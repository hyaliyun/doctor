MAFLD encompasses different disease stadia ranging from isolated liver steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although MAFLD is considered as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, multiple concomitant disease-potentiating factors can accelerate disease progression. Among these risk factors are diet, lifestyle, genetic traits, intake of steatogenic drugs, male gender and particular infections. Although infections often outweigh the development of fatty liver disease, pre-existing MAFLD could be triggered to progress towards more severe disease stadia. These combined disease cases might be underreported because of the high prevalence of both MAFLD and infectious diseases that can promote or exacerbate fatty liver disease development. In this review, we portray the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the most relevant viral, bacterial and parasitic infections influence the progression of fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis. We focus in particular on how infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease-19, hepatitis C, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, peptic ulcer and periodontitis, exacerbate MAFLD.

Previous studies have pointed out that disruption of the proteolytic cleavage of proteins can promote infectious and non-infectious diseases. The last few weeks have been marked by an important revelation concerning the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2. This new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and transmissible acute respiratory infectious disorder. SARS-CoV-2 is composed of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and structural proteins including Spike protein (S protein). Interestingly, the FURIN, one of the proproteins of the convertase family, plays a crucial role in the maturation of viral glycoproteins. In addition, many viruses including coronaviruses, exploit FURIN for the activation of their glycoproteins. Recent data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Subsequently, the S protein is cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 with the help of FURIN which facilitates the entry of the virus into the cell after binding. Furthermore, it seems that FURIN is implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially in the increased rates of human-to-human transmission.","output":"Expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and proteases in COVID-19 patients: A potential role of cellular FURIN in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak began in Israel at the end of February 2020, and on March 17, 2020, a general lockdown was announced.

Mothers and children (aged 10C45 months) were recruited from areas with high (n = 40) and low (n = 78) exposure to armed conflict. Mothers reported on their posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and on their child's effortful control tendencies prior to the outbreak. Toward the end of the first lockdown, mothers were interviewed regarding adverse effects of the outbreak on their family. No group differences were found for maternal perceptions of adverse effects of COVID-19.

Thus, anti-inflammatory therapies are attractive agents for potentially combating the uncontrolled inflammatory cascade in these patients. We designed a trial testing tocilizumab versus standard of care intending to improve the outcomes by inhibiting interleukin-6, an important inflammatory mediator in COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This open-label multicentre randomized controlled trial will compare clinical outcomes of tocilizumab plus standard of care versus standard of care alone in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Two of the following four criteria are required for protocol enrolment: D-dimer > 1,000ng/mL; C reactive protein > 5mg/dL, ferritin > 300mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase > upper limit of normal. The primary objective will be to compare the clinical status on day 15, as measured by a 7-point ordinal scale applied in COVID-19 trials worldwide. The primary endpoint will be assessed by an ordinal logistic regression assuming proportional odds ratios adjusted for stratification variables (age and sex). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The TOCIBRAS protocol was approved by local and central (national) ethical committees in Brazil following current national and international guidelines/directives. Each participating center had the study protocol approved by their institutional review boards before initiating protocol enrolment. The data derived from this trial will be published regardless of the results.

ME/CFS usually occurs as sporadic cases, but epidemics (outbreaks) have occurred worldwide. Myalgic encephalomyelitis was named to describe an outbreak affecting the lymphatic, muscular, and nervous systems that closed the Royal Free hospital for three months in 1955. Fifteen years later, two psychiatrists concluded that epidemic hysteria was the likely cause. ME/CFS research studies show multiple pathophysiological differences between patients and controls and a possible etiological role for infectious organisms, but the belief that ME/CFS is psychosomatic is widespread and has been specifically supported by the epidemic hysteria hypothesis for the Royal Free outbreak. Our objective was to obtain accounts from ex-Royal Free hospital staff who personally experienced the 1955 outbreak and evaluate evidence for it being an infectious illness versus epidemic hysteria. Materials and Methods: Statements in the newsletters of two organizations for staff who had worked at the Royal Free hospital invited anyone who had experienced the 1955 Royal Free outbreak to contact the authors. Accounts of the outbreak from telephone interviews and letters were evaluated against the epidemic hysteria hypothesis paper and original medical staff reports. Results: Twenty-seven ex-Royal Free hospital staff, including six who had developed ME, provided descriptions typical of an infectious illness affecting the lymphatic, muscular, and nervous systems, and were not consistent with epidemic hysteria. Conclusions: The 1955 Royal Free hospital epidemic of myalgic encephalomyelitis was an organic infectious disease, not psychogenic epidemic hysteria.","output":"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Organic Disease or Psychosomatic Illness?

The purpose of this study was to explore the early clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 from a single centre. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on admission. Demographic and clinical factors and laboratory data were reviewed and collected to evaluate for significant associations. RESULTS: The study included 541 patients with COVID-19. A total of 144 (26.6%) patients had a history of CVD. The mortality of patients with CVD reached 22.2%, which was higher than that of the overall population of this study (9.8%). Patients with CVD were also more likely to develop liver function abnormality, elevated blood creatinine and lactic dehydrogenase (p<0.05). Symptoms of sputum production were more common in patients with CVD (p=0.026). Lymphocytes, haemoglobin and albumin below the normal range were pervasive in the CVD group (p<0.05). The proportion of critically ill patients in the CVD group (27.8%) was significantly higher than that in the non-CVD group (8.8%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that CVD (OR: 2.735 (95% CI 1.495 to 5.003), p=0.001) was associated with critical COVID-19 condition, while patients with coronary heart disease were less likely to reach recovery standards (OR: 0.331 (95% CI 0.125 to 0.880), p=0.027).

Adolescents were asked to discuss their cancer and cancer prevention knowledge, sources of cancer education, and preferences for cancer prevention education. Focus groups were audio-recorded, and professionally transcribed. Transcripts were content and thematically analyzed by two study team members using NVivo qualitative data software. Six themes were identified in focus groups: knowledge about cancer, negative perceptions of cancer, awareness of cancer prevention, engagement in cancer prevention, facilitators and barriers for action, and preferences for cancer education. Adolescents described a wide range of cancer education sources, including friends, family, healthcare professionals, school, technology, and pamphlets. Participants associated cancer with negative emotions, such as sadness and fear. Participants expressed interest in learning about cancer and cancer prevention, but also identified barriers to engaging in preventative behaviors, such as discomfort, lack of knowledge, and lack of personal connection to cancer. Adolescents preferred learning through personal presentations, online videos, school, educational games, and social situations. Adolescence is a critical period for learning and developing healthy behaviors. Awareness of cancer and cancer prevention is crucial to lowering cancer risk in the future. To be effective, cancer education for adolescents should target specific areas of cancer prevention and address barriers to engagement in preventative behaviors.

For this purpose, we consider a spatio-temporal multivariate time series model under a hierarchical framework, which is especially suitable for envisioning the virus transmission tendency across a geographic area over time. Briefly, our model decomposes the COVID-19 risk into: (i) an autoregressive component that describes the within-state COVID-19 risk effect; (ii) a spatiotemporal component that describes the across-state COVID-19 risk effect; (iii) an exogenous component that includes other factors (e.g., weather/climate) that could envision future epidemic development risk; and (iv) an endemic component that captures the function of time and other predictors mainly for individual states. Our results indicate that maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidity, the percentage of cloud coverage, and the columnar density of total atmospheric ozone have a strong association with the COVID-19 pandemic in many states. In particular, the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and the columnar density of total atmospheric ozone demonstrate statistically significant associations with the tendency of COVID-19 spreading in almost all states. Furthermore, our results from transmission tendency analysis suggest that the community-level transmission has been relatively mitigated in the USA, and the daily confirmed cases within a state are predominated by the earlier daily confirmed cases within that state compared to other factors, which implies that states such as Texas, California, and Florida with a large number of confirmed cases still need strategies like stay-at-home orders to prevent another outbreak.","output":"Analysis of the Spread of COVID-19 in the USA with a Spatio-Temporal Multivariate Time Series Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background : The online teaching demand has increased tremendously to promote the implementation of online teaching-leaning system to meet the need of students during the outbreaks of emerging infectious disease.

They were called medical service personnel and authorized to handle certain medical treatments. This included tasks such as providing injections and vaccinations under the supervision of the doctor in the health center. Issue/problem The system of co-medicals only applied in Okinawa and not in Japan. As such, when Okinawa was reverted back to Japan in 1972, it was proposed to abolish the system. In the current emergency of the new coronavirus pandemic, we are facing a similar situation in terms of the shortage of medical personnel. Description of the problem In Japan, like many countries, there is a shortage of health resources due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The focus will be on healthcare personnel, those who have taken on the role of COVID-19 vaccinators in Japan, and a comparison of the situation in other countries. Results In Japan, vaccinations are legally limited to being administered by doctors and nurses. However, pharmacists have taken on the role of administering vaccinations in the UK, US, Ireland, Canada, and Italy, thus COVID-19 vaccinations could be easily integrated into these routine procedures.Even vaccinations by medical students have been carried out. In addition, non-healthcare volunteers have been trained as vaccinators in UK and Italy. The coverage has reached 50% in the UK, 42% in the US, and 30% in Canada, whereas 1.8% in Japan in April (Our World in Data, 2021). Lessons Although the COVID-19 situation is substantially different from the case of postwar Okinawa, it will be necessary to take resilient measures to solve the medical personnel shortage. Additionally, the strict measures of limiting vaccinations by medical doctors may need to be reconsidered in Japan.

Given these roles and their relevance in the health professions, we sought to understand the methods and strategies used in the development of existing competency frameworks. Methods The Arksey and O'Malley framework was applied to undertake this scoping review. Six electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus, and ERIC) and three grey literature sources (greylit.org, Trove and Google Scholar) were searched using keywords related to competency frameworks. Studies of all types were included that described the development of a competency framework in a healthcare profession. Studies were screened for inclusion, and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Data synthesis was both quantitative and qualitative. Results Among 5,710 citations, 190 were selected for analysis. The majority of studies were conducted in medicine and nursing professions. Group techniques were utilised in 140 studies (74%), literature reviews were conducted in 112 (59%), and 81 (43%) outlined some form of stakeholder deliberation. We found a significant degree of diversity in methodological strategies, inconsistent adherence to existing guidance on the selection of methods, who was involved, and based on the variation we observed in timeframes, form, choice, sequence, combination, function, application and reporting of methods and strategies, there is no apparent gold standard or standardised approach to competency framework development. Conclusions This review observed significant variation within the conduct and reporting of the competency framework development process. Such variation is a cause for concern, potentially resulting in the development of frameworks that may not have captured the complexities of clinical practice, which are therefore of limited value to the profession, and may unwillingly create and legitimise artificial outcomes.

The subjects executed an auditory task at 4-s intervals consisting of interleaved verbal and click stimuli to identify loss and recovery of consciousness. During induction, subjects lost responsiveness to the less salient clicks before losing responsiveness to the more salient verbal stimuli; during emergence they recovered responsiveness to the verbal stimuli before recovering responsiveness to the clicks. The median frequency and bandwidth of the frontal EEG power tracked the probability of response to the verbal stimuli during the transitions in consciousness. Loss of consciousness was marked simultaneously by an increase in low-frequency EEG power (<1 Hz), the loss of spatially coherent occipital alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz), and the appearance of spatially coherent frontal alpha oscillations. These dynamics reversed with recovery of consciousness. The low-frequency phase modulated alpha amplitude in two distinct patterns. During profound unconsciousness, alpha amplitudes were maximal at low-frequency peaks, whereas during the transition into and out of unconsciousness, alpha amplitudes were maximal at low-frequency nadirs.

We estimated the median concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces as 2.6 (95% CrI: 0.22C4.8) log copies per gram-faeces over the shedding period, and our model implied that the duration of viral shedding was 23.2 days (95% CrI: 19.5C31.5), given the current standard quantification limit (Ct = 40). With simulated incidences, our results also indicated that a one-week delay between symptom onset and wastewater sampling increased the estimation of incidence by a factor of 7.4 (i.e., 10(0.87) times higher). Our results demonstrated that the temporal variation in virus concentration in faeces affects microbial monitoring systems such as WBE. The present study also implied the need for adjusting the estimates of virus concentration in faeces by incorporating the kinetics of unobserved concentrations. The method used in this study is easily implemented in further simulations; therefore, the results of this study might contribute to enhancing disease surveillance and risk assessments that require quantities of virus to be excreted into the environment.","output":"Duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in faeces as a parameter for wastewater-based epidemiology: Re-analysis of patient data using a shedding dynamics model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conclusions The present tool is adequate to investigate attitudes towards Smart Working among healthcare workers. Background During the most difficult phases of the Covid-19 he-alth emergency, when access to the usual work location was not allowed due to the constraints related to the pandemic, Smart Working enabled business continuity in the face of the ongoing health emergency. Mo-dern technology serves a new way of working, allowing workers to effectively manage their professional and personal spheres in a world that increasingly requires them to optimize their time. The main objective of this research is to validate a Smart Working questionnaire administered to healthcare workers. Methods The questionnaire, reported in Annex I, consisting of 30 questions and submitted electronically through Google Forms, was administered in Italian to healthcare personnel of the Teaching hospi-tal Umberto I and Sapienza University of Rome between September and October 2020. The questionnaire analyzed the characteristics of the sample and investigated the perception and attitude of healthcare personnel towards seven different aspects of Smart Working. A descriptive analysis of the sample examined and an internal consistency analysis was performed through the use of the SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) program version 25.0. Cronbach's alpha statistical indicator, which measures reprodu-cibility over time, reliability, and homogeneity of questions, was used for the analysis. Results A total number of 53 health care providers answered the online questionnaire. The majority of the respondents were female (60.4%); 73.6% of respondents reported having a college degree or a higher educational level. The analysis showed an overall standardized Cronbach's Alpha of 0.709, which corresponds to a good reliability.

The COVID-19 refers to the disease while the SARS-CoV-2 refers to the virus and is characterized by a rapid contagious capacity able to spread worldwide in a very short time. The rise in the number of infected patients and deaths is of great concern especially because symptoms are vague and similar to other forms of flu infection and corona syndrome infections characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. According to the latest guidelines published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the diagnosis of COVID-19 must be confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or gene sequencing of specimen obtained from throat, sputum and blood samples. However, the limitations due to logistics, as well as low sensitivity and specificity diagnostic tools currently available have been reported as the main cause of high incidence of either false-negative or positive results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The purpose of the present translational research protocol is to discuss and present the original findings from our research team on new diagnostic technique to detect four Coronaviridae family members (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, HCoV and MERS-CoV), highlighting the methodology, the procedure and the possible advantages. Moreover, the authors review the current epidemiology, precautions and safety measures for health personnel to manage patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Implementation of an effective and rapid plan of diagnosing, screening and checking is a key factor to reduce and prevent further transmission. This procedure based on rRT-PCR could be of great help to decisively validate the results obtained from more conventional diagnostic procedures such as chest computed tomography (CT) imaging and chest ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: This translational diagnostic tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing people with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Rapid and sensitive diagnostic procedure for multiple detection of pandemic Coronaviridae family members SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV: a translational research and cooperation between the Phan Chau Trinh University in Vietnam and University of Bari \\"Aldo Moro\\" in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients are presumed to be high risk for novel SARS-CoV2 virus complications given their multiple comorbidities. Data on COVID-19 outcomes in LVAD patients is limited. Our single-center, retrospective, cohort study aimed to study the characteristics and outcomes of LVAD patients with COVID-19 infection. Methods Institutional IRB approval was obtained. A total of 70 Heartmate 3 (HM3) LVAD patients at our center were screened from December 2019 - September 2021. Variables analyzed included mortality, need for hospitalization, respiratory failure, thromboembolic events, bleeding events, and International Normalized Ratio (INR). Results The rate of COVID-19 infection in our cohort of 70 patients was 15.7% (n=11) similar to the rate observed in the state of Texas (14.1%). The average time interval between LVAD implantation and COVID-19 infection was 41.1 months. 63% (n=7) patients when to ER/hospitalized with a mortality rate of 9% (n=1). All patients had community-acquired infections except one patient who acquired from a visiting family member at the hospital. 81% (n=9) patients acquired the infection during a period of high-infectivity rate in the state of Texas (November 2020-February 2021). Cough was the most common symptom (63.3%, n=7). No patient required intubation. One patient with DNR status who was also unvaccinated died of acute respiratory failure. Three patients developed chronic hypoxic respiratory failure. There were no incidents of pump thrombosis, strokes, or pulmonary embolisms. 72% of patients had an INR >2.0 closest to testing COVID+ with an average INR of 3.5 (range: 1.3 - 9.7). As of September 2021, 63% are vaccinated. Conclusion COVID-19 infection in LVAD patients can result in substantial morbidity requiring hospitalization and/or death. Interestingly, in our series, no patients suffered a thromboembolic event.

However, to date, vaccination studies in the country have not explicitly focused on CE as an outcome in and of itself. Therefore, this study sought to examine the barriers and enablers of community engagement for vaccination in India. METHODS: Employing qualitative methods, twenty-five semi-structured elite interviews among vaccine decisionmakers were triangulated with twenty-four national-level vaccine policy documents and researcher field notes (December 2017 to February 2018). Data collected for this study included perceptions and examples of enablers of and barriers to CE for vaccination uptake. Concepts, such as the absence of formal procedures or data collection approaches related to CE, were confirmed during document review, and a final convening to review study results was conducted with study respondents in December 2018 and January 2019 to affirm the general set of findings from this study. The Social Ecological Model (SEM) was used to organize and interpret the study findings. RESULTS: Although decisionmakers and policy documents generally supported CE, there were more CE barriers than facilitators in the context of vaccination, which were identified at all social-ecological levels. Interviews with vaccine decisionmakers in India revealed complex systemic and structural factors which affect CE for vaccination and are present across each of the SEM levels, from individual to policy. Policy-level enablers included decisionmakers political will for CE and policy documents and interviews highlighted social mobilization, whereas barriers were lack of a CE strategy document and a broad understanding of CE by decisionmakers. At the community level, dissemination of Social-behavioral Change Communication (SBCC) materials from the national-level to the states was considered a CE facilitator, while class, and caste-based power relations in the community, lack of family-centric CE strategies, and paternalistic attitude of decisionmakers toward communities (the latter reported by some NGO heads) were considered CE barriers. At the organizational level, partnerships with local organizations were considered CE enablers, while lack of institutionalized support to formalize and incentivize these partnerships highlighted by several decisionmakers, were barriers. At the interpersonal level, SBCC training for healthcare workers, sensitive messaging to communities with low vaccine confidence, and social media messaging were considered CE facilitators. The lack of strategies to manage vaccine related rumors or replicate successful CE interventions during the during the introduction and rollout of new vaccines were perceived as CE barriers by several decisionmakers. CONCLUSION: Data obtained for this study highlighted national-level perceptions of the complexities and challenges of CE across the entire SEM, from individual to systemic levels. Future studies should attempt to associate these enablers and barriers with actual CE outcomes, such as participation or community support in vaccine policy-making, CE implementation for specific vaccines and situations (such as disease outbreaks), or frequency of sub-population-based incidents of community resistance and community facilitation to vaccination uptake. There would likely be value in developing a population-based operational definition of CE, with a step-by-step manual on how to do CE. The data from this study also indicate the importance of including CE indicators in national datasets and developing a compendium documenting CE best-practices. Doing so would allow more rigorous analysis of the evidence-base for CE for vaccination in India and other countries with similar immunization programs.","output":"Perceived enablers and barriers of community engagement for vaccination in India: Using socioecological analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article we deal with the problem of portfolio allocation by enhancing network theory tools.

The word 'epidemic' has the potential to lead to chaotic, unreasoned responses to health problems, especially when used by journalists. Nigeria like other poor resource countries is equally affected by the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Standardization and proper documentation of the mortality of the COVID-19 in the poor-resource countries will help in managing other disease outbreaks in future. This paper calls for improvement in capturing of these data for better planning in the future. AREAS COVERED: Quality data is very essential for policy makers to appreciate any disease condition. In order to present a comprehensive picture of COVID-19 mortality, the deaths were broadly grouped into two as follows: direct and indirect COVID-19 deaths. Most of the current reported deaths seem to be direct deaths. EXPERT OPINION: We propose that for better estimation and standardization, verbal autopsy could be used to differentiate direct/indirect COVID deaths. At full development, this model could be applied to other diseases, outbreaks, or pandemics. The disease surveillance officers, and other health workers can be trained in this regard as well as scaling up the e-surveillance of the DSNOs.","output":"Call for proper documentation of COVID-19 deaths in poor resource setting: a necessity for management of future occurrences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although an increase in hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence from Northern to Southern Italy has been reported, the burden of asymptomatic individuals in different Italian regions is currently unknown. METHODS: A probabilistic approach, including a Markov chain for liver disease progression, was applied to estimate current HCV viraemic burden. The model defined prevalence by geographic area using an estimated annual historical HCV incidence by age, treatment rate, and migration rate from the Italian National database. Viraemic infection by age group was estimated for each region by main HCV transmission routes of individuals for stage F0CF3 (i.e. patients without liver cirrhosis and thus potentially asymptomatic) and F4 (patients with liver cirrhosis, thus potentially symptomatic). RESULTS: By January 2020, it was estimated that there were 409,184 Italian individuals with HCV (prevalence of 0.68%; 95% CI: 0.54C0.82%), of which 300,171 (0.50%; 95% CI: 0.4C0.6%) were stage F0CF3. Considering all individuals with HCV in stage F0CF3, the geographical distributions (expressed as the proportion of HCV infected individuals by macroarea within the overall estimated number of F0CF3 individuals and prevalence values, expressed as the percentage of individuals with HCV versus the overall number of individuals for each macroarea) were as follows: North 42.1% (0.45%; 95% CI: 0.36C0.55%), Central 24.1% (0.61%; 95% CI: 0.48C0.74%), South 23.2% (0.50%; 95% CI: 0.4C0.61%), and the Isles 10.6% (0.49%; 95% CI: 0.39C0.59%). The population of people who inject drugs accounted for 50.4% of all individuals infected (F0CF3). Undiagnosed individuals (F0CF3) were ~ 15 years younger (? 50 years) compared with patients with stage F4 (? 65 years), with similar age distributions across macroareas. In contrast to what has been reported on HCV epidemiology in Italy, an increasing trend in the proportion of potentially undiagnosed individuals with HCV (absolute number within the F0CF3) from South (23.2%) to North (42.1%) emerged, independent of similar regional prevalence values. CONCLUSION: This targeted approach, which addresses the specific profile of undiagnosed individuals, is helpful in planning effective elimination strategies by region in Italy and could be a useful methodology for other countries in implementing their elimination plans.

This intervention considered caregivers perceived needs and incorporated three evidence-based dimensions (psychoeducation, skill-building and peer support). DESIGN: A prospective randomised control trial. SETTING: A community-based study conducted in Egypt. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 110 caregivers aged 18 years who cared for a survivor within 6 months of stroke, with modified Rankin Scale scores of 3C5, and without other physical disabilities or terminal illnesses were recruited between December 2019 and May 2020. Participants were assigned to the intervention group (IG; n=55) and control group (CG; n=55) through open-label, parallel 1:1 randomisation. INTERVENTION: The IG was provided with tailored multidimensional interventions for 6 months until November 2020, including three home visits, six home-based telephone calls and one peer-support session. The CG received simple educational instructions at a single visit. OUTCOME: The participants completed the Zarit Burden Interview (primary outcome) and the WHO Quality of Life-BREF (secondary outcome) before the intervention (T0), at 3 months (T1) and at 6 months (T2). RESULTS: No differences were observed between the characteristics of the groups at baseline (T0). The independent t-test showed no significant differences in the care burden and Quality of Life (QoL) at T1 and T2 between the groups. The intervention had no significant effect on the outcomes between or within groups over time, as shown by the repeated-measures analysis of variance. However, the group and time interaction had significant main effects on caregivers QoL (psychological and social domains). CONCLUSION: The main results showed that participants in the IG did not experience an improvement in the main outcomes. Nevertheless, the improvement in the psychological and social domains may have been attributed to our intervention.

PURPOSE To describe a pharmacist-managed virtual consult service practice model to improve medication safety in a population of rheumatology patients and evaluate its initial impact on guideline compliance. SUMMARY Optimal pharmacologic care of patients with rheumatologic conditions often revolves around the use of specialty medications such as self-injectable biologics and infused therapies, including biologic response modifiers (BRMs), nearly all of which carry risks of serious adverse events due to their immune-suppressive properties. Possible adverse events include serious infections such as reactivation of tuberculosis (TB) and viral hepatitis B (HBV). This articles describes a pharmacist-managed virtual consult service introduced by a large university-affiliated health system in 2018 to integrate clinical, specialty pharmacy, and therapeutic infusion services for proactive medication and safety management for patients with rheumatologic conditions requiring specialty or infused medications. During a 4-month evaluation period, 157 referrals were sent to the consult service; of 137 consults included in the analysis, 42% were for self-injectable biologic medications, 28% were for intra-articular injections, 26% were for infusions, and 4% were for oral specialty medications. Forty-one percent of the pharmacy benefit consult orders required an intervention prior to submission of prior authorization requests. Most interventions (61%) were clinical in nature and involved the pharmacists ensuring that necessary laboratory work, clinical disease activity scoring, or radiographic imaging were completed prior to submission of the consult results for insurer approval. CONCLUSION National rates of HBV screening and TB screening for patients prescribed BRMs continue to be suboptimal. The pharmacist-managed virtual consult service is a novel practice model to increase the screening rate to 100% to ensure the safety and appropriate monitoring of patients who are starting or continued on these complex medications.","output":"A pharmacist-managed virtual consult service to improve tuberculosis screening."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Low-status expatriates (LSEs), a highly vulnerable group, have been significantly affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This study explores the stressors that continue to impact LSEs in Germany and their access to support during the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach An interpretivist, qualitative research approach was employed. The authors utilised a multi-level data collection strategy that combined interview and questionnaire data from 16 expatriates and 16 social actors. The data were analysed using a directed content analysis method. Findings LSEs experienced high levels of stress that were further exacerbated by the introduction of COVID-19 control measures that were intended to slow the spread of the virus. LSEs are particularly vulnerable due to their overrepresentation in precarious professions and the associated job insecurity. Critically, external support from employers and social actors is generally lacking, leaving LSEs to rely on their own personal coping strategies in difficult times. Research limitations/implications The earlier Expatriate crisis Framework highlights the importance of external support for expatriates. However, this framework does not sufficiently account for personal coping strategies that are particularly important for individuals that cannot access such external support (e.g. LSEs). Herein, the authors offer a revised framework that is more applicable to LSEs. Practical implications Current practices are problematic, necessitating policy changes at both governmental and organisational levels.

PTX-3 median value (IQR) was 3.66 ng/mL (0.9C27.9) in all patients, 3.3 ng/mL (0.9C27.9) in survivors and 3.91 ng/mL (1.9C23.2) in nonsurvivors which was significantly higher (P = 0.045). As a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis the cut-off value of PTX-3 for predicting mortality in patients was 3.73 with 65% sensitivity and 65% specificity (AUC: 0.646, 95% CI: 0.525C0.767, P = 0.045). Also, we found significant cut-off values with respect to D-dimer, D-dimer/PTX-3, high-sensitivity troponin, high-sensitivity troponin/PTX-3, lymphocyte, PTX-3/lymphocyte, procalcitonin, procalcitonin/PTX-3, CRP, and CRP/PTX-3 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In this study, as far as we know, for the first time, we have shown PTX-3 as the new mortality biomarker for COVID-19 disease.","output":"The predictive and diagnostic accuracy of long pentraxin-3 in COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The investigation of the immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection has been the goal of many researchers worldwide. The study of humoral immune responses and in vitro T cell production after infection requires the obtaining of individualized blood samples to test the presence of antibodies or activated T cells specific for the virus. In vitro T cell studies are especially troublesome due to the need for more specialized resources often outside the daily routine of clinical laboratories. For this reason the development of a simple and objective method to achieve these T cell studies is needed. In this manuscript we reviewed the hypersensitivity reactions, the theoretical basis and the historical background of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) which uses the principles of use of this test in the clinical setting for the past century. In the second part of the review, we focus on COVID adaptive immune responses, to understand the differences and challenges offered by this new application of DTH to investigate immune responses elicited after infection. In the last part of the review a vision provided for the use of this test to investigate the immunogenicity elicited by the vaccines. In our opinion, the clinical guidelines of immune assessment of SARS-CoV-2-infected or vaccinated individuals should include this simple and low-cost test to measure T-cell immunity. Rationale and improved vaccination schemes could be obtained after its implementation in the routine assessment of immunity in this pandemic situation.","output":"A review of hypersensitivity methods to detect immune responses to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/Purpose: Telehealth has evolved over the past several decades to address varying medical needs. Most recently, it has been widely utilized as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most previous studies have not performed in-depth analyses of patient satisfaction with telehealth technologies. This project investigated patient satisfaction with the abrupt implementation of telemedicine within pediatric surgical subspecialties during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: We conducted a single-center review to determine patients' satisfaction with telemedicine during the early stages of the pandemic. Surveys were distributed to patients who completed a telemedicine video visit within a pediatric surgical subspecialty at Connecticut Children's Medical Center between March 16 and May 16, 2020. Results: A total of 1,608 patients were contacted, with 457 surveys completed (28.4%). Of all respondents, 95.6% were \\"very satisfied\\" or \\"satisfied\\" with their overall telemedicine appointment. Seventy-three percent reported no difficulty with completing their visit. Eighty-seven percent would consider another telemedicine visit again in the future. No significant difference was found between the payor mix for telemedicine and in-person appointments. Conclusions: The implementation of telemedicine at Connecticut Children's Medical Center during the COVID-19 pandemic was successful despite numerous barriers to use.

Systematic searches of randomised controlled trials with an experimental tryptophan intervention in children and adults with ADHD identified 14 studies measuring core and related symptoms of the condition. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The 14 studies all used acute tryptophan depletion procedures, and most did not investigate core ADHD symptoms (inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity) as primary outcome measures. Only two studies examined attention and revealed mixed effects of tryptophan. Similar effects were found for impulsivity in a small number of studies. No studies investigated hyperactivity. Most studies focused on reactive aggression, but samples were heterogenous and small, rendering potential meta-analyses inconclusive or misleading. However, the narrative analysis indicates tryptophan interventions may impact reactive aggression. More research is needed on the effect of tryptophan modulation on core ADHD symptoms, especially in adults, using more diverse samples to determine potential as an intervention.

Here, we investigated if canagliflozin can reverse isoprenaline (ISO)-induced renal oxidative damage in rats, a model that mimics SNS overstimulation-induced organ injuries in humans. We found that ISO administration elevates renal oxidative stress markers including malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced protein oxidation product (APOP), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and nitric oxide (NO), while depleting levels of endogenous antioxidants such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). Strikingly, canagliflozin treatment of ISO-treated rats not only prevents elevation of oxidative stress markers but also rescues levels of depleted antioxidants. Our results also show that canagliflozin stimulates antioxidant/anti-inflammatory signaling pathways involving AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Akt and eNOS, and inhibits iNOS and NADPH oxidase isoform 4 (NOX4), all of which are associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. Further, canagliflozin prevents ISO-induced apoptosis of kidney cells by inhibiting Bax protein upregulation and caspase-3 activation. Histological examination of kidney sections reveal that canagliflozin attenuates ISO-mediated increases in inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen deposition and fibrosis. Finally, consistent with these findings, canagliflozin treatment improves kidney function in ISO-treated rats, suggesting that the antioxidant effects may be clinically translatable.","output":"Canagliflozin ameliorates renal oxidative stress and inflammation by stimulating AMPK-Akt-eNOS pathway in the isoprenaline-induced oxidative stress model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the latest years, a number of studies have confirmed the benefits of perioperative haemodynamic optimisation on surgical mortality and postoperative complication rate.

ADARB1 encodes the enzyme ADAR2 that is highly expressed in the brain and essential to modulate the function of glutamate and serotonin receptors. Impaired ADAR2 editing causes early onset progressive epilepsy and premature death in mice. In humans, ADAR2 dysfunction has been very recently linked to a neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly and epilepsy in four unrelated subjects. METHODS We studied three children from two consanguineous families with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) through detailed physical and instrumental examinations. Exome sequencing (ES) was used to identify ADARB1 mutations as the underlying genetic cause and in vitro assays with transiently transfected cells were performed to ascertain the impact on ADAR2 enzymatic activity and splicing. RESULTS All patients showed global developmental delay, intractable early infantile-onset seizures, microcephaly, severe-to-profound intellectual disability, axial hypotonia and progressive appendicular spasticity. ES revealed the novel missense c.1889G>A, p.(Arg630Gln) and deletion c.1245_1247+1 del, p.(Leu415PhefsTer14) variants in ADARB1 (NM_015833.4). The p.(Leu415PhefsTer14) variant leads to incorrect splicing resulting in frameshift with a premature stop codon and loss of enzyme function. In vitro RNA editing assays showed that the p.(Arg630Gln) variant resulted in a severe impairment of ADAR2 enzymatic activity. CONCLUSION In conclusion, these data support the pathogenic role of biallelic ADARB1 variants as the cause of a distinctive form of DEE, reinforcing the importance of RNA editing in brain function and development.","output":"Biallelic variants in ADARB1, encoding a dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase, cause a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Interaction of a single dose (36 mg/kg body wt) of the organochlorine pesticide dieldrin with mouse peritoneal macrophages was examined in C57Bl 6 , ( C57Bl 6  A J )F1 , and A J strains of different genetic resistance to mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) infection. In vivo studies showed increased susceptibility to MHV3 acute disease of C57Bl 6 and ( C57Bl 6  A J )F1 animals challenged with the pesticide. Significant decrease of mean time of death in dieldrin-exposed, MHV3-infected susceptible C57Bl 6 mice was observed similarly upon po or ip administration of a single, sublethal dose of dieldrin. In addition, decrease of humoral response to the virus was quantified by determination of anti-MHV3 IgG antibodies in spleen cell supernatant fractions and in blood sera of dieldrin-exposed C57Bl 6 mice. A single dose of dieldrin did not alter the in vivo resistance of A J animals to acute MHV3 disease. The resistant A J mice, however, showed increased mortality upon two subsequent exposures to dieldrin followed by infection with high lethal doses of MHV3. Phagocytic activity, cell adherence capacity, and attachment and uptake of 3H-radiolabeled MHV3 by C57Bl 6 peritoneal macrophages were determined by in vitro studies.

Recently migrated women are considered a vulnerable group who may experience challenges in adapting to a new country. We aimed to identify challenges and barriers recently migrated women face in accessing and utilising maternity healthcare services. METHODS: In the mixed-method MiPreg-study, we included recently migrated ( five years) pregnant women born in low- or middle-income countries and healthcare personnel. First, we conducted 20 in-depth interviews with migrant women at Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHC) and seven in-depth interviews with midwives working at either the hospital or the MCHCs in Oslo. Afterwards, we triangulated our findings with 401 face-to-face questionnaires post-partum at hospitals among migrant women. The data were thematically analysed by grouping codes after careful consideration and consensus between the researchers. RESULTS: Four main themes of challenges and barriers faced by the migrant women were identified: (1) Navigating the healthcare system, (2) Language, (3) Psychosocial and structural factors, and (4) Expectations of care. Within the four themes we identified a range of individual and structural challenges, such as limited knowledge about available healthcare services, unmet needs for interpreter use, limited social support and conflicting recommendations for pregnancy-related care. The majority of migrant women (83.6%) initiated antenatal care in the first trimester. Several of the challenges were associated with vulnerabilities not directly related to maternal health. CONCLUSION: A combination of individual, structural and institutional barriers hinder recently migrated women in achieving optimal maternal healthcare. Suggested strategies to address the challenges include improved provision of information about healthcare structure to migrant women, increased use of interpreter services, appropriate psychosocial support and strengthening diversity- and intercultural competence training among healthcare personnel.

However, noise pollution is also a relevant environmental factor that contributes to the worsening of chronic cardiovascular diseases and even diabetes. This study analyzes the role of short-term noise pollution levels on the incidence and severity of cases of COVID-19 in Madrid from February 1 to May 31, 2020. The following variables were used in the study: daily noise levels averaged over 14 days; daily incidence rates, average cumulative incidence over 14 days; hospital admissions, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and mortality due to COVID-19. We controlled for the effect of the pollutants PM10 and NO2 as well as for variables related to seasonality and autoregressive nature. GLM models with Poisson regressions were carried out using significant variable selection (p < 0.05) to calculate attributable RR. The results of the modeling using a single variable show that the levels of noise (leq24 h) were related to the incidence rate, the rate of hospital admissions, the ICU admissions and the rate of average cumulative incidence over 14 days. These associations presented lags, and the first association was with incidence (lag 7 and lag 10), then with hospital admissions (lag 17) and finally ICU admissions (lag 22). There was no association with deaths due to COVID-19. In the results of the models that included PM10, NO2, Leq24 h and the control variables simultaneously, we observed that only Leq24 h went on to become a part of the models using COVID-19 variables, including the 14-day average cumulative incidence.

Also, it examines how artificial intelligence (AI) can mitigate burnout in oncology. Methods: We searched Ovid Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, for articles that examine how to address burnout in oncology. Results: A total of 17 studies were found to examine how burnout in oncology can be mitigated. These interventions were either targeted at individuals (oncologists) or organizations where the oncologists work. The organizational interventions include educational (psychosocial and mindfulness-based course), art therapies and entertainment, team-based training, group meetings, motivational package and reward, effective leadership and policy change, and staff support. The individual interventions include equipping the oncologists with adequate training that includecommunication skills, well-being and stress management, burnout education, financial independence, relaxation, self-efficacy, resilience, hobby adoption, and work-life balance for the oncologists. Similarly, AI is thought to be poised to offer the potential to mitigate burnout in oncology by enhancing the productivity and performance of the oncologists, reduce the workload and provide job satisfaction, and foster teamwork between the caregivers of patients with cancer. Discussion: Burnout is common among oncologists and can be elicited from different types of situations encountered in the process of caring for patients with cancer. Therefore, for these interventions to achieve the touted benefits, combinatorial strategies that combine other interventions may be viable for mitigating burnout in oncology. With the potential of AI to mitigate burnout, it is important for healthcare providers to facilitate its use in daily clinical practices. Conclusion: These combinatorial interventions can ensure job satisfaction, a supportive working environment, job retention for oncologists, and improved patient care.

METHODS We searched through different electronic databases (PubMed, Google-scholar, Embase, and Cochrane Library) to locate relevant articles. Studies, with sufficient data to reconstruct a 2  2 contingency table, met our inclusion criteria were included. Three reviewers independently screened the articles. Discrepancies were resolved by other reviewers. Unpublished data were requested from the authors of the study via email. Subsequently, data extraction was done using a standardized form and quality assessment of studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. Meta-analysis was done using a bivariate model using R software. RESULTS Fourteen studies were selected for the final evaluation, which yielded the summary points: pooled sensitivity 87.77% (77.52%-93.72%, I2 = 86%), pooled specificity 88.45% (75.59%-94.99%, I2 = 88%), pooled DOR 49.37(14.53-167.72, I2 = 89%), and AUC of SROC was 0.923. The lambda value of the HSROC curve was 3.670. The Fagan plot showed that GPBB increases the pretest probability of myocardial infarction from 46% to 81% when positive, and it lowers the same probability to 12% when negative. CONCLUSION With these results, we can conclude that GPBB has modest accuracy in screening myocardial infarction, but the limitations of the study warrant further high-quality studies to confirm its usefulness in predicting myocardial infarction (MI).","output":"Diagnostic accuracy of glycogen phosphorylase BB for myocardial infarction: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has produced worldwide interruptions of face-to-face teaching activity in both schools and universities In Italy, the quarantine began in the second half of February 2020 and lasted for all the second semester of lectures The University of Bologna, where all the authors of the present article are based, developed and activated several interfaces necessary to efficiently deliver online teaching courses with the utmost speed The framework used by the authors is based on a common platform, Microsoft TEAMS, available to all teachers at Bologna University ? 2021 American Association of Physics Teachers","output":"Physics Laboratory at Home during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Shortage of skilled workers is a relevant global health care problem.

Among them, 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations in RdRp and S, respectively, became dominant in Europe and the US, which led to debates regarding their effects on the mutability and transmissibility of the virus. In this study, we aimed to investigate possible differences between time-dependent variation of mutation densities (MDe) of viral strains that carry these two mutations and those that do not. Our analyses at the genome and gene level led to two important findings: First, time-dependent changes in the average MDe of circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes showed different characteristics before and after the beginning of April, when daily new case numbers started levelling off. Second, this pattern was much delayed or even non-existent for the mutant (MT) strain that harbored both 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations. Although these differences were not limited to a few hotspots, it is intriguing that the MDe increase is most evident in two critical genes, S and Orf1ab, which are also the genes that harbor the defining mutations of the MT genotype.

Disasters and major emergencies, not just COVID-19, undoubtedly lead to greater incidence of mental health problems. Previous studies indicate that the novel Coronavirus disease can cause panic and stress in patients. Our literature search didnt reveal any previous published data from Cameroon and the Central African sub-region. In order to bridge this gap, we assessed the prevalence and factors associated with depression and anxiety in COVID-19 patients. Methods: : We carried out a cross-sectional study in a secondary hospital in the Littoral Region of Cameroon. We recruited hospitalised COVID-19 patients during a 4-month period. We collected data on sociodemographic characteristics. The HADS score was used to assess levels of anxiety and depression. All analysis were done using Stata 14. A P value of <0.05 was used as the cut-off for statistical significance. Results: : A total number of 285 patients took part in this study with a mean age of 48.47 years. The prevalence of anxiety in COVID-19 patients was 60.35% while the prevalence of depression was 81.40%.

We tested the hypothesis that sociodemographic, access to health care, and presentation to care characteristics among individuals with diabetes in Mexico confer an additional risk of hospitalization with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using public data from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of the Mexican Ministry of Health. We included individuals with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between 1 March and 31 July 2020. The primary outcome was the predicted probability of hospitalization, inclusive of 8.5% of patients who required intensive care unit admission. RESULTS: Among 373,963 adults with COVID-19, 16.1% (95% CI 16.0-16.3) self-reported diabetes. The predicted probability of hospitalization was 38.4% (37.6-39.2) for patients with diabetes only and 42.9% (42.2-43.7) for patients with diabetes and one or more comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease). High municipality-level of social deprivation and low state-level health care resources were associated with a 9.5% (6.3-12.7) and 17.5% (14.5-20.4) increased probability of hospitalization among patients with diabetes, respectively. In age-, sex-, and comorbidity-adjusted models, living in a context of high social vulnerability and low health care resources was associated with the highest predicted probability of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Social vulnerability contributes considerably to the probability of hospitalization among individuals with COVID-19 and diabetes with associated comorbidities. These findings can inform mitigation strategies for populations at the highest risk of severe COVID-19.","output":"Incremental Risk of Developing Severe COVID-19 Among Mexican Patients With Diabetes Attributed to Social and Health Care Access Disadvantages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The utility of preoperative computed tomography for urgent abdominal wall hernia repair is unclear. This study tests the hypothesis that there is no difference in patient outcomes for acutely incarcerated ventral or inguinal hernias diagnosed by preoperative computed tomography versus clinical assessment alone. METHODS: This retrospective cohort analysis included 270 adult patients undergoing urgent repair of ventral or inguinal hernia. Demographics, risk factors for complications, operative management strategies, and 1-year outcomes were compared between patients with (n = 179) versus without (n = 91) preoperative computed tomography. RESULTS: Among 179 preoperative computed tomography scans, 15 (8.4%) were ordered by surgeons, and all others were ordered by referring providers. The computed tomography and no computed tomography groups had similar age (58 vs 58 years, P = .77), body mass index (30.7 vs 30.6 kg/m2, P = .30), American Society of Anesthesiologists class (3.0 vs 3.0, P = .39), incidence of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (19.0% vs 20.9%, P = .75), and incidence of recurrent hernia (16.8% vs 19.8%, P = .61). The interval between admission and incision was longer in the computed tomography group (11.2 hours vs 6.6 hours, P < .001). The computed tomography and no computed tomography groups had similar duration of surgery (125 minutes in both groups, P = .88), proportions of patients with biologic mesh (21.2% vs 17.6%, P = .52) and synthetic mesh (35.2% vs 46.2%, P = .09) placement, and 1-year outcomes including incidence of superficial (8.4% vs 6.6%, P = .81) and deep or organ/space surgical site infection (5.0% vs 6.6%, P = .59), mesh explant for infection (2.2% vs 3.3%, P = .69), reoperation for recurrent hernia (3.9% vs 1.1%, P = .27), and mortality (7.8% vs 4.4%, P = .44). CONCLUSION: The performance of preoperative computed tomography was associated with a longer interval between admission and incision and no differences in mesh placement, mesh type, or 1-year patient outcomes.

METHODS: Renal function was evaluated prospectively in 61 patients with newly diagnosed untreated MM employing CKD-EPI and CAPA equations. The comparison was conducted using BlandCAltman graphics and Cohen's Kappa statistic. MannCWhitney T and Chi-square tests were used, and univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out. RESULTS: According to the IMWG criteria, 26% of patients showed RI (3 women/13 men) whilst the use of CysC equations allowed us to identify up to 39% of patients (7 women/17 men). The CAPA equation was less biased and dispersed and more sensitive than CKD-EPI-creatinine. Furthermore, univariate analysis unveiled an association between decreased CKD-EPI-CysC and poor prognosis based on R-ISS-3. CONCLUSIONS: The IMWG criteria may underestimate kidney disease, mostly in women, which could affect the dose received as well as its toxicity.

PURPOSE Our aim was to analyze the outcomes after flow diversion of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of 3 databases was performed for studies published from 2006 to 2018. STUDY SELECTION According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we included studies (from 2010 to 2018) reporting acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with flow diversion. DATA ANALYSIS Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the following: aneurysm occlusion rate, complications, rebleeding, and factors influencing the studied outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS We included 20 studies evaluating 223 patients with acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with flow-diverter stents. Immediate angiographic occlusion was obtained in 32% (29/86; 95% CI, 15.4%-48%; I2 = 79.6%) of aneurysms, whereas long-term complete/near-complete aneurysm occlusion was 88.9% (162/189; 95% CI, 84%-93.5%; I2 = 20.9%) (mean radiologic follow-up of 9.6 months). The treatment-related complication rate was 17.8% (42/223; 95% CI, 11%-24%; I2 = 52.6%). Complications were higher in the posterior circulation (16/72 = 27%; 95% CI, 14%-40%; I2 = 66% versus 18/149 = 11.7%; 95% CI, 7%-16%; I2 = 0%) (P = .004) and after treatment with multiple stents (14/52 = 26%; 95% CI, 14%-45%; I2 = 59%) compared with a single stent (20/141 = 10%; 95% CI, 5%-15%; I2 = 0%) (P = .004). Aneurysm rebleeding after treatment was 4% (5/223; 95% CI, 1.8%-7%; I2 = 0%) and was higher in the first 72 hours. LIMITATIONS Small and retrospective series. CONCLUSIONS Flow-diversion treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms yields a high rate of long-term angiographic occlusion with a relatively low rate of aneurysm rebleeding. However, treatment is associated with a complication rate of 18%. When coiling or microsurgical clipping are not feasible strategies, anterior circulation ruptured aneurysms can be effectively treated with a flow-diversion technique, minimizing the number of stents deployed. Given the 27% rate of complications, flow diversion for ruptured posterior circulation aneurysms should be considered only in selected cases not amenable to other treatments.","output":"Acutely Ruptured Intracranial Aneurysms Treated with Flow-Diverter Stents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telehealth appears useful to fill in the void for home-ventilated patients to maintain the much-needed connectivity with their healthcare team during the #COVID19 pandemic https://bit ly/3ftvjxW","output":"Telehealth: \\"virtual\\" lifeline for home-ventilated patients during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modelling and simulating the dynamics of pathogen spreading has been proven crucial to inform public heath decisions, containment strategies, as well as cost-effectiveness calculations. Pathogen spreading is often modelled as a stochastic process that is driven by pathogen exposure on time-evolving contact networks. In adaptive networks, the spreading process depends not only on the dynamics of a contact network, but vice versa, infection dynamics may alter risk behaviour and thus feed back onto contact dynamics, leading to emergent complex dynamics. However, stochastic simulation of pathogen spreading processes on adaptive networks is currently computationally prohibitive. In this manuscript, we propose SSATAN-X, a new algorithm for the accurate stochastic simulation of pathogen spreading on adaptive networks. The key idea of SSATAN-X is to only capture the contact dynamics that are relevant to the spreading process. We show that SSATAN-X captures the contact dynamics and consequently the spreading dynamics accurately. The algorithm achieves up to 100 fold speed-up over the state-of-art stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). The speed-up with SSATAN-X further increases when the contact dynamics are fast in relation to the spreading process, i.e. if contacts are short-lived and per-exposure infection risks are small, as applicable to most infectious diseases. We envision that SSATAN-X may extend the scope of analysis of pathogen spreading on adaptive networks. Moreover, it may serve to create benchmark data sets to validate novel numerical approaches for simulation, or for the data-driven analysis of the spreading dynamics on adaptive networks. A C++ implementation of the algorithm is available at https://github.com/nmalysheva/SSATAN-X. Author summary Modelling and simulating of infectious disease spreading supports public heath decisions, such as prevention and containment strategies and allows to perform cost-effectiveness calculations. Detailed modelling approaches consider stochastic pathogen spreading on time-evolving contact networks. In adaptive networks, the spreading process depends not only on the dynamics of a contact network, but vice versa, infection dynamics may alter risk behaviour and thus feed back onto contact dynamics. Stochastic simulation of these complex dynamics is currently computationally prohibitive. We propose a new algorithm (SSATAN-X) that can significantly speed up stochastic simulations on adaptive networks, while being accurate at the same time. Our algorithm achieves this speed-up by only considering the contact dynamics that are relevant to the spreading process. The benefit of algorithm is particularly pronounced when contacts are short-lived and per-exposure infection risks are small, which is applicable to most infectious diseases. We envision that SSATAN-X may allow simulation and analysis of pathogen spreading on more complex adaptive networks than previously possible. Moreover, data sets may be created with SSATAN-X that are useful for benchmarking novel numerical schemes and analytic approaches.","output":"Stochastic Simulation Algorithm for effective spreading dynamics on Time-evolving Adaptive NetworX (SSATAN-X)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly disrupted the well-established, traditional structure of medical education. he new limitations of physical presence have accelerated the development of an online learning environment, comprising both of asynchronous and synchronous distance education, and the introduction of novel ways of student assessment.

RESULTS: Mean symptom scores increased from before to during COVID-19 restrictions on the PHQ-9 (coefficient: 1.29; 95% CI 0.72-1.86) and GAD-7 (0.78; 95% CI 0.26-1.31), but there was no increase in help-seeking over time (odds ratio 0.50; 95% CI 0.19-1.32). There was no evidence of differential changes by gender. CONCLUSIONS: This study found increases in depression and anxiety symptoms but not greater help-seeking among young Australian adults during the first wave of the pandemic. Increasing availability and awareness of accessible treatment options and psychoeducation is critical, as well as further research into risk and protective factors to help target treatment to this vulnerable age group.","output":"Changes in mental health and help-seeking among young Australian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The three-dimensional (3D) structures of Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules are essential to understanding their various and important biological functions.

A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify admission factors associated with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1,718 patients were analyzed (56.5% men; median age 81.4 years). The overall case fatality rate was 47.6% (n=819). The independent risk factors at admission for in-hospital mortality were: age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.03; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.02-1.05; p<.001); severe dependence (AOR: 1.62; 95%CI: 1.19-2.20; p=.002); tachycardia (AOR: 1.01; 95%CI: 1.00-1.01; p=.004); and high C-reactive protein (AOR: 1.004; 95%CI:1.002-1.004; p<.001), LDH (AOR: 1.001; 95%CI: 1.001-1.002; p<.001), and serum creatinine levels (AOR: 1.35; 95%CI: 1.18-1.54; p<.001).

When the pigments producing skin color turn carcinogenic, this disease gets contracted. A skin cancer diagnosis is a challenging process for dermatologists as many skin cancer pigments may appear similar in appearance. Hence, early detection of lesions (which form the base of skin cancer) is definitely critical and useful to completely cure the patients suffering from skin cancer. Significant progress has been made in developing automated tools for the diagnosis of skin cancer to assist dermatologists. The worldwide acceptance of artificial intelligence-supported tools has permitted usage of the enormous collection of images of lesions and benevolent sores approved by histopathology. This paper performs a comparative analysis of six different transfer learning nets for multi-class skin cancer classification by taking the HAM10000 dataset. We used replication of images of classes with low frequencies to counter the imbalance in the dataset. The transfer learning nets that were used in the analysis were VGG19, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, Xception, and MobileNet. Results demonstrate that replication is suitable for this task, achieving high classification accuracies and F-measures with lower false negatives.

In this study, a total of 791 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Bangladesh deposited in the GISAID database during March 2020 to January 2021 were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed circulation of seven GISAID clades G, GH, GR, GRY, L, O, and S or five Nextstrain clades 20A, 20B, 20C, 19A, and 19B in the country during the study period. The GISAID clade GR or the Nextstrain clade 20B or lineage B.1.1.25 is predominant in Bangladesh and closely related to the sequences from India, USA, Canada, UK, and Italy. The GR clade or B.1.1.25 lineage is likely to be responsible for the widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the country during the first wave of infection.

The nonstructural protein nsp5, also called 3C-like protease, is responsible for processing viral polyprotein precursors in coronavirus (CoV) replication. Previous studies have shown that PDCoV nsp5 cleaves the NF-&#954;B essential modulator and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 to disrupt interferon (IFN) production and signaling, respectively. Whether PDCoV nsp5 also cleaves IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), IFN-induced antiviral effector molecules, remains unclear. In this study, we screened 14 classical ISGs and found that PDCoV nsp5 cleaved the porcine mRNA-decapping enzyme 1a (pDCP1A) through its protease activity. Similar cleavage of endogenous pDCP1A was also observed in PDCoV-infected cells. PDCoV nsp5 cleaved pDCP1A at glutamine 343 (Q343), and the cleaved pDCP1A fragments, pDCP1A1-343 and pDCP1A344-580, were unable to inhibit PDCoV infection. Mutant pDCP1A-Q343A, which resists nsp5-mediated cleavage, exhibited a stronger ability to inhibit PDCoV infection than wild-type pDCP1A. Interestingly, the Q343 cleavage site is highly conserved in DCP1A homologs from other mammalian species. Further analyses demonstrated that nsp5 encoded by seven tested CoVs that can infect human or pig also cleaved pDCP1A and human DCP1A, suggesting that DCP1A may be the common target for cleavage by nsp5 of mammalian CoVs.IMPORTANCE Interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) induction through IFN signaling is important to create an antiviral state and usually directly inhibits virus infection. The present study first demonstrated that PDCoV nsp5 can cleave mRNA-decapping enzyme 1a (DCP1A) to attenuate its antiviral activity. Furthermore, cleaving DCP1A is a common characteristic of nsp5 proteins from different coronaviruses (CoVs), which represents a common immune evasion mechanism of CoVs. Previous evidence showed that CoV nsp5 cleaves the NF-&#954;B essential modulator and signal transducer and activator of transcription 2. Taken together, CoV nsp5 is a potent IFN antagonist because it can simultaneously target different aspects of the host IFN system, including IFN production and signaling and effector molecules.","output":"Porcine Deltacoronavirus nsp5 Cleaves DCP1A To Decrease Its Antiviral Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proliferation of fake news on social media is now a matter of considerable public and governmental concern.

Such high editing rates of viral RNA have not, to our knowledge, been reported before.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine and inter-personal distancing are crucial to limiting the spread of the virus in the general population, but more tailored interventions may be needed at an individual level on a case-by-case basis. In this perspective, the most insidious situation is when an individual has contact with a contagious subject without adequate protection.

For diagnostic purposes the following approaches can be used: demonstration of presence of infectious virus or its structural components directly from a patient's specimens or investigation of specific antibody response in serum specimes. Virus isolation is used to demonstrate infectious virus in a patient's specimens, whereas nucleic acid amplification techniques, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are widely used to detect virus nucleic acids.

In the saline injection group (group A), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was performed for 11 nodules after transbronchial saline injection under balloon occlusion with a 2-cm active single internally cooled electrode. In the control group (group B), conventional RFA was performed for 10 nodules as a control. The infused saline liquid showed a wedge-shaped and homogeneous distribution surrounding a tumor mimic. All 21 RFAs were successfully completed. The total ablation time was significantly longer (13.4 +/- 2.8 min vs. 8.9 +/- 3.5 min; P = 0.0061) and the tissue impedance was significantly lower in group A compared with group B (73.1 +/- 8.8 Omega vs. 100.6 +/- 16.6 Omega; P = 0.0002).

METHODS: The evaluations were carried out by means of an online survey, with a sample of 3480 persons in the first data collection and 1041 and 569 persons in the successive evaluation periods. The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated by means of screening tests. Sociodemographic data, Covid-19 variables, loneliness, psychological well-being, social support, discrimination and a sense of belonging, were collected. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms increased significantly throughout the confinement, decreasing at the last assessment but not dropping to previous levels. In anxiety, there are no significant changes between the three evaluations, but a downward trend can be seen over time. Regarding the symptomatology of PTSD, a downward trend is observed throughout the three evaluations, with significantly lower scores between the first and third assessments. The different regression models developed reveal the importance of perceived loneliness and spiritual well-being as the main predictors of mental health, as well as the importance of the lower age for depression and the female gender for anxiety and PSTD. CONCLUSIONS: This research shows that the pandemic has had a negative impact on our mental health, which still does not seem to be at pre-crisis levels, although it has improved as the emergency situation subsides. These results underline the importance of paying greater attention to mental health, and reveal key variables such as spiritual well-being and perceived loneliness in which to intervene from different care services, as well as younger people and women as vulnerable groups on which to focus more attention.","output":"Mental health consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak in Spain.

Modifications in running time, blood lactate, blood glucose, blood oxygen saturation, subjective perceived stress, rating of perceived exertion, and heart rate variability were measured in 50 m and 400 m maximal running tests with and without the use of surgical masks in 72 athletes. The use of a surgical mask increased blood lactate concentration, sympathetic autonomic modulation, perceived exertion, perceived stress, and decreased blood oxygen saturation in 50 and 400 m running tests. Thus, the higher levels of blood lactate and lower blood oxygen saturation require adaptation of the athlete's rest and recovery periods to the acute workload. The higher level of sympathetic activation makes the acute and chronic control of autonomic modulation essential for an efficient training periodization.

In this study, osmotic-stress-induced dormant bacterial cells were separated by cell sorting and revived by osmotic down-shift in the absence of nutrients, source(s) that potentially could supply nutrients, and/or the external addition of resuscitation factor(s). Reversal of dormancy followed a definite pattern akin to population asynchrony of dormant cells, and the phenomenon was observed across three species, namely, Enterobacter sp. strain mcp11b, Klebsiella pneumonia strain mcp11d and Escherichia coli. In addition, our study precisely forecasted the presence of multiple subpopulations in dormant cells, which is explained by an emerging theory of survival mechanisms in stressful environments. These observations reveal that the state of dormancy induced by environmental stress in these nonspore-forming bacteria is reversible and also implies that it is an orderly and spontaneous adaptation to circumvent adverse conditions.

At first sight, it seems that many families were able to cope relatively well with the stressors. Yet, for others the demands of the pandemic and pandemic-related measures seemed to exceed their capabilities and available resources. Importantly, the studies in this special issue suggest that the pandemic disproportionally affected children, caregivers and families who were already at risk. Together, the contributions to the special issue offer knowledge on the consequences of both the pandemic and preventive measures on family functioning.

Many stakeholders affect the opioid epidemic, including government entities, healthcare providers and policymakers, and opioid users. Simulation and conceptual modeling can help us understand the dynamics of the opioid epidemic by simplifying the real world and informing policymakers about different health interventions that could reduce the deaths caused by opioid overdose in the United States every year. Objectives To conduct a scoping review of simulation and conceptual models that propose policies capable of controlling the opioid epidemic. We demonstrate the strengths and limitations of these models and provide a framework for further improvement of future decision support tools. Methods Using the methodology of a scoping review, we identified articles published after 2000 from eight electronic databases to map the literature that uses simulation and conceptual modeling in developing public health policies to address the opioid epidemic. Results We reviewed 472 papers of which 14 were appropriate for inclusion. Each used either system dynamics simulation modeling, mathematical modeling, conceptual modeling, or agent-based modeling. All included studies tested and proposed strategies to improve health outcomes related to the opioid epidemic. Factors considered in the models included physicians prescribing opioids, trafficking, users recruiting new users, and doctor shopping; no model investigated the impact of age and spatial factors on the dynamics of the epidemic. Key findings from these studies were (1) prevention of opioid initiation is better than treatment of opioid addiction, (2) the analysis of an intervention's impact should include both benefits and harms, and (3) interventions with short-term benefits might have a counterproductive impact on the epidemic in long run. Conclusions While most studies examined the role of prescription opioids and trafficking on this epidemic, the transition of patients from prescription opioid use to nonprescription use including heroin and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl impacts the system significantly and results in an epidemic with quite different characteristics than what it had a decade ago.

Prior research has demonstrated that victims of discrimination are more likely to experience physiological health concerns, possibly linked to sleep. The objective of this study was to determine if there was a relationship between disordered sleep and discrimination among Chinese older adults using data collected from the Population Study of ChINese Elderly (N=3124, 59% female). To assess, the experience of discrimination in nine settings (school, hiring, work, housing, medical, service, finance, public, and authority) and four indicators of sleep quality (duration, trouble falling asleep, insomnia, and self-reported sleep quality) were evaluated using logistic- and multinomial logistic regression. With an average age of 75 years, discrimination was experienced by 7.2% of participants. Experiencing any discrimination was associated with lower odds of longer sleep durations (>8 hours) compared to those sleeping 6-8 hours. Experiences of discrimination in housing (OR: 5.51 (95%CI:1.08-27.98)) and with authority figures (OR: 6.02 (95%CI:1.16-31.31)) were significantly associated with shorter sleep durations (<6 hours), compared to those sleeping 6-8 hours. Those who experienced discrimination in a school setting were less likely to have trouble falling asleep (OR: 0.28 (95%CI:0.09-0.88)), while discrimination in medical settings were more likely to experience insomnia (OR: 2.29 (95%CI:1.13-4.63)).

Here we describe a male patient fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of MIS-C, who was initially treated according to current consensus guidelines. Presence of hypofibrinogenemia, normal lymphocyte counts and C-reactive protein, but substantial hyperferritinemia distinguish this patient from others with MIS-C. The clinical course following initial presentation with acute respiratory distress syndrome was marked by fatal liver failure in the context of EBV-associated HLH despite treatment with steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, interleukin (IL)-1 receptor blockade and eventually HLH-directed treatment. X-linked lymphoproliferative disease type 1 (XLP1), a subtype of primary HLH was diagnosed in this patient post-mortem. This case report highlights the importance of including HLH in the differential diagnosis in MIS-C with severe disease course to allow specific, risk-adapted treatment and genetic counseling.","output":"X-Linked Lymphoproliferative Disease Mimicking Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in ChildrenA Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research paper examines the state of European integration in the aftermath of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (Brexit) and the outburst of the Covid-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Data on baseline characteristics, stroke subtype, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, the time between last known well (LKW) to emergency department (ED) arrival, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration, the involvement of large vessel occlusion (LVO), and whether mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was pursued in patients with acute stroke were extracted from 24 March to 23 April 2020 (the time period of a stay-at-home order was placed due to the COVID-19 pandemic as the study group) at a tertiary care hospital in West Michigan, USA, compared with data from 24 March to 23 April 2019 (control group). RESULTS: Our study demonstrated a reduction in cases of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), although this did not reach statistical significance. However, there was an increase in hemorrhagic stroke (7.5% controls vs. 19.2% study group). The age of stroke patients was significantly younger during the period of the stay-at-home order compared to the control group. We identified a significant overall delay of ED arrivals from LKW in the study group. Additionally, an increased number of AIS patients with LVO in the study group (34.8%) was found compared to the control group (17.5%). A significantly increased number of patients received MT in the study group. Additionally, 11 patients were COVID-19 PCR-positive in the study group, 10 with AIS and only 1 with hemorrhagic stroke. Patients with COVID-19 had a high incidence of atrial fibrillation and hyperlipidemia. One AIS patient with COVID-19 rapidly developed cytotoxic edema with corresponding elevated inflammatory biomarkers. No statistical significance was noted when stroke subtype, LVO, and MT groups were compared. CONCLUSIONS: There was a trend of decreasing AIS admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also a significantly increased number of AIS patients with LVO who received MT, especially those with COVID-19. We conclude that cytokine storm resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection might play a role in AIS patients with COVID-19.","output":"Impact of a Stay-at-Home Order on Stroke Admission, Subtype, and Metrics during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The novel human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed more than 600,000 lives worldwide, causing tremendous public health, social, and economic damages. While the risk factors of COVID-19 are still under investigation, environmental factors, such as urban air pollution, may play an important role in increasing population susceptibility to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional nationwide study using zero-inflated negative binomial models to estimate the association between long-term (2010-2016) county-level exposures to NO2, PM2.5 and O3 and county-level COVID-19 case-fatality and mortality rates in the US. We used both single and multipollutant models and controlled for spatial trends and a comprehensive set of potential confounders, including state-level test positive rate, county-level healthcare capacity, phase-of-epidemic, population mobility, population density, sociodemographics, socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, behavioral risk factors, and meteorology. Results: 3,659,828 COVID-19 cases and 138,552 deaths were reported in 3,076 US counties from January 22, 2020 to July 17, 2020, with an overall observed case-fatality rate of 3.8%. County-level average NO2 concentrations were positively associated with both COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate in single-, bi-, and tri-pollutant models. When adjusted for co-pollutants, per inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in NO2 (4.6 ppb), COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate were associated with an increase of 11.3% (95% CI 4.9% to 18.2%) and 16.2% (95% CI 8.7% to 24.0%), respectively. We did not observe significant associations between COVID-19 case-fatality rate and long-term exposure to PM2.5 or O3, although per IQR increase in PM2.5 (2.6 ug/m3) was marginally associated with 14.9% (95% CI: 0.0% to 31.9%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate when adjusted for co-pollutants. Discussion: Long-term exposure to NO2, which largely arises from urban combustion sources such as traffic, may enhance susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes, independent of long-term PM2.5 and O3 exposure. The results support targeted public health actions to protect residents from COVID-19 in heavily polluted regions with historically high NO2 levels. Continuation of current efforts to lower traffic emissions and ambient air pollution may be an important component of reducing population-level risk of COVID-19 case-fatality and mortality.","output":"Urban Air Pollution May Enhance COVID-19 Case-Fatality and Mortality Rates in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Population-level COVID-19 immunization will play a key role in slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on a global scale and protect the most at-risk individuals. Thanks to a formidable universal effort, several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been marketed less than a year since the first documented COVID-19 case, with promising safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity results in adults. As children were not included in the initial trials, no vaccine is currently approved for individuals <16 years of age. Similarly, immunosuppressed individuals, such as solid organ transplant recipients, were excluded from initial vaccine trials, limiting the understanding of vaccine immunogenicity and safety in this at-risk population. Thus, data regarding COVID-19 vaccination in pediatric solid organ transplantation recipients are currently lacking. METHODS: Members of the International Pediatric Transplant Association review the current general status of COVID-19 vaccines focusing on pediatric-specific issues.

METHODS We enrolled 92 patients older than 18 years undergoing elective OPCAB-surgery. Serum-levels of S100 were determined at baseline (BL), end of surgery (EOS) and on the first postoperative day (PD1). Postoperatively, all-patients were evaluated daily until PD5 for the presence of POD using the confusion assessment method (CAM) or the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS The overall incidence of POD was 21%. S100-values on PD1 significantly predicted the occurrence of POD during the later hospital stay [area under the curve (AUC)=0.724 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.619-0.814); p=0.0001] with an optimal cut-off level of 123 pg mL-1 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 44%). Below this value, the absence of POD was predicted correctly in 43.66% of patients without POD [negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% (95%CI: 88.8%-100.0%) - positive predictive value of 29.8% (95%CI: 18.4%-43.4%) and likelihood ratio (LR) of the negative result of 0.0]. CONCLUSIONS S100-levels <123 pg mL-1 measured on PD1 reliably rule out the development of POD after elective OPCAB-surgery.

The exposures of interest are BMI categories and central obesity (e.g., larger waist circumference). Using genome-wide genotyping data, we also computed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) that represent an individual's overall genetic risk for each obesity trait. The outcome was severe COVID-19, defined by hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 489,769 individuals, 33% were normal weight (BMI, 18.5-24.9a?kg/m2), 43% overweight (25.0-29.9a?kg/m2), and 24% obese (&#8805;30.0a?kg/m2). The UK Biobank identified 641 patients with severe COVID-19. Compared to adults with normal weight, those with a higher BMI had a dose-response increases in the risk of severe COVID-19, with the following adjusted ORs: for 25.0-29.9a?kg/m2, 1.40 (95%CI 1.14-1.73; Pa?=a?0.002); for 30.0-34.9a?kg/m2, 1.73 (95%CI 1.36-2.20; Pa?<a?0.001); for 35.0-39.9a?kg/m2, 2.82 (95%CI 2.08-3.83; Pa?<a?0.001); and for &#8805;40.0a?kg/m2, 3.30 (95%CI 2.17-5.03; Pa?<a?0.001). Likewise, central obesity was associated with significantly higher risk of severe COVID-19 (Pa?<a?0.001).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether boosting healthcare personnel, already reasonably protected by prior infection or vaccination, with a vaccine developed for an earlier variant of COVID-19 protects against the Omicron variant. Methods. Employees of Cleveland Clinic who were previously infected with or vaccinated against COVID-19, and were working in Ohio the day the Omicron variant was declared a variant of concern, were included. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined over two months during an Omicron variant surge. Protection provided by boosting (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Analyses were adjusted for time since proximate overt immunologic challenge (POIC) as a time-dependent covariate. Results. Among 39 766 employees, 8037 (20%) previously infected and the remaining previously vaccinated, COVID-19 occurred in 6230 (16%) during the study. Risk of COVID-19 increased with time since POIC. In multivariable analysis, boosting was independently associated with lower risk of COVID-19 among those with vaccine-induced immunity (HR, .43; 95% CI, .41-.46) as well as those with natural immunity (HR, .66; 95% CI, .58-.76). Among those with natural immunity, receiving 2 compared to 1 dose of vaccine was associated with higher risk of COVID-19 (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.21-1.97). Conclusions. Administering a COVID-19 vaccine not designed for the Omicron variant, 6 months or more after prior infection or vaccination, protects against Omicron variant infection in both previously infected and previously vaccinated individuals.

Four hours after injection with LPS or saline, blood, spleen, and liver samples were collected and subjected to transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), metabolomics, and specific reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Differential expression analysis was at the gene, pathway, and network levels. LPS-treated deermice showed signs of sickness similar to those of exposed mice and had similar increases in corticosterone levels and expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, and C-reactive protein. By network analysis, the M. musculus response to LPS was characterized as cytokine associated, while the P. leucopus response was dominated by neutrophil activity terms. In addition, dichotomies in the expression levels of arginase 1 and nitric oxide synthase 2 and of IL-10 and IL-12 were consistent with type M1 macrophage responses in mice and type M2 responses in deermice. Analysis of metabolites in plasma and RNA in organs revealed species differences in tryptophan metabolism. Two genes in particular signified the different phenotypes of deermice and mice: the Slpi and Ibsp genes.

We found that kidney, small intestine, esophagus, tongue, brain, and liver express ACE2. Epithelium of proximal tubules of kidney and surface epithelium of ileum expresses a very high amount of this protein. Surprisingly, analysis of stained tissue sections for ACE2 showed no detectable expression of ACE2 in the lung or tracheal epithelial cells. Similarly, all parts of the large intestine (caecum, colon, and rectum) were negative for ACE2 expression. Together, our findings corroborate some of the earlier reports related to ACE2 expression pattern in human tissues and also contradicts some others. We believe that the findings of this study will enable the appropriate use of the Syrian golden hamster to carryout SARS-CoV-2 related studies.","output":"Tissue distribution of ACE2 protein in Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) and its possible implications in SARS-CoV-2 related studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To analyze the quality of resuscitation (CPR) performed by individuals without training after receiving a set of instructions (structured and unstructured/intuitive) from an expert in a simulated context, the specific objective was to design a simple and structured CPR learning method on-site An experimental study was designed, consisting of two random groups with a post-intervention measurement in which the experimental group (EG) received standardized instructions, and the control group (CG) received intuitive or non-standardized instructions, in a public area simulated scenario Statistically significant differences were found (p &lt; 0 0001) between the EG and the CG for variables: time needed to give orders, pauses between chest compressions and ventilations, depth, overall score, chest compression score, and chest recoil The average depth of the EG was 51 1 mm (SD 7 94) and 42 2 mm (SD 12 04) for the CG The chest recoil median was 86 32% (IQR 62 36, 98 87) for the EG, and 58 3% (IQR 27 46, 84 33) in the CG The use of a sequence of simple, short and specific orders, together with observation-based learning makes possible the execution of chest compression maneuvers that are very similar to those performed by rescuers, and allows the teaching of the basic notions of ventilation The structured order method was shown to be an on-site learning opportunity when faced with the need to maintain high-quality CPR in the presence of an expert resuscitator until the arrival of emergency services","output":"Relief Alternatives during Resuscitation: Instructions to Teach Bystanders.

Examining the economic, social, physical and political food environment of low-income groups as a complex adaptive system C i.e. a system of multiple, interconnected factors exerting non-linear influence on an outcome, can enhance the development and assessment of effective policies and interventions by honouring the complexity of lived reality. We aimed to develop and apply novel causal loop diagramming methods in order to construct an evidence-based map of the underlying system of environmental factors that drives dietary intake in low-income groups. METHODS: A systematic umbrella review was conducted on literature examining determinants of dietary intake and food environments in low-income youths and adults in high/upper-middle income countries. Information on the determinants and associations between determinants was extracted from reviews of quantitative and qualitative studies. Determinants were organised using the Determinants of Nutrition and Eating (DONE) framework. Associations were synthesised into causal loop diagrams that were subsequently used to interpret the dynamics underlying the food environment and dietary intake. The map was reviewed by an expert panel and systems-based analysis identified the system paradigm, structure, feedback loops and goals. RESULTS: Findings from forty-three reviews and expert consensus were synthesised in an evidence-based map of the complex adaptive system underlying the food environment influencing dietary intake in low-income groups. The system was interpreted as operating within a supply-and-demand, economic paradigm. Five sub-systems (geographical accessibility, household finances, household resources, individual influences, social and cultural influences) were presented as causal loop diagrams comprising 60 variables, conveying goals which undermine healthy dietary intake. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal how poor dietary intake in low-income groups can be presented as an emergent property of a complex adaptive system that sustains a food environment that increases the accessibility, availability, affordability and acceptability of unhealthy foods. In order to reshape system dynamics driving unhealthy food environments, simultaneous, diverse and innovative strategies are needed to facilitate longer-term management of household finances and socially-oriented practices around healthy food production, supply and intake. Ultimately, such strategies must be supported by a system paradigm which prioritises health.

To determine the value of undertaking a systematic review on this topic; and to identify knowledge gaps to aid future research, education and guidelines. METHODS: This review was guided by specific methodological framework and reporting items (PRISMA-ScR). We included studies, cases and grey literature regarding prone position and CPR/cardiac arrest. The databases searched were MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus and Google Scholar. Expanded grey literature searching included internet search engine, targeted websites and social media. RESULTS: Of 453 identified studies, 24 (5%) studies met our inclusion criteria. There were four prone resuscitation-relevant studies examining: blood and tidal volumes generated by prone compressions; prone compression quality metrics on a manikin; and chest computed tomography scans for compression landmarking. Twenty case reports/series described the resuscitation of 25 prone patients. Prone compression quality was assessed by invasive blood pressure monitoring, exhaled carbon dioxide and pulse palpation. Recommended compression location was zero-to-two vertebral segments below the scapulae. Twenty of 25 cases (80%) survived prone resuscitation, although few cases reported long term outcome (neurological status at hospital discharge). Seven cases described full neurological recovery. CONCLUSION: This scoping review did not identify sufficient evidence to justify a systematic review or modified resuscitation guidelines. It remains reasonable to initiate resuscitation in the prone position if turning the patient supine would lead to delays or risk to providers or patients. Prone resuscitation quality can be judged using end-tidal CO2, and arterial pressure tracing, with patients turned supine if insufficient.","output":"Prone cardiopulmonary resuscitation: A scoping and expanded grey literature review for the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Most RNA viruses have evolved strategies to regulate cellular translation in order to promote preferential expression of the viral genome.

The critical importance of using PPE properly is highlighted by 2 potentially fatal viral infections, severe acute respiratory syndromeCassociated coronavirus and Ebola virus, where HCP became infected while caring for patients due to errors in the use of PPE. However, PPE in dealing with less dangerous, but highly infectious organisms is important as well. This work proposes a framework to test and evaluate PPE with a focus on gown design. METHODS: An observational study identified issues with potential for contamination related to gown use. After redesigning the existing gown, a high-fidelity patient simulator study with 40 HCP as participants evaluated the gown redesign using 2 commonly performed tasks. Variables of interest were nonadherence to procedural standards, use problems with the gown during task performance, and usability and cognitive task load ratings of the standard and redesigned gowns. RESULTS: While no differences were found in terms of nonadherence and use problems between the current and the redesigned gown, differences in usability and task load ratings suggested that the redesigned gown is perceived more favorably by HCP. CONCLUSIONS: This work proposes a framework to guide the evaluation of PPE. The results suggest that the current design of the PPE gown can be improved in usability and user satisfaction. Although our data did not find an increase in adherence to protocol when using the redesigned gown, it is likely that higher usability and lower task load could result in higher adherence over longer periods of use.","output":"Evaluation of a Redesigned Personal Protective Equipment Gown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, cases of pneumonia, a new type of corona virus (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), began to be reported in Wuhan, China.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the most challenging threat to the swine industry worldwide. Currently, commercially available vaccines are ineffective for controlling porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs. Therefore, a pharmacological intervention may represent an alternative control measure for PRRSV infection. Hence, the present study evaluated the effects of DiNap on the replication of VR2332 (a prototype strain of type 2 PRRSV). Initially, in vitro antiviral assays against VR2332 were performed in MARC-145 cells and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Following this, a pilot study was conducted in a pig model to demonstrate the effects of DiNap following VR2332 infection. DiNap inhibited VR2332 replication in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, and viral growth was completely suppressed at concentrations 0.06 mM, without significant cytotoxicity. Consistent with these findings, in the pig study, DiNap also reduced viral loads in the serum and lungs and enhanced the weight gain of pigs following VR2332 infection, as indicated by comparison of the DiNap-treated groups to the untreated control (NC) group. In addition, DiNap-treated pigs had fewer gross and microscopic lesions in their lungs than NC pigs. Notably, virus transmission was also delayed by approximately 1 week in uninfected contact pigs within the same group after treatment with DiNap.

However, NMB use varies by patient and procedural characteristics, clinical practices, protocols, and drug access. National utilization patterns are unknown. We describe changes in NMB and NMB reversal agent administration in surgical inpatients since the US introduction of sugammadex in December 2015. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study of inpatients involving NMB with rocuronium or vecuronium in the Premier Healthcare Database, we estimate associations between factors related to choice of (1) active NMB reversal versus spontaneous recovery and (2) sugammadex versus neostigmine as the reversal agent. RESULTS: Among 4.3 million adult inpatient encounters involving rocuronium or vecuronium, the most widely administered NMB agent was rocuronium alone (86%). Over time, gradual declines in both neostigmine use and spontaneous reversal were observed (64% and 36% in 2014 to 38% and 28%, respectively in the first half of 2019). Several factors were independently associated with use of active versus spontaneous NMB recovery including years since 2016, patient (age, race, comorbidities), and procedure (admission and surgery type) characteristics. Among those actively reversed, these and other factors were independently associated with choice of reversal agent administered, including size and teaching affiliation of hospital. While both impacted choices in treatment, the direction and magnitude of effect of patient comorbidities and procedure type varied in their impact on choice of mode (pharmacologic vs. spontaneous) and agent (neostigmine vs. sugammadex) of NMB reversal independent of other factors and each other. Sites which adopted sugammadex earlier were more likely to choose sugammadex over neostigmine compared with later adopters independent of other factors.

Methods The primary objective was to assess the time-course evolution of CFR of COVID-19 in all countries with available data and secondary objective was to evaluate associations between country-wise CFR and country-level health, human development, demographic and economic parameters. Day-wise data of COVID-19 cases and deaths for each country was extracted from a public repository and countries with at least 1000 cases on cutoff date were clustered by unsupervised kmeans on the basis of deaths per 100000 population (DP100K). Day-wise CFR (cumulative deaths divided by cumulative cases, multiplied by 100) for each country and cluster (country group) was plotted as time-series and country-level parameters were tested for association with CFR using weighted multiple linear regression. Results On September 24, 2020 there were 32140504 cumulative COVID-19 cases and 981792 deaths reported from 184 countries for a worldwide CFR of 3.06 % (95%CI 3.05 -3.07). Unsupervised k-means clustering in 157 countries with at least 1000 reported cases resulted in Clusters (country groups) A, B, C, D and E with centroid DP100K and CFR of 0.100 and 2.51 (95% CI 2.42-2.61), 0.503 and 2.28 (95% CI 2.23-2.33), 1.816 and 1.73 (95% CI 1.71-1.75), 7.395 and 1.76 (95% CI 1.75-1.76),4 and 36.303 and 3.82 (95% CI 3.82-3.83), respectively. In a log-log analysis DP100K and CFR were significantly positively correlated (R=0.3570, p<0.001) with each other. All country groups and majority of included countries showed a pattern of gradually increasing CFR from the beginning of pandemic, followed by a plateau and then a steady decline in CFR. Among 10 country-level parameters, GDP per capita ({beta}=-0.483, p=0.000), hospital beds per population ({beta}=-0.372, p<0.001), mortality from air pollution ({beta}=-0.487, p=0.003) and population density ({beta}=-0.570, p< 0.000) were significantly negatively associated while maternal mortality ratio ({beta}=0.431, p=0.000) and age ({beta}=0.635, p<0.000) were positively associated with CFR. Conclusions The CFR of COVID-19 has gradually increased over time in majority of countries at various stages of the pandemic, followed by a plateau and a steady decline.

Early studies on tourism management focus on discovering external factors related to tourism demand. Recent studies utilize deep learning in demand forecasting along with these external factors.

This is because tourism demand is strongly affected by changes in various external factors, and recursive neural network models have limitations in handling these multivariate inputs. We propose a multi-head attention CNN model (MHAC) for addressing these limitations. The MHAC uses 1D-convolutional neural network to analyze temporal patterns and the attention mechanism to reflect correlations between input variables. This model makes it possible to extract spatiotemporal characteristics from time-series data of various variables.

In addition, they provide energy and nutrients, which are required for growth and survival. They occur as prebiotics or dietary supplements, including oligosaccharides, processed foods, and herbal products. However, oligosaccharides are more efficiently recognized and utilized, as they play a fundamental role as functional ingredients with great potential to improve health in comparison to other dietary supplements. They are low molecular weight carbohydrates with a low degree of polymerization. They occur as fructooligosaccharide (FOS), inulooligosaccharadie (IOS), and xylooligosaccahride (XOS), depending on their monosaccharide units. Oligosaccharides are produced by acid or chemical hydrolysis. However, this technique is liable to several drawbacks, including inulin precipitation, high processing temperature, low yields, and high production costs. As a consequence, the application of microbial enzymes for oligosaccharide production is recognized as a promising strategy. Microbial enzymatic production of FOS and IOS occurs by submerged or solid-state fermentation in the presence of suitable substrates (sucrose, inulin) and catalyzed by fructosyltransferases and inulinases. Incorporation of FOS and IOS enriches the rheological and physiological characteristics of foods. They are used as low cariogenic sugar substitutes, suitable for diabetics, and as prebiotics, probiotics and nutraceutical compounds. In addition, these oligosaccharides are employed as anticancer, antioxidant agents and aid in mineral absorption, lipid metabolism, immune regulation etc. This review, therefore, focuses on the occurrence, physico-chemical characteristics, and microbial enzymatic synthesis of FOS and IOS from coprophilous fungi.

While the author's story is unique, other medical students have also faced challenges that have led them to consider a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

Students fear that showing the slightest hint of vulnerability or imperfection will be used against them in an advancement committee, a course evaluation, or the dean's letter for residency applications. This difficulty asking for help and the subsequent suppression of feelings can lead to burnout and ultimately to increased risk of suicide. The author calls for medical schools to make changes to their culture to preserve medical student mental health. These include committing to helping students who are struggling academically or psychologically; implementing an institution-wide program to screen for individuals at risk for suicide; educating members of the institution's community about depression to destigmatize seeking help for mental health; and ensuring confidential mental health services are readily available to those who need them.

Training future physicians to recognize and respond to trauma is paramount, and engaging medical students in the preclinical years affords the opportunity to foster the development of a trauma-informed lens that can then be solidified during clinical clerkships. METHODS: We developed and implemented a 4-hour trauma-informed care (TIC) symposium for 179 second-year medical students at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences during the Patients, Populations, and Systems course. The symposium included three interactive didactic sessions focusing on the connection between trauma and health and TIC principles. A facilitated small-group discussion allowed students to apply TIC principles to a patient case, followed by reflection and evaluation. RESULTS: The overall rating of the TIC symposium was 4 out of 5. Strengths included integration of a small-group case with discussion on application of TIC in practice, experience of the lecturers and small-group facilitators, and review of research relating adversity to specific health outcomes. Suggestions for improvement included incorporating role-play and standardized patients. Content analysis of student reflections mapped to the domains of physician competency.

While many surveys have been conducted, most are focused on drinking changes in the general population and validation with biological markers is lacking. METHOD: We performed a retrospective cohort study among patients with AUD attending a urine drug screening program. With mixed-effects logistic regression models, we assessed the probability of screening positive for ethyl glucuronide according to patients' main clinical characteristics and time of analysis (either prior to or after a lockdown was implemented in Spain). RESULTS: A total of 362 patients provided 2,040 urine samples (1,295 prior to lockdown, 745 during lockdown). The mean age of participants was 52.0 years (SD 12.6), and 69.2% were men. Of the 43% of patients tested for other drugs 22% screened positive. After adjusting for all covariates, the odds of screening positive for ethyl glucuronide during lockdown almost doubled (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.33, p = 0.008).

Due to its high prevalence and dependence upon patient self-management strategies, osteoarthritis is one musculoskeletal condition which may benefit from such approaches. This is particularly pertinent due to the increasing use of remote monitoring technologies to collect patient data and facilitate self-management in individuals outside of hospital clinics. In practice however, application of digital behaviour change interventions is difficult due to insufficient reporting of behaviour change theories in the current literature. When digital technologies are employed to alter behaviour change in osteoarthritis, they often focus on physical activity. Currently, such interventions focus of self-efficacy but do not often explicitly report the behaviour change techniques they use to facilitate these changes. METHODS: This paper proposes a new model of integrating specific behaviour change principles (persuasive design) in an integrated model of remote monitoring and digital behaviour change interventions for osteoarthritis. RESULTS: There is potential to combine remote monitoring systems of patient data through digital and mobile technologies with behaviour change principles to improve physical activity behaviours in individuals with osteoarthritis. The use of persuasive design principles (e.g. prompts or nudges) through mobile notifications and strategic system design can be directed to enhance behaviour change. A validated measure of behaviour change, such as the patient activation measure, will allow effective evaluation of such systems. CONCLUSIONS: Digital behaviour change interventions should be directed towards the underlying principles of behaviour change they employ, although this is not commonly reported in practice. Such interventions can be integrated within remote monitoring pathways using persuasive design techniques to enhance patient activation. This approach can enhance self-management in individuals with musculoskeletal conditions, such as osteoarthritis.","output":"A model of integrated remote monitoring and behaviour change for osteoarthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a rare case of mesenteric venous infarction in a 36-year-old man due to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).

METHODS In this work, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network-based method to efficiently recover undistorted images (ReUINet) for real-time image guidance. The ReUINet, based on the encoder-decoder structure, was created to learn the relationship between the undistorted images and distorted images. The ReUINet was pre-trained and tested on a publically available brain MR image dataset acquired from 23 volunteers. Then, transfer-learning was adopted to implement the pre-trained model (i.e., network with optimal weights) on the experimental 3D grid phantom and in-vivo pelvis image datasets acquired from the 1.0 T Australian MRI-Linac system. RESULTS Evaluations on the phantom (768 slices) and pelvis data (88 slices) showed that the ReUINet achieved over 15-times and 45-times improvement on computational efficiency in comparison with standard interpolation and GNL-encoding methods, respectively. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrated that the ReUINet provided better correction results than the standard interpolation method, and comparable performance compared to the GNL-encoding approach.

Results Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 replicates in vitro in bacterial growth medium, that the viral replication follows bacterial growth and it is influenced by the administration of specific antibiotics. SARS-CoV-2-related peptides have been detected in 30-day bacterial cultures and characterised. Discussion Our observations are compatible with a 'bacteriophage-like' behaviour of SARS-CoV-2, which, to our knowledge has not been observed or described before. These results are unexpected and hint towards a novel hypothesis on the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and on the COVID-19 epidemiology. The discovery of possible new modes of action of SARS-CoV-2 has far-reaching implications for the prevention and the treatment of the disease.","output":"Increase of SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in faecal samples prompts for rethinking of SARS-CoV-2 biology and COVID-19 epidemiology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative viral pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), appears to have various clinical presentations and may result in severe respiratory failure.

The enhancement of SOT efficiency and reduction of power consumption are key points for the implementation of high-performance SOT devices, which strongly rely on the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength and magnetic properties of ferromagnetic/non-magnetic heterostructures. Recently, van der Waals-layered materials have shown appealing properties for use in efficient SOT applications. On the one hand, transition-metal dichalcogenides, topological insulators, and graphene-based heterostructures possess appreciable SOC strength. This feature can efficiently converse the charge current into spin current and result in large SOT. On the other hand, the newly discovered layered magnetic materials provide ultra-thin and gate-tunable ferromagnetic candidates for high-performance SOT devices. In this review, the latest advancements of SOT research in various layered materials are summarized. First, a brief introduction of SOT is given.

We used content analysis to categorize participants' written comments and explored the extent to which the identified categories mapped onto theoretical conceptualizations of influences on awareness of age-related change (AARC). DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. PARTICIPANTS: The study sample comprised 609 UK individuals aged 50 years or over (mean (SD) age = 67.9 (7.6) years), enrolled in the PROTECT study. MEASUREMENTS: Between January and March 2019, participants provided demographic information, completed a questionnaire assessing awareness of age-related change (AARC-10 SF), and responded to an open-ended question asking them to comment on their responses. RESULTS: While some of the emerging categories were in line with the existing conceptual framework of AARC (e.g. experiencing negative changes and attitudes toward aging), others were novel (e.g. engagement in purposeful activities or in activities that distract from age-related thoughts). Analysis revealed some of the thought processes involved in selecting responses to the questionnaire items, demonstrating different ways in which people make sense of specific items. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the ability of the AARC questionnaire to capture perceived age-related changes in cognitive functioning, physical and mental health, and engagement in social activities and in healthy and adaptive behaviors. However, findings also suggest ways of enriching the theoretical conceptualization of how AARC develops and offer insights into interpretation of responses to measures of AARC.","output":"Exploring awareness of age-related changes among over 50s in the UK: findings from the PROTECT study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With a sample of 4,646 undergraduate students from four universities in China, this study examined the psychometric qualities of a newly-adapted measurement, namely, the Online Motivation and Engagement Scale for university and college students, and investigated the characteristics of and differences in Chinese students motivation and engagement in emergent online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study determined the existence and effect of vertical programs on disease surveillance and response in Nigeria. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 14 State epidemiologists and Disease Notification Surveillance Officers (DSNOs) in 12 states located within the 6 geopolitical zones in Nigeria. Data was collected using mailed electronic semi-structured self-administered questionnaires. Response rate was 33.3%. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: Half of the respondents were males (50.0%) and State epidemiologists (50.0%). Malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and other diseases were ongoing vertical programs in the States surveyed. In over 90% of cases, vertical programs had different personnel, communication channels and supportive supervision processes different from the IDSR system. Although less than 50% acknowledged the existence of a forum for data harmonization, this forum was ineffectively utilized in 83.3% of cases. Specific disease funding was higher than that of IDSR (92.9%) and only 42.9% reported funding for IDSR activities from development partners in the State. Poor data management, low priority on IDSR priority diseases, and donor-driven programming were major negative effects of vertical programs. Improved funding, political ownership, and integration were major recommendations preferred by the respondents. CONCLUSION: We found that vertical programs in the surveyed States in the Nigerian health system led to duplication of efforts, inequitable funding, and inefficiencies in surveillance.

The short GDS versions that have four (GDS-4) and five items (GDS-5) represent alternatives for depression screening in limited-resource settings. However, their accuracy remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of the GDS-4 and GDS-5 versions for depression screening in older adults. METHODS: Until May 2020, we systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Google Scholar; for studies that have assessed the sensitivity and specificity of GDS-4 and GDS-5 for depression screening in older adults. We conducted meta-analyses of the sensitivity and specificity of those studies that used the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) as reference standard. Study quality was assessed with the QUADAS-2 tool. We performed bivariate random-effects meta-analyses to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) at each reported common cut-off. For the overall meta-analyses, we evaluated each GDS-4 version or GDS-5 version separately by each cut-off, and for investigations of heterogeneity, we assessed altogether across similar GDS versions by each cut-off. Also, we assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE methodology. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were included and meta-analyzed, assessing eleven different GDS versions. The number of participants included was 5048. When including all versions together, at a cut-off 2, GDS-4 had a pooled sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.70C0.82) and a pooled specificity of 0.75 (0.68C0.81); while GDS-5 had a pooled sensitivity of 0.85 (0.80C0.90) and a pooled specificity of 0.75 (0.69C0.81). We found results for more than one GDS-4 version at cut-off points 1, 2, and 3; and for more than one GDS-5 version at cut-off points 1, 2, 3, and 4. Mostly, significant subgroup differences at different test thresholds across versions were found. The accuracy of the different GDS-4 and GDS-5 versions showed a high heterogeneity. There was high risk of bias in the index test domain. Also, the certainty of the evidence was low or very low for most of the GDS versions. CONCLUSIONS: We found several GDS-4 and GDS-5 versions that showed great heterogeneity in estimates of sensitivity and specificity, mostly with a low or very low certainty of the evidence. Altogether, our results indicate the need for more well-designed studies that compare different GDS versions.","output":"Accuracy of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)-4 and GDS-5 for the screening of depression among older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surgical practice during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed significantly, without supporting data.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a predicting marker of severe COVID-19 cases under the resource-constrained setting. Methods & Materials This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among the purposively selected 71 COVID-19 patients admitted to the COVID hospital of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) from March 2021 to May 2021. The study population was grouped into mild to moderate COVID-19 (n=25) and Severe COVID-19 (n=46) patients based on the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 disease severity classification. The predictive performance of the NLR for the assessment of severity in the COVID-19 population was determined by generating receiver operative characteristics (ROC) curves to obtain the best cut-off value. Results Among the study populations, none of the studied laboratory parameters was found to significantly varied between the mild to moderate and severe COVID-19 patients group except NLR. NLR values in severe COVID-19 patients (median: 12.57, IQR:3.79-18.6) were found significantly higher (P<0.01) than that of the mild to moderate COVID-19 group (median: 3.45; IQR: 2.71-8.16).

METHODS: A scan was performed of provincial and territorial reporting of five data elements (cumulative totals of tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and population size) across three units of aggregation (province or territory level, health regions, and local areas) (15 overall indicators), and for four vulnerable settings (long-term care and detention facilities, schools, and homeless shelters) and eight social markers (age, sex, immigration status, race/ethnicity, healthcare worker status, occupational sector, income, and education) (180 equity-related indicators) as of December 31, 2020. Per indicator, one point was awarded if case-delimited data were released, 0.7 points if only summary statistics were reported, and 0 if neither was provided. Results were presented using a scorecard approach. RESULTS: Overall, information was more complete for cases and deaths than for tests, hospitalizations, and population size denominators needed for rate estimation. Information provided on jurisdictions and their regions, overall, tended to be more available (average score of 58%, D) than that for equity-related indicators (average score of 17%, F). Only British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario provided case-delimited data, with Ontario and Alberta providing case information for local areas. No jurisdiction reported on outcomes according to patients immigration status, race/ethnicity, income, or education. Though several provinces reported on cases in long-term care facilities, only Ontario and Quebec provided detailed information for detention facilities and schools, and only Ontario reported on cases within homeless shelters and across occupational sectors. CONCLUSION: One year into the pandemic, socially stratified reporting for COVID-19 outcomes remains sparse in Canada. However, several best practices in health equity-oriented reporting were observed and set a relevant precedent for all jurisdictions to follow for this pandemic and future ones.

In NLR resistance genes, the toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-NB-LRRs (TNLs) are an important subfamily out of which approximately half members carry a post-LRR (PL) domain of unknown role. We first investigated the requirement of the PL domain for TNL-mediated immune response by mutating the most conserved amino acids across PL domains of Arabidopsis thaliana TNLs. We identified several amino acids in the PL domain of RPS4 required for its ability to trigger a hypersensitive response to AvrRps4 in N. tabacum transient assay. Mutating the corresponding amino acids within the PL domain of the tobacco TNL gene N also affected its function. Consequently, our results indicate that the integrity of the PL domain at conserved positions is crucial for at least two unrelated TNLs. We then tested the PL domain specificity for function by swapping PL domains between the paralogs RPS4 and RPS4B. Our results suggest that the PL domain is involved in their TNL pair specificity, 'off state' stability and NLR complex activation. Considering genetically paired Arabidopsis TNLs, we finally compared the PL and TIR domains of their sensor and executor sequences, respectively. While TIR and PL domains from executors present complete motifs, sensors showed a lack of conservation with degenerated motifs. We provide here a first contribution to the functional analysis of the PL domain in order to decipher its role for TNLs' function.","output":"Integrity of the post-LRR domain is required for TNLs' function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper uses a robust method of spatial epidemiological analysis to assess the spatial growth rate of multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the local authority areas of England, September 2020-December 2021. Using the genomic surveillance records of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium, the analysis identifies a substantial (7.6-fold) difference in the average rate of spatial growth of 37 sample lineages, from the slowest (Delta AY.4.3) to the fastest (Omicron BA.1). Spatial growth of the Omicron (B.1.1.529 and BA) variant was found to be 2.81x faster than the Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY) variant and 3.76x faster than the Alpha (B.1.1.7 and Q) variant. In addition to AY.4.2 (a designated variant under investigation, VUI-21OCT-01), three Delta sublineages (AY.43, AY.98 and AY.120) were found to display a statistically faster rate of spatial growth than the parent lineage and would seem to merit further investigation. We suggest that the monitoring of spatial growth rates is a potentially valuable adjunct to routine assessments of the growth of emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages in a defined population.","output":"Spatial Growth Rate of Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Lineages in England, September 2020-December 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"General visualization recommendation systems typically make design decisions of the dataset automatically. However, most of them can only prune meaningless visualizations but fail to recommend targeted results. This paper contributes TaskVis, a task-oriented visualization recommendation system that allows users to select their tasks precisely on the interface. We first summarize a task base with 18 classical analytic tasks by a survey both in academia and industry. On this basis, we maintain a rule base, which extends empirical wisdom with our targeted modeling of the analytic tasks. Then, our rule-based approach enumerates all the candidate visualizations through answer set programming. After that, the generated charts can be ranked by four ranking schemes. Furthermore, we introduce combination recommendation, leveraging a set of visualizations to give a brief view of the dataset collaboratively. Finally, we evaluate TaskVis through a series of use cases and a user study.","output":"Visual Data Analysis with Task-based Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Low barrier addiction clinics increase access to medications to treat substance use disorders, while emphasizing harm reduction The Harm Reduction and BRidges to Care (HRBR) Clinic is an on demand, low barrier addiction clinic that opened in October 2019 In the first three months of operation (November through January 2020), HRBR saw steadily increasing numbers of patients Oregon saw its first case of novel coronavirus in February, and declared a state of emergency and enacted a formal Stay at Home order in March That same month, the DEA announced that patients could be initiated on buprenorphine through telemedicine visits without an in-person exam Within a week of being granted the ability to see patients virtually, HRBR had transitioned to over 90% virtual visits, while still allowing patients without technology to access in-person care Within four weeks, the clinic expanded hours significantly, established workflows with community harm reduction partners, and was caring for patients in rural areas of the state In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the HRBR clinic was able to quickly transition from in-person to almost completely virtual visits within a week This rapid pivot to telemedicine significantly increased access to care for individuals seeking low-threshold treatment in multiple contexts Overarching institutional support, grant funding and a small flexible team were critical HRBR's increased access and capacity were only possible with the Drug Enforcement Agency loosening restrictions around the use of telehealth for new patients Keeping these altered regulations in place will be key to improving health and health care equity for people who use drugs, even after the pandemic subsides Further research is needed in to whether addiction telemedicine impacts medication diversion rates, continued substance use, or provider practices","output":"Low-barrier buprenorphine during the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid transition to on-demand telemedicine with wide-ranging effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes mellitus represents one of the most widespread diseases in civilization nowadays. Since the costs for treating and diagnosing of diabetes represent several billions of dollars per year, a cheap, fast, and simple sensor for diabetes diagnosis is needed. Electrochemical insulin sensors can be considered as a novel approach for diabetes diagnosis. In this study, carbon electrode with electrodeposited NiO nanoparticles was selected as a suitable electrode material for insulin determination. The morphology and surface composition were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). For a better understanding of insulin determination on NiO-modified electrodes, the mechanism of electrochemical reaction and the kinetic parameters were studied. They were calculated from both voltammetric and amperometric measurements. The modified carbon electrode displayed a wide linear range from 600 nM to 10 M, a low limit of detection of 19.6 nM, and a high sensitivity of 7.06 A/M. The electrodes were stable for 30 cycles and were able to detect insulin even in bovine blood serum. Additionally, the temperature stability of this electrode and its storage conditions were studied with appropriate outcomes. The above results show the high promise of this electrode for detecting insulin in clinical samples.","output":"NiO Nanoparticles for Electrochemical Insulin Detection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 32 hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 to clarify the epidemiological characteristics of this special population. METHOD: The data of 32 hemodialysis patients with COVID-19, including epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological, were collected from the Blood Purification Department of Wuhan Fourth Hospital from February 3 to 16, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 32 patients, 23 were male, and the median age was 58 years; the median dialysis vintage was 33 months. Two groups were divided according to the patients primary renal disease: group 1 (16 patients with diabetic nephropathy), group 2 (12 patients with primary glomerulonephritis, 2 with obstructive kidney disease, 1 with hypertensive renal damage, and 1 with polycystic kidney). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in epidemiological characteristics, blood cell counts, and radiological performance. Hemodialysis patients are susceptible to COVID-19 at all ages, and patients with diabetes may be a high-risk population (50%). Common symptoms included fever (15 cases), cough (21 cases), and fatigue (7 cases). The blood lymphocyte count decreased in 84.6% of the patients (median: 0.765  10(9)/L). Chest CT revealed ground-glass-like lesions in 18 cases, unilateral lung patchiness in 7 cases, bilateral lung patchiness in 7 cases, and pleural effusion in 2 cases. CONCLUSION: Only 46.875% of the hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 had fever in the early stage; and diabetics may be the most susceptible population. A decrease in blood lymphocyte count and ground-glass opacity on chest CT scan is beneficial in identifying the high-risk population.","output":"Clinical features of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19: a single-center retrospective study on 32 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Our aim was to describe the electrocardiographic features of critical COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We carried out a multicentric, cross-sectional, retrospective analysis of 431 consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized between 10 March and 14 April 2020 who died or were treated with invasive mechanical ventilation. This project is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT04367129). Standard ECG was recorded at hospital admission. ECG was abnormal in 93% of the patients. Atrial fibrillation/flutter was detected in 22% of the patients. ECG signs suggesting acute right ventricular pressure overload (RVPO) were detected in 30% of the patients. In particular, 43 (10%) patients had the S1Q3T3 pattern, 38 (9%) had incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB), and 49 (11%) had complete RBBB. ECG signs of acute RVPO were not statistically different between patients with (n = 104) or without (n=327) invasive mechanical ventilation during ECG recording (36% vs. 28%, P = 0.10). Non-specific repolarization abnormalities and low QRS voltage in peripheral leads were present in 176 (41%) and 23 (5%), respectively. In four patients showing ST-segment elevation, acute myocardial infarction was confirmed with coronary angiography. No ST-T abnormalities suggestive of acute myocarditis were detected. In the subgroup of 110 patients where high-sensitivity troponin I was available, ECG features were not statistically different when stratified for above or below the 5 times upper reference limit value. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG is abnormal in almost all critically ill COVID-19 patients and shows a large spectrum of abnormalities, with signs of acute RVPO in 30% of the patients. Rapid and simple identification of these cases with ECG at hospital admission can facilitate classification of the patients and provide pathophysiological insights.","output":"Electrocardiographic features of 431 consecutive, critically ill COVID-19 patients: an insight into the mechanisms of cardiac involvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a common and ubiquitous human-restricted pathogen, causes a primary infection (varicella or chickenpox) followed by establishment of latency in sensory ganglia. The virus can reactivate, causing herpes zoster (HZ, shingles) and leading to significant morbidity but rarely mortality, although in immunocompromised hosts, VZV can cause severe disseminated and occasionally fatal disease. We discuss VZV diseases and the decrease in their incidence due to the introduction of live-attenuated vaccines to prevent varicella or HZ. We also focus on acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir (FDA approved drugs to treat VZV infections), brivudine (used in some European countries) and amenamevir (a helicase-primase inhibitor, approved in Japan) that augur the beginning of a new era of anti-VZV therapy. Valnivudine hydrochloride (FV-100) and valomaciclovir stearate (in advanced stage of development) and several new molecules potentially good as anti-VZV candidates described during the last year are examined. We reflect on the role of antiviral agents in the treatment of VZV-associated diseases, as a large percentage of the at-risk population is not immunized, and on the limitations of currently FDA-approved anti-VZV drugs. Their low efficacy in controlling HZ pain and post-herpetic neuralgia development, and the need of multiple dosing regimens requiring daily dose adaptation for patients with renal failure urges the development of novel anti-VZV drugs.","output":"Advances and Perspectives in the Management of Varicella-Zoster Virus Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A dinamica de circula??o do vrus da dengue em espa?os intra-urbanos de grandes metrpoles e os fatores de risco para esta infec??o ainda n?o s?o bem conhecidos.

The government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, limiting movement of people as a preventive measure. This survey was designed and conducted during the lockdown period to assess its effect on ophthalmic practice and patient care in India. Methods: An online survey was sent across to practicing Indian ophthalmologists across through various social media platforms. All valid responses were tabulated and analyzed. Results: A total of 1260 ophthalmologists responded to the survey. Most of the respondents (775/1260; 61.5%) were in private practice and 14.8% (187/1260) were affiliated to ophthalmic institutes. At the time of taking the survey, 72.5% of the respondents (913/1260) were not seeing any patients due to the lockdown. Of those who were still examining patients, 82.9% (287/347) were only seeing emergency cases, based on their own clinical judgement. The proportion of ophthalmologists in ophthalmic institutes, government and municipal hospitals (126/253;49.8%) who were still seeing patients was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than those in private practice (174/775;22.4%). Apart from emergencies such as trauma, retinal detachment, and endophthalmitis (81.8%), other surgeries that were still being performed included intravitreal injections (9.1%) and cataract surgeries (5.9%). Approximately, 77.5% (976/1260) of the respondents had begun telephonic/e-mail/video consultations or consultations over social media applications since the lockdown began. In addition, 59.1% (745/1260) felt that ophthalmologists were potentially at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to other specialties while examining patients. When asked about the resumption of practice upon easing off of the restrictions, 57.8% (728/1260) of the respondents said they were unsure of when to resume elective surgeries; furthermore, 62.8% (791/1260) were unsure about the preferred screening strategy or precautionary approach prior to resuming surgeries and were awaiting guidelines. Conclusion: Our survey shows that majority of ophthalmologists in India were not seeing patients during the COVID-19 lockdown, with near-total cessation of elective surgeries. Emergency services were still being attended to by 27.5% of ophthalmologists who responded. A large proportions of ophthalmologists had switched over to telephonic advice or other forms of telemedicine to assist patients. Most of the responding ophthalmologists were unclear about when and how to resume surgeries upon easing off of the COVID-19 related restrictions. Regulatory bodies should take note of this and issue appropriate guidelines regarding the same.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 related lockdown on ophthalmic practice and patient care in India: Results of a survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are major public health issues that disproportionately affect minority communities, including Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPI).

In recent decades, the growing interest in mitochondria research has revealed that these multifunctional organelles are more than just the cell powerhouses, playing many other key roles as signaling platforms that regulate cell metabolism, proliferation, death and immunological response. As key regulators, mitochondria, when dysfunctional, are involved in the pathogenesis of a wide range of metabolic, neurodegenerative, immune and neoplastic disorders. Far more recently, mitochondria attracted renewed attention from the scientific community for their ability of intercellular translocation that can involve whole mitochondria, mitochondrial genome or other mitochondrial components. The intercellular transport of mitochondria, defined as horizontal mitochondrial transfer, can occur in mammalian cells both in vitro and in vivo, and in physiological and pathological conditions. Mitochondrial transfer can provide an exogenous mitochondrial source, replenishing dysfunctional mitochondria, thereby improving mitochondrial faults or, as in in the case of tumor cells, changing their functional skills and response to chemotherapy. In this review, we will provide an overview of the state of the art of the up-to-date knowledge on intercellular trafficking of mitochondria by discussing its biological relevance, mode and mechanisms underlying the process and its involvement in different pathophysiological contexts, highlighting its therapeutic potential for diseases with mitochondrial dysfunction primarily involved in their pathogenesis.","output":"Mitochondria Can Cross Cell Boundaries: An Overview of the Biological Relevance, Pathophysiological Implications and Therapeutic Perspectives of Intercellular Mitochondrial Transfer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spatiotemporal bias in genome sampling can severely confound discrete trait phylogeographic inference.

We demonstrate that including travel history data yields i) more realistic hypotheses of virus spread and ii) higher posterior predictive accuracy compared to including only sampling location. We further explore methods to ameliorate the impact of sampling bias by augmenting the phylogeographic analysis with lineages from undersampled locations. Our reconstructions reinforce specific transmission hypotheses suggested by the inclusion of travel history data, but also suggest alternative routes of virus migration that are plausible within the epidemiological context but are not apparent with current sampling efforts.","output":"Accommodating individual travel history and unsampled diversity in Bayesian phylogeographic inference of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Although Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children, the currently used diagnostic methods are not optimal. Proteomics is increasingly being used to study the biomarkers of infectious diseases. Methods: Label-free quantitative proteomics and liquid chromatography-mass/mass spectrometry were used to analyze the fold change of protein expression in plasma of children with MP pneumonia (MPP), infectious disease control (IDC), and healthy control (HC) groups. Selected proteins that can distinguish MPP from HC and IDC were further validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: After multivariate analyses, 27 potential plasma biomarkers were identified to be expressed differently among child MPP, HC, and IDC groups. Among these proteins, SERPINA3, APOC1, ANXA6, KNTC1, and CFLAR were selected for ELISA verification. SERPINA3, APOC1, and CFLAR levels were significantly different among the three groups and the ratios were consistent with the trends of proteomics results. A comparison of MPP patients and HC showed APOC1 had the largest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.853, with 77.6% sensitivity and 81.1% specificity.

Enzymes catalyze biological reactions with a very high degree of specificity. Examples include the horseradish peroxidase, lactate, glucose, and cholesterol oxidases. For this reason, many industrial uses of enzymes outside their natural environments have been developed. Similar to enzymes, many industrial applications of nanozymes have been developed and used. Unlike the enzymes, however, nanozymes are cost-effectively prepared, purified, stored, and reproducibly and repeatedly used for long periods of time. The detection and identification of pathogens is among some of the reported applications of nanozymes. Three of the methodologic milestones in the evolution of pathogen detection and identification include the incubation and growth, immunoassays and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategies. Although advances in the history of pathogen detection and identification have given rise to novel methods and devices, these are still short of the response speed, accuracy and cost required for point-of-care use. Debuting recently, nanozymology offers significant improvements in the six methodological indicators that are proposed as being key in this review, including simplicity, sensitivity, speed of response, cost, reliability, and durability of the immunoassays and PCR strategies. This review will focus on the applications of nanozymes in the detection and identification of pathogens in samples obtained from foods, natural, and clinical sources. It will highlight the impact of nanozymes in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent and PCR strategies by discussing the mechanistic improvements and the role of the design and architecture of the nanozyme nanoconjugates. Because of their contribution to world health burden, the three most important pathogens that will be considered include viruses, bacteria and fungi. Although not quite seen as pathogens, the review will also consider the detection of cancer cells and helminth parasites. The review leaves very little doubt that nanozymology has introduced remarkable advances in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and PCR strategies for detecting these five classes of pathogens. However, a gap still exists in the application of nanozymes to detect and identify fungal pathogens directly, although indirect strategies in which nanozymes are used have been reported. From a mechanistic point of view, the nanozyme technology transfer to laboratory research methods in PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies, and the point-of-care devices such as electronic biosensors and lateral flow detection strips, that is currently taking place, is most likely to give rise to no small revolution in each of the six methodological indicators for pathogen detection and identification. While the evidence of widespread research reports, clinical trials and point-of-care device patents support this view, the gaps that still exist point to a need for more basic research studies to be conducted on the applications of nanozymology in pathogen detection and identification. The multidisciplinary nature of the research on the application of nanozymes in the detection and identification of pathogens requires chemists and physicists for the design, fabrication, and characterization of nanozymes; microbiologists for the design, testing and analysis of the methodologies, and clinicians or clinical researchers for the evaluation of the methodologies and devices in the clinic. Many reports have also implicated required skills in mathematical modelling, and electronic engineering. While the review will conclude with a synopsis of the impact of nanozymology on the detection and identification of viruses, bacteria, fungi, cancer cells, and helminths, it will also point out opportunities that exist in basic research as well as opportunities for innovation aimed at novel laboratory methodologies and devices. In this regard there is no doubt that there are numerous unexplored research areas in the application of nanozymes for the detection of pathogens. For example, most research on the applications of nanozymes for the detection and identification of fungi is so far limited only to the detection of mycotoxins and other chemical compounds associated with fungal infection. Therefore, there is scope for exploration of the application of nanozymes in the direct detection of fungi in foods, especially in the agricultural production thereof. Many fungal species found in seeds severely compromise their use by inactivating the germination thereof. Fungi also produce mycotoxins that can severely compromise the health of humans if consumed.","output":"Applications of Nanozymology in the Detection and Identification of Viral, Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The demand for rapid and simple development of a vaccine against a newly emerging infectious disease is increasing worldwide. We previously revealed that UV-inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virions (UV-V) elicited high levels of humoral immunity and a weak Th0 response in mice immunized subcutaneously. To ensure the safety of such a whole inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine, we additionally treated the UV-V vaccine with formalin, resulting in the UV-F-V vaccine. Analysis of the immunogenicity of the UV-F-V+alum vaccine in mice revealed that it generated comparable neutralizing serum anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody levels as the UV-V+alum vaccine. Moreover, both vaccines induced similar frequencies of anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody-producing cells in bone marrow. Interestingly, the UV-F-V vaccine induced fewer IgG(2a) subtype antibodies and higher interleukin-4 production in vaccinated mice than did UV-V. Thus, UV-F-V imposes a Th2-type bias on the immune response, unlike UV-V.

Livestock traders play an important role in this process, yet there is little knowledge of traders perceptions of animal disease or their associated actions. The aim of this study was to investigate perceptions and practices of Zambian small ruminant traders with regard to sheep and goat health and disease. It also analysed how existing perceptions and practices might affect risks of disease transmission through trade. A case study was performed at the two largest small livestock markets in Zambia: the Lusaka market in the capital and the Kasumbalesa market near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. Semi-structured interviews with 47 traders performed in April-May and September 2018 represent the core material. Zambian small ruminant traders frequently trade animals that have clinical signs of disease, either because they appear unaware or indifferent to the associated risks, experience financial constraints or assign responsibility for disease prevention to other value chain actors. In their decision about whether or not to sell a visibly sick small ruminant, traders appear to consider whether the clinical sign is perceived as natural or the result of an illness, whether the buyer is aware of the animals health condition, and whether the animal is sold for consumption or breeding purposes. Traders appear to regard the veterinary certificate required to transport small ruminants in Zambia as proof of health, placing the responsibility for potential disease in traded animals on the veterinary authorities. In their description of a model trader, taking good care of and being sensitive to customer needs was emphasized, indicating that an efficient way to encourage traders to change their behaviour is to influence customer demands. In contrast to the focus in previous studies on identifying and filling knowledge gaps, the present study show that lack of knowledge is not central to why traders engage in disease-transmitting behaviour. Greater awareness of other reasons for certain perceptions and practices could lead to the formulation of risk communication strategies and mitigation measures that are relevant for the local context, as well as alternative strategies for changing trader behaviour.","output":"Perceptions and practices among Zambian sheep and goat traders concerning small ruminant health and disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: A novel type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for an unprecedented pandemic with profound socioeconomic consequences. Owing to its recent discovery, the virus that emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 still represents a great unknown to researchers. This study aims to establish the spatio-temporal associations of the incidence, mortality, and the rate of both rapid and RT-PCR tests in Minas Gerais. Methods: This is a quantitative analysis of secondary data based on a cross-sectional research design. Incidence, mortality, date of the first notification of COVID-19 and number of rapid and RT-PCR tests were obtained from the sources: Laboratory Environment Manager, e-SUS epidemiological surveillance platform and SES-MG. Pearson coefficient for correlation was calculated to establish the level of association between the relevant data. Descriptive statistical procedures were used to provide a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of incidence, mortality and test rates in the territory. Results: Positive correlations were found between the rate of rapid tests and incidence;rate of RT-PCR tests and incidence/mortality. At the municipal level, incidence, mortality, rate of rapid tests and RT-PCR revealed a negative correlation with days elapsed since the First Notified Case. The same effect occurs, at different intensities, at the level of health macro-regions. Discussion: The heterogeneity of the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in the territory of Minas Gerais, as well as the rate of tests (rapid and RT-PCR) may be caused, in part, due to the different dates of introduction of the virus in the municipalities/macro-regions. It is speculated that this phenomenon occurs due to the dynamics of regional and inter-regional flows of people.","output":"Analysis of the spatial-temporal dynamics of incidence, mortality and test rates (rapid and RT-PCR) of COVID-19 in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil (preprint)/ pt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The role of humoral immunity in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not fully understood owing, in large part, to the complexity of antibodies produced in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is a pressing need for serology tests to assess patient-specific antibody response and predict clinical outcome. METHODS: Using SARS-CoV-2 proteome and peptide microarrays, we screened 146 COVID-19 patients plasma samples to identify antigens and epitopes. This enabled us to develop a master epitope array and an epitope-specific agglutination assay to gauge antibody responses systematically and with high resolution. RESULTS: We identified linear epitopes from the Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) protein and showed that the epitopes enabled higher resolution antibody profiling than the S or N protein antigen. Specifically, we found that antibody responses to the S(811-825), S(881-895) and N(156-170) epitopes negatively or positively correlated with clinical severity or patient survival. Moreover, we found that the P681H and S235F mutations associated with the coronavirus variant of concern B.1.1.7 altered the specificity of the corresponding epitopes. CONCLUSIONS: Epitope-resolved antibody testing not only affords a high-resolution alternative to conventional immunoassays to delineate the complex humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and differentiate between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, it may potentially be used to predict clinical outcome. The epitope peptides can be readily modified to detect antibodies against variants of concern (VOC) in both the peptide array and latex agglutination formats.

We aimed to explore the feasibility and molecular mechanisms of RS against COVID-19, to provide a reference for basic research and clinical applications.Methodology. Through literature mining, it is found that a Chinese herbal pair, RS, has potential anti-COVID-19 activity. In this study, we analysed the feasibility of RS against COVID-19 by high-throughput molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, we predicted the molecular mechanisms of RS against COVID-19 based on network pharmacology.Results. We proved the feasibility of RS anti-COVID-19 by literature mining, virtual docking and molecular dynamics simulations, and found that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and 3C-like protease (3 CL pro) were also two critical targets for RS against COVID-19. In addition, we predicted the molecular mechanisms of RS in the treatment of COVID-19, and identified 29 main ingredients, 21 potential targets and 16 signalling pathways. Rhein, eupatin, (-)-catechin, aloe-emodin may be important active ingredients in RS. ALB, ESR1, EGFR, HMOX1, CTSL, and RHOA may be important targets against COVID-19.

We present the most recent approaches for their isolation and characterization and elaborate on the emerging mathematical and computational models for studying the roles of these cell-released cancer biomarkers in cancer progression. We envision that the study of these new models and technologies could significantly contribute to the field of personalized medicine. ABSTRACT: During cancer progression, tumors shed different biomarkers into the bloodstream, including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), extracellular vesicles (EVs), circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). The analysis of these biomarkers in the blood, known as liquid biopsy (LB), is a promising approach for early cancer detection and treatment monitoring, and more recently, as a means for cancer therapy. Previous reviews have discussed the role of CTCs and ctDNA in cancer progression; however, ctDNA and EVs are rapidly evolving with technological advancements and computational analysis and are the subject of enormous recent studies in cancer biomarkers. In this review, first, we introduce these cell-released cancer biomarkers and briefly discuss their clinical significance in cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Second, we present conventional and novel approaches for the isolation, profiling, and characterization of these markers. We then investigate the mathematical and in silico models that are developed to investigate the function of ctDNA and EVs in cancer progression.

METHODS: Combinatorial gDNA and cDNA antibody libraries were constructed using the gDNAs and mRNAs isolated from uninfected and HIV-1-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All libraries were deep sequenced and sequences analysed using IMGT/HighV-QUEST software (http://imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/index.action).

Clinical trials have reported improved outcomes resulting from an effective reduction or absence of viral load when patients were treated with chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). In addition, the effects of these drugs were improved by simultaneous administration of azithromycin (AZM). The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds to the cell surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, allowing virus entry and replication in host cells. The viral main protease (Mpro) and host cathepsin L (CTSL) are among the proteolytic systems involved in SARS-CoV-2 S protein activation. Hence, molecular docking studies were performed to test the binding performance of these three drugs against four targets. The findings showed AZM affinity scores (&#916;G) with strong interactions with ACE2, CTSL, Mpro and RBD. CQ affinity scores showed three low-energy results (less negative) with ACE2, CTSL and RBD, and a firm bond score with Mpro. For HCQ, two results (ACE2 and Mpro) were firmly bound to the receptors, however CTSL and RBD showed low interaction energies. The differences in better interactions and affinity between HCQ and CQ with ACE2 and Mpro were probably due to structural differences between the drugs.

We aim to investigate, first, whether burnout levels have increased during the crisis and, second, whether burnout levels during the COVID-19 crisis depend on the threat of becoming ill, having to stay at home due to the lockdown, and/or having to file for bankruptcy due to the economic downturn. We do so using seven data sets of French entrepreneurs with a temporal comparison of averages and two data sets of French entrepreneurs with a cross-sectional analysis of individuals. Our findings show that indeed, the risks of burnout have increased during the pandemic and that the threat of bankruptcy is the dominant threat. As an increasing number of studies in the entrepreneurship literature indicate that entrepreneurs mental health influences their activities, as well as the growth and sustainability of their ventures, our study is important and timely in its contribution, as it takes a close look at the perception of burnout in general and more specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: The risk of burnout in French entrepreneurs has increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which calls for not only financial support but also other forms of support. The COVID-19 pandemic presents many threats for entrepreneurs since their business survival is often directly at stake. These threats are not just financial but also related to health, such as the threat of burnout. The findings of our study show that for French entrepreneurs, the threat of burnout increased after the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding raises the question whether this outcome is due to the threat to health, the effects of the lockdown, or the threat of bankruptcy. It appears that all three factors play important roles, although the financial threat is the dominant threat. These findings call for the extension of entrepreneurial support systems beyond the financial area by also involving an entrepreneurship care aspect, which includes telephone support, webinars, and mental help facilities.","output":"Risk of burnout in French entrepreneurs during the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While many studies have explored the financial barriers to healthcare, there is little evidence regarding the non-financial barriers to healthcare. This study identified characteristics associated with financial and non-financial barriers to healthcare and quantified the effects of these characteristics in South Korea, using a nationally representative longitudinal survey dataset. Overall, 68,930 observations of 16,535 individuals aged 19 years and above were sampled from Korea Health Panel survey data (2014C2018). From self-reported information about respondents' experiences of unmet healthcare needs, a trichotomous dependent variableno barrier, non-financial barrier, and financial barrierwas derived. Sociodemographics, physical and health conditions were included as explanatory variables. The average adjusted probability (AAP) of experiencing each barrier was predicted using multivariable and panel multinomial logistic regression analyses. According to the results, the percentage of people experiencing non-financial barriers was much higher than that of people experiencing financial barriers in 2018 (9.6 vs. 2.5%). Women showed higher AAPs of experiencing both non-financial (9.9 vs. 8.3%) and financial barriers (3.6 vs. 2.5%) than men. Men living in the Seoul metropolitan area showed higher AAPs of experiencing non-financial (8.7 vs. 8.0%) and financial barriers (3.4 vs. 2.1%) than those living outside it. Household income showed no significant associations in the AAP of experiencing a non-financial barrier. People with a functional limitation exhibited a higher AAP of experiencing a non-financial barrier, for both men (17.8 vs. 7.8%) and women (17.4 vs. 9.0%), than those without it. In conclusion, people in South Korea, like those in most European countries, fail to meet their healthcare needs more often due to non-financial barriers than financial barriers. In addition, the characteristics associated with non-financial barriers to healthcare differed from those associated with financial barriers. This finding suggests that although financial barriers may be minimised through various policies, a considerable degree of unmet healthcare needs and disparity among individuals is very likely to persist due to non-financial barriers. Therefore, current universal health insurance systems need targeted policy instruments to minimise non-financial barriers to healthcare to ensure effective universal health coverage.","output":"Characteristics Associated With Financial or Non-financial Barriers to Healthcare in a Universal Health Insurance System: A Longitudinal Analysis of Korea Health Panel Survey Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study determined the cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences of ferret (Mustela putorius furo) inflammatory cytokines, interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha.

METHODS: Thirty-nine patients admitted to the study hospital with confirmed COVID-19 who experienced various skin manifestations during hospitalization or in the convalescence period, were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with COVID-19, admitted to the study hospital between 23 March and 12 September 2020, had intra-infectious rash or lesions of cutaneous vasculitis during convalescence. The most common cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 were erythematous and erythematous papular rash. Twenty-seven of the 39 patients had anosmia (69.2%), 26 patients had ageusia (66.7%), 34 patients had pneumonia (87.2%) and 24 patients had intra-infectious enterocolitis (61.5%). Skin biopsies were rarely performed in these patients. This article reports the results of biopsies performed in two patients, showing histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in erythematous rash and erythema multiforme-like lesions. Both skin biopsies revealed early fibrous remodelling of the dermis, suggesting similarity with changes that occur in the lungs and other tissues in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Correlations between skin lesions and anosmia, ageusia and enteritis in patients with COVID-19 do not seem to be accidental, but are associated with a similar response to ACE2 receptor expression in these tissues.","output":"Cutaneous manifestations associated with anosmia, ageusia and enteritis in SARS-CoV-2 infection - A possible pattern?

If such a game has deterministic winning strategies, one may ask how simple such strategies can get. The answer may help with actual implementation, or to win despite imperfect information, or to conceal sensitive information especially if the game is repeated. Given a concurrent two-player win/lose game of infinite duration, this article considers equivalence relations over histories of played actions. A classical restriction used here is that equivalent histories have equal length, hence time awareness. A sufficient condition is given such that if a player has winning strategies, she has one that prescribes the same action at equivalent histories, hence uniformization. The proof is fairly constructive and preserves finiteness of strategy memory, and counterexamples show relative tightness of the result.

A large number of serologic tests, platforms, and methodologies are being employed to determine seroprevalence in populations to select convalescent plasma samples for therapeutic trials and to guide policies about reopening. However, the tests have substantial variations in sensitivity and specificity, and their ability to quantitatively predict levels of NAbs is unknown. We collected 370 unique donors enrolled in the New York Blood Center Convalescent Plasma Program between April and May of 2020. We measured levels of antibodies in convalescent plasma samples using commercially available SARS-CoV-2 detection tests and in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and correlated serological measurements with NAb activity measured using pseudotyped virus particles, which offer the most informative assessment of antiviral activity of patient sera against viral infection. Our data show that a large proportion of convalescent plasma samples have modest antibody levels and that commercially available tests have various degrees of accuracy in predicting NAb activity. We found that the Ortho anti-SARS-CoV-2 total Ig and IgG high-throughput serological assays (HTSAs) and the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay quantify levels of antibodies that strongly correlate with the results of NAb assays and are consistent with gold standard ELISA results. These findings provide immediate clinical relevance to serology results that can be equated to NAb activity and could serve as a valuable roadmap to guide the choice and interpretation of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Serological Assays Estimate Highly Variable SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibody Activity in Recovered COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we highlight recent findings on the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)/uPA receptor (uPAR) system that suggest its potential role as a main orchestrator of fatal progression to pulmonary, kidney, and heart failure in patients with coronavirus.

We report here an element of HLA class I homozygosity that may or may not help preserve its existence in populations but which could indicate a new avenue for antiviral research. METHODS: Lymphocytes from serologically HLA-homozygous or -heterozygous donors were examined for synthesis of influenza virus proteins and RNA after exposure to virus as peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The virus-exposed lymphocytes were also examined for internalization of the virus after exposure, and for susceptibility to virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in comparison with virus-exposed monocytes/macrophages and unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Results were compared using two-tailed Fishers exact test. RESULTS: Serologically-defined HLA-A2-homozygous lymphocytes, in contrast to heterozygous lymphocytes, did not synthesize detectable influenza virus RNA or protein after exposure to the virus. HLA-A2-homozygous lymphocytes, including both homozygous and heterozygous donors by genetic sequence subtyping, did internalize infectious virus but were not susceptible to lysis by autologous virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (fratricide). Similar intrinsic resistance to influenza virus infection was observed with HLA-A1- and HLA-A11-homozygous lymphocytes and with HLA-B-homozygous lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of individuals within a population that is characterized by common expression of HLA class I alleles may possess lymphocytes that are not susceptible to influenza virus infection and thus to mutual virus-specific lysis.

It is characterized by emotional exhaustion, cognitive weariness and physical fatigue, and it may occur in association with any occupation, but is most frequently observed among professionals who work directly with people, particularly in institutional settings. Healthcare professionals who work directly with patients and are frequently exposed to work overload and excessive clinical demands, to ethical dilemmas, to pressing occupational schedules and to managerial challenges; who have to make complex judgements and difficult decisions; and who have relatively little autonomy over their job-related tasks are at risk of developing clinical burnout. In turn, clinical burnout among clinicians has a negative impact on the quality and safety of treatment, and on the overall professional performance of healthcare systems. Healthcare workers with burnout are more likely to make mistakes and to be subjected to medical malpractice claims, than do those who are burnout-na?ve. Experiencing the emotional values of autonomy, competence and relatedness are essential work-related psychological needs, which have to be satisfied to promote feelings of self-realization and meaningfulness in relation to work activities, thus reducing burnout risk. Importantly, an autonomy-supportive rather than a controlling style of management decreases burnout risk and promotes self-actualization, self-esteem and a general feeling of well-being in both those in charge and in their subordinates. The purpose of this article is to discuss some of the elements constituting the burnout construct with the view of gaining a better understanding of the complex multifactorial nature of burnout. This may facilitate the development and implementation of both personal, behavioural and organizational interventions to deal with the burnout syndrome and its ramifications.","output":"The burnout construct with reference to healthcare providers: A narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To estimate in a real life setting, the vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital admission, and death among five priority groups for vaccination Design: Cohort study Setting: Roll-out of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in Denmark Participants: 864,096 individuals who were first inline to receive the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine: 46,101 long-term care facility (LTCF) residents, 61,805 individuals 65 years and older living at home but requiring practical help and personal care (65PHC), 98,533 individuals []85 years of age (+85), 425,799 health-care workers (HCWs), and 231,858 individuals with comorbidities that predispose for severe COVID-19 disease (SCD).

Future decision-making policies require consistent data on the management and prognosis of the older patients (> 70 years old) with COVID-19 admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Characteristics, management, and prognosis of critically ill old patients (> 70 years) were extracted from the international prospective COVID-ICU database. A propensity score weighted-comparison evaluated the impact of intubation upon admission on Day-90 mortality. RESULTS: The analysis included 1199 (28% of the COVID-ICU cohort) patients (median [interquartile] age 74 [72C78] years). Fifty-three percent, 31%, and 16% were 70C74, 75C79, and over 80 years old, respectively. The most frequent comorbidities were chronic hypertension (62%), diabetes (30%), and chronic respiratory disease (25%). Median Clinical Frailty Scale was 3 (2C3). Upon admission, the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio was 154 (105C222). 740 (62%) patients were intubated on Day-1 and eventually 938 (78%) during their ICU stay. Overall Day-90 mortality was 46% and reached 67% among the 193 patients over 80 years old. Mortality was higher in older patients, diabetics, and those with a lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio upon admission, cardiovascular dysfunction, and a shorter time between first symptoms and ICU admission.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the influence of mental health problems developed during the COVID-19 pandemic on the course of mastocytosis. Methods Mental health status in 60 adult patients with mastocytosis was prospectively evaluated with the total Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (tDASS-21) and Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in the lockdown period (LP) and the return to normal period (RTNP) during the pandemic. The disease course was assessed from emergency and outpatient medical reports, including Scoring Mastocytosis (SCORMA) index and serum baseline tryptase levels, by telephone interviews and clinical visits. Results The mean FCV-19S and median tDASS-21 scores were significantly higher in LP than RTNP (p<0.001) and there was a positive correlation between FCV-19S and tDASS-21 in LP (r=0.820, p<0.001) and in RTNP (r=0.572 p= <0.001). Disease-related symptoms including skin lesions, flushing and anaphylaxis attacks increased in 22 patients in LP, and in this group, mean FCV-19S and median tDASS-21 were higher than those without symptom exacerbation (p<0.001).

We evaluated the time-series relationships between EMS and ED billing data and syndromic surveillance and ED billing data by calculating cross-correlation functions, controlling for influences of autocorrelations.

METHODS: Data of 332 patients who were diagnosed and treated for breast cancer between December 2019 and November 2020 were evaluated retrospectively according to periods of pandemic. RESULTS: A significant decrease in the number of operations, especially upfront surgeries rather than surgeries after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, was detected in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was found that patients with complaints were mostly admitted during this period (p = 0.024). No statistical significance was found for age, sex, side of the tumor, type of tumor, surgery to breast, and axilla. Following the early period of the pandemic, it was observed that patients with mostly luminal, early-stage, and less axillary nodal involvement (p < 0.05) were admitted, and as a result, it was founded that upfront surgeries increased, although no change in TNM staging was observed. However, it did affect the decision of initial treatment. Thus, the number of upfront surgeries was significantly higher than the NCT group (p = 0.027) following the early period. CONCLUSION: Surgical volume is significantly affected in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. To overcome overload due to delayed surgeries related to pandemics, some hospitals should be spared for oncological treatments.

ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain. ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form. An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7. Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis. The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors. Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane. Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACEAngiotensin IIAT1 receptor axis. Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.e., older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency. We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions. The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the adverse ACEAngiotensin IIAT1 receptor axis and the protective ACE2Angiotensin1-7Mas receptor axis. In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7. In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"The pivotal link between ACE2 deficiency and SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The infection with coronavirus and non-survivor cases have been escalated since the first inception between January and March 2020. Therefore, reviewing the collated clinical characteristics of non-survivors might assist in current preventive efforts, triaging, and management of survivors. The aim of this review was to summarize the clinical characteristics of non-survivor cases due to the infection caused by a novel coronavirus and to identify the relevant data that might put the new cases at increased mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have identified three published articles on novel coronavirus reported during December 01, 2020, to March 15, 2020, which have described the mortality rate in Wuhan, Hubei, China. RESULTS: The mean duration of studies (i.e., the three retrospective studies with 278 cases) was 24.7 days, and the duration of onset to dyspnea was variable between 8 and 5 days. The main reported complications were acute respiratory distress, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac disease. The overall major comorbidity reported was cardiovascular diseases at 23.7% (66 of 278). The reported overall mortality rate was 8.3% (23 of 278), with the highest mortality rate of 15.0% (6 of 41) reported in Jin Yintan Hospital at Wuhan city. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical characteristics of the non-survivors from the novel coronavirus included adult males, aged older than 50 years, having comorbidities of cardiovascular disease, respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and diabetes with higher admission to the intensive care unit. The mortality rate was high in two of the reported studies (15.0% and 11.0%), which was decreased in the later-dated study to 3.4%.","output":"The early mortality rate of people infected with coronavirus (COVID-2019) in Wuhan, China: Review of three retrospective studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Importance: Predictive models can help identify SARS-CoV-2 patients at greatest risk of post-COVID sequelae and direct them towards appropriate care. Objective: To develop and internally validate a model to predict children and young people most likely to experience at least one impairing physical symptom 3 months after a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-test and to determine whether the impact of these predictors differed by SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Design: Potential pre-specified predictors included: SARS-CoV-2 status, sex, age, ethnicity, deprivation, quality of life/functioning (5 EQ-5D-Y items), physical and mental health, and loneliness (all prior to SARS-CoV-2 testing), and number of physical symptoms at testing. Logistic regression was used to develop the model. Model performance was assessed using calibration and discrimination measures; internal validation was performed via bootstrapping; the final model was adjusted for overfitting. Setting: National cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive and PCR-negative participants matched according to age, sex, and geographical area. Participants: Children and young people aged 11-17 years who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in England, January to March 2021. Main outcome measure: one or more physical symptom 3 months after initial PCR-testing which affected physical, mental or social well-being and interfered with daily living. Results: A total of 50,836 children and young people were approached; 7,096 (3,227 test-positives, 3,869 test-negatives) who completed a questionnaire 3 months after their PCR-test were included. 39.6% (1,279/3,227) of SAR-CoV-2 PCR-positives and 30.6% (1,184/3,869) of SAR-CoV-2 PCR-negatives had at least one impairing physical symptom 3 months post-test. The final model contained predictors: SARS-COV-2 status, number of symptoms at testing, sex, age, ethnicity, self-rated physical and mental health, feelings of loneliness and four EQ-5D-Y items before testing. Internal validation showed minimal overfitting with excellent calibration and discrimination measures (optimism adjusted calibration slope:0.97527; C-statistic:0.83640). Conclusions and relevance: We developed a risk prediction equation to identify those most at risk of experiencing at least one impairing physical symptom 3 months after a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-test which could serve as a useful triage and management tool for children and young people during the ongoing pandemic. External validation is required before large-scale implementation.","output":"Developing a model for predicting impairing physical symptoms in children 3 months after a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-test: The CLoCk Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading all over the world rapidly.

Even today new indications evolve due to the complex mode of action of these compounds. Due to the fear of side effects, especially irreversible retinopathy, their use is often limited. These side\\\\effects, however, are a consequence of excessive daily dosages.

He presented distention and abdominal pain, for which an abdomen-pelvic tomography was requested, reporting lack of filling in the right renal artery and renal infarcts requiring angioplasty and double antiplatelet therapy. The evolution was favorable, and the patient was discharged. Currently, a renal Doppler reports adequate vascularization. The patient presents proper renal function. Clinical Significance: The coronavirus disease is a contagious and life- threatening infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. It can lead patients to arterial and venous thrombosis. However, acute renal artery occlusion is considered a rare disease. Clinical Implications: Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent permanent kidney damage or permanent loss of kidney function. Conclusion: The underlying etiology of renal infarcts remains largely unknown at present, but it may include direct viral cytopathic effects on endothelial cells. Most patients are managed conservatively. Some cases undergo angioplasty successfully.

The EDs continue to struggle against this outbreak by implementing strategies maximizing their performance within an uncertain healthcare environment. The efforts, however, have remained insufficient in view of the growing number of admissions and increased severity of the coronavirus disease. Therefore, the primary aim of this paper is to review the literature on process improvement interventions focused on increasing the ED response to the current COVID-19 outbreak to delineate future research lines based on the gaps detected in the practical scenario. Therefore, we applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to perform a review containing the research papers published between December 2019 and April 2021 using ISI Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, IEEE, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases. The articles were further classified taking into account the research domain, primary aim, journal, and publication year. A total of 65 papers disseminated in 51 journals were concluded to satisfy the inclusion criteria. Our review found that most applications have been directed towards predicting the health outcomes in COVID-19 patients through machine learning and data analytics techniques. In the overarching pandemic, healthcare decision makers are strongly recommended to integrate artificial intelligence techniques with approaches from the operations research (OR) and quality management domains to upgrade the ED performance under social-economic restrictions.","output":"Process Improvement Approaches for Increasing the Response of Emergency Departments against the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had spread worldwide.

This study aimed to determine the intention of nurses to accept the covid-19 vaccination. Method: This online survey was given to all nurses in East Java who are scheduled to get the Covid-19 vaccine and had not been confirmed of Covid-19. This survey was conducted during 20th-27th February 2021 and distributed through social media. Data analysis used using an ordinal logistic regression. Result: A total of 150 nurses in East Java responded to this survey. Most of the participants were female (68.67%), aged 30- 39 years (59.33%), married (67,33%), worked less than 10 years (58.33%), graduated from Ners (60%), worked in non-covid rooms (70 %), had good knowledge about vaccines (85,33%), and had no anxiety about receiving the covid-19 vaccine (66%). There were 69.33% of nurses intend to accept vaccination, 14% had no intention to accept vaccination, and 16.67% were still unsure. Intention to accept vaccination was influenced by marital status (p= 0.043) and anxiety level (p=0.041). Conclusion: The intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccination reached 69,33% among nurses.

Here we report that E protein PDZ-binding motif (PBM), a domain involved in protein-protein interactions, is a major determinant of virulence. Elimination of SARS-CoV E protein PBM by using reverse genetics caused a reduction in the deleterious exacerbation of the immune response triggered during infection with the parental virus and virus attenuation. Cellular protein syntenin was identified to bind the E protein PBM during SARS-CoV infection by using three complementary strategies, yeast two-hybrid, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy assays. Syntenin redistributed from the nucleus to the cell cytoplasm during infection with viruses containing the E protein PBM, activating p38 MAPK and leading to the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines. Silencing of syntenin using siRNAs led to a decrease in p38 MAPK activation in SARS-CoV infected cells, further reinforcing their functional relationship. Active p38 MAPK was reduced in lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoVs lacking E protein PBM as compared with the parental virus, leading to a decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines and to virus attenuation. Interestingly, administration of a p38 MAPK inhibitor led to an increase in mice survival after infection with SARS-CoV, confirming the relevance of this pathway in SARS-CoV virulence. Therefore, the E protein PBM is a virulence domain that activates immunopathology most likely by using syntenin as a mediator of p38 MAPK induced inflammation.","output":"The PDZ-Binding Motif of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Envelope Protein Is a Determinant of Viral Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serology detection is recognized for its sensitivity in convalescent patients with COVID-19, in comparison with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs).

The overall objective of this study was to investigate the subjective strategies for maintaining appetite applied by patients recovering from COVID-19. The study included 19 in-depth interviews, focusing on patients suffering from long-term effects of COVID-19. The results were analysed using a thematic analysis for qualitative data. Results on strategies for maintaining appetite included four key themes: (1) a focus on well-functioning senses, (2) a focus on familiar foods, (3) a focus on the eating environment, and (4) a focus on post-ingestive well-being. It was found that factors prior to, during and after food intake, as well as the context, could influence desire to eat and pleasure related to food intake. As ageusia and anosmia make characterization of food difficult, being able to recognize and memorize its flavour was important to engage in consumption. Under normal circumstances, the hedonic value of food relies predominantly on the flavour of foods. When suffering from chemosensory dysfunction, shifting focus towards the texture of food, including trigeminal stimulation during consumption, were beneficial for maintaining appetite and food-related pleasure. Furthermore, a focus on the holistic satisfying feelings of choosing healthy food, as well as a focus on other people's enjoyment during meals were reported to boost well-being around food intake.

Fisheries and aquaculture sectors which are important sectors with high potential for export in the Turkish economy were immediately hit by the crisis. In this study, therefore, the early impacts of the COVID-19 on the export of aquatic products of Turkey were evaluated by using export data on quantity (kg) and customs value (USD) of the aquatic products belong to the first quarter period of 2019 and 2020. Fisher quantity index and price index showed that the mean values of exported products in both quantity and customs were decreased by 3.79% and 4.22% from 2019 to 2020, respectively. Drill-down analysis of export statistics showed that fresh Sea bass, Sea bream, Bluefin tuna, Carp were main exported products and Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Russia, Greece, and Japan were main exported countries that determined the way and strength of the Turkish export on aquatic products. Their exports from 2019 to 2020 were changed as -7.89% (in quantity) and -7.43% (in customs value-USD). Frozen sea cucumber exported to China, Hong Kong, and the USA was decreased by 56.07%, 24%, and 5.5%, respectively. The export of frozen or fresh crab, shrimp, lobster, frozen fillet (trout, sea bream and sea bass) and live fish (sea bream and sea bass) were also decreased by 31.08% and 48.55%, respectively. In contrast to the general decrease, the quantity of fresh, live, and frozen snails, mussels, octopus, squid and cuttlefish exported to South Korea, Greece, and China was increased by 58.59%. Also, the export of dried, salted, or pickled and smoked fish (7.24% in quantity), canned aquatic products (26.63% in quantity) and frozen sea bass, sea bream, and tuna fish (7.56% in quantity) were increased. In conclusion, it was clearly identified that, in general, the products exported as mostly canned, frozen, and smoked fish have experienced an increase in demand. However, these increases have not been compensated for the decreases in demand for other products, yet. In that chaotic situation, therefore, the Turkish government should immediately fund the fisheries and aquaculture sectors.

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Community dwelling population, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 28 356 participants in the Office for National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey aged 18-69 years who received at least one dose of an adenovirus vector or mRNA covid-19 vaccine after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Presence of long covid symptoms at least 12 weeks after infection over the follow-up period 3 February to 5 September 2021. RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 46 years, 55.6% (n=15 760) were women, and 88.7% (n=25 141) were of white ethnicity. Median follow-up was 141 days from first vaccination (among all participants) and 67 days from second vaccination (83.8% of participants). 6729 participants (23.7%) reported long covid symptoms of any severity at least once during follow-up. A first vaccine dose was associated with an initial 12.8% decrease (95% confidence interval ?18.6% to ?6.6%, P<0.001) in the odds of long covid, with subsequent data compatible with both increases and decreases in the trajectory (0.3% per week, 95% confidence interval ?0.6% to 1.2% per week, P=0.51). A second dose was associated with an initial 8.8% decrease (95% confidence interval ?14.1% to ?3.1%, P=0.003) in the odds of long covid, with a subsequent decrease by 0.8% per week (?1.2% to ?0.4% per week, P<0.001). Heterogeneity was not found in associations between vaccination and long covid by sociodemographic characteristics, health status, hospital admission with acute covid-19, vaccine type (adenovirus vector or mRNA), or duration from SARS-CoV-2 infection to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of long covid symptoms was observed to decrease after covid-19 vaccination and evidence suggested sustained improvement after a second dose, at least over the median follow-up of 67 days.

In the current study, we aimed to examine the flow and content of tweets, exploring the role of COVID-19 key events on the popular Twitter platform. METHODS: Using representative freely available data, we performed a focused, social media-based analysis to capture COVID-19 discussions on Twitter, considering sentiment and longitudinal trends between January 19 and March 3, 2020. Different populations of users were considered. Core discussions were explored measuring tweets sentiment, by both computing a polarity compound score with 95% Confidence Interval and using a transformer-based model, pretrained on a large corpus of COVID-19-related Tweets. Context-dependent meaning and emotion-specific features were considered. RESULTS: We gathered 3,308,476 tweets written in English. Since the first World Health Organization report (January 21), negative sentiment proportion of tweets gradually increased as expected, with amplifications following key events. Sentiment scores were increasingly negative among most active users. Tweets content and flow revealed an ongoing scenario in which the global emergency seems difficult to be emotionally managed, as shown by sentiment trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating social media like Twitter as essential surveillance tools in the management of the pandemic and its waves might actually represent a novel preventive approach to hinder emotional contagion, disseminating reliable information and nurturing trust.

Participants with VI reported significantly higher levels of sleep disturbance and use of sleep medication at both timepoints, poorer global sleep quality, sleep duration and latency at time 1, and daytime dysfunction at time 2, than those with no disabilities. Global sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and self-rated sleep quality deteriorated significantly in participants with no disabilities, but daytime dysfunction increased in all three groups. Disability and state anxiety were significant predictors of sleep quality across both surveys. Conclusion: While sleep was consistently poorer in people with disabilities such as VI, it appears that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a greater impact on sleep in people with no disabilities. State anxiety and, to a lesser extent, disability, were significant predictors of sleep across both surveys, suggesting the need to address anxiety in interventions targeted toward improving sleep.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Sleep Quality in People Living With Disabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a description of the enzymoimmunologic method (ELISA), which was used for demonstration of rotaviruses and coronaviruses in the samples of excrements of the calves suffering from diarrheas.

Here, we showed that C57BL/6J wild-type mice intranasally inoculated with the murine betacoronavirus murine hepatitis coronavirus 3 (MHV-3) develop a robust inflammatory response leading to acute lung injuries, including alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and fibrin thrombi. Although such histopathological changes seemed to resolve as the infection advanced, they efficiently impaired respiratory function, as the infected mice displayed restricted lung distention and increased respiratory frequency and ventilation. Following respiratory manifestation, the MHV-3 infection became systemic, and a high virus burden could be detected in multiple organs along with morphological changes. The systemic manifestation of MHV-3 infection was also marked by a sharp drop in the number of circulating platelets and lymphocytes, besides the augmented concentration of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, gamma interferon (IFN-), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), thereby mirroring some clinical features observed in moderate and severe cases of COVID-19. Importantly, both respiratory and systemic changes triggered by MHV-3 infection were greatly prevented by blocking TNF signaling, either via genetic or pharmacologic approaches. In line with this, TNF blockage also diminished the infection-mediated release of proinflammatory cytokines and virus replication of human epithelial lung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Collectively, results show that MHV-3 respiratory infection leads to a large range of clinical manifestations in mice and may constitute an attractive, lower-cost, biosafety level 2 (BSL2) in vivo platform for evaluating the respiratory and multiorgan involvement of betacoronavirus infections. IMPORTANCE Mouse models have long been used as valuable in vivo platforms to investigate the pathogenesis of viral infections and effective countermeasures. The natural resistance of mice to the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has launched a race toward the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection in other animals (e.g., hamsters, cats, ferrets, bats, and monkeys), as well as adaptation of the mouse model, by modifying either the host or the virus. In the present study, we utilized a natural pathogen of mice, MHV, as a prototype to model betacoronavirus-induced acute lung injure and multiorgan involvement under biosafety level 2 conditions. We showed that C57BL/6J mice intranasally inoculated with MHV-3 develops severe disease, which includes acute lung damage and respiratory distress that precede systemic inflammation and death. Accordingly, the proposed animal model may provide a useful tool for studies regarding betacoronavirus respiratory infection and related diseases.","output":"A Biosafety Level 2 Mouse Model for Studying Betacoronavirus-Induced Acute Lung Damage and Systemic Manifestations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The management of hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 is not currently subject to consensus. International and national guidance has favoured early intubation, with concerns persisting over the use of CPAP. However, considering available evidence and local circumstances, early ward based CPAP and self proning was adopted in our institution. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this approach. Methods In this retrospective observational study we included all patients admitted with a positive COVID-19 PCR. Negative patients were also included where clinical suspicion remained high. A large number of simple CPAP machines were used with entrained oxygen. Ward staff were supported in their use by physiotherapists and an intensive critical care outreach program. CPAP was initiated early via protocol, with the aim of preventing rather than responding to deterioration. Data was analysed descriptively. Results 559 patients admitted prior to 1/May/20 were included. 29.5% received CPAP, 7.2% were admitted to ICU and 4.8% were ventilated. Hospital mortality was 33.3%, ICU mortality 54.5%. Following CPAP, 64% of patients with moderate or severe ARDS at presentation, who were candidates for escalation, avoided intubation during their stay. Conclusion Figures for ICU admission, intubation and overall hospital mortality are significantly lower than those reported in a large and relevant comparator database, whilst ICU mortality is similar. This is despite our population having high levels of co-morbidity and ethnicities associated with poor outcomes. We advocate this approach as both effective and safe.","output":"Reduced ICU demand with early CPAP and proning in COVID-19 at Bradford: a single centre cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID19 forced the closure of educational centres and the suspension of face-to-face academic activity. This unexpected situation generated a new teaching-learning scenario and centres, teachers, students and families had to respond, with no time for planning. The aim of this work is to know the perception of the Vocational Training (VT) students in Galicia about the development of the teaching-learning process during this period. To this end, an ad hoc questionnaire was designed and implemented, to which 505 Higher and Intermediate students responded, 54.3 % of whom were women and 44.8 % men, most of whom were over 20 years old (56.4 %). The results report that 10% of the students did not have technological tools to continue the learning process and 21.4% did not have the Internet where they were confined. Vocational training teachers used different technologies and methodologies to continue teaching, without a common shared line of action. Although students report that their digital competence allowed them to follow the teaching online, they recognise that they need more support from the teaching staff to continue their learning. 34.7% of students said that they had to look after children or people with dependency. This study highlights the methodological disparity in VET for continuing the teaching process during the suspension of face-to-face academic activity, as well as the relevant role of face-to-face education as an axis for equity and the reduction of inequalities. ? 2021, Edicoes Universitarias Lusofonas.

Moreover, the slower responses and increased omissions were found to be associated with less self-reported mind-wandering, thus showing consistency with their higher subjective ratings of attentional control.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been no different, with reports of rising cases of GBV emerging worldwide. Already a significant problem in Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, and South Africa, GBV in these countries has been exacerbated by government restrictions intended to contain the spread of COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the availability of GBV prevention and response services from the perspective of the organizations that provide them. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of people who work in GBV prevention and response in Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, and South Africa was administered from July to October 2020. A convenience sample was identified through web search, contacts of in-country consultants, and relevant listservs and technical working groups. Descriptive analyses were completed using SPSS. RESULTS: A total of 187 respondents completed the survey. Nearly all (98.9%) survey respondents reported that COVID-19 impacted their work. The majority (77.9%) stated that work decreased due to government restrictions or GBV services being deemed non-essential. The types of service most impacted were community-based prevention, shelters, and legal services. Survey respondents overwhelmingly agreed (99.3%) that COVID-19 impacted GBV prevalence and identified adolescents and women with disabilities as particularly vulnerable groups. CONCLUSIONS: GBV prevention and response services in Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, and South Africa were highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, largely due to government restrictions and the failure of governments to deem GBV services as essential. Preparedness for future crises should ensure that GBV is adequately prioritized in the initial response in order to maintain service availability with special attention paid to at-risk populations.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Gender-Based Violence Prevention and Response Services in Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, and South Africa: A Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study is based on the experience gained over the period of March 2020- December 2020 when the outbreak of covid-19 pandemic forced millions of students of secondary and higher schools to shift almost overnight to distant or remote learning.

One reason could be that many patients are diagnosed and treated outside the NLEP network and dermatologists may be managing some of these patients not captured by official statistics. To estimate these missing numbers, the DermLep survey was carried out to study the number and profile of leprosy patients seen by dermatologists and their significance. METHODOLOGY: The DermLep survey was a questionnaire-based study to be filled in by participating dermatologists from all over India, both in private practice and in medical institutions. Participating dermatologists provided information on old and new leprosy patients seen in their clinic over a 3-month period. RESULTS: Total of 201 dermatologists from 20 states of India participated in the survey. 3701 leprosy patients (M: F ratio 2.1:1) were seen. Of them 46.62% (n = 1680) were new; 22.89% (n = 825) were under-treatment; and 19.65% (n = 708) were post RFT patients. Children <15 years constituted 4.29%, while elderly >60 years were 22.21%. As per WHO classification, MB were 73.36% and PB 28.46%. Of all patients 30.91% had lepra reactions, with T2R being more frequent. While 23.58% of all patients in the survey had G2D; in new patients 17.79%; and in post RFT patients 37% had G2D. Among the 1680 new cases seen, 59% were reported to NLEP by the dermatologists and 41% remained unreported mainly by the private dermatologists, among whom for 20% of the cases they mentioned no access to register. Source of MDT was WHO-MDT in 60.09% of new cases and for rest of 39.91% it was private pharmacies where private dermatologists had no access to MDT blister packs. CONCLUSION: This survey suggests that a good number of new-untreated leprosy patients, treatment defaulters and post RFT cases are managed by dermatologists in India. About 40% of the new patients managed mainly by private dermatologists are not being reported to NLEP for various reasons, and these constitute the missing numbers from government statistics. If extrapolated to the large of number of practicing dermatologists in India, these numbers could be very significant. The high percentage of G2D noted in patients surveyed (23.58%) and post RFT patient issues observed need special attention.

The application of EZH2i in several solid tumors is still in different stages of clinical trials and needs to be further validated. As a key epigenetic regulator, besides its role in controlling the proliferation of tumor cells, EZH2 has been implicated in the regulation of various immune cells including macrophages. But there are still controversial research results at present. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor that highly expresses EZH2, which has the third highest incidence and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Studies have shown that the numbers of M2-type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are highly associated with the progression and metastasis of CRC. In the current study, we aim to investigate how EZH2 modulates the polarization of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of CRC, and compare the role of two different EZH2 inhibitors, EPZ6438 and GSK126. We applied a 3D culture method to demonstrate that EZH2i did indeed suppress the proliferation of CRC cells in vitro. In vivo, we found that the percentage of CD206(+) macrophages of the TME was decreased under the treatment of EPZ6438, but it increased upon GSK126 treatment. Besides, in the co-culture system of macrophages and CRC cells, EPZ6438 led to significant elevation of M1 markers and reduction of M2 markers. Furthermore, mechanistic studies validated by ChIP-qPCR demonstrated that EZH2i inhibit EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 levels on the promoters of STAT3, an essential transcription factor for M1 macrophage polarization. Therefore, our data suggested that EZH2i not only suppress CRC cell proliferation directly, but also regulate macrophage by skewing M2 into effector M1 macrophage to exert a tumor suppressive effect. Moreover, our study provided new insight for better understanding of the role of two kinds of EZH2i: EPZ6438 and GSK126, which may pave the way in treating CRC by targeting cancer cells and immune cells via this epigenetic approach in the future.","output":"EZH2 Inhibitors Suppress Colorectal Cancer by Regulating Macrophage Polarization in the Tumor Microenvironment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Norms, weighted for Norwegian general population characteristics, are shown for the five EQ-5D-5L dimensions, EQ-5D index, and EQ VAS scores for seven age categories, females, males, and education level. RESULTS: There were 3200 (25.9%) respondents to 12,263 correctly addressed questionnaires. The EQ-5D-5L dimensions, EQ VAS, and background questions were completed by 3120 (24.6%) respondents. The mean age (SD) was 50.9 (21.7) and range was 18C97 years. The youngest age group of 18C29 years and oldest of 80 years and over had the highest (n = 691) and lowest (n = 239) number of respondents, respectively. Compared to the general population, the respondents comprised a greater number of females, younger and older ages, and had a higher education level. 32% of respondents reported no health problems on the EQ-5D-5L. From the youngest to oldest age groups, there was a general decline in health as assessed by the EQ-5D-5L. The exception was for anxiety/depression, where the youngest age groups had the poorest health. Apart from self-care, women reported poorer health than men, as assessed by the EQ-5D-5L; EQ VAS scores were similar for men and women. Higher levels of health (EQ-5D index, EQ VAS scores) were found with increasing levels of education. CONCLUSION: The population norms will improve interpretation of EQ-5D-5L and EQ VAS scores in Norwegian applications including clinical practice, clinical and health services research, and national quality registers where EQ-5D-5L is the most widely used patient-reported instrument.

METHODS: A descriptive questionnaire-based survey was conducted nationwide from 10 November 2020 to 13 December 2020. The national scale survey was both anonymous and voluntary and was sent by the National Board of Dentists to 42,464 private dentists that were officially registered in France. The questionnaire included 36 questions divided into various sections: (i) general profile (gender, age range, and university, where respondents completed their dental studies), (ii) general knowledge of telemedicine, and (iii) familiarity with current regulations on telemedicine and activities that qualify as telemedicine. RESULTS: Only 57.1% of dentists in private practice stated that they had never heard nor knew about TD (n=2,887). Only 1.5% (n=76) stated they had attended a training module on telemedicine and/or TD during their studies at university. Only 1.3% (n=26) of dentists who practised a TD activity stated that they knew about telemedicine regulations. Only 65.7% (n=2,020) of those who had never practised and 74.8% (n=1,485) who had practised TD acknowledged that they would like to practice TD. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study found a significant need for TD education and training as well as on regulations. It may be necessary in the future to ensure that all stakeholders in the field of dentistry work together to improve these two topics for dental practitioners. It is also worth noting that TD and telemedicine are public health tools and that they could provide inequitable access to medical care. However, TD must be implemented to decrease inequality and ensure it does not do the opposite.","output":"A national teledentistry study on the knowledge, attitudes, training and practices of private dentists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many patients who suffer from pulmonary diseases cannot inflate their lungs normally, as they need mechanical ventilation (MV) to assist them. The stress associated with MV can damage the delicate epithelium in small airways and alveoli, which can cause complications resulting in ventilation-induced lung injuries (VILIs) in many cases, especially in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, efforts were directed to develop safe modes for MV. In our work, we propose a different approach to decrease injuries of epithelial cells (EpCs) upon MV. We alter EpCs cytoskeletal structure to increase their survival rate during airway reopening conditions associated with MV. We tested two anti-inflammatory drugs dexamethasone (DEX) and transdehydroandrosterone (DHEA) to alter the cytoskeleton. Cultured rat L2 alveolar EpCs were exposed to airway reopening conditions using a parallel-plate perfusion chamber. Cells were exposed to a single bubble propagation to simulate stresses associated with mechanical ventilation in both control and study groups. Cellular injury and cytoskeleton reorganization were assessed via fluorescence microscopy, whereas cell topography was studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our results indicate that culturing cells in media, DEX solution, or DHEA solution did not lead to cell death (static cultures). Bubble flows caused significant cell injury. Preexposure to DEX or DHEA decreased cell death significantly. The AFM verified alteration of cell mechanics due to actin fiber depolymerization. These results suggest potential beneficial effects of DEX and DHEA for ARDS treatment for patients with COVID-19. They are also critical for VILIs and applicable to future clinical studies. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Preexposure of cultured cells to either dexamethasone or transdehydroandrosterone significantly decreases cellular injuries associated with mechanical ventilation due to their ability to alter the cell mechanics. This is an alternative protective method against VILIs instead of common methods that rely on modification of mechanical ventilator modes.","output":"Dexamethasone and transdehydroandrosterone significantly reduce pulmonary epithelial cell injuries associated with mechanical ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract On August 6, 2019, the 119 members of the School of criminal justice, forensic science and criminology at the University of Lausanne were the target of an online scammer.

The first author of this paper is the Director of the School, and the second is an expert in digital forensic science and a professor of the School. They worked together in real time to deal with the fraud. Because the fraud occurred in a School of forensic science and criminology, it raised many questions on a variety of overlapping dimensions. The objective of this study was, therefore, to draw lessons from this case from several perspectives ranging from forensic science to cybersecurity, and from practical to academic. The response to the incident has been treated in four typical distinguishable phases: (1) fraud detection; (2) crisis management; (3) post-incident analysis; and (4) reporting to different communities. We conclude this paper by taking lessons from the case to express the essential role of forensic knowledge and crime analysis in interpreting the information conveyed by digital traces to develop innovative cross-disciplinary models for preventing, detecting, analysing, investigating and responding to online fraud.","output":"Hello are you available?

The flexural properties of the multi-tow structure were analyzed to evaluate the influence of the processing temperature, processing speed, number of glass/PP tapes, and glass fiber content of the glass/PP tapes. The proposed process for constructing the multi-tow structure can generate straight, curved, and looped three-dimensional structures by using a multi-joint robot and instantaneous consolidation of glass/PP tapes. As the number of glass/PP tapes increased, the resin-rich area increased and the void volume fraction in the multi-tow structure increased from 2 to 5 vol%, while the flexural strength decreased. However, when the number of glass/PP tapes and processing temperature were adjusted appropriately, the flexural strength of the multi-tow structure that can be constructed at speeds 30 times faster than those of conventional pultrusion process was relatively superior. The results of a finite element analysis, confirmed that the inclusion of the proposed multi-tow structure in a bumper beam was effective in reducing deformation and absorbing the impact energy due to external loads.","output":"Flexural Properties of Multi-Tow Structures Constructed from Glass/Polypropylene Tape under Various Manufacturing Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Cross-contamination of raw food to other surfaces, hands, and foods is a serious issue in food service. With individuals eating more meals away from home, contracting a foodborne illness from a food service establishment is an increasing concern. However, most studies have concentrated on hands or food contact surfaces and neglected atypical and unusual surfaces (surfaces that are not typically identified as a source of cross-contamination) and venues. This review was conducted to identify atypically cross-contaminated surfaces and atypical venues where cross-contamination could occur that have not been examined thoroughly in the literature. Most surfaces that could be at risk for cross-contamination are frequently touched, are rarely cleaned and sanitized, and can support the persistence and/or growth of foodborne pathogens. These surfaces include menus, spice and condiment containers, aprons and coveralls, mobile devices and tablets, and money. Venues that are explored, such as temporary events, mobile vendors, and markets, are usually limited in space or infrastructure, have low compliance with proper hand washing, and provide the opportunity for raw and ready-to-eat foods to come into contact with one another. These factors create an environment in which cross-contamination can occur and potentially impact food safety. A more comprehensive cleaning and sanitizing regime encompassing these surfaces and venues could help mitigate cross-contamination. This review highlights key surfaces and venues that have the potential to be cross-contaminated and have been underestimated or not fully investigated. These knowledge gaps indicate where further work is needed to fully understand the role of these surfaces and venues in cross-contamination and how it can be prevented.","output":"Cross-Contamination on Atypical Surfaces and Venues in Food Service Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2020 wildfire season was devastating to the Western United States and affected the regions NICUs.

One aim of the present study was to determine CVR throughout acclimatization to high altitude when controlling for these. Middle cerebral artery mean velocity (MCAv mean) CVR was assessed during hyperventilation (hypocapnia) and CO2 administration (hypercapnia) with background normoxia (sea level (SL)) and hypoxia (3,454 m) in nine healthy volunteers (26  4 years (mean  s.d.)) at SL, and after 30 minutes (HA0), 3 (HA3) and 22 (HA22) days of high-altitude (3,454 m) exposure. At altitude, ventilation was increased whereas MCAv mean was not altered.

In veterinary ophthalmology, little is known about keratometry in dogs, and its practical application has been limited. The present study aimed to describe keratometry in some dog breeds popular in Japan using a handheld keratometer. METHODS: Client-owned dogs of various signalment were enrolled prospectively in the keratometry examination. Interbreed variations in mean corneal curvatures (R1R2avg) and corneal astigmatism ((R1?R2)) were evaluated statistically with respect to their bodyweight based on the data which fulfilled the predetermined inclusion criteria. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: On examination of 237 dogs from 16 different breeds, R1R2avg (meansd) ranged from 7.540.30 mm in Pomeranians to 9.280.19 mm in golden retrievers. (R1?R2) (meansd) ranged from 0.220.11 mm in miniature schnauzers to 0.570.30 mm in French bulldogs. CONCLUSION: The present study successfully described keratometry in 16 dog breeds.

In the context of specific immune response against the virus, a correlation between Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I (MHC-I) and the severity of the disease in patients with COVID-19 has been suggested. Aiming at better understanding the biology of the infection and the immune response against the virus in the Brazilian population, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 protein S peptides in order to identify epitopes able to elicit an immune response mediated by the most frequent MHC-I alleles using in silico methods. METHODS: Our analyses consisted in searching for the most frequent Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A, HLA-B and HLA-C alleles in the Brazilian population, excluding the genetic isolates; then, we performed: molecular modelling for unsolved structures, MHC-I binding affinity and antigenicity prediction, peptide docking and molecular dynamics of the best fitted MHC-I/protein S complexes. RESULTS: We identified 24 immunogenic epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 protein S that could interact with 17 different MHC-I alleles (namely, HLA-A*01:01; HLA-A*02:01; HLA-A*11:01; HLA-A*24:02; HLA-A*68:01; HLA-A*23:01; HLA-A*26:01; HLA-A*30:02; HLA-A*31:01; HLA-B*07:02; HLA-B*51:01; HLA-B*35:01; HLA-B*44:02; HLA-B*35:03; HLA-C*05:01; HLA-C*07:01 and HLA-C*15:02) in the Brazilian population.

The aim of this study was to see whether or not this may affect overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). METHOD: A systematic review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020189158). Medline, EMBASE and Scopus were interrogated. Patients aged over 18 years with a diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer who received elective surgery as their primary treatment were included. Delay to elective surgery was defined as the period between CRC diagnosis and the day of surgery. Meta-analysis of the outcomes OS and DFS were conducted. Forest plots, funnel plots and tests of heterogeneity were produced. An estimated number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated for statistically significant pooled hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: Of 3753 articles identified, seven met the inclusion criteria. Encompassing 314 560 patients, three of the seven studies showed that a delay to elective resection is associated with poorer OS or DFS. OS was assessed at a 1 month delay, the HR for six datasets was 1.13 (95% CI 1.02-1.26, p = 0.020) and at 3 months the pooled HR for three datasets was 1.57 (95% CI 1.16-2.12, p = 0.004). The estimated NNH for a delay at 1 month and 3 months was 35 and 10 respectively. Delay was nonsignificantly negatively associated with DFS on meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: This review recommends that elective surgery for CRC patients is not postponed longer than 4 weeks, as available evidence suggests extended delays from diagnosis are associated with poorer outcomes.

However, longitudinal in vivo imaging of the intact spinal cord in rodent models has been challenging, requiring repeated surgeries to expose the cord for imaging or sacrifice of animals at various time points for ex vivo tissue analysis. To address these limitations, we have developed an implantable spinal cord window chamber (SCWC) device and procedures in mice for repeated multimodal intravital microscopic imaging of the cord and its vasculature in situ. We present methodology for using our SCWC to achieve spatially co-registered optical-acoustic imaging performed serially for up to four weeks, without damaging the cord or induction of locomotor deficits in implanted animals. To demonstrate the feasibility, we used the SCWC model to study the response of the normal spinal cord vasculature to ionizing radiation over time using white light and fluorescence microscopy combined with optical coherence tomography (OCT) in vivo. In vivo power Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustics were used to directly visualize the cord and vascular structures and to measure hemoglobin oxygen saturation through the complete spinal cord, respectively.

VCs have been set up at the block level, covering a population of 150,000-250,000 in rural areas in North India. Inadequate use by rural communities is a major challenge to sustainability of these VCs. This not only reduces the communitys vision improvement potential but also impacts self-sustainability and limits expansion of services in rural areas. The current literature reports a lack of awareness regarding eye diseases and the need for care, social stigmas, low priority being given to eye problems, prevailing gender discrimination, cost, and dependence on caregivers as factors preventing the use of primary eye care. OBJECTIVE: Our organization is planning an awareness-cum-engagement interventiondoor-to-door basic eye checkup and visual acuity screening in VCs coverage areasto connect with the community and improve the rational use of VCs. METHODS: In this randomized, parallel-group experimental study, we will select 2 VCs each for the intervention arm and the control arm from among poor, low-performing VCs (ie, walk-in of 10 patients/day) in our 2 operational regions (Vrindavan, Mathura District, and Mohammadi, Kheri District) of Uttar Pradesh. Intervention will include door-to-door screening and awareness generation in 8-12 villages surrounding the VCs, and control VCs will follow existing practices of awareness generation through community activities and health talks. Data will be collected from each VC for 4 months of intervention. Primary outcomes will be an increase in the number of walk-in patients, spectacle advise and uptake, referral and uptake for cataract and specialty surgery, and operational expenses. Secondary outcomes will be uptake of refraction correction and referrals for cataract and other eye conditions. Differences in the number of walk-in patients, referrals, uptake of services, and cost involved will be analyzed. RESULTS: Background work involved planning of interventions and selection of VCs has been completed. Participant recruitment has begun and is currently in progress. CONCLUSIONS: Through this study, we will analyze whether our door-to-door intervention is effective in increasing the number of visits to a VC and, thus, overall sustainability. We will also study the cost-effectiveness of this intervention to recommend its scalability.

We developed a real-time vital sign monitor using impulse-radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB) radar with embedded processors and software;we then evaluated its accuracy in measuring heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) and investigated the factors affecting the accuracy of the radar-based measurements. In 50 patients visiting a cardiology clinic, HR and RR were measured using IR-UWB radar simultaneously with electrocardiography and capnometry. All patients underwent HR and RR measurements in 2 posturessupine and sittingfor 2 min each. There was a high agreement between the RR measured using radar and capnometry (concordance correlation coefficient [CCC] 0.925 [0.919C0.926];upper and lower limits of agreement [LOA], ? 2.21 and 3.90 breaths/min). The HR measured using radar was also in close agreement with the value measured using electrocardiography (CCC 0.749 [0.738C0.760];upper and lower LOA, ? 12.78 and 15.04 beats/min). Linear mixed effect models showed that the sitting position and an HR < 70 bpm were associated with an increase in the absolute biases of the HR, whereas the sitting position and an RR < 18 breaths/min were associated with an increase in the absolute biases of the RR. The IR-UWB radar sensor with embedded processors and software can measure the RR and HR in real time with high precision. The sitting position and a low RR or HR were associated with the accuracy of RR and HR measurement, respectively, using IR-UWB radar.","output":"Preclinical evaluation of noncontact vital signs monitoring using real-time IR-UWB radar and factors affecting its accuracy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to the wide spread of SARS-CoV2 around the world, the risk of death in individuals with metabolic comorbidities has dangerously increased. Mexico has a high number of infected individuals and deaths by COVID-19 as well as an important burden of metabolic diseases; nevertheless, reports about features of Mexican individuals with COVID-19 are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate demographic features, clinical characteristics and the pharmacological treatment of individuals who died by COVID-19 in the south of Mexico. METHODS: We performed an observational study including the information of 185 deceased individuals with confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19. Data were retrieved from medical records. Categorical data were expressed as proportions (%) and numerical data were expressed as mean  standard deviation. Comorbidities and overlapping symptoms were plotted as Venn diagrams. Drug clusters were plotted as dendrograms. RESULTS: The mean age was 59.53 years. There was a male predominance (60.1%). The mean hospital stay was 4.75  4.43 days. The most frequent symptoms were dyspnea (88.77%), fever (71.42%) and dry cough (64.28%). Present comorbidities included diabetes (60.63%), hypertension (59.57%) and obesity (43.61%). The main drugs used for treating COVID-19 were azithromycin (60.6%), hydroxychloroquine (53.0%) and oseltamivir (27.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Mexican individuals who died of COVID-19 had shorter hospital stays, higher frequency of shortness of breath, and higher prevalence of diabetes than individuals from other countries.

Recognizing that social connections and feelings of normality are important for public health, this study examines whether, and for whom, that goal is realized, and identifies obstacles that may inhibit its achievement. METHODS: Thematic analysis of narratives obtained via a qualitative cross-sectional survey of a community cohort in Aotearoa | New Zealand. RESULTS: A majority of participants reported that life after elimination was more or less the same as before the pandemic. Some became more social. Nevertheless, a sizeable minority reported being less social, even many months after elimination. Key obstacles to social recovery included fears that the virus was circulating undetected and the enduring impact of lockdowns upon social relationships, personal habits and mental health. Within our sample, old age and underlying health conditions were both associated with a propensity to become less social. CONCLUSIONS: Elimination strategies can successfully allow normal social life to resume. However, this outcome is not guaranteed. People may encounter difficulties with re-establishing social connections in Zero-COVID settings. Measures designed to overcome such obstacles should be an integral part of elimination strategies.","output":"Pathways and obstacles to social recovery following the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 from Aotearoa New Zealand: a qualitative cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of in-hospital cardiac arrest in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and to describe the characteristics and outcomes for patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest within the ICU, compared with non-ICU patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Finally, we evaluated outcomes stratified by age. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, and preprint websites was conducted between January 1, 2020, and December 10, 2020. Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews identification: CRD42020203369. STUDY SELECTION: Studies reporting on consecutive in-hospital cardiac arrest with a resuscitation attempt among patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently performed study selection and data extraction. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were synthesized according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or through an independent third reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eight studies reporting on 847 in-hospital cardiac arrest were included. In-hospital cardiac arrest incidence varied between 1.5% and 5.8% among hospitalized patients and 8.0-11.4% among patients in ICU. In-hospital cardiac arrest occurred more commonly in older male patients. Most initial rhythms were nonshockable (83.9%, [asystole = 36.4% and pulseless electrical activity = 47.6%]). Return of spontaneous circulation occurred in 33.3%, with a 91.7% in-hospital mortality. In-hospital cardiac arrest events in ICU had higher incidence of return of spontaneous circulation (36.6% vs 18.7%; p < 0.001) and relatively lower mortality (88.7% vs 98.1%; p < 0.001) compared with in-hospital cardiac arrest in non-ICU locations. Patients greater than or equal to 60 years old had significantly higher in-hospital mortality than those less than 60 years (93.1% vs 87.9%; p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately, one in 20 patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 received resuscitation for an in-hospital cardiac arrest. Hospital survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest within the ICU was higher than non-ICU locations and seems comparable with prepandemic survival for nonshockable rhythms. Although the data provide guidance surrounding prognosis after in-hospital cardiac arrest, it should be interpreted cautiously given the paucity of information surrounding treatment limitations and resource constraints during the pandemic. Further research is into actual causative mechanisms is needed.","output":"A Systematic Review of the Incidence and Outcomes of In-Hospital Cardiac Arrests in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 presented significant challenges to the field of kidney transplantation. After increasing each year since 2015 and reaching the highest annual count to date in 2019, the total number of kidney trans- plants decreased slightly, to 23642, in 2020. The decrease in total kidney transplants was due to a decrease in living donor transplants; the number of deceased donor transplants rose in 2020. The number of patients waiting for a kidney transplant in the United States declined slightly in 2020, driven by a slight drop in the number of new candidates added in 2020 and an increase in patients removed from the waiting list owing to death-important patterns that correlated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The complexities of the pandemic were accompanied by other ongoing challenges. Nationwide, only about a quarter of waitlisted patients receive a deceased donor kidney transplant within 5 years, a proportion that varies dramatically by donation service area, from 14.8% to 73.0%. The nonutilization (discard) rate of recovered organs rose to its highest value, at 21.3%, despite a dramatic decline in the discard of organs from hepatitis C-positive donors. Nonutilization rates remain particularly high for Kidney Donor Profile Index 85% kidneys and kidneys from which a biopsy specimen was obtained. Due to pandemic-related disruption of living donation in spring 2020, the number of living donor transplants in 2020 declined below annual counts over the last decade. In this context, only a small proportion of the waiting list receives living donor transplants each year, and racial disparities in living donor transplant access persist. As both graft and patient survival continue to improve incrementally, the total number of living kidney transplant recipients with a functioning graft exceeded 250,000 in 2020. Pediatric transplant numbers seem to have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The total number of pediatric kidney transplants performed decreased to 715 in 2020, from a peak of 872 in 2009. Despite numerous efforts, living donor kidney transplant remains low among pediatric recipients, with continued racial disparities among recipients. Of concern, the rate of deceased donor transplant among pediatric waitlisted candidates continued to decrease, reaching its lowest point in 2020. While this may be partly explained by the COVID-19 pandemic, close attention to this trend is critically important. Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract remain the leading cause of kidney disease in the pediatric population. While most pediatric de- ceased donor recipients receive a kidney from a donor with KDPI less than 35%, most pediatric deceased donor recipients had four or more HLA mis- matches. Graft survival continues to improve, with superior survival for living donor recipients versus deceased donor recipients.","output":"OPTN/SRTR 2020 Annual Data Report: Kidney"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the infectious diseases that have seriously threatened global public health since its outbreak in 2019. Due to the complicated Pathogenesis, high infectivity and high fatality rate of COVID-19, there is currently no effective treatment for such epidemic disease. Traditional Chinese medicine has a long clinical history for the prevention and treatment of this kind of acute infectious disease. Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QFPD) is widely used in treating COVID-19 in China. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive and systematic evidence on the effectiveness and safety of Qingfei Paidu Decoction. METHODS: We will search each database from the built-in until May 2020. The English literature mainly searches Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science, while the Chinese literature comes from CNKI, CBM, VIP, and Wangfang database. Simultaneously we will retrieval clinical registration tests and grey literatures. This study only screen the clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about QFPD for COVID-19 to assess its efficacy and safety. The two researchers worked independently on literature selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. The dichotomous data is represented by relative risk (RR), and the continuous is expressed by mean difference (MD) or standard mean difference (SMD), eventually the data is synthesized using a fixed effect model (FEM) or a random effect model (REM) depending on whether or not heterogeneity exists.

Finally, we estimate the effect of age on these indicators in a two-year follow up. A questionnaire survey among the Finnish postal service employees was conducted in 2016, and a follow-up was conducted in 2018. We analyze data from 1262 subjects who replied to both the baseline and the follow-up surveys. Sustainable employability is defined as a multidimensional construct using nine indicators and covering three domains (health, well-being and employability) based on Fleuren and colleagues model. Measurement time (repeated measure) is used as a within-subjects factor, and age is used as a between-subjects factor. The estimated marginal means of the indicators of sustainable employability at the baseline and the follow-up by age in years are calculated. No significant change is found in eight indicators (work ability, time and resources, recovery after work, job satisfaction, motivation, perceived employment, enough training on the job and relevance of work) of sustainable employability after the two-year follow-up. We find a statistically significant effect of time on self-rated health (F = 6.56, p = 0.011). Six out of nine indicators (self-rated health, work ability, time and resources, recovery after work, job satisfaction, and perceived employment) have a statistically significant effect of age between subjects. Partial Eta Squared (?2p) shows a very small difference in the indicators of sustainable employability during the follow-up, indicating that the employability of the workers was sustained throughout. We used the Fleuren model as the basis for our definition of sustainable employability.

Twenty studies met inclusion criteria and the following themes were identified: caregiving experiences and the burden of care; barriers to caregiving; and caregiver recommendations to improve care. Results demonstrate that studies about informal caregivers and dementia within Arab-Muslim populations are underrepresented in the research.

Among hospitalized patients with IDU-IE at the two tertiary-care hospitals in the Canadian Maritimes, we aimed to identify (1) the availability of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) and sterile drug injecting equipment, and (2) indicators of potential unmet addiction care needs. METHODS: Retrospective review of IDU-IE hospitalizations at Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre (Halifax, Nova Scotia) and the Saint John Regional Hospital (Saint John, New Brunswick), October 2015 -March 2017. In Halifax, there are no addiction medicine providers on staff; in Saint John, infectious diseases physicians also practice addiction medicine. Inclusion criteria were: (1) probable or definite IE as defined by the modified Duke criteria; and (2) injection drug use within the prior 3 months. RESULTS: We identified 38 hospitalizations (21 in Halifax and 17 in Saint John), for 30 unique patients. Among patients with IDU-IE and untreated opioid use disorder, OAT was offered to 36% (5/14) of patients in Halifax and 100% (6/6) of patients in Saint John. Once it was offered, most patients at both sites initiated OAT and planned to continue it after discharge. In Halifax, no patients were offered sterile injecting equipment, and during five hospitalizations staff confiscated patients own equipment. In Saint John, four patients were offered (and one was provided) injecting equipment in hospital, and during two hospitalizations staff confiscated patients own equipment. Concerns regarding undertreated pain or opioid withdrawal were documented during 66% (25/38) of hospitalizations, and in-hospital illicit or non-medical drug use during 32% (12/38). Two patients at each site (11%; 4/38) had self-directed discharges against medical advice.

A variety of methods like implant surgery and salvage procedures as partial or total ulnar head resection and the Sauve-Kapandji procedure are reasonable options in the elderly patient but not in young individuals since it often compromises manual power and stability and may cause impingement problems. Reconstruction of the DRUJ with rib perichondrium is a new treatment option with promising short-term outcome. The aim the present study was to investigate if the outcome is consistent over time. METHODS: Four female patients with a mean age of 40.5 years suffered severe unilateral osteoarthritis in the DRUJ. They underwent reconstruction of the joint with rib perichondrium transplants. Preoperatively, mean pain under manual load was 8.5 (range 7C10) and 4.2 (range 2C5) at rest, using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Range of motion (ROM) in forearm rotation was on average 118 and grip strength was 86% in comparison to the contralateral hand. The outcome was assessed at a clinical follow-up in 2016, measuring ROM, grip-strength, pain at rest and under manual load and DASH-score. Radiological examination was performed. An additional follow-up by letter was performed in 2021 using a patient-reported-outcome survey (PROS). The patients were asked to grade the ROM and grip-strength as changed or unchanged in comparison to the clinical follow-up in 2016. RESULTS: At clinical follow-up at a mean of 3.1 years (range 1C5) after surgery, pain level had decreased to VAS 1.5 (0C5) under load and all patients were pain free at rest. Forearm rotation was on average 156 (range 100C180) and grip strength was 97% of the unoperated hand. The mean DASH-score was 14.4 (0C45). An additional follow-up by letter was conducted at a mean of 7.5 years (5.5C9.5) after surgery. ROM and grip strength were reported as unchanged by all patients in relation to the previous clinical follow-up. No additional surgery or complications were reported.

Acquired GH deficiency (GHD) has been recently proposed as a risk factor for severity of COVID-19 infections. However, acquired GHD is often associated to other factors, including pituitary tumors, surgery, radiotherapy, and additional pituitary hormones deficits and their replacements, which, together, may hinder an accurate analysis of the relationship between GHD and COVID-19. Therefore, we decided to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the frequency of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in adults subjects with untreated isolated GHD (IGHD) due to a homozygous null mutation in the GHRH receptor gene. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 27 adult IGHD subjects and 27 age- and gender-matched local controls. Interview, physical examination, bio-impedance, hematological and SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were analyzed. RESULTS: There was no difference in the prevalence of positivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies between the two groups. Conversely, no IGHD individual had a previous clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, while 6 control subjects did (p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: The production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was similar between IGHD subjects due to a GHRH receptor gene mutation and controls, but the evolution to symptomatic stages of the infection and the frequency of confirmed cases was lower in IGHD subjects than in GH sufficient individuals.","output":"Individuals with isolated congenital GH deficiency due to a GHRH receptor gene mutation appear to cope better with SARS-CoV-2 infection than controls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic brought a myriad of challenges and opportunities and has influenced the modern concept of sustainability as projected into the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and the underlying multi-stakeholder model.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a literature review that discusses how communities of entrepreneurship education practitioners can deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. A review of the current literature on Covid-19 and entrepreneurship education is conducted that highlights the need to incorporate a community approach. This enables a better understanding about how communities of educational stakeholders including teachers, students and institutions can facilitate a more proactive and positive attitude. Findings: The paper finds that managing the Covid-19 crisis is difficult for entrepreneurship educations due to the need for practical and real life examples. This means the use of augmented reality and artificial intelligence is needed to simulate the real environment. This will enable a more community orientated approach to the study and practice of entrepreneurship.

This is further emphasised within 'ASPHER's European List of Core Competencies for the Public Health Professional' which mentions that public health responsibilities fall upon the 'public health workforce'. If even those outside the medical profession are considered part of the public health workforce, why are medical students being overlooked as a group who can contribute? As representatives of the future generation of medical professionals, shouldn't they be an obvious starting point for practising public health advocacy? Medical students have the potential to act and, with better integration into the public health workforce, could become an asset. Despite them having a legal obligation to contribute in emergency situations, there are insufficiencies or a lack of clarity within the guidelines to highlight and elaborate on what students are specifically expected to be able to carry out in various situations. This is in stark contrast to the predefined lists of competencies against which medical professionals are assessed. This workshop will focus on identifying the core competencies regarding medical students in their contribution to emergency preparedness and how these could be integrated into the existing framework for effecting a structured and organised response. The primary outcome is to achieve better advocacy for public health in future medical professionals with a focus on preparedness for emergency situations. To begin with, research carried out to elucidate whether different countries have set guidelines or competencies that are expected of medical students by the conclusion of their medical studies will be presented. Such guidelines both on national and regional levels were identified and then compared following analysis. This will be followed by more personal accounts from medical students and a discussion of the potential steps that could be introduced to improve emergency preparedness. Shortcomings of such guidelines concerning medical student competencies are further highlighted in times of crisis such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It is during this time when healthcare systems are stretched and their contribution may be most valuable. The nature of this contribution within the context of international pandemic plans will be explored and debated. Finally this workshop will conclude by opening up the floor for discussion between the panellists and the audience regarding the topics and issues raised. This workshop aims to highlight the need for core competencies in medical education and bring this topic to the forefront for further discussion and analysis amongst professionals, with the eventual international unification, simplification and clarification of these being the ultimate goal. This could be pivotal for the future of public health and in the advancement and evolution of education. KEY MESSAGES: Armed with suitable competencies, medical students can be an asset to the public health workforce if utilised effectively and in doing so can enhance preparedness response.

Monopolar HDsEMG signals were collected using a grid of 13  5 electrodes placed over the vastus medialis (VM). Intramuscular electrical stimulation was used to selectively activate two regions within VM. The distribution of EMG responses to stimulation was obtained by calculating the amplitude of the compound action potential for each channel; the position of the peak amplitude was tracked across knee angles to describe shifts of the active muscle regions under the electrodes. In a separate experiment, regional activation was investigated in 10 knee flexion-extension movements against a fixed resistance. Intramuscular stimulation of different VM regions resulted in clear differences in amplitude distribution along the columns of the electrode grid (P < 0.001); changes in knee angle resulted in consistent shifts along the rows (P < 0.01) and negligible shifts along the columns of the electrode grid. Regional VM activation was identified in dynamic movement, with distal shifts of the EMG distribution in the eccentric phase of the movement (P < 0.05) and at more flexed knee angles (P < 0.05). HDsEMG was used to describe regional activation across the VM that was not attributable to anatomic factors.

Understanding which factors motivate their willingness to work (WTW) during infectious disease outbreaks may guide improvements in preparedness. The perspective of health care students, the future workforce, remains largely unexplored. This study compared factors influencing WTW among medical, nursing, and pharmacy students. METHODS A printed survey was administered to 631 medical, nursing, and pharmacy students. The questionnaire elicited information regarding prior disaster training, disease-related knowledge, and WTW in the setting of infectious diseases with contact or respiratory transmission. RESULTS Analyses of the 579 respondents (92% response rate) demonstrated that students were less fearful for their health and more willing to work during outbreaks with contact transmission than during those with respiratory transmission. Medical students were the most fearful for their health, but they demonstrated the greatest WTW, followed by nursing students, and then pharmacy students. Medical students were also the most knowledgeable about infectious diseases. Prior disaster training was associated with greater WTW. CONCLUSIONS Extent of disease-related knowledge and prior disaster training appear to influence WTW.

The average age was 68 (15) years old, and the proportion of men (162/302) was slightly more than that of women (140/302). In this study, a deep learning based model UNet was applied to extract lesion areas from chest CT images. Lesion areas were extracted and classified by a designed spatial attention mechanism network. The model AUC and diagnostic accuracy were analyzed based on the results of the model. We analyzed the accuracy rate, sensitivity, and specificity and compared the results of the model to the junior and senior radiologists and radiologists based on the model. RESULTS: The model has a good efficiency in detecting pneumonia-like lesions (6.31 seconds/case). The model accuracy rate, sensitivity, and specificity were 74.20%, 60.37%, and 89.36%, respectively. The junior radiologist's accuracy rate, sensitivity, and specificity were 61.00%, 48.08%, and 75.00%, respectively.

Method: Child suicide rates between April to December 2020 were compared with those in 2019 using negative binomial regression models, and characteristics compared. In a subset (1st January to 17th May 2020) further characteristics and possible contributing factors were obtained. Results: A total of 193 likely childhood deaths by suicide were reported. There was no evidence overall suicide deaths were higher in 2020 than 2019 (RR 1.09 (0.80-1.48), p=0.584) but weak evidence that the rate in the first lockdown period (April to May 2020) was higher than the corresponding period in 2019 (RR 1.56 (0.86-2.81), p=0.144).

Methods: : We conducted a retrospective study on 42 patients (14 males, 28 females;age 6510 years) with COVID-19 admitted between February 7, 2020 and March 27, 2020. Only patients with at least 3 CT scans taken at least 3 weeks after initial symptom onset were included in the study. CT images were analyzed by 2 independent radiologists using different scoring: (1) area-based scoring (ABS);and (2) intensity-weighted scoring (IWS). Temporal changes in the average lung lesion were evaluated by averaged area under the curve (AUC) of the CT score-time curve. Correlations between averaged AUCs and clinical characteristics were determined. Results: Temporal changes in lung abnormalities during recovery (weeks 3 through 8) of CT findings using the ABS system were variable (P=0.934). By contrast, the IWS system detected more subtle changes in lung abnormalities during the late phase of recovery in COVID-19 patients, with consistent week-to-week relative reductions in IWS (P=0.025). In assessing the correlation between averaged AUCs and clinical characteristics, strong relationships were observed with D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on admission, with hazard ratios (HR)(95%CI) of 5.32 (1.25-22.6)(P=0.026) and 1.05 (1.10-1.09)(P=0.017), respectively. Conclusion: Our results suggest an intensity-weighted rather than area-based scoring system is more sensitive to detect subtle temporal CT changes in COVID-19, with D-dimer and CRP levels on admission being predictive of the time course of late phase recovery from the disease.","output":"Computation Tomography (CT)-Based Evaluation of Temporal Changes in Lung Abnormalities During the Recovery Stage in COVID-19 In-Hospital Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess how different bans on serving alcohol in Norwegian bars and restaurants were related to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in bartenders and waiters and in persons in any occupation. METHODS: In 25 392 bartenders and waiters and 1 496 328 persons with other occupations (mean (SD) age 42.0 (12.9) years and 51.8% men), we examined the weekly rates of workers tested and detected with SARS-CoV-2, 1-10 weeks before and 1-5 weeks after implementation of different degrees of bans on serving alcohol in pubs and restaurants, across 102 Norwegian municipalities with: (1) full blanket ban, (2) partial ban with hourly restrictions (eg, from 22:00 hours) or (3) no ban, adjusted for age, sex, testing behaviour and population size. RESULTS: By 4 weeks after the implementation of ban, COVID-19 infection among bartenders and waiters had been reduced by 60% (from 2.8 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.6) to 1.1 (95% CI 0.5 to 1.6) per 1000) in municipalities introducing full ban, and by almost 50% (from 2.5 (95% CI 1.5 to 3.5) to 1.3 (95% CI 0.4 to 2.2) per 1000) in municipalities introducing partial ban. A similar reduction within 4 weeks was also observed for workers in all occupations, both in municipalities with full (from 1.3 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.4) to 0.9 (95% CI 0.9 to 1.0)) and partial bans (from 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.3) to 0.5 (95% CI 0.5 to 0.6)).

It is unknown whether conventional short-term load forecasting methods based on single-task, single-region, and conventional indicators can accurately capture the load pattern during the COVID-19 and should be carefully studied. In this paper, we make the following contributions: 1) A mobility-optimized load forecasting method based on multi-task learning and long short-term memory network is innovatively proposed to alleviate the impact of the COVID-19 on short-term load forecasting. The incorporation of mobility data and data sharing layers potentially reduces the difficulty of capturing the load patterns and improves the generalization of the load forecasting models. 2) The real public data collected from multiple agencies and companies in the United States and European countries are used to conduct horizontal and vertical tests. These tests prove the failure of the conventional models and methods in the COVID-19 and demonstrate the high accuracy (error mostly less than 1%) and robustness of the proposed model. 3) The Shapley additive explanations technology based on game theory is innovatively introduced to improve the objectivity of the models. It visualizes that mobility indicators are of great help to the accurate load forecasting.

Across the 7 U.S. cities with taxes, the average annual revenue from SSB taxes totaled $133.9 M. In the fiscal year studied, cities allocated a total of $133.2 M in SSB tax revenues. Human and community capital investments totaled $89.6 M (67% of all allocations) funding early childhood development, community infrastructure improvements, and youth and workforce development. Health-related investments totaled $36.9 M (28% of total allocations), funding access to healthy foods and beverages; support for physical activity opportunities; promotion of overall physical, mental or social health and wellbeing; health and nutrition education; chronic-disease prevention and management; and reducing SSB consumption. In the 3 cities that specified how tax revenues would be spent, allocations were consistent with promised uses of revenues. In addition, 85% of aggregated revenues ($112.9 M) were targeted to support work and programs in impacted communities (communities that experience health inequities, discrimination and exclusion).

We aimed to further study seasonality of respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens in relation to antibiotic use, as well as meteorological parameters. METHODS: An ecologic study of antibiotic exposure, meteorological parameters, detection of respiratory viruses and clinical isolates of Clostridioides difficile, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (grouped together as gram-negative bacteria; GNB) in Rhode Island from 2012 to 2016. RESULTS: Peak detection of C. difficile occurred 3 months after the peak in antibiotic prescriptions filled (OR = 1.24, 95% CI, 1.07C1.43; P = 0.006). Peak MRSA detection was noted 7 months after the peak in antibiotic prescriptions filled (OR = 1.69, 95% CI, 1.21C2.35; P = 0.003) and 10 months after the peak in respiratory virus detection (OR = 1.04, 95% CI, 1.01C1.06; P = 0.003). Peak GNB detection was noted 2 months after the peak mean monthly ambient temperature (OR = 1.69, 95% C.I., 1.20C2.39; P = 0.004).

Students who are just starting clinical practice have a lack of clinical knowledge, skill proficiency, and patient communication skills, so they experience anxiety and lack of confidence in clinical setting. Practice in a safe environment, such as simulation education, can help students perform more settled and competently in patient care. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of high-fidelity simulation experience on anxiety and confidence in medical students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study enrolled 37 5(th)-year students at Ajou University School of Medicine in 2020. Two simulation trainings were implemented, and a survey was conducted to measure students level of anxiety and confidence before and after each simulation. Based on the research data, a paired t-test was conducted to compare these variables before and after the simulation, and whether this was their first or second simulation experience. RESULTS: Students had a significantly lower level of anxiety and a significantly higher level of confidence after the simulation than before. In addition, after one simulation experience, students had less anxiety and more confidence before the second simulation compared to those without simulation experience. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that medical students need to be repeatedly exposed to simulation education experiences in order to have a sense of psychological stability and to competently deliver medical treatment in a clinical setting.

For example, it has been used with patients suffering from autism spectrum symptoms, medical difficulties, behavioral problems, and emotional disorders. More recently, this type of intervention has been increasingly used in the workplace to mitigate the effects of stress in employees (including healthcare workers). The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the potential benefits of animal-assisted intervention in healthcare workers. ABSTRACT: Healthcare settings have recently increased the use of companion animals in the workplace to provide emotional support to people with disabilities, but there is limited empirical research on the effects of these programs on healthcare workers. However, it is reasonable to speculate that Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAIs) may have positive effects on health care workers (HCWs) by buffering the negative effects of work-related stress and other occupational psychosocial risk factors. The aim of this review was to examine the beneficial effects of AAIs on the psychological well-being of HCWs. A systematic review was conducted in December 2021 to gain insight into the positive effects of pets on HCWs in the workplace. Searches were conducted in the following databases: Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, including studies between 2001 and December 2021, and 12 articles were included in the review. The results indicate that implementing the AAI program in a busy clinic is feasible and that the program is accepted by medical professionals because of the immense psychological benefits it provides.

Lockdown could be a factor in the emergence or deterioration of psychological disorders; it can be even more fragilizing during the specific period of adolescence. The ? Maisons des Adolescents ? (Teenagers' Houses) had to urgently adjust their practices to provide continuity of care for adolescents suffering from physical or mental disorders. The ? Maisons des Adolescents ? are pluridisciplinary care centres for adolescents and their families that provide assessments and services for medical, psychological, socio-educational, educational and legal needs. How did care continue for adolescents during lockdown? What adjustments occurred in the ? Maisons des Adolescents ? during the health crisis? METHODS: This article presents the case of an adolescent who suffered a significant deterioration of her anorexia nervosa during confinement. Through this case, we describe the reorganization of care within the different units (consultations - day hospital - hospitalization unit) of a Parisian ? Maison des Adolescents ? during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: In this service, the rapid implementation of the telemedicine system in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic made possible provision of continuity in care for vulnerable adolescents and families. Based on the existing literature, we discuss the advantages and limitations of telemedicine and the practical issues for the future organization of care for adolescents. PERSPECTIVES: In contrast to pediatric medicine or child psychiatry, there is no protocol describing the application of telemedicine in adolescent medicine and psychiatry. There is an urgent need for further evaluation of the use of telemedicine for this population. This kind of research will improve knowledge about the effectiveness, acceptability and limitations of using a teleconsultation device in adolescent psychiatry in a crisis context. Certain remote care modalities implemented during the sanitary crisis could thus be maintained over time and become routine in the field of adolescent medicine and psychiatry.","output":"[Adjustment of healthcare and telemedicine in times of lockdown and COVID-19 pandemic: feedback from a \\"Maison des Adolescents\\" (Teenager's House)]./ Adaptation des soins et tlmdecine en priode de confinement et de pandmie de COVID-19: retour d'exprience d'une Maison des Adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The latest COVID-19 pandemic outbreak posed a significant risk to millions of people worldwide who are safe and well-being As the environment continues to be open from lockdowns and becomes unprecedentedly tenuous or what many called a new norm, it makes sense to focus on what the society has experienced, re-examine our fundamental beliefs, and map the path of designing and creating a sustainable world This article has summarized the latest technologies that have been recently implemented to control the spreading of COVID-19 through embedded smart monitoring systems and communicate effectively with the building management infrastructure This article also discussed the statistical research analysis, which motivates the achievement of the targeted sustainable development goals (SDGs) Last but not least, the implemented technologies and their related variables to be controlled, challenges, and new perspectives were also addressed ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"Opportunities and challenges for the building monitoring systems in the age-pandemic of COVID-19: Review and prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergency 3D-printing of medical devices came out as a potential solution to tackle shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This review aims to summarize the pharmacological activities that lead to the influential role of Lf against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: An all-inclusive search of published articles was carried out to focus on publications related to Lf and its biological/pharmacological activities using various literature databases, including the scientific databases Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, Google, EMBASE, and Scientific Information (SID). Results: By acting on cell targets, Lf prevents viral attachment, surface accumulation on the host cell, and virus penetration. Lf has shown high antiviral effectiveness across a broad spectrum of viruses, suggesting that it might be used to cure and prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Lf can also attach to viral particles directly, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), and steer them away from certain sites. LF has a powerful attraction for iron, with a constant of approximately 10(20) . Lf capacity to link iron relies on the existence of (minute amounts of) bicarbonate. The bacteriostatic effect of Lf is due to its capability to come together with free iron, which is one of the ingredients necessary for bacterial development. Lf located in neutrophil secondary granules is essential for host defense. Conclusion: Researchers confirmed that Lf activates natural killer (NK) cells in a study. Lf has been shown in certain studies to prevent patronization in pseudovirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases that leads to attenuation of SARS-CoV-2. Lf may decrease inflammation induced by microbial exposure and directly reduce bacterial growth.

However, it is not known whether paricalcitol prevents neuronal injury after global cerebral ischemia. The purpose of this study is to investigate the neuroprotective effect of paricalcitol in a rat model of transient global cerebral ischemia. METHODS This is a prospective, randomized experimental study. Male Sprague-Dawley rats that survived 10 min of four-vessel occlusion were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: one group was treated with paricalcitol 1 g/kg IP, and the other was given an equivalent volume of normal saline IP. Drugs were administered at 5 min, 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days after ischemia. Neurologic function was assessed at 2 h, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, and 4 days after ischemia. We tested motor function 3 days after ischemia using the rotarod test. Also, we tested memory function 4 days after ischemia using the passive avoidance test. We assessed neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus of surviving rats 4 days after ischemia. RESULTS Eight rats were allocated to each group. No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of survival rate, motor coordination, or memory function. The neurological function score 2-h post-ischemia was significantly higher in the paricalcitol group (p = 0.04). Neuronal degeneration was significantly less in the paricalcitol group compared with the control group (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Paricalcitol significantly attenuated neuronal injury in the hippocampus.

The availability of social media platforms has played a vital role in providing and obtaining information about any ongoing event. However, consuming a vast amount of online textual data to predict an event's trends can be troublesome. To our knowledge, no study analyzes the online news articles and the disease data about coronavirus disease. Therefore, we propose an LDA-based topic model, called PAN-LDA (Pandemic-Latent Dirichlet allocation), that incorporates the COVID-19 cases data and news articles into common LDA to obtain a new set of features. The generated features are introduced as additional features to Machine learning(ML) algorithms to improve the forecasting of time series data.

That error will lead to biased prevalence estimates. If the true prevalence of COVID-19 is low, possibly in the range of 1-5%, then testing error will lead to a constant background of bias that will most likely be larger and possibly much larger than the true prevalence itself. As a result, what is needed is a method for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error. In this paper we outline methods for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error both prospectively in studies being planned and retrospectively in studies that have been conducted. The methods if employed would also help to harmonize study results within countries and around the world.

This study compares two different sites of endoscopic psoas tenotomy performed following THA: at the edge of the acetabulum (AR) versus at the lesser trochanter (LT). This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from a single-surgeon case series. Thirty-five iliopsoas tenotomy cases which had >24-month follow-up were identified. There were 21 tenotomies at the lesser trochanter. Demographic data, preop and postop pain, mHHS and NAHS scores, strength and patient satisfaction data were collected and analysed. Average age at the time of surgery was 62. Mean follow-up for the LT group was 49.11 months and 42.42 months for the AR group. Pain decreased significantly for both groups (P < 0.001). Both mHHS and NAHS showed superiority in the LT group, but this difference did not reach significance (P = 0.06). LT patients showed better strength with 71.42% of them having normal strength at latest follow-up, compared with 41.6% in the AR group. There were no complications in either group. Endoscopic tenotomy is a safe and reliable surgical option, giving significant pain relief and good functional outcomes. Tenotomy at the level of the lesser trochanter might be preferable since it shows better outcomes.

This paper aims to provide insight into shifts in alcohol consumption and associated factors during the epidemic. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional convenience sample of 2307 Australians aged 18 and over who drank at least monthly was recruited through social media. Respondents were asked about their alcohol consumption and purchasing in 2019 prior to the epidemic plus similar questions about their experiences in the month prior to being surveyed between 29 April and 16 May 2020. RESULTS: Reports of average consumption before (3.53 drinks per day [3.36, 3.71 95% confidence interval]) and during (3.52 [3.34, 3.69]) the pandemic were stable. However, young men and those who drank more outside the home in 2019 reported decreased consumption during the pandemic, and people with high levels of stress and those who bulk-bought alcohol when restrictions were announced reported an increase in consumption relative to those who did not. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: A reported increase in consumption among those experiencing more stress suggests that some people may have been drinking to cope during the epidemic. Conversely, the reported decrease in consumption among those who drank more outside of their home in 2019 suggests that closing all on-trade sales did not result in complete substitution of on-premise drinking with home drinking in this group.

The goal of this study was to determine the quality of those recommendations and provide suggestions to hospital managers for the adjustment of existing hospital prevention and control strategies, and also to offer recommendations for further research. DESIGN: A rapid review of the guidelines and consensuses for the management in paediatric wards facing COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, UpToDate, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Wanfang database and relevant websites such as medlive.cn, dxy.cn, the National Health and Health Commission and the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention were systematically searched through late May 2020. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool was then used to assess the quality of the selected articles and summarise the relevant evidence concerning management in paediatric wards. RESULTS: A total of 35 articles were included, composed of 3 consensus guidelines, 25 expert consensuses and 7 expert opinions. Of the 35 papers, 24 were from China, 2 from the USA, 1 from Spain, 1 from Brazil, 1 from Saudi Arabia and 6 from multinational cooperative studies. Scores for the six domains of the AGREE II tool (scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, applicability and editorial independence) were 98.57%, 53.57%, 17.92%, 69.62%, 26.96% and 50.35%, respectively. Recommendations for nosocomial infection and control, human resource management as well as management of paediatric patients and their families were summarised. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the quality of rapid guidelines and consensuses for the management in paediatric wards affected by COVID-19 is unsatisfactory. In the future, it will be necessary to develop more high-quality guidelines or consensuses for the management in paediatric wards to deal with nosocomial outbreaks in order to fully prepare for emergency medical and health problems.","output":"Management in the paediatric wards facing novel coronavirus infection: a rapid review of guidelines and consensuses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increase in the surgical waiting list as a health consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic: a Balearic perspective.","output":"[Increase in the surgical waiting list as a health consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic: a Balearic perspective.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) infection has been announced as a global health problem nowadays The loss of smell and taste are frequent complains of COVID-19 patients However, the exact mechanism underlying these manifestations remains unclear This study aimed to determine the prevalence, identify potential risk factors and detect recovery of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in confirmed COVID-19 patients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on confirmed COVID-19 patients in KSA The study recruited patients of both sexes, aged 18 and above, and clinically stable All participants are invited to complete an electronic questionnaire to give data on their age, sex, comorbidities, general and otolaryngologic symptoms and olfactory and gustatory status, and the recovery of this presentation Results: The study recruited 428 confirmed COVID-19 patients Of these 15 4% were health care workers, 20 3% were smokers, 8 6% had asthma and chest diseases, 6 1% were diabetic and 10 7% had recurrent inflammations Loss of smell/taste was reported by 75 2% of patients, with 13 1% had loss of smell only, 5 8% had loss of taste only and 56 3% had both Complete improvement of smell/taste disorders was reported by 51 2% The duration needed for improvement was 1 week in 32 2%, &gt;3 weeks in 34 4% Non improvement was reported by 14 3% and was more likely in younger patients (18-25 years) Other reported COVID-19 manifestations were fever (63 8%), tiredness and body ache (61 2%), headache (59 1%), sore throat (30 4%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (21 1%) Conclusion: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are common presentation of COVID-19 infection in KSA They might present early and without other symptoms, which can help in diagnosis of COVID-19 infection","output":"The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus infectious diseases (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that has taken a strong grip on the entire global community.

However, multivariate empirical studies investigating its determinants are still limited. We document variation in COVID-19 case and death rates across different racial/ethnic neighbourhoods in New York City (NYC), the initial epicentre of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, and conduct a multivariate ecological analysis investigating how various neighbourhood characteristics might explain any observed disparities. METHODS: Using ZIP-code-level COVID-19 case and death data from the NYC Department of Health, demographic and socioeconomic data from the American Community Survey and health data from the Centers for Disease Control's 500 Cities Project, we estimated a series of negative binomial regression models to assess the relationship between neighbourhood racial/ethnic composition (majority non-Hispanic White, majority Black, majority Hispanic and Other-type), neighbourhood poverty, affluence, proportion of essential workers, proportion with pre-existing health conditions and neighbourhood COVID-19 case and death rates. RESULTS: COVID-19 case and death rates for majority Black, Hispanic and Other-type minority communities are between 24% and 110% higher than those in majority White communities. Elevated case rates are completely accounted for by the larger presence of essential workers in minority communities but excess deaths in Black neighbourhoods remain unexplained in the final model. CONCLUSIONS: The unequal COVID-19 case burden borne by NYC's minority communities is closely tied to their representation among the ranks of essential workers.

Results Valid responses were received from 36 hospitals. Most of these programmes offered both in-person and online therapy. The most common aim of these interventions was emotional regulation, which was treated by psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioural techniques in individual interventions. Group interventions mainly used psychoeducation and mindfulness. Only half of the teams that offered in-person interventions received training in the proper use of personal protective equipment. Conclusions Several hospitals in Spain have developed mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying a wide range of therapeutic modalities and techniques. The rapid implementation of these programmes during the pandemic suggests that safety may not have received sufficient attention.

However, the Swedish government has not implemented such measures but rather depended on individual responsibility. An important question regarding the extent to which individuals have been encouraged to trust in and be satisfied with government strategies and adopt personal health measures, such as social isolation, remains unanswered. This study aims to examine the direct effects of trust in the government and risk perception on self-efficacy. Most importantly, this study intends to explore whether satisfaction with government measures augments the relationships between trust in the government and self-efficacy and between risk perception and self-efficacy. Thus, we test our suggested hypotheses using survey data obtained from 403 Swedish citizens living in Sweden, and as predicted, the findings indicate that trust in the government and risk perception positively impact individual self-efficacy. Additionally, the findings reveal that satisfaction with government measures strengthens this relationship;more precisely, the impact of trust in the government and risk perception under a high level of individual satisfaction with government measures is much more positive than that under a low level of satisfaction. In practice, a focus on implementing successful policies or strategies and excellent individual self-efficacy are required to halt the pandemic, and the findings indicate that combining strictly attentive and adaptive individual strategies with government strategies can minimize the spread of infection.","output":"The Swedish Gamble and the Battle to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from the Field"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current battle against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus-2 benefits from the worldwide distribution of different vaccine formulations.

Emerging evidence suggests that management should be guided in part by symptom burden; however, there is currently no standardized assessment tool for quantifying symptom burden in this pediatric population. This study aimed to develop and refine a patient-reported symptom assessment tool for children with CKD/kidney failure (PRO-Kid), to evaluate the frequency and impact of symptoms. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of children and caregivers of children with CKD/kidney failure at two Canadian pediatric care centers. Building on previously published patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) for the assessment of symptom burden in other populations, we drafted a 13-item questionnaire. Cognitive interviews were performed with children and caregivers of children with CKD/kidney failure to iteratively refine the questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-four participants completed cognitive interviewing (11 children, 13 caregivers). The most common symptoms endorsed were feeling left out, feeling sad/depressed, inability to focus, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, not wanting to eat, and changes in the taste of food. Feeling left out was added to the questionnaire as almost all participants voiced this as a frequent and impactful symptom, resulting in a 14-item questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: PRO-Kid is the first pediatric CKD/kidney failure-specific PRO tool to assess symptom burden.

We highlight recent developments in three promising areas of telemedicine: teleconsultation, telemonitoring, and teletreatment. We illustrate this using Parkinson's disease as a model for other chronic neurological disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Teleconsultations can reliably administer parts of the neurological examination remotely, but are typically not useful for establishing a reliable diagnosis. For follow-ups, teleconsultations can provide enhanced comfort and convenience to patients, and provide opportunities for blended and proactive care models. Barriers include technological challenges, limited clinician confidence, and a suboptimal clinician-patient relationship. Telemonitoring using wearable sensors and smartphone-based apps can support clinical decision-making, but we lack large-scale randomized controlled trials to prove effectiveness on clinical outcomes. Increasingly many trials are now incorporating telemonitoring as an exploratory outcome, but more work remains needed to demonstrate its clinical meaningfulness. Finding a balance between benefits and burdens for individual patients remains vital. Recent work emphasised the promise of various teletreatment solutions, such as remotely adjustable deep brain stimulation parameters, virtual reality enhanced exercise programs, and telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy. Personal contact remains essential to ascertain adherence to teletreatment. SUMMARY: The availability of different telemedicine tools for remote consultation, monitoring, and treatment is increasing.

The human intestine was found to be a major viral target which could have a strong impact on virus spread and pathogenesis since it is one of the largest organs. While type I interferons (IFNs) are key cytokines acting against systemic virus spread, in the human intestine type III IFNs play a major role by restricting virus infection and dissemination without disturbing homeostasis. Recent studies showed that both type I and III IFNs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is not clear whether one IFN controls SARS-CoV-2 infection of the human intestine better or with a faster kinetics. In this study, we could show that type I and III IFNs both possess antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs); however, type III IFN is more potent. Shorter type III IFN pretreatment times and lower concentrations were required to efficiently reduce virus load compared to type I IFNs. Moreover, type III IFNs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 even 4 h postinfection and induced a long-lasting antiviral effect in hIECs. Importantly, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to type III IFNs was virus specific since type III IFN did not control VSV infection as efficiently. Together, these results suggest that type III IFNs have a higher potential for IFN-based treatment of SARS-CoV-2 intestinal infection compared to type I IFNs. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 infection is not restricted to the respiratory tract and a large number of COVID-19 patients experience gastrointestinal distress. Interferons are key molecules produced by the cell to combat virus infection. Here, we evaluated how two types of interferons (type I and III) can combat SARS-CoV-2 infection of human gut cells. We found that type III interferons were crucial to control SARS-CoV-2 infection when added both before and after infection. Importantly, type III interferons were also able to produce a long-lasting effect, as cells were protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 72 h posttreatment. This study suggested an alternative treatment possibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Increased Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to Type III Interferon in Human Intestinal Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction True aneurysms of peripancreatic arterial arcades (PAAAs) coexisting with celiac axis lesion are often asymptomatic.

Typical CT patterns of viral pneumonia were exhibited in 40 (54.1%) children, including ground-glass opacity and interstitial abnormalities. However, 17 (23.0%) children were classified as asymptomatic carriers, with neither symptoms nor radiological findings. Also, 68 (91.9%) children recovered fully and showed negative results on RT-PCR assay by nasopharyngeal swabs during our observation period. In contrast to the negative result for nasopharyngeal swab, 34% of the anal swabs showed a continued positive result. The mean hospitalization days of the children discharged after full recovery was 10.0 days. Conclusion: Within family clusters that had SARS-CoV-2 infection, children had mild or even asymptomatic illness. Although CT is highly sensitive, it should be avoided in follow-up of the disease in consideration of the radiological hazards and limited clinical benefits for mild illness in children. Furthermore, it is advocated that both nasopharyngeal and anal swabs should be confirmed negative for viral load prior to declaring full recovery so as to avoid oral-fecal transmission. Asymptomatic children with family clusters are potentially a little-known source of COVID-19. This therefore warrants an urgent reassessment of the transmission dynamics of the current outbreak.","output":"Children Infected With SARS-CoV-2 From Family Clusters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnant women are diverse, and little is known of the impact of the disease on placental physiology Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been detected in the human placenta, and its binding receptor ACE2 is present in a variety of placental cells, including endothelium Here, we analyze the impact of COVID-19 in placental endothelium, studying by immunofluorescence the expression of von Willebrand factor (vWf), claudin-5, and vascular endothelial (VE) cadherin in the decidua and chorionic villi of placentas from women with mild and severe COVID-19 in comparison to healthy controls Our results indicate that: (1) vWf expression increases in the endothelium of decidua and chorionic villi of placentas derived from women with COVID-19, being higher in severe cases;(2) Claudin-5 and VE-cadherin expression decrease in the decidua and chorionic villus of placentas from women with severe COVID-19 but not in those with mild disease Placental histological analysis reveals thrombosis, infarcts, and vascular wall remodeling, confirming the deleterious effect of COVID-19 on placental vessels Together, these results suggest that placentas from women with COVID-19 have a condition of leaky endothelium and thrombosis, which is sensitive to disease severity","output":"Molecular Insights into the Thrombotic and Microvascular Injury in Placental Endothelium of Women with Mild or Severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In French Guiana were detected high lead (Pb) levels in blood of Amerindian people. Lead exposure is a serious hazard that can affect the cognitive and behavior development. People can be exposed to Pb through occupational and environmental sources. Fingerprinting based on stable Pb isotopes in environmental media is often used to trace natural and anthropogenic sources but is rarely paired with blood data. The objective of this study was to determine the main factors associated with high Blood Lead Levels (BLL). Soil, manioc tubers, food bowls, beverages, wild games, lead pellets and children blood were sampled in small villages along the Oyapock River. children BLL ranged between 5.7 and 35 g dL-1, all exceeding 5 g dL-1, the reference value proposed in epidemiologic studies for lead poisoning. Among the different dietary sources, manioc tubers and large game contained elevated Pb concentrations while manioc-based dishes were diluted. The isotopes ratios (207Pb/206Pb and 208Pb/206Pb) of children blood overlapped these of lead shots and meals. These first results confirm for the first time, the diary consumption of manioc-based food as the main contributor to Amerindian children's BLL in French Guiana, but don't exclude the occasional exposure to lead bullets by hunting activities. This is a specific health concern, since previous studies have shown that these same villagers present high levels of mercury (Hg). These communities are indeed subject to a double exposure to neurotoxic metals, Hg and Pb, both through their diet. The farming activity is based on manioc growing, and explaining that this ancestral practice can induce serious health risks for the child's development may seriously affect their food balance and cultural cohesion.","output":"Childhood lead exposure of Amerindian communities in French Guiana: an isotopic approach to tracing sources."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: High intake of added sugar have been suggested to impact the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Knowledge on the subject can contribute to preventing CVD. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of a high versus low-added sugar consumption for primary prevention of CVD in the general population. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) on 2 July 2021. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal for ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was performed together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no restriction on language of publication or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross-over trials, that compared different levels of added sugar intake. Exclusion criteria were: participants aged below 18 years; diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2); and previous CVD. Primary outcomes were incident cardiovascular events (coronary, carotid, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease) and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and adverse events (gastrointestinal symptoms and impaired dental health). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 RCTs (1110 participants completing the interventions) examining the effects of different levels of added sugar intake with a mean duration of 14 weeks. The study participants were generally described as healthy and the mean age ranged from 22 to 57 years. No studies reported on cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality. There was minimal effect of low intake of added sugar on total cholesterol levels (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21; I2 = 0%; 16 studies; 763 participants; low certainty of evidence) and triglycerides (MD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17; I2 = 3%; 14 studies; 725 participants) but no evidence of effect on LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol. There was minimal effect on diastolic blood pressure (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.37; I2 = 0%; 13 studies; 873 participants) and on systolic blood pressure (MD 1.44, 95% 0.08 to 2.80; I2 = 27%, 14 studies; 873 participants; low certainty of evidence), but no evidence of effect on fasting plasma glucose. Only one study reported on dental health, with no events. No other trials reported adverse events (impaired dental health or gastrointestinal symptoms). All results were judged as low-quality evidence according to GRADE. The risk of bias was generally unclear, five studies were classified at an overall low risk of bias (low risk in at least four domains, not including other bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No trials investigating the effect of added sugar on cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality were identified in our searches. Evidence is uncertain whether low intake of added sugar has an effect on risk factors for CVD; the effect was small and the clinical relevance is, therefore, uncertain. Practical ways to achieve reductions in dietary added sugar includes following current dietary recommendations. Future trials should have longer follow-up time and report on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in order to clarify the effect of added sugar on these outcomes. Future trials should also aim for more direct interventions and preferably be more independent of industry funding.","output":"High versus low-added sugar consumption for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health-care-associated infection (HAI) is a major issue of patient safety with a substantial impact on morbidity, mortality, and use of additional resources worldwide.

Therefore, the targeted elimination or permanent silencing of this latently infected reservoir is a major focus of HIV-1 research.

However, its unsupervised nature increases ease of cheating, which is an academic integrity concern. This study's purpose was to evaluate the integrity of two online open book assessments with different formats (1. Tightly time restricted - 50 min for mid-semester and 2. Take home - any 4 h within a 24-h window for end of semester) implemented in a radiologic pathology unit of a Bachelor of Science (Medical Radiation Science) course during the pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective study involving a review and analysis of existing information related to the integrity of the two radiologic pathology assessments. Three integrity evaluation approaches were employed. The first approach was to review all the Turnitin plagiarism detection software reports with use of seven-words-in-a-row criterion to identify any potential collusion. The second approach was to search for highly irrelevant assessment answers during marking for detection of other cheating types. Examples of highly irrelevant answers included those not addressing question requirements and stating patients' clinical information not from given patient histories. The third approach was an assessment score statistical analysis through descriptive and inferential statistics to identify any abnormal patterns that might suggest cheating occurred. An abnormal pattern example was high assessment scores. The descriptive statistics used were minimum, maximum, range, first quartile, median, third quartile, interquartile range, mean, standard deviation, fail and full mark rates. T-test was employed to compare mean scores between the two assessments in this year (2020), between the two assessments in the last year (2019), between the two mid-semester assessments in 2019 and 2020, and between this and last years' end of semester assessments. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: No cheating evidence was found in all Turnitin reports and assessment answers. The mean scores of the end of semester assessments in 2019 (88.2%) and 2020 (90.9%) were similar (p = 0.098). However, the mean score of the online open book mid-semester assessment in 2020 (62.8%) was statistically significantly lower than that of the traditional invigilated mid-semester assessment in 2019 (71.8%) with p < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: This study shows the use of the online open book assessments with tight time restrictions and the take home formats in the radiologic pathology unit did not have any academic integrity issues. Apparently, the strict assessment time limit played an important role in maintaining their integrity.","output":"Evaluation of academic integrity of online open book assessments implemented in an undergraduate medical radiation science course during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are common infectious diseases in humans transmitted through unprotected sexual activities. In South Korea, despite the high annual incidence of STDs, detailed examinations of pathogen-specific factors and causes for delays in diagnosis and treatment are still lacking. Furthermore, STD prevalence patterns and important pathogen-specific factors remain unclear. Herein, we retrospectively analyzed the epidemiology of STDs in South Korea in 2019 by analyzing the association of pathogen-specific infection patterns with factors such as sex, age, region, and month. Methods: We obtained the STD test results of 172,973 individuals from the Seoul Clinic Laboratory in 2019, most of whom had multiple infections; hence, 275,296 STD-positive cases were included in this analysis. Through deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) amplification, they were categorized by pathogen type. Subsequently, they were further classified by month, region, and age while concurrently being stratified according to sex. Results: Among the 12 pathogens detected in this study, Gardnerella vaginalis had the highest prevalence, with 92,490 cases in both sex groups; moreover, many of them were concurrently infected by two or more pathogens. The prevalence of STDs did not differ according to month or region. Conversely, the pathogen-specific prevalence rates significantly differed according to age. Older adults had higher prevalence rates of Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida albicans, and herpes simplex virus type 1 infections than younger adults. Conclusion: These pathogen-specific prevalence patterns provide information that helps to understand population vulnerability according to region and age and helps develop STD prevention and treatment strategies in South Korea.","output":"Trend Analysis of the Profiles of 12 Sexually Transmitted Disease Pathogens in the Republic of Korea in 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On April 8th, 2020, the Chinese government lifted the lockdown and opened up public transportation in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. After 76 days in lockdown, Wuhan residents were allowed to travel outside of the city and go back to work. Yet, given that there is still no vaccine for the virus, this leaves many doubting whether life will indeed go back to normal. The aim of this research was to track longitudinal changes in motivation for self-isolating, life structured, indicators of well-being and mental health after lockdown was lifted. We have recruited 462 participants in Wuhan, China, prior to lockdown lift between the 3rd and 7th of April, 2020 (Time 1), and have followed up with 292 returning participants between 18th and 22nd of April, 2020 (Time 2), 284 between 6th and 10th of May, 2020 (Time 3), and 279 between 25th and 29th of May, 2020 (Time 4). This 4-wave study used latent growth models to examine how Wuhan residents psychological experiences change (if at all) within the first two months after lockdown was lifted.

RESULTS: The present nano-formula reported a superior microbial reduction of 99.999% against a wide number of microorganisms. Furthermore, the enveloped H5N1 virus was wholly inactivated after 15 min of disinfection. Far more attractive, the current method for reusing surgical masks did not show outcomes of detrimental amendments, suggesting that the protocol does not alter the filtration effectiveness.

Moreover, investor attention plays a partial mediating role in transmitting the impact of P&A policies on NEV stock market by increasing the stock volatility risk. Furthermore, there is heterogeneous effect of equity ownership in the relationship between policy announcement and investor attention on the volatility of NEV concept stocks; non-state-owned firms are more sensitive to the NEV P&A policies than state-owned firms.

Mg deficiency contributes to chronic low-grade inflammation leading to cardiovascular diseases, and low Mg level exacerbates virus-induced inflammation.

This was a single-center, observational retrospective study of patients with COVID-19. The study population was divided into two groups according to in-hospital mortality: a survivor group (SG) and a non-survivor group (NSG). Myocardial damage was defined as blood levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) above the 99th percentile upper reference limit. Magnesium, variables regarding inflammation, and myocardial damage were compared between the groups. A total of 629 patients with COVID-19 were included. Mortality rate was 11.85% (n = 82).

People were more risk-averse in the loss condition of the current study compared to the benchmark established by Tversky and Kahneman (1981). Among the Dark Triad traits, psychopathy emerged as the significant predictor of risk taking, suggesting that people who score high in psychopathy are more likely to gamble with other people's lives during the COVID-19 crisis. We suggest that both voters and pandemic-related public awareness campaigns should consider the possibility that decision-makers with psychopathic tendencies may take greater risks with other people's lives during a pandemic.

However, in some territories teachers often use recess for other purposes (e.g., childrens poor classroom behavior might be punished with reduced time for recess). This study aimed to examine the impact of such practices on childrens physical activity (PA) and the relationships between PA, gender, body mass index (BMI), and academic achievement. Forty-six first-grade students from two natural classrooms wore an accelerometer over the course of 6 weeks to measure their metabolic equivalent of task (METs) and sedentary behavior during school recess. Gender, age, BMI, the classroom to which students belonged, and academic achievement were also analyzed in two Generalized Estimating Equations models. Results revealed that boys achieved more METs and spent less time participating in sedentary behavior than girls during recess. Children within a healthy weight range of BMI yielded more METs than underweight and overweight/obese children. Academic achievement was positively associated with the METS and negatively with the sedentary behavior. Finally, withholding all or part of school recess significantly reduced childrens PA and extended their sedentary behavior. The literature indicates that school recess plays an important role in promoting numerous childrens health outcomes. Therefore, students should not be excluded from participation in all or part of recess.","output":"A Longitudinal Examination of Withholding All or Part of School Recess on Childrens Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior: Evidence from a Natural Experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiorgan failure is devastating, and its mechanisms and mediators are not clear. Tissue injury in one organ appears to trigger disease in remote organs. Kidney and lung are frequently affected, such as when acute kidney injury (AKI) causes acute lung injury (ALI), a frequent clinical condition with high mortality. Here we identify factors secreted from the injured kidney that cause acute lung injury. We developed a murine model mimicking the generation of respiratory failure following acute kidney injury. To identify interorgan crosstalk mediators involved, we performed scRNAseq of mouse kidneys and lungs after AKI. We then applied ligand-receptor (L-R) pairing analysis across cells residing in kidney (ligands) or lung (receptors) to identify kidney-released circulating osteopontin (OPN) as a novel mediator of AKI-induced ALI (AKI-ALI). OPN release very early after AKI largely from tubule cells triggered neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into lungs associated with endothelial leakage, interstitial edema, and functional impairment. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of OPN prevented AKI-ALI. Transplantation of ischemic wt kidneys into wt mice caused AKI-ALI, while transplantation of ischemic OPN-global-knockout kidneys failed to induce lung endothelial leakage and AKI-ALI, identifying circulating kidney-released OPN as sufficient to cause AKI-ALI in vivo. We show that AKI in humans results in elevations in OPN levels in the serum. Increased serum OPN levels in patients with multiorgan failure have been shown to positively correlate with reduced kidney function, respiratory failure, and mortality. Thus, our results identifying OPN as a mediator of AKI-ALI may have important therapeutic implications in human AKI-ALI and multiorgan failure.","output":"Circulating osteopontin released by injured kidneys causes pulmonary inflammation and edema"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 has had unambiguously tragic human consequences in Brazil, which have been exacerbated by President Jair Bolsonaros executive underreach in failing to follow public-health guidance Yet the democratic impacts are mixed On the one hand, the health crisis may have diminished the risk of military intervention, belying Bolsonaros expressed support for military insurrection and encouraging elites to resist his performative golpismo  On the other hand, the pandemic has furthered societal polarization and encouraged citizens to interpret even information on matters of immediate personal health through partisan filters If the pandemic is a crucible, Brazils democracy will likely emerge brittle but intact ? 2020 National Endowment for Democracy and Johns Hopkins University Press","output":"Covid vs. democracy: Brazils populist playbook"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We estimate the association between forgetfulness to take medications as prescribed and polypharmacy and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among a cohort of patients with hypertension, dyslipidemia or both in Greece during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A telephone survey of 1018 randomly selected adults was conducted in Greece in June 2020. Participants were included in the survey, if they (a) had a diagnosis of hypertension, dyslipidemia or both and (b) were on prescription treatment for these conditions. HRQoL was calculated using the short form (SF) -12 Patient Questionnaire. A multivariable generalized linear regression model (GLM) was used to estimate the association between forgetfulness and polypharmacy and HRQoL, controlling for sociodemographic and health-related covariates. RESULTS: Overall, 351 respondents met the inclusion criteria, of whom 28 did not fully complete the questionnaire (response rate: 92%, n = 323). Of those, 37% were diagnosed with hypertension only, 28% with dyslipidemia only, and 35% with both. Most reported good to average physical (64.1%) and mental health (48.6%). Overall, 25% indicated that they sometimes forget to take their prescribed medications, and 12% took two or more pills multiple times daily. Total HRQoL score was 68.9% (s.d. = 18.0%). About 10% of participants reported paying less attention to their healthcare condition during the pandemic. Estimates of multivariable analyses indicated a negative association between forgetfulness (? 9%, adjusted : ? 0.047, 95% confidence interval ? 0.089 to ? 0.005, p = 0.029), taking two or more pills multiple times daily compared to one pill once a day (? 16%, adjusted : ? 0.068, 95% confidence interval ? 0.129 to ? 0.008, p = 0.028) and total HRQoL. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that among adult patients with hypertension, dyslipidemia or both in Greece, those who forget to take their medications and those with more complex treatment regimens had lower HRQoL. Such patients merit special attention and require targeted approaches by healthcare providers to improve treatment compliance and health outcomes.","output":"Assessing forgetfulness and polypharmacy and their impact on health-related quality of life among patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia in Greece during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The relationship between the occlusive clot morphology and the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is not well known. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical significance of the clot meniscus sign in patients with acute BAO. METHODS 89 patients with acute BAO who underwent MT were retrospectively analyzed. The clot meniscus sign was defined as meniscoid/tram-track like antegrade side-wall contrast opacification of the thrombus. Patients were assigned to two groups based on the presence of the clot meniscus sign. The treatment and clinical outcomes were compared. RESULTS The clot meniscus sign was diagnosed in 62.9% (53/89) of the patients. The meniscus sign (+) group showed a shorter procedure time (55 vs 85 min; p=0.045), higher rate of successful recanalization (89.3% vs 63.6%, p=0.004), higher incidence of first pass effect (32.1% vs 6.1%, p=0.004), and lower number of passes (2 vs 3; p=0.042) when compared with the meniscus sign (-) group. The procedure time (OR 0.972, 95% CI 0.962 to 0.992; p=0.003) and clot meniscus sign (OR 7.920, 95% CI 1.769 to 35.452; p=0.007) were independent predictors of successful recanalization.

Several reports from Saudi Arabia describe optimized in-house protocols that enable detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and measurement of their neutralizing activity. Notably, there were variations in the approaches utilized to develop and validate these immunoassays in term of sample size, validation methodologies, and statistical analyses. The developed enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) were based on the viral full-length spike (S), S1 subunit, and nucleocapsid (NP), and enabled detection of IgM and/or IgG. ELISAs were evaluated and validated against a microneutralization assay utilizing a local SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate, FDA-approved commercially available immunoassays, and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Overall, the performance of the described assays was high, reaching up to 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity with no cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses. In-house immunoassays, along with commercially available kits, were subsequently applied in a number of sero-epidemiological studies aiming to estimate sero-positivity status among local populations including healthcare workers, COVID-19 patients, non-COVID-19 patients, and healthy blood donors. The reported seroprevalence rates differed widely among these studies, ranging from 0.00% to 32.2%. These variations are probably due to study period, targeted population, sample size, and performance of the immunoassays utilized. Indeed, lack of sero-positive cases were reported among healthy blood donors during the lockdown, while the highest rates were reported when the number of COVID-19 cases peaked in the country, particularly among healthcare workers working in referral hospitals and quarantine sites.

It has been found that circRNAs are important players in cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis, as well as disease development. Moreover, the expression of circRNAs is usually not correlated with their parental gene expression, indicating that they are not only a steady-state by-product of mRNA splicing but a product of variable splicing under novel regulation. Sequence conservation analysis has also demonstrated that circRNAs have important non-coding functions. CircRNAs exist as a covalently closed loop form in mammalian cells, where they regulate cellular transcription and translation processes. CircRNAs are built from pre-messenger RNAs, and their biogenesis involves back-splicing, which is catalyzed by spliceosomes. The splicing reaction gives rise to three different types of intronic, exotic and exonCintron circular RNAs. Due to higher nuclease stability and longer half lives in cells, circRNAs are more stable than linear RNAs and have enormous clinical advantage for use as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for disease. In recent years, it has been reported that circRNAs in stem cells play a crucial role in stem cell function. In this article, we reviewed the general feature of circRNAs and the distinct roles of circRNAs in stem cell biology, including regulation of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. CircRNAs have shown unique expression profiles during differentiation of stem cells and could serve as promising biomarkers of these cells. As circRNAs play pivotal roles in stem cell regulation as well as the development and progression of various diseases, we also discuss opportunities and challenges of circRNA-based treatment strategies in future effective therapies for promising clinical applications.","output":"Circular RNAs Acting as miRNAs Sponges and Their Roles in Stem Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the decent work agenda has called upon vocational psychologists to advance psychological research and intervention to promote work as a human right.

Pain control is poor, with most patients remaining in moderate to severe pain. This may be because central causes of pain, a common contributor to knee pain, are not affected by current treatment strategies. Antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, have been used to treat chronic pain in other conditions. The aim of this randomised, double blind, controlled trial, is to determine whether low dose amitriptyline reduces pain in people with painful knee osteoarthritis over 3 months compared to benztropine, an active placebo. METHODS/DESIGN: One hundred and sixty people with painful radiographic knee osteoarthritis will be recruited via clinicians, local and social media advertising. Participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either low dose amitriptyline (25 mg) or active placebo (benztropine mesylate, 1 mg) for 3 months. The primary outcome is change from baseline in knee pain (WOMAC pain subscale) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include change in function (total WOMAC) and the proportion of individuals achieving a substantial response ( 50% reduction in pain intensity, measured by Visual Analog Scale, VAS, from no pain to worst pain imaginable, 0-100 mm) and moderate response ( 30% reduction in pain intensity, measured by VAS) at 12 weeks. Intention to treat analyses will be performed. Subgroup analyses will be done. DISCUSSION: This study will provide high level evidence regarding the effectiveness of low dose amitriptyline compared to benztropine in reducing pain and improving function in knee OA. This trial has the potential to provide an effective new therapeutic approach for pain management in knee osteoarthritis, with the potential of ready translation into clinical practice, as it is repurposing an old drug, which is familiar to clinicians and with a well described safety record.

The use of this technology has been shown to improve outpatient glycemic outcomes and quality of life and oftentimes may be continued in the hospital setting. Our aim is to review the current guidelines and available evidence on the continuation of insulin pumps and CGMs in the inpatient setting. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with diabetes are at higher risk for hospitalizations and complications due to hyper- or hypoglycemia, metabolic co-morbidities, or as seen recently, more severe illness from infections such as SARS-CoV-2. The maintenance of euglycemia is important to decrease both morbidity and mortality in the hospital setting. There is consensus among experts and medical societies that inpatient use of diabetes technology in carefully selected patients with proper institutional protocols is safe and can improve inpatient glycemic outcomes and reduce hypoglycemia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CGMs played a vital role in managing hyperglycemia in some hospitalized patients.

Many CB detection systems have been developed for many natural languages to face this phenomenon. However, Arabic is one of the under-resourced languages suffering from the lack of quality datasets in many computational research areas. This paper discusses the design, construction, and evaluation of a multi-dialect, annotated Arabic Cyberbullying Corpus (ArCybC), a valuable resource for Arabic CB detection and motivation for future research directions in Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP). The study describes the phases of ArCybC compilation. By way of illustration, it explores the corpus to discover strategies used in rendering Arabic CB tweets pulled from four Twitter groups, including gaming, sports, news, and celebrities. Based on thorough analysis, we discovered that these groups were the most susceptible to harassment and cyberbullying. The collected tweets were filtered based on a compiled harassment lexicon, which contains a list of multi-dialectical profane words in Arabic compiled from four categories: sexual, racial, physical appearance, and intelligence. To annotate ArCybC, we asked five annotators to classify 4,505 tweets into two classes manually: Offensive/non-Offensive and CB/non-CB. We conducted a rigorous comparison of different machine learning approaches applied on ArCybC to detect Arabic CB using two language models: bag-of-words (BoW) and word embedding. The experiments showed that Support Vector Machine (SVM) with word embedding achieved an accuracy rate of 86.3% and an F1-score rate of 85%.

Given the panoply of potential COVID-19 diagnostic tools and therapeutic candidates that require purified spike protein and its importance for ongoing SARS-CoV-2 research, we have explored new approaches for spike production and purification. Three transient gene expression methods based on PEI-mediated transfection of CHO or HEK293 cells in suspension culture in chemically-defined media were compared for rapid production of full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain. A high-cell-density protocol using DXB11-derived CHO(BRI/55E1) cells gave substantially better yields than the other methods. Different forms of the spike ectodomain were expressed, including the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 sequence and a mutated form (to favor expression of the full-length spike ectodomain stabilized in pre-fusion conformation), with and without fusion to putative trimerization domains. An efficient two-step affinity purification method was also developed. Ultimately, we have been able to produce highly homogenous preparations of full-length spike, both monomeric and trimeric, with yields of 100-150 mg/L in the harvested medium. The speed and productivity of this method support further development of CHO-based approaches for recombinant spike protein manufacturing.","output":"Rapid, high-yield production of full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain by transient gene expression in CHO cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents a novel data set on perceptions and behaviors of university students collected after the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak in Vietnam.

After having performed electrostatic pKa calculations on several X-ray structures, we consider both the native (unbound) configuration of the enzyme and its noncovalent complex with a model peptide, Ace-Ala-Val-Leu-Glna??Ser-Nme, which mimics the polyprotein sequence recognized at the active site. For each configuration, we also study their monomeric and homodimeric forms. The simulations of the unbound systems show that the relative orientation of domain III is not stable in the monomeric form and provide further details about interdomain motions, protomer-protomer interactions, inter-residue contacts, accessibility at the catalytic site, etc. In the presence of the peptide substrate, the monomeric protease exhibits a stable interdomain arrangement, but the relative orientation between the scissile peptide bond and the catalytic dyad is not favorable for catalysis. By means of comparative analysis, we further assess the catalytic impact of the enzyme dimerization, the actual flexibility of the active site region, and other structural effects induced by substrate binding. Overall, our computational results complement previous crystallographic studies on the SARS-CoV-2 enzyme and, together with other simulation studies, should contribute to outline useful structure-activity relationships.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease: A Molecular Dynamics Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microvascular anastomosis has become a standard surgical technique for reconstruction because of increasing possibilities, indications, and clinical success regarding the survival of the flaps.

Leaving surgical complications aside, systemic problems like disorder of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system are a significant cause of graft loss usually being unrecognized. Reports exist describing a hypercoagulable state with clotting activation and inhibition of fibrinolysis after trauma and delayed surgery considering the secondary homeostasis. In this clinical case, a patient had a large soft tissue defect at the temporal side of the head after severe trauma. After some days of primary stabilization, reconstruction using a free microvascular latissimus dorsi flap was performed. Multiple revisions of the arterial and venous branches had to be performed intraoperatively due to insufficient flap perfusion. After 24 hours, definitive flap loss occurred due to multiple thrombosis in the arterial and venous branches. Postoperative comprehensive coagulation analysis revealed a distinct activation of primary hemostasis with massively increased von Willebrand factor parameters and factor VIII activity as well as acetylsalicylic acid resistance contributing to thrombotic occlusion. In severely injured patients, comprehensive preoperative determination of the coagulation status (especially those of the primary hemostasis) is indispensable before performing free flap reconstruction surgeries to reduce the risk of microvascular flap loss.","output":"The Role of von Willebrand Factor in Microvascular Surgery in Severely Injured Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has not yet been conclusively established. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of recent scientific literature to assess whether AKI may be associated with worse prognosis and increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was conducted between 1st November 2019 and 15th May 2020 on Medline (PubMed interface) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) to identify potentially eligible studies. Cohort or case-control studies reporting data on AKI in patients with or without severe COVID-19 were included. Studies were divided into separate cohorts for analysis based on two endpoints (severity [severe vs non-severe] and mortality [non-survivors vs survivors]). Data were pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for either outcome. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies (n= 5,832 patients) were included in the analysis. Overall, AKI was found to be associated with significantly increased odds of COVID-19 severity (OR= 18.5; 95% CI 8.99-38.08) and mortality (OR= 23.9; 95% CI 18.84-30.31). No heterogeneity was observed for both outcomes (Cochrans Q= 6.21, p=0.52, I(2)=0% and Cochrans Q= 4.56, p=0.47, I(2)=0% respectively). CONCLUSION: According to current data, AKI seems to be associated with worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism of renal disease in COVID-19 would be needed to clarify possible therapeutic targets.

The radiological pattern on CT of the thorax most often allows us to make a diagnosis with varying levels of confidence, to optimize management. With a multidisciplinary team bringing the strengths of their individual domains of knowledge, clinical, radiological, histopathological and in many cases rheumatological, the level of confidence in making this diagnosis increases, often to the stage where the diagnosis is most often right, is concordant with the diagnosis achieved at histopathology and therefore obviates the need for lung biopsy which carries its own costs and risks of complications. Our study emphasizes the role of the Multidisciplinary team (MDT) in the management of DPLDs at a tertiary care referral center. MATERIALS AND METHODS Every case of DPLD presenting to our pulmonology department was discussed in an MDT meeting before subjecting them to any diagnostic intervention or therapy. A clinico-radiological diagnosis was made according to the 2002 ATS/ERS guidelines initially. Later an official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT statement on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 2013 ATS/ERS consensus for the classification and diagnosis of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia was used. The concordance in our study was defined as the percentage of histopathological diagnoses that were identical to the clinico-radiological MDT diagnosis prior to the biopsy. RESULTS A total of 434 patients with DPLDs were evaluated. The MDT suggested biopsy for only 38.7% (168 / 434) patients since the pattern was very clear in 266 (61.3%) cases. As not all patients cionsented to undergo the biopsy procedure when recommended, histopathology was obtained in 102 patients. The histological diagnosis was concordant with the initial MDT diagnosis in 80.3% (82 / 102) of samples. On an individual basis CTD-ILD and sarcoidosis showed the best concordance (87%). In idiopathic NSIP cases, the histopathological diagnosis concurred in only 53.3% (8 / 15), out of which 8 were NSIP, 4 were UIP and 3 were reported as inadequate sampling on histopathology. CONCLUSION The MDT plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of DPLDs. Not every pattern requires biopsy confirmation. However, an iNSIP diagnosis by the MDT should probably be better confirmed by biopsy.","output":"Multidisciplinary team obviates biopsy in most patients with diffuse parenchymal lung diseases - a retrospective study from India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As recent research indicates, refugees and people seeking asylum are suffering disproportionately from the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and have become more and more shut out and marginalised.

We compared 5 mechanically assisted cough devices by bench testing using a breathing simulator and assessed their user-friendliness. METHODS We measured inspiratory and expiratory airway pressures and peak expiratory flow, the strongest indicator of cough efficacy. We performed 2 bench tests: 1) to ascertain the differences between preset and actual settings in 3 different machines of each mechanically assisted cough device and 2) to assess the effects of varying respiratory impedance and air leaks on performance of the devices. We also evaluated the user-friendliness of the devices by measuring the time required and errors in accomplishing 4 tasks by 10 physicians unfamiliar with mechanically assisted cough devices compared with product specialists from the distributing companies. Physicians also scored the ease of use. RESULTS Four mechanically assisted cough devices during insufflation and all 5 during exsufflation showed differences between preset and actual airway pressures. All but one device showed uneven actual pressure values between models of the same type. Peak expiratory flow was significantly influenced by the mechanical properties in 2 devices and by air leaks in 4 devices. The median time to accomplish all tasks by the product specialist (10 [interquartile range of 2-29] s) was overall significantly shorter compared with all physicians (from 19 [14-65] to 36 [19-116] s). The number of procedural errors, but not the perceived ease of use, differed significantly between the devices. CONCLUSIONS The performance of different mechanically assisted cough devices was erratic and included variance between models from the same manufacturer; it was affected by respiratory system impedance and air leaks. Time and rate of errors for performing procedures were elevated. These findings indicate that the devices are not interchangeable and that the settings should be targeted for each patient with the specific machine being used.

In early 2020, Italy became the most affected country and national lockdown was declared early on in March. We described trends in ACS from all the Marche coronary catheterization laboratories (CCL) during the global pandemic. METHODS Retrospective study of all consecutive patients admitted to the four regional CCL. The coronavirus disease 2019 period (20 February 2020 to 15 April 2020) was compared with the interyear control period (1 January 2020 to 19 February 2020) and to the intrayear control period (20 February 2019 to 15 April 2019). All patients with an initial diagnosis of ACS were included in the analysis, and further stratified into ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI)/unstable angina. RESULTS A total of 1239 patients were enrolled. Daily incidence of ACS was 6.1, 6.3 and 4.5 for the interyear control period, the intrayear control period and the case period, respectively. There was no difference in overall STEMI daily incidence while NSTEMI/unstable angina fell from 3.6 and 3.3-1.8 during the case period (P = 0.01).

COVID-19 patients have an increased risk of thromboembolic (TE) complications, which develop despite pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. The mechanism behind COVID-19-associated coagulopathy remains unclear. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a pattern recognition molecule that initiates the lectin pathway of complement activation, has been suggested as a potential amplifier of blood coagulation during thromboinflammation. Here we describe data from a cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients ( n = 65) treated at a tertiary hospital center intensive care unit (ICU). A subset of patients had strongly elevated MBL plasma levels, and activity upon ICU admission, and patients who developed symptomatic TE (14%) had significantly higher MBL levels than patients without TE. MBL was strongly correlated to plasma D-dimer levels, a marker of COVID-19 coagulopathy, but showed no relationship to degree of inflammation or other organ dysfunction. In conclusion, we have identified complement activation through the MBL pathway as a novel amplification mechanism that contributes to pathological thrombosis in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Pharmacological targeting of the MBL pathway could be a novel treatment option for thrombosis in COVID-19. Laboratory testing of MBL levels could be of value for identifying COVID-19 patients at risk for TE events.","output":"Mannose-Binding Lectin is Associated with Thrombosis and Coagulopathy in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although many studies emphasize the importance of using oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) targets in the NICUs, there is a wide variability in used saturation ranges among centers.

Second aim was to identify healthcare-professionals related factors associated with oxygen targeting in the preterm population. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with data collection via an electronic survey form. A questionnaire containing pre-piloted and open questions on monitoring and management of the SpO(2) was administered to neonatologists across the network of the Italian Society of Neonatology. The questions focused on: the infrastructure, specific training, healthcare professionals and patients-related factors. The results of the survey were anonymously collected, summarized and analyzed. RESULTS: Out of 378 questionnaires, 93 were correctly filled. Thirty-six different SpO(2) ranges were observed. Centers using written standard operating procedures on oxygen management and SpO(2) monitoring maintained a correct average range of SpO(2) 90C95%, avoided hyperoxia and reconsidered saturation targets in relation to comorbidities. 39.8% of responders disabled alarms during neonatal care.

The objective of this study was to characterize the association between timing of treatment and survival and to evaluate how extended delays to guideline-concordant treatment for suspected stage I high grade serous ovarian cancer might impact survival. Using the National Cancer Data Base (2004-2015), patients surgically treated for clinical stage I high grade serous ovarian cancer were identified. Patients receiving surgery within 14 days of diagnosis were compared to those receiving surgery 2-4 months after diagnosis. The groups were propensity matched with 2:1 matching to balance baseline characteristics. Survival outcomes of the two cohorts were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis, the log-rank test, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis. During the study period, 10,957 patients underwent guideline-concordant surgery for stage I high-grade serous ovarian cancer within 14 days of diagnosis (early) and 171 patients underwent surgery 2-4 months following diagnosis (delayed). Between patients in the early versus delayed treatment groups, the delayed group was more likely to be Black (5.3% vs 11.8%, p=0.003) and have a smaller tumor size (8.0 vs. 6.2 cm, p<0.001). The early group was more likely to have private insurance (57.4% vs 44.9%, p=0.006). There was no significant difference in 5-year overall survival between the unmatched early versus delayed groups (56.6% vs 50.8%, p=0.36). Propensity-score 2:1 matching was used to create two groups of patients who received early (n=342) or delayed (n=171) surgery that were well-matched with regards to baseline characteristics. The only significant difference between groups in the matched cohort was patients in the delayed group had smaller tumors (8.0 vs 6.2 cm, p<0.001). There was no significant difference in 3-year overall survival (early 73.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 68.2 - 78.2] vs delayed 72.6% [95% CI: 64.4 - 79.2]) or 5-year overall survival (early 56.6% [95% CI: 50.3 - 62.4] vs delayed 50.8% [95% CI: 41.6 - 59.3], log-rank p=0.52) between the early versus delayed groups (Figure 1).

Private insurance status was associated with improved overall survival (aHR=0.51, [CI: 0.27 - 0.96], p=0.04). Surgical delay was not significantly associated with different overall survival (aHR=1.19, [CI: 0.90 - 1.58], p=0.23).

Desirable attributes of a CNS service include service users having access to the same CNS throughout their care, receiving timely care and experiencing longer-term support and reassurance. In the post-diagnostic period, service user needs are often more psycho-social than medical, and the CNS role can complement and add value to clinical appointments.

Almost all calves had antibody titers on arrival in the Alberta feedlot and 82% of the calves had an antibody titer on arrival at the Ontario feedlots; titers in calves in Alberta were almost twice as high as those in calves in Ontario. The incidence of infection, in the first mo after arrival as judged by seroconversion, ranged from 61% to 100%; titer increases were much greater in calves in Ontario feedlots. Titer variables were not significantly related to BRD, except on a within-group basis (group was a confounding variable for BCV-BRD associations). Given control of group effects, calves with an antibody titer on arrival appeared to be protected against BRD for the first 28 d in the feedlot, and the association was reasonably linear over the range of titers. Each titer unit on arrival decreased the risk of BRD by about 0.8x (odds ratio). Titer change was not strongly related to the risk of BRD and the relationship was not linear over the range of titer changes. Titer change was strongly and negatively correlated with titer on arrival, and titer change was not significantly related to BRD in the presence of arrival titers. Arrival titer retained its relationship with BRD in the presence of titer data for other putative pathogens. Each higher unit of titer to BCV on arrival increased the 28-day weight gain (controlling for group, initial weight and the occurrence of BRD) by slightly more than 1 kg. Titer change was associated with decreased weight gain, when initial titer was not in the model. The lack of a linear or multivariable association between BCV titer change and BRD, and weight gain, may indicate that BCV is not a major pathogen; or, its lack of significance may merely be due to its strong correlation with arrival titer.

Methods: A cohort study was conducted from July-2021 to December-2021 in a tertiary hospital of north India. The primary outcome was vaccine-effectiveness against COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were AESCs, and persistent health issues in those receiving vaccine. Regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors. Results: In 2760 healthcare workers (HCWs) included, 1033 COVID-19 events were reported. Around 6-17% vaccine effectiveness was observed against COVID-19 occurrence. One dose-recipients were at 1.6-times increased risk of COVID-19. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was a strong independent protective factor against COVID-19 (aOR 0.66). Full vaccination reduced moderate-severe COVID-19 by 57%. Those with lung disease were at 2.5-times increased risk of moderate-severe COVID-19. AESCs were observed in 1.3% including one case each of myocarditis and severe hypersensitivity.

Many countries have closed schools as part of measures to limit transmission and this has had a considerable impact on children world-wide.

The aims of this study were to investigate parents' and caregivers' knowledge of CoVID-19 in children, to understand their levels of concern and to identify their most trusted sources of information. METHODS: Participants were recruited via NZ parenting support and interest groups on Facebook.com. Knowledge was assessed by way of a self-administered questionnaire during the 10 days prior to NZ schools reopening on 18 May 2020. RESULTS: Of the 1191 study participants, 721 (60%) expressed some level of worry (14.5% very or extremely worried) that their child would catch CoVID-19 at school. A high proportion (79%, 941) thought it likely or very likely that their child would catch CoVID-19 at school if there were to be widespread community transmission. Fear scores for CoVID-19 were generally high, and 828 (80%) of participants said they would vaccinate their child if a newly developed vaccine were available. CONCLUSIONS: Parents and caregivers were generally fearful of their children acquiring CoVID-19 at school.

To enhance the prediction capabilities of the models, properties of the unknown uncertainties in the pandemic disease, which can be utterly random, or function of the system dynamics, or it can be correlated with an unknown function, should be determined. The known structures and amount of the uncertainties can also help the state authorities to improve the policies based on the recognized source of the uncertainties. For instance, the uncertainties correlated with an unknown function imply existence of an undetected factor in the casualties. In this paper, we extend the SpID-N (Suspicious-Infected-Death with non-pharmacological policies) model as in the form of MIMO (Multi-Input-Multi-Output) structure by adding the multi-dimensional unknown uncertainties. The results confirm that the infected and death sub-models mostly have random uncertainties (due undetected casualties) whereas the suspicious sub-model has uncertainties correlated with the internal dynamics (governmental policy of increasing the number of the daily tests) for Turkey. However, since the developed MIMO model parameters are learned from the data (daily reported casualties), it can be easily adapted for other countries. Obtained model with the corresponding uncertainties predicts a distinctive second peak where the number of deaths, infected and suspicious casualties disappear in 240, 290, and more than 300 days, respectively, for Turkey.","output":"Unknown uncertainties in the COVID-19 pandemic: Multi-dimensional identification and mathematical modelling for the analysis and estimation of the casualties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Linear mixed models are commonly used in healthcare-based association analyses for analyzing multi-site data with heterogeneous site-specific random effects. Due to regulations for protecting patients privacy, sensitive individual patient data (IPD) typically cannot be shared across sites. We propose an algorithm for fitting distributed linear mixed models (DLMMs) without sharing IPD across sites. This algorithm achieves results identical to those achieved using pooled IPD from multiple sites (i.e., the same effect size and standard error estimates), hence demonstrating the lossless property. The algorithm requires each site to contribute minimal aggregated data in only one round of communication. We demonstrate the lossless property of the proposed DLMM algorithm by investigating the associations between demographic and clinical characteristics and length of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients using administrative claims from the UnitedHealth Group Clinical Discovery Database. We extend this association study by incorporating 120,609 COVID-19 patients from 11 collaborative data sources worldwide.","output":"DLMM as a lossless one-shot algorithm for collaborative multi-site distributed linear mixed models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 Coronavirus originating from Wuhan, China has become a global pandemic.

People living with NCDs could face challenges owing to restricted mobility, low access to medical care and suboptimal logistics during the pandemic. The present study explored the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on NCD care in a district of Odisha State of India. Methods: : This study was carried out during May-June 2020 in the Khurda district of Odisha. A community-based explanatory mixed-method study was followed. Data collection comprised 12 in-depth interviews and 491 structured interviews using Likert-questionnaire with individuals having at least one NCD. Mantel-Haenszel's Chi-square test was used to assess the difference in the effect of COVID-19 on the routine NCD care. Qualitative data were analyzed by content analysis. Results: : Findings revealed that nearly two-thirds of participants encountered challenges in their routine investigation (69%), day-care procedures (67%) and reaching hospital (61%). Around half of them reported having trouble in doctor appointments (59%), emergency treatment (56%), access to the pharmacy (47%) and delay in healthcare (46%). Thirty seven per cent perceived that they could not access care because of social restriction/lockdown, 29 per cent attributed arranging finance as a constraint to visiting hospitals and 16 per cent avoided going to the hospital, fearing COVID-19 infection. Interpretation & conclusions: : Our findings showed that people with chronic NCDs faced multiple challenges in accessing health care during the pandemic. A cohesive doctor-pharmacy-patient engagement is vital for managing NCD care during a pandemic. During emergencies, changes in dispensing practices and service provision closer to the patients are crucial. Additionally, health literacy and home-based NCD management should be encouraged.","output":"Non-communicable diseases care during COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed-method study in Khurda district of Odisha, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate human exposure to live poultry and changes in risk perception and behavior after the April 2013 influenza A(H7N9) outbreak in China, we surveyed 2,504 urban residents in 5 cities and 1,227 rural residents in 4 provinces and found that perceived risk for influenza A(H7N9) was low.

Thus, it is essential to improve our understanding of COVID-19 transmission and develop more focused and effective strategies. As human mobility drives transmission, data from cell phone devices can be utilized to achieve these goals. Methods: We analyzed aggregated and anonymized mobility data from the cell-phone devices of>3 million users between February 1, 2020, to May 16, 2020 - in which several movement restrictions were applied and lifted in Israel. We integrated these mobility patterns into age-, risk- and region-structured transmission model. Calibrated to coronavirus incidence in 250 regions covering Israel, we evaluated the efficacy and effectiveness in decreasing mortality of applying localized and temporal lockdowns (stay-at-home order). Results: Poorer regions exhibited lower and slower compliance with the restrictions. Our transmission model further indicated that individuals from poverty areas were associated with high transmission rates. Model projections suggested that, counterintuitively, school closure has an adverse effect and increases COVID-19 mortality in the long run, while interventions focusing on the elderly are the most efficient. We also found that applying localized and temporal lockdowns during regional outbreaks reduce mortality compared to nationwide lockdowns. These trends were consistent across vast ranges of epidemiological parameters, possible seasonal forcing, and even when we assumed that vaccination would be commercially available in 1-3 years.

Understanding HCPs risk for burnout is critical to supporting HCPs and maintaining the quality of healthcare during the pandemic. METHODS: To assess exposure, perceptions, workload, and possible burnout of HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic we conducted a cross-sectional survey. The main outcomes and measures were HCPs self-assessment of burnout and other experiences and attitudes associated with working during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: A total of 2,707 HCPs from 60 countries participated in this study. Fifty-one percent of HCPs reported burnout. Burnout was associated with work impacting household activities (RR=157, 95% CI=139C178, P<0001), feeling pushed beyond training (RR=132, 95% CI=120C147, P<0001), exposure to COVID-19 patients (RR=118, 95% CI=105C132, P=0005), making life prioritizing decisions (RR=116, 95% CI=102C131, P=003). Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was protective against burnout (RR=088, 95% CI=079C097, P=001).

It is assumed that antibiotics are efficacious for all bronchiectasis exacerbations, but not all practitioners agree. Inadequately treated exacerbations may risk lung function deterioration. Our study tests the hypothesis that both oral azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid are superior to placebo at improving resolution rates of respiratory exacerbations by day 14 in children with bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis. METHODS: We are conducting a bronchiectasis exacerbation study (BEST), which is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial, in five centres (Brisbane, Perth, Darwin, Melbourne, Auckland). In the component of BEST presented here, 189 children fulfilling inclusion criteria are randomised (allocation-concealed) to receive amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (22.5 mg/kg twice daily) with placebo-azithromycin; azithromycin (5 mg/kg daily) with placebo-amoxicillin-clavulanic acid; or placebo-azithromycin with placebo-amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for 14 days. Clinical data and a paediatric cough-specific quality of life score are obtained at baseline, at the start and resolution of exacerbations, and at day 14. In most children, blood and deep nasal swabs are also collected at the same time points. The primary outcome is the proportion of children whose exacerbations have resolved at day 14. The main secondary outcome is the paediatric cough-specific quality of life score. Other outcomes are time to next exacerbation; requirement for hospitalisation; duration of exacerbation; and spirometry data. Descriptive viral and bacteriological data from nasal samples and blood markers will also be reported. DISCUSSION: Effective, evidence-based management of exacerbations in people with bronchiectasis is clinically important. Yet, there are few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the neglected area of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Indeed, no published RCTs addressing the treatment of bronchiectasis exacerbations in children exist. Our multicentre, double-blind RCT is designed to determine if azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, compared with placebo, improve symptom resolution on day 14 in children with acute respiratory exacerbations. Our planned assessment of the predictors of antibiotic response, the role of antibiotic-resistant respiratory pathogens, and whether early treatment with antibiotics affects duration and time to the next exacerbation, are also all novel.

METHODS Lung US examinations were performed in 63 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to a university hospital. Lung involvement was evaluated on a 4-point scale with a 12-area pulmonary division, obtaining a lung score (LS). Ultrasound findings and clinical characteristics were recorded. RESULTS All patients showed US involvement in at least 1 area (mean  SD, 8  3.5). The total LS was 15.3  8.1, without differences between left and right lungs. Most affected regions were the lower region (95.2%) and the posterior region (73.8%). The total LS showed a strong correlation (r = -0.765) with the oxygen pressure-to-fraction of inspired oxygen ratio; by lung region, those with a higher correlation were the LS of the anterior region (r = -0.823) and the LS of the upper region (r = -0.731). In total, 22.2% of patients required noninvasive respiratory support (NIRS). A multivariate analysis showed that the anterior region LS, adjusted for age and sex, was significant (odds ratio, 2.159; 95% confidence interval, 1.309-3.561) for the risk of requiring NIRS. An anterior region LS of 4 or higher and a total LS of 19 or higher had similar characteristics to predict the need for NIRS. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia is bilateral and heterogeneous. Most affected regions are the posterior and the lower regions. The anterior region has prognostic value because its involvement strongly correlates with the risk of requiring NIRS, and an anterior region LS of 4 or higher has high sensitivity and specificity for predicting the need for NIRS.","output":"Findings and Prognostic Value of Lung Ultrasound in COVID-19 Pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we explore the possible policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic shock as well as the related economic (financial crisis) shocks on trade and global value chains (GVC) in East Asia.

Estrogens may promote neutrophilic inflammation in subjects with asthma and COPD. Moreover, the activation of estrogen receptors might induce tumorigenesis. In this chapter, we summarize the most recent advances in the functional roles and associated signaling pathways of inflammatory cellular responses in asthma, COPD, PF, LC, and newly occurring COVID-19 disease. We also meticulously deliberate the influence of sex steroids on the development and progress of these common and severe lung diseases.","output":"Sex Hormones and Lung Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To design, implement, and evaluate learner attitudes of a virtual urologic surgery clinical rotation for medical students METHODS: Ten senior medical students at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania were enrolled. Students were administered a pre-course test on their perceived confidence of their urologic knowledge, confidence in identifying urologic conditions, comfort with performing urologic evaluations, and confidence placing consults for urologic issues. Students participated in a two-week curriculum that included both asynchronous and synchronous content. Asynchronous content included pre-recorded lectures, self-paced problem-based learning (PBL) modules, directed reading and video content, and an online discussion board. Synchronous content included real-time videoconferences covering case discussions, simulated patient presentations, and critical literature reviews. At the conclusion of the course, students were administered the post-course survey evaluating changes in their ability to identify and understand urologic conditions. RESULTS: The post-course survey demonstrated this course significantly increases students scores in: self-perceived urologic knowledge, confidence in naming urologic conditions, comfort with performing urologic evaluations, and confidence placing consults for urologic conditions (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual medical student rotations are scalable and effective at delivering surgical material and can approximate the interpersonal teaching found in clinical learning environments.

Sendai virus causes a localized respiratory tract infection in rodents, while a mutant, F1-R, causes a systemic infection. It has been suggested that two determinants are responsible for the systemic infection caused by F1-R [Okada et al (1998) Arch Virol 143:2343C2352]. The primary determinant of the pantropism is the enhanced proteolytic cleavability of the fusion (F) protein of F1-R, which allows the virus to undergo multiple rounds of replication in many different organs, whereas wild-type virus can only undergo multiple rounds of replication in the lungs. The enhanced cleavability of F1-R F was previously attributed to an amino acid change at F115 that is adjacent to the cleavage site at amino acid 116. Secondly, wild-type virus buds only from the apical domain of bronchial epithelium, releasing virus into the lumen of the respiratory tract, whereas F1-R buds from both apical and basolateral domains. Thus, virus is released into the basement membrane where it can easily gain access to the bloodstream for dissemination. The microtubule disruption is attributed to two amino acid differences in M protein. To confirm that the F and M gene mutations described above are solely responsible for the phenotypic differences seen in wld-type versus F1-R infections, reverse genetics was used to construct recombinant Sendai viruses with various combinations of the mutations found in the M and F genes of F1-R. Plaque assays were performed with or without trypsin addition. A recombinant virus containing all F1-R M and F mutations formed plaques in LLC-MK2 cells and underwent multiple cycles of replication without trypsin addition. To clarify which mutation(s) are necessary for plaque formation, plaque assays were done using other recombinant viruses. A virus with only the F115 change, which was previously thought to be the only change important for plaque formation of F 1-R F, did not confer upon the virus the ability to form plaques without the addition of trypsin. Another virus with the F115 and both M changes gave the same result. Therefore, more than one mutation in the F gene contributes to the ability of F1-R to form plaques without trypsin addition.","output":"Mutations in Sendai virus variant F1-R that correlate with plaque formation in the absence of trypsin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 58-year-old man developed reversible acute kidney injury (AKI) following concomitant administration of tacrolimus with off-label darunavir, ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine He also developed COVID-19 pneumonia following immunosuppressive drug therapy with tacrolimus, prednisolone and mycophenolate-mofetil His COVID-19 pneumonia was further treated with off-label azithromycin, darunavir, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine and ritonavir [routes and durations of treatments to reactions onsets not stated;not all outcomes and dosages stated] The man presented with acute fever, watery diarrhoea, nausea and dyspnea Two years before presentation, he had undergone a kidney transplantation His medical history also included dyslipidaemia, hypertension and post-transplant diabetes mellitus After receiving induction therapy, he had been undergoing maintenance therapy with tacrolimus 2 5 mg/d, mycophenolate mofetil 2 mg/d and prednisolone and 2 5 mg/ During the course of treatment, he had developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia treated with ganciclovir and valganciclovir He was additionally receiving various other concomitant medications On 13 March 2020, 12 days before presentation, he had developed diarrhea which continued throughout with additional fever, myalgia, dry cough and shortness of breath Upon his presentation, his body temperature was 39 2C, BP was 118/65mm Hg, respiratory rate was 24 times/minutes, oxygen saturation on room air was 94% and pulse rate was 92 beats/minute He underwent nasal swab testing and stool testing, which was positive for COVID-19 His chest radiograph showed bilateral multifocal patchy infiltration pneumonia His immunosuppressive drug therapy was thought to contribute in the development of COVID-19 pneumonia, with atypical presentations of diarrhoea and nausea The man started receiving off-label treatment with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, darunavir, ritonavir and favipiravir 3 2 g/d (subsequently lowered to 1 2 g/d) on the first day of hospitalisation His tacrolimus dose was lowered to 1 5 mg/d, whereas mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued on day 3 Hence, his prednisolone was continued at an increased dose of 15 mg/d from day 3 He was also initiated on prophylactic ceftriaxone for bacterial infection He was then transferred to another hospital and received oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygenation During this admission, his laboratory examinations were significant for lymphopenia, elevated levels of creatine, serum sodium and interleukin 6 (IL-6) His tacrolimus trough levels were also found to be elevated and tacrolimus was discontinued, as were hydroxychloroquine, darunavir, ritonavir A diagnosis of AKI secondary to raised tacrolimus trough levels, due to an interaction with anti-virals was considered On days 4-5 of admission (day 11-12 of fever), his lymphocyte count and PaO2/FiO2 ratio decreased A chest radiography showed increased bilateral infiltration and he underwent placement of a high-flow oxygen nasal cannula He was then treated with immunoglobulin and underwent haemoperfusion for increased level of endotoxin On hospital day 6, his IL-6 levels had increased further and he received tocilizumab Within 4 days of initiating tocilizumab, his clinical condition improved and he did not require oxygen therapy Subsequent chest radiography showed reduced infiltration However, in spite of early discontinuation of tacrolimus and anti-viral medications, his tacrolimus trough levels remained high;his tacrolimus had been withdrawn since 10 days until the tacrolimus trough levels and creatinine returned to baseline Eventually, COVID-19 was undetectable and his lymphopenia resolved, following which, mycophenolate-mofetil was reintroduced","output":"Azithromycin/antiretrovirals/tacrolimus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have become widely available, cases of new-onset glomerular disease after receiving COVID-19 vaccination have been reported.

We hypothesized that COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) who die in intensive care units (ICU) have a lower viral clearance in the respiratory tract than ICU patients discharged alive, and that protracted viral shedding in respiratory samples is associated with patterns of fibroproliferation on lung CT. We, therefore, conducted a retrospective observational study, in 2 ICU of Lyon university hospital. RESULTS: 129 patients were included in the study, of whom 44 (34%) died in ICU. 432 RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were performed and 137 CT scans were analyzed. Viral load was significantly higher in patients deceased as compared to patients alive at ICU discharge (p < 0.001), after adjustment for the site of viral sampling and RT-PCR technique. The median time to SARS-CoV-2 negativation on RT-PCR was 19 days [CI(95 %):15C21] in patients alive at ICU discharge and 26 days [CI(95 %):17-infinity] in non-survivors at ICU discharge. Competitive risk regression identified patients who died in ICU and age as independent risk factors for longer time to SARS-CoV-2 negativation on RT-PCR, while antiviral treatment was independently associated with shorter time. None of the CT scores exploring fibroproliferation (i.e., bronchiectasis and reticulation scores) were significantly associated with time to SARS-CoV-2 negativation.

Helping patients to map their everyday activities and motivating them to associate medications with everyday activities may facilitate adherence to medications. Addressing patient beliefs about medications, supporting patients in coping with side effects of medications and eliciting patients' wishes for involvement in treatment decisions may also facilitate adherence.

This research paper assessed the efficacy of high-dose nebulized IFN  2b in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This is a retrospective study. It commenced on April 9 and ended on June 17, 2020. Researchers selected participants from hospitalized patients aged 18 years and above who were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Other inclusion criteria were bilateral pneumonia on lung or chest X-ray scan and severe respiratory distress. SMART-COP, which is a risk stratification scoring tool, and radiologic severity index (RSI) were used to assess pneumonia severity. Patients in the treatment cohort received nebulized IFN  2b at a dose of 10 million IU every 12 hours for 5 days, in addition to standard treatment. Patients in the control cohort received standard treatment only. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients met the inclusion criteria; 37 were included in the treatment cohort and 36 in the control cohort. Mechanical ventilation was needed in 14 of 36 (38.9%) patients in the control cohort, compared with 6 of 37 (27.4%) patients in the treatment cohort (HR 5.62 [95% CI 1.81-17.48]; P = .003). For pneumonia severity, there was a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.72 [95% CI 1.74- 7.98]; P = .01. After 5 days of treatment, chest X-rays indicated significant beneficial changes in the treatment group (HR 2.24 [CI 1.05-4.79]; P = .036). Multivariate analysis revealed that pneumonia severity and RSI remained higher in the control group. The HR was 3.44 [95% CI 1.49-7.94]; P = .004 and 2.26 [95% CI 0.99-5.16]; P = .05, respectively. There was an increase in liver aminotransferases in 5 (14%) participants in the control cohort and 3 (8%) participants in the treatment cohort. CONCLUSION: High-dose nebulized IFN  2b has potential efficacy in mitigating severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This study established that administering high-dose nebulized IFN  2b significantly reduces pneumonia severity in COVID-19 patients. We also found a strong relationship between using nebulized IFN  2b and reduced need for mechanical ventilation among patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Depending on the learning technique used, such label noise is potentially harmful, requiring an increased size of the training set, making the trained model more complex and more prone to overfitting and yielding less accurate prediction. This work proposes a cleaning technique called the ensemble method based on the noise detection metric (ENDM). From the corrupted training set, an ensemble classifier is first learned and used to derive four metrics assessing the likelihood for a sample to be mislabeled. For each metric, three thresholds are set to maximize the classifying performance on a corrupted validation dataset when using three different ensemble classifiers, namely Bagging, AdaBoost and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN). These thresholds are used to identify and then either remove or correct the corrupted samples. The effectiveness of the ENDM is demonstrated in performing the classification of 15 public datasets. A comparative analysis is conducted concerning the homogeneous-ensembles-based majority vote method and consensus vote method, two popular ensemble-based label noise filters.","output":"Label Noise Cleaning with an Adaptive Ensemble Method Based on Noise Detection Metric"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of July 2020, approximately 6 months into the pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), whether people living with HIV (PLWH) are disproportionately affected remains an unanswered question.

In parts of Yemen, reports indicated a peak in hospital admissions and burials during May-June 2020. To estimate excess mortality during the epidemic period, we quantified activity across all identifiable cemeteries within Aden governorate (population approximately 1 million) by analysing very high-resolution satellite imagery and compared estimates to Civil Registry office records. METHODS: After identifying active cemeteries through remote and ground information, we applied geospatial analysis techniques to manually identify new grave plots and measure changes in burial surface area over a period from July 2016 to September 2020. After imputing missing grave counts using surface area data, we used alternative approaches, including simple interpolation and a generalised additive mixed growth model, to predict both actual and counterfactual (no epidemic) burial rates by cemetery and across the governorate during the most likely period of COVID-19 excess mortality (from 1 April 2020) and thereby compute excess burials. We also analysed death notifications to the Civil Registry office over the same period. RESULTS: We collected 78 observations from 11 cemeteries. In all but one, a peak in daily burial rates was evident from April to July 2020. Interpolation and mixed model methods estimated &#8776;1500 excess burials up to 6 July, and 2120 up to 19 September, corresponding to a peak weekly increase of 230% from the counterfactual. Satellite imagery estimates were generally lower than Civil Registry data, which indicated a peak 1823 deaths in May alone. However, both sources suggested the epidemic had waned by September 2020. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first instance of satellite imagery being used for population mortality estimation. Findings suggest a substantial, under-ascertained impact of COVID-19 in this urban Yemeni governorate and are broadly in line with previous mathematical modelling predictions, though our method cannot distinguish direct from indirect virus deaths. Satellite imagery burial analysis appears a promising novel approach for monitoring epidemics and other crisis impacts, particularly where ground data are difficult to collect.","output":"Excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic: a geospatial and statistical analysis in Aden governorate, Yemen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study highlights the advantages of using the quality by design (QbD) approach to synthesise and optimize SERS substrates for the detection of Hg(2+).

For studies conducted across a country or territory, we used the seroprevalence estimate and the upper and lower CIs and compared them to the total number of reported infections to calculate the ratio of reported to expected infections. RESULTS: We identified 23 population-based seroprevalence studies conducted in Europe.

Of the eight studies in blood donors, seroprevalence ranged from 0.91% in North-Western Germany to 23.3% in a high-transmission area in Lombardy region, Italy. In three studies which recruited individuals through employment, seroprevalence ranged from 0.5% among factory workers in Frankfurt, Germany, to 10.2% among university employees in Milan, Italy. In comparison to nationally reported cases, the extent of infection, as derived from these seroprevalence estimates, is manyfold higher and largely heterogeneous.

The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown measures have had far-reaching and quite diverse consequences for different social groups, and have increased the need for practical help, childcare, financial aid, but also emotional support to cope with the psychological consequences of social isolation. Hence, even individuals who are not traditionally receivers of informal help have suddenly become dependent on it. Existing research on volunteering, caregiving and donations has shown that the provision of help and volunteer work has a social gradient, and that social inequalities therein can partly be explained by reference to individuals attitudes and social networks. Against this backdrop, we ask: (1) Has the COVID-19 pandemic sparked the emergence of a new local solidarity? (2) What types of help are provided, and to whom? (3) How does socio-economic position affect the provision of different forms of help during the COVID-19 crisis? (4) Which sociological mechanisms can explain these inequalities in helping? Using data from a topical online-survey based on a quota sample which was collected, during the heydays of the first lockdown in Germany, we find that one of two respondents engages in some sort of local solidarity. Depending on the recipient and the way of helping C up to half of these helping arrangements has newly emerged and does not build on already existing (pre-crisis) help-arrangements.

This adaptation is likely due to the leading noise shifting ('adapting') the dynamic range of auditory neurons, which can improve the neural encoding of speech spectral and temporal cues. Because neural dynamic range adaptation depends on stimulus level statistics, here we investigated the importance of 'statistical' adaptation for improving speech recognition in noisy backgrounds. We compared the recognition of noised-masked words in the presence and in the absence of adapting noise precursors whose level was either constant or was changing every 50 ms according to different statistical distributions. Adaptation was measured for 28 listeners (9 men) and was quantified as the recognition improvement in the precursor relative to the no-precursor condition. Adaptation was largest for constant-level precursors and did not occur for highly fluctuating precursors, even when the two types of precursors had the same mean level and both activated the medial olivocochlear reflex. Instantaneous amplitude compression of the highly fluctuating precursor produced as much adaptation as the constant-level precursor did without compression. Altogether, results suggest that noise adaptation in speech recognition is probably mediated by neural dynamic range adaptation to the most frequent sound level. Further, they suggest that auditory peripheral compression per se, rather than the medial olivocochlear reflex, could facilitate noise adaptation by reducing the level fluctuations in the noise.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRecognizing speech in noise is challenging but can be facilitated by noise adaptation. The neural mechanisms underlying this adaptation remain unclear. Here, we report some benefits of adaptation for word-in-noise recognition and show that (1) adaptation occurs for stationary but not for highly fluctuating precursors with equal mean level; (2) both stationary and highly fluctuating noises activate the medial olivocochlear reflex; and (3) adaptation occurs even in highly fluctuating noise when the stimulus is passed through a fast amplitude compressor. These findings suggest that noise adaptation reflects neural dynamic range adaptation to the most frequent noise level and that auditory peripheral compression rather than the medial olivocochlear reflex could facilitate noise adaptation.","output":"Adaptation to noise in human speech recognition depends on noise-level statistics and fast dynamic-range compression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a worldwide pandemic and created an utmost crisis across the globe. To mitigate the crisis, the design of vaccines is a crucial solution. The frequent mutation of the virus demands generalized vaccine candidates, which would be effective for all mutated strains at present and for the strains that would evolve due to further new mutations in the virus. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to identify more frequently occurring mutated variants of SARS-CoV-2 and to suggest peptide vaccine candidates effective in common against the viral strains considered. METHOD In this study, we have identified all currently prevailing mutated strains of SARS-CoV-2 through 2D Polar plot and Quotient Radius(q_R) characterization descriptor. Then, by considering the top eight mutation strains, which are significant due to their frequency of occurrence, peptide regions suitable for vaccine design have been identified with the help of a mathematical model - 2D Polygon Representation, followed by the evaluation of epitope potential and ensuring that there is no case of any autoimmune threat. Lastly, in order to verify whether this entire approach is applicable for vaccine design against any other virus in general, we have made a comparative study between the peptide vaccine candidates prescribed for the Zika virus using the current approach and a list of potential vaccine candidates for the same already established in the past. RESULTS We have finally suggested three generalized peptide regions which would be suitable as sustainable peptide vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of its currently prevailing strains as well any other variant of the same that may appear in the future. We also observed that during the comparative study using the case of E protein of Zika virus, the peptide regions suggested using the new approach matched with the already established results. CONCLUSION The study, therefore, illustrates an approach that would help in developing peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by suggesting those peptide regions which can be targeted irrespective of any mutated form of this virus. The consistency with which this entire approach was also able to figure out similar vaccine candidates for Zika virus with utmost accuracy proves that this protocol can be extended for peptide vaccine design against any other virus in the future.","output":"Identification of Generalized Peptide Regions for Designing Vaccine Effective for All Significant Mutated Strains of SARS-CoV-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The post-translational attachment of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers (ULMs) to proteins regulates many cellular processes including the generation of innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogens.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: EQ-5D-5L values and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) scores. RESULTS: Long-term prevalence of ODGD was 12.8% (19/149) at median time of 264.5 days following SARS-CoV-2 infection onset. Patients with ODGD had a significantly higher median total SNOT-22 score (46.1; Q1CQ3: 23.0C60.0; 95% CI 23.0 to 60.0) compared with those without (16.0; Q1CQ3: 5.0C30.5; 95% CI 12.0 to 18.0) (p=0.0002), reflecting poorer QoL, particularly psychological well-being (p=0.0004), which was not alleviated with time (p=0.4977). Median EQ-5D-5L value was not significantly different between patients with ODGD (0.70; Q1CQ3: 0.38C0.83; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.83) and those without (0.83; Q1CQ3: 0.61C0.94; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89) (p=0.0627). Age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, highest C reactive protein value, intubation and ventilation, and oxygen supplementation were not found to influence ODGD (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 12.8% of previously hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in London still report persistent problems with smell or taste up to a year after infection, impacting their QoL. Increased holistic support including psychological therapy and olfactory rehabilitation for affected patients may help to reduce long-term morbidity.","output":"Prevalence of olfactory dysfunction and quality of life in hospitalised patients 1 year after SARS-CoV-2 infection: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: We propose a method for screening full blood count metadata for evidence of communicable and noncommunicable diseases using machine learning (ML).

DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional, multicenter online survey investigating skin injuries in medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Respondents voluntarily completed the questionnaire on their smartphones. Ordinal and multinomial logistic regression were employed to identify factors related to skin injuries. RESULTS: In total, 1,611 respondents wore protective masks combined with goggles in 145 hospitals in China; 1,281 cases of skin injuries were found, and the overall prevalence was 79.5%. Multiple concomitant skin injuries (68.5%) and injuries in four locations (24.0%) were the most common, followed by injuries in three locations (22.8%), two locations (21.7%) and one location (11.0%). Multinomial logistic regression indicated that sweating increased the risk of injuries in 1-4 locations (95% confidence interval [CI] for odds ratio [OR] 16.23-60.02 for one location and 38.22-239.04 for four locations), and wearing an N95 mask combined with goggles and a daily use > 4 hours increased the risk of injuries in four locations (95% CI for OR 1.18-5.31 and 1.14-3.93, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of skin injuries among medical staff wearing protective masks combined with goggles was very high. These were mainly device-related pressure injuries, moisture-associated skin damage and skin tears. The combination of multiple factors resulted in skin injuries at multiple sites. Preventing and managing sweating should be a focus for medical staff who wear protective masks combined with goggles for more than 4 hours.","output":"Association between Protective Masks Combined with Goggles and Skin Injuries in Medical Staff during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a novel platform for electrical circuits applied for educational purposes based on an Arduino and Matlab-Simulink.

An online survey collected data on alcohol consumption and hangovers related to their heaviest drinking occasion between 15 January and 14 March 2020. When correcting for the amount of alcohol consumed, significant correlations were found between hangover severity and both sensitivity to pain (r = 0.085, p = 0.029) and pain catastrophizing (r = 0.095, p = 0.015). In addition, subjective intoxication correlated significantly with sensitivity to pain (r = 0.080, p = 0.041) and pain catastrophizing (r = 0.099, p = 0.011). Overall, the results were more pronounced in men than women, and the associations with pain catastrophizing were strongest for the subscale assessing rumination.

We assessed whether these lockdowns affected anti-seizure medication (ASM) use and epilepsy-related access to emergency departments (ED) in the general population. Methods: We performed a population-based study using the healthcare administrative database of Tuscany. We defined the weekly time series of prevalence and incidence of ASM, along with the incidence of epilepsy-related ED access from 1 January 2018 to 27 December 2020 in the general population. An interrupted time-series analysis was used to assess the effect of lockdowns on the observed outcomes. Results: Compared to pre-lockdown, we observed a relevant reduction of ASM incidence (0.65; 95% Confidence Intervals: 0.59C0.72) and ED access (0.72; 0.64C0.82), and a slight decrease of ASM prevalence (0.95; 0.94C0.96). During the post-lockdown the ASM incidence reported higher values compared to pre-lockdown, whereas ASM prevalence and ED access remained lower. Results also indicate a lower impact of the second lockdown for both ASM prevalence (0.97; 0.96C0.98) and incidence (0.89; 0.80C0.99). Conclusion: The lockdowns implemented during the COVID-19 outbreaks significantly affected ASM use and epilepsy-related ED access. The potential consequences of these phenomenon are still unknown, although an increased incidence of epilepsy-related symptoms after the first lockdown has been observed.

These varied mechanisms can be better understood when combined with the study of the ultrastructural morphological variability of spermatozoa. Within the coral snakes, genus Micrurus, there are differences in the reproductive strategies adopted between monads (BRM) and triads (BRT); the aim of this work was to relate these two strategies to morphological differences among spermatozoa within different species. The semen of six Micrurus was collected using a non-invasive technique, fixed and processed for scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Micrurus spermatozoa have the same ultrastructure as those of other snake species, comprising the head, divided into acrosome, nucleus and neck; the midpiece; and the two parts of the tail, the principal piece and the end piece. Micrurus corallinus and Micrurus surinamensis presented evident multilaminar membranes occurring along all the pieces, while Micrurus frontalis and Micrurus altirostris showed cytoplasmic droplets occurring mainly in the midpiece. The differences found in spermatozoa morphology may be related with sperm storage in these four coral snakes, since the development of multilaminar membranes in the midpiece and the maintenance of cytoplasmic droplets in the mature sperm are both features related to extra energy provision for the spermatozoa while stored.","output":"Sperm storage in coral snakes: a spermatozoa ultrastructural approach (Serpentes: Elapidae)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) XIST establishes X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female cells in early development and thereafter is thought to be largely dispensable.

The aim of our case-ascertained study is to examine transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 among children and staff based on outbreaks in day care centres in Germany. Methods Based on day care centres with at least one reported case of SARS-CoV-2 we include 1-6-year-old children and staff of the affected group in the day care centre as well as their respective households. We test each study participant on acute and past SARS-CoV-2 infection with innovative child friendly tests and collect data on sociodemographics and symptoms. At four further measurement points within 12 days, the participants carry out the tests on SARS-CoV-2 by themselves. From October 2020 to May 2021, 25 day care centres with SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks participated and we included n = 244 children 1-6 years and n = 72 staff members in the study. Results First analyses from 25 outbreaks showed that the observed infection events in the examined day care centres were very different. Often, no or only few transmissions were found among the participants in the day care group, but in one day care centre, 13 people were infected: Between 0% and 81% of close contact persons in the day care centres were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the study period. Children showed a similar percentage of secondary SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to adults (both 11%). Conclusions The study has been successful in detecting previously undetected infections of SARS-CoV-2 in day care centres.

This is particularly evident in immune systems, where random recombination produces millions of antibodies from only a few genes; in nervous systems, where stochastic mechanisms vary the sensory receptors and synaptic matching molecules produced by different neurons; and in microbial antigenic variation. These systems employ overlapping molecular strategies including allelic exclusion, gene silencing by constitutive heterochromatin, targeted double-strand breaks, and competition for limiting enhancers.

The inclusion criteria were studies that specifically assessed a sample of saliva or DTS with at least one other respiratory specimen in patients with COVID-19 infection, based on RT-PCR tests. The DerSimonian-Laird bivariate random-effects model analysis performed using STATA software with the \\"metaprop\\" package. RESULTS: From 1598 studies, we retrieved 33 records, of which 26 studies were included for quantitative analysis. We found an overall sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 86-100) for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, 92% (95% CI, 80-99) for double naso/oropharyngeal swabs, 87% (95% CI, 77-95) for nasopharyngeal swabs, 83% (95% CI, 77-89) for saliva, 82% (95% CI, 76-88) for DTS, and 44% (95% CI, 35-52) for oropharyngeal swabs among symptomatic patients, respectively. Regardless of the type of specimens, the viral load and sensitivity in the severe patients were higher than mild and in the symptomatic patients higher than asymptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS: The present review provides evidence for the diagnostic value of different respiratory specimens and supports saliva and DTS as promising diagnostic tools for first-line screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the methods of sampling, storing, and laboratory assay need to be optimized and validated before introducing as a definitive diagnosis tool. Saliva, DTS, and nasopharyngeal swab showed approximately similar results, and sensitivity was directly related to the disease severity. This review revealed a relationship between viral load, disease severity, and test sensitivity. None of the specimens showed appropriate diagnostic sensitivity for asymptomatic patients.","output":"Are saliva and deep throat sputum as reliable as common respiratory specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection?

Out of 86 PLHIV with COVID-19 illness, 19.7% had severe/critical illness and 6 (6.9%) individuals died. Median (IQR) age was 51 (47-56) years and 77.6% were male. Eighty-five PLHIV were on antiretroviral treatment with 98% having a Viral load < 200 copies/ml. Hypertension (38.3%) and Diabetes mellitus (17.4%) were commonest co-morbidities. Fifty-eight percent PLHIV were hospitalized while 6.9% individuals needed Intensive care. Presence of medical co-morbidity was significantly associated with severe/critical COVID-19, while Hypertension was significantly associated with mortality. Recovery from COVID-19 was documented in 93% PLHIV. In conclusion, PLHIV in Western India have similar COVID-19 clinical outcomes as compared to that reported historically amongst general population.

Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) has the advantages of being a sedative agent that does not require a painful injection and that offers shallower levels of sedation and a rapid recovery of mental state. We evaluated the clinical usefulness of N(2)O compared with intravenous ketamine when used for the repair of lacerations in children in the ED. METHODS From January to December 2009, we performed a prospective, randomized study at a single academic ED enrolling pediatric patients aged 3 to 10 years who needed primary repair of a laceration wound. The primary outcome was recovery time, which was defined as the time from completion of procedure to recovery of mental state. Other outcomes were sedation depth, pain scale, adverse effects, and satisfaction with sedation. RESULTS There were 32 children who were randomly assigned. Recovery times were shorter in the N(2)O group compared with those in the ketamine group (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.0 minutes, [0.0-4.0 minutes] vs 21.5 minutes [12.5-37.5 minutes], P < 0.05). Sedation levels were deeper in the ketamine group than in the N2O group, but pain scales were comparable between groups. No difference was observed in the satisfaction scores by physicians, parents, or nurses. CONCLUSIONS Nitrous oxide inhalation was preferable to injectable ketamine for pediatric patients because it is safe, allows for a faster recovery, maintains sufficient sedation time, and does not induce unnecessarily deep sedation.","output":"A randomized comparison of nitrous oxide versus intravenous ketamine for laceration repair in children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sweeping across our country has reawakened the fear, pain, stigma, and loss of past outbreaks of infectious diseases among American Indians and Alaska Natives.

Our inclusion criteria were: manual therapy (by regulated or registered professionals) of unsettled, distressed and excessively crying infants who were otherwise healthy and treated in a primary care setting. Outcomes of interest were: crying, feeding, sleep, parent-child relations, parent experience/satisfaction and parent-reported global change. RESULTS Nineteen studies were selected for full review: seven randomised controlled trials, seven case series, three cohort studies, one service evaluation study and one qualitative study.We found moderate strength evidence for the effectiveness of manual therapy on: reduction in crying time (favourable: -1.27 hours per day (95% CI -2.19 to -0.36)), sleep (inconclusive), parent-child relations (inconclusive) and global improvement (no effect).

Here, we report three-dimensional (3D) internal analysis of N95 filtration layers via X-ray tomography. Using deep learning methods, we uncover how the distribution and diameters of fibers within these layers directly affect contaminant particle filtration. The average porosity of the filter layers is found to be 89.1%. Contaminants are more efficiently captured by denser fiber regions, with fibers <1.8 m in diameter being particularly effective, presumably because of the stronger electric field gradient on smaller diameter fibers.

The primary aim of this study was to identify the predictors of early discharge and readiness for discharge in a study population. METHODS: Early discharge was defined as discharge occurring in 72 h or less after surgery. The characteristics and clinical outcomes of the patients in the early and non-early discharge groups were compared, and variables associated with early discharge were identified. Additionally, independent variables associated with the readiness for discharge within 48 h were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 965 patients who underwent colorectal surgery between January 2015 and July 2020, 788 were included in this study. No differences in readmission, reoperation, or 30-day mortality were observed between the early and non-early discharge groups. Both early discharge and readiness for discharge had a positive association with adherence to 80 per cent or more of the ERAS items and a negative association with the female sex, duration of surgery, drain positioning, and postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: Early discharge after colorectal surgery is safe and feasible, and is not associated with a high risk of readmission or reoperation. Discharge at 48 h can be reliably predicted in a subset of patients. Future studies should collect prospective data on early discharge related to safety, as well as patients expectations, possible organizational issues, and effective costs reduction in Italian clinical practice.","output":"Feasibility of discharge within 72 hours of major colorectal surgery: lessons learned after 5 years of institutional experience with the ERAS protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID pandemic generated unparalleled operational disruption.

However, length of stay (LOS), as a healthcare quality indicator, has not been examined across the healthcare regions in the KSA. Therefore, this study aimed to examine factors associated with LOS to better understand the Saudi Health System's performance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the newly suggested five Saudi regional business units (BUs). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using Ministry of Health (MOH) data on hospital LOS during the period from March to mid-July 2020. Participants were adult inpatients (18 years or older) with confirmed COVID-19 (n = 1743 patients). The 13 regions of the KSA were united into the defined five regional BUs during the reorganization of the health system. Covariates included demographics such as age and sex, comorbidities, and complications of COVID-19. A multiple linear regression with stepwise forward selection was used to model LOS for other explanatory variables associated with LOS, including demographic, comorbidities, and complications. RESULTS: The mean LOS was 11.85 days which differed significantly across the BUs, ranging from 9.3 days to 13.3 days (p value < 0.001). BUs differed significantly in LOS for transferred patients but not for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) or those who died in-hospital. The multiple regression analysis revealed that the LOS for inpatients admitted in the Eastern and Southern BUs was significantly shorter than for those in the Central BU. (p value < 0.001). Admission to the ICU was associated with lengthier stays (p value < 0.0001). Factors significantly associated with shorter stays (compared to the reference), were being Saudi, death during admission, and patients referred to another hospital (p value < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The LOS for patients with COVID-19 differed across the proposed regional healthcare BUs, suggesting regional differences in quality of care under the reorganization of the national health system. Since patient and disease characteristics did not explain these findings, differences in staffing and other resources need to be examined to develop interventions.","output":"Variations in length of stay of inpatients with COVID-19: A nationwide test of the new model of care under vision 2030 in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although generally known as a human commensal, Staphylococcus epidermidis is also an opportunistic pathogen that can cause nosocomial infections related to foreign body materials and immunocompromized patients. Infections are often caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) lineages that are difficult and costly to treat, and can have a major adverse impact on patients' quality of life. Heterogeneity is a common phenomenon in both carriage and infection, but present methodology for detection of this is laborious or expensive. In this study, we present a culture-independent method, labelled Epidome, based on an amplicon sequencing-approach to deliver information beyond species level on primary samples and to elucidate clonality, population structure and temporal stability or niche selection of S. epidermidis communities. RESULTS: Based on an assessment of > 800 genes from the S. epidermidis core genome, we identified genes with variable regions, which in combination facilitated the differentiation of phylogenetic clusters observed in silico, and allowed classification down to lineage level. A duplex PCR, combined with an amplicon sequencing protocol, and a downstream analysis pipeline were designed to provide subspecies information from primary samples. Additionally, a probe-based qPCR was designed to provide valuable absolute abundance quantification of S. epidermidis. The approach was validated on isolates representing skin commensals and on genomic mock communities with a sensitivity of < 10 copies/L. The method was furthermore applied to a sample set of primary skin and nasal samples, revealing a high degree of heterogeneity in the S. epidermidis populations. Additionally, the qPCR showed a high degree of variation in absolute abundance of S. epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: The Epidome method is designed for use on primary samples to obtain important information on S. epidermidis abundance and diversity beyond species-level to answer questions regarding the emergence and dissemination of nosocomial lineages, investigating clonality of S. epidermidis communities, population dynamics, and niche selection. Our targeted-sequencing method allows rapid differentiation and identification of clinically important nosocomial lineages in low-biomass samples such as skin samples.","output":"The Epidome - a species-specific approach to assess the population structure and heterogeneity of Staphylococcus epidermidis colonization and infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontline defense against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

At the same time, infant mortality in Moscow has significantly decreased which is associated with a sharp decrease in the share of births among nonresidents (it exceeded a quarter of all births in the capital in 2019). The reduction in labor migration due to the closure of borders has led to a decrease in births among nonresidents. Using the decomposition method, it was shown that the greatest negative contribution to the loss of life expectancy in both sexes was made by mortality in the age group of 70-74 years which reduced life expectancy by 0.36 years for men and 0.27 years for women.

At this time, there appears little consensus regarding questions of psychological continuity. I argue that this is a futile debate. Rather than focusing on behavior in nonhuman animals that represent potential parallels to human psychology (or behavior), comparative psychologists should focus on questions of development, function, and mechanism of behavior to better understand the behavior of all species in biological context. A focus on understanding underlying mechanisms for behavior rather than settling on behavioral outcomes alone as diagnostic of a species' status on some imaginary scale of progress will help address anthropocentric biases in current approaches.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that this sequence clustered within the East/ Central/South African CHIKV genotype. Using this sequence information, we constructed a CHIKV-pseudotyped lenti-virus expressing the structural polyprotein of the Korean CHIKV isolate (CHIKVpseudo) and dual reporter genes of green fluorescence protein and luciferase. We then developed a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay (PBNA) using CHIKVpseudo. Results from this assay compared to those from the conventional plaque reduction neutralization test showed that our PBNA was a reliable and rapid method to evaluate the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies. More importantly, the neutralizing activities of human sera from CHIKV-infected individuals were quantitated by PBNA using CHIKVpseudo.

Out of the 120 chicken tracheal samples collected and tested, 84 (70%) were positive for G. anatis. Genotyping by Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis and genome sequencing revealed a total of 24 pulsotypes for 71 strains (at a 87% similarity level) and seven genome clusters comprising 21 strains (97% similarity level), respectively. The combination of the two typing methods confirmed the presence of several genotypes originating from a common ancestor affecting poultry yet also suggested that identical clones were shared among chickens within farms and between different farms. The latter finding is to our knowledge the first example of clonal presence of G. anatis in epidemiologically unrelated farms. The 21 sequenced strains were characterized against a panel of commonly used antibiotics and showed lowered sensitivity to tetracycline (76.2%) and enrofloxacin (90.5%).

When confined to the plasma membrane, the lysine-competent IFITM3 lost restriction against VSV-G pseudotyped viral vectors but gained antiviral activity against vectors that fuse directly at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, altering the lysines did not alter IFITM3 homodimerization but impacted higher-order protein complex formation, suggesting loss of interaction with cellular co-factors. In agreement, IFITM3 expression was not sufficient to restrict viral vectors in myeloid K562 cells as opposed to promonocytic THP1 or primary HSC. We exclude the involvement of previously identified factors affecting IFITM3 biology and propose a novel model for IFITM3 restriction that depends on the presence of cellular co-factor(s) that may interact with IFITM3 through the intracellular loop lysine residues. Overall, our work provides significant insight into the mechanisms of action of IFITM3 and CsH that can be exploited for improved gene therapies and broadly acting antiviral strategies.","output":"The lysine-rich intracellular loop and cell type-specific co-factors are required for IFITM3 antiviral immunity in hematopoietic stem cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza viruses have caused disease outbreaks in human societies for a long time.

There were 9 (25.7%) patients with saliva positive/swab negative result and this included 5 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients undergoing repeat screening. Using the swab as the reference gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of saliva were 73.1% (95% CI 52.2C88.4%) and 97.6% (95% CI 95.5C98.9%) while the positive and negative predictive values were 67.9% (95% CI 51.5C80.8%) and 98.1% (95% CI 96.5C99.0%), respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest good diagnostic accuracy for saliva and feasibility of utilization of specimen without transport media for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR.

MethodsHCWs at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (STH) were prospectively enrolled and sampled at two time points. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were tested using an in-house assay for IgG and IgA reactivity against Spike and Nucleoprotein (sensitivity 99{middle dot}47%, specificity 99{middle dot}56%). Data were analysed using three statistical models: a seroprevalence model, an antibody kinetics model, and a heterogeneous sensitivity model. FindingsAs of 12th June 2020, 24{middle dot}4% (n=311/1275) HCWs were seropositive. Of these, 39{middle dot}2% (n=122/311) were asymptomatic. The highest adjusted seroprevalence was measured in HCWs on the Acute Medical Unit (41{middle dot}1%, 95% CrI 30{middle dot}0-52{middle dot}9) and in Physiotherapists and Occupational Therapists (39{middle dot}2%, 95% CrI 24{middle dot}4-56{middle dot}5). Older age groups showed overall higher median antibody titres. Further modelling suggests that, for a serological assay with an overall sensitivity of 80%, antibody titres may be markedly affected by differences in age, with sensitivity estimates of 89% in those over 60 years but 61% in those []30 years. InterpretationHCWs in acute medical units working closely with COVID-19 patients were at highest risk of infection, though whether these are infections acquired from patients or other staff is unknown. Current serological assays may underestimate seroprevalence in younger age groups if validated using sera from older and/or more symptomatic individuals. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for studies published up to March 6th 2021, using the terms \\"COVID\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"seroprevalence\\", and \\"healthcare workers\\", and in addition for articles of antibody titres in different age groups against coronaviruses using \\"coronavirus\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2, \\"antibody\\", \\"antibody tires\\", \\"COVID\\" and \\"age\\". We included studies that used serology to estimate prevalence in healthcare workers. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence has been shown to be greater in healthcare workers working on acute medical units or within domestic services. Antibody levels against seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were found to be higher in older adults, and patients who were hospitalised. Added value of this studyIn this healthcare worker seroprevalence modelling study at a large NHS foundation trust, we confirm that those working on acute medical units, COVID-19 \\"Red Zones\\" and within domestic services are most likely to be seropositive. Furthermore, we show that physiotherapists and occupational therapists have an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. We also confirm that antibody titres are greater in older individuals, even in the context of non-hospitalised cases. Importantly, we demonstrate that this can result in age-specific sensitivity in serological assays, where lower antibody titres in younger individuals results in lower assay sensitivity. Implications of all the available evidenceThere are distinct occupational roles and locations in hospitals where the risk of COVID-19 infection to healthcare workers is greatest, and this knowledge should be used to prioritise infection prevention control and other measures to protect healthcare workers. Serological assays may have different sensitivity profiles across different age groups, especially if assay validation was undertaken using samples from older and/or hospitalised patients, who tend to have higher antibody titres. Future seroprevalence studies should consider adjusting for age-specific assay sensitivities to estimate true seroprevalence rates.

OBJECTIVE We offer a comprehensive review of the temporoparietal fascia flap (TPFF) and provide a step-by-step illustration of its application performed under local anesthesia for a challenging reconstructive scenario. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 66-year-old male initially underwent Mohs micrographic surgery resulting in a large full-thickness defect at the postauricular scalp contiguous with a through-and-through defect of the upper right ear. A TPFF was performed under local anesthesia to reconstruct the surgical defect. RESULTS Complete healing in our patient was noted at 10 weeks after completion of the TPFF. However, granulation caused adherence of the ear to the postauricular scalp, which was corrected by a dividing incision to release the ear. At 4 weeks after the division, lateral projection of the ears was symmetric and readherence of the ear did not recur. CONCLUSION The TPFF is a highly versatile pedicled flap that can be performed under local anesthesia to reconstruct a variety of complex defects on the head and neck. This case reveals that the TPFF adds a powerful tool to the armamentarium of dermatologic surgeons.","output":"The temporoparietal fascia flap: a versatile tool for the dermatologic surgeon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmission of pathogens through currency notes has become very relevant in todays world due to Covid-19 pandemic.

Rapid spread of COVID-19 has forced clinicians to care for patients with a highly contagious disease without evidence-based guidelines. Using a virtual modified nominal group technique, the Pediatric Difficult Intubation Collaborative (PeDI-C), which currently includes 35 hospitals from 6 countries, generated consensus guidelines on airway management in pediatric anesthesia based on expert opinion and early data about the disease. PeDI-C identified overarching goals during care, including minimizing aerosolized respiratory secretions, minimizing the number of clinicians in contact with a patient, and recognizing that undiagnosed asymptomatic patients may shed the virus and infect health care workers. Recommendations include administering anxiolytic medications, intravenous anesthetic inductions, tracheal intubation using video laryngoscopes and cuffed tracheal tubes, use of in-line suction catheters, and modifying workflow to recover patients from anesthesia in the operating room. Importantly, PeDI-C recommends that anesthesiologists consider using appropriate personal protective equipment when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures in asymptomatic children, in addition to known or suspected children with COVID-19. Airway procedures should be done in negative pressure rooms when available. Adequate time should be allowed for operating room cleaning and air filtration between surgical cases. Research using rigorous study designs is urgently needed to inform safe practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Until further information is available, PeDI-C advises that clinicians consider these guidelines to enhance the safety of health care workers during airway management when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures.

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of blunt-tip needles in the surgery. METHODS Cases of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy were reviewed. If a blunt-tip needle had been used to suture the DVC, the patient was recruited to the blunt-tip group. If a regular needle was used, the patient was recruited to the control group. Patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. RESULTS One hundred and nine cases were reviewed. A blunt-tip needle was used to suture the DVC in 67 cases, and a regular needle in 42 cases. All characteristics of the two groups are comparable (p > 0.05). In 66 cases in the blunt-tip group, no sutures or coagulations were needed when suturing the DVC, Five cases of DVC-related bleeding were observed in the control group, which is higher than in the blunt-tip group (p = 0.031). At the same time, no catheter was sutured in the blunt-tip group. All patients were followed for at least six months. The continence rate in the blunt-tip group is 89.6%, significantly higher than in the control group (73.8%, p = 0.031).

Despite robust evidence of efficacy and safety, key questions regarding the manner of their use remain unanswered. Recent studies demonstrated that the Pipeline device geometry can dramatically affect its metal coverage, emphasizing the negative effects of oversizing the device relative to its target vessels. This follow-up investigation focuses on the geometry and coverage of multidevice constructs. MATERIALS AND METHODS A number of Pipeline devices were deployed in tubes of known diameters and photographed, and the resultant coverage was determined by image segmentation. Multidevice segmentation images were created to study the effects of telescoped devices and provide an estimate of coverages resulting from device overlap. RESULTS Double overlap yields a range of metal coverage, rather than a single value, determined by the diameters of both devices, the size of the recipient artery, and the degree to which strands of the overlapped devices are coregistered with each other. The potential variation in coverage is greatest during overlap of identical-diameter devices, for example, ranging from 24% to 41% for two 3.75-mm devices deployed in a 3.5-mm vessel. Overlapping devices of progressively different diameters produce correspondingly more uniform ranges of coverage, though reducing the maximum achievable value, for example, yielding a 33%-34% range for 3.75- and 4.75-mm devices deployed in the same 3.5-mm vessel.

The objective of this study was to monitor reliability of the laboratory results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through an external quality assessment (EQA) scheme. METHODS: For this, the Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna was tasked by the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection to perform the first Austrian EQA on SARS-CoV-2 which was organised in cooperation with the Austrian Association for Quality Assurance and Standardization of Medical and Diagnostic Tests (?QUASTA). Data were analysed on the basis of qualitative outcome of testing in relation to the nucleic acid (NA) extraction and detection methods used. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 52 laboratories participated, contributing results from 67 test panels comprising 42 distinct combinations of NA extraction and PCR reagents. By testing 3 positive (CT values: S1, 28.4; S2, 33.6; S3, 38.5) and 1 negative sample, no false-positive results were obtained by any of the laboratories. Otherwise, 40/67 tests (60 %) detected all positive samples correctly as positive, but 25/67 tests (37 %) did not detect the weakest positive sample (S3), and 3 % reported S2 and S3 as false-negative.

The GenOSept study was designed to determine genetic influences on sepsis outcome. Phenotypic data was recorded using a robust clinical database allowing a contemporary analysis of the clinical characteristics, microbiology, outcomes and independent risk factors in patients with severe CAP admitted to ICUs across Europe. METHODS: Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine mortality rates. A Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model was used to identify variables independently associated with 28-day and six-month mortality. RESULTS: Data from 1166 patients admitted to 102 centres across 17 countries was extracted. Median age was 64 years, 62% were male. Mortality rate at 28 days was 17%, rising to 27% at six months. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest organism isolated (28% of cases) with no organism identified in 36%. Independent risk factors associated with an increased risk of death at six months included APACHE II score (hazard ratio, HR, 1.03; confidence interval, CI, 1.01-1.05), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (HR1.44; CI 1.11-1.87) and ventilator support (HR 3.04; CI 1.64-5.62). Haematocrit, pH and urine volume on day one were all associated with a worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate in patients with severe CAP admitted to European ICUs was 27% at six months. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest organism isolated. In many cases the infecting organism was not identified.

Wounds and skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common complications of IDU that disproportionately affect people who inject drugs (PWID) and are a major source of morbidity and mortality for this population. Critical Issues: Injections in a nonsterile environment and reusing or sharing needles facilitates bacterial inoculation, with subsequent risk of serious complications such as sepsis, gangrene, amputation, and death. PWID are susceptible to infections with a wide spectrum of organisms beyond common culprits of SSTI, including Clostridium and Bacillus spp., as well as Candida. Recent Advances: Syringe services programs (SSPs) are cost-effective and successful in reducing harms associated with IDU. SSPs provide new equipment to PWID and aid in discarding used equipment. SSPs aim to reduce the risks of unhygienic injecting practices, which are associated with transmission of infections and blood-borne pathogens. Future Directions: Concurrently run SSPs and wound care clinics are uniquely positioned to facilitate care to PWID. Providing new, sterile equipment as well as early wound care intervention can reduce morbidity and mortality as well as health care expenditures by reducing the number of SSTI and injection-related wounds that require hospital admission.

The current study aimed to examine these effects and additionally benefit individuals' mental health by making their meaning salient. Specifically, the goal of the research was to design an intervention that could counter the potential negative effects of social distancing. We recruited a total of 96 U.S.A. residents (M age = 34.45, 92.7% Female) and assigned them to either the control group or to a meaning salience intervention. That is, participants either focused on the meaning of their daily activities (n = 45) or did not participate in any study-related activities during the week (n = 51). They completed various measures of mental health before and after this experimental period. Results suggested that the control group reported significantly greater anxiety, depression, and stress at the end of the week. In contrast, the experimental group reported less anxiety and trended toward less depression and stress at the end of that same week. In all, results suggest that simply focusing on one's daily activities and the meaning found in them protected people from the otherwise detrimental effects of the restrictions.

A clinical examination of infected peacocks identified birds with symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, yellowish droppings, airsacculitis, sinusitis, and conjunctivitis, whereas the infected farmers showed high fever and respiratory distress. Immunofluorescence tests detected chlamydial antigens in pharyngeal swabs (12 of 20) and lung tissue samples (four of five) from peacocks. One of four swabs taken from farmers was also positive by the same test. Specific anti-chlamydia immunoglobulin G was detected in 16 of 20 peacocks and four of four peacock farmers. The isolated pathogen was able to grow in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos and McCoy cell lines and was identified as Chlamydiae by immunofluorescence assay and PCR. Avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious bronchitis virus were eliminated as potential causative agents after pharyngeal swabs inoculated onto the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonate eggs failed to recover viable virus. PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism indicated the ompA gene from the isolate was similar to that of avian C. psittaci type B. Three-week-old SPF chickens challenged with the peacock isolate via intraperitoneal injection showed a typical pneumonia, airsacculitis, and splenitis. Subsequently, the inoculating strain was recovered from the lungs of challenged birds. This is the first report of C. psittaci infection in peacocks and peacock farmers.","output":"Isolation and characterization of peacock Chlamydophila psittaci infection in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the time of writing, it is unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will play out in rapidly urbanising regions of the world. In these regions, the realities of large overcrowded informal settlements, a high burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases, as well as malnutrition and precarity of livelihoods, have raised added concerns about the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in these contexts. COVID-19 infection control measures have been shown to have some effects in slowing down the progress of the pandemic, effectively buying time to prepare the healthcare system. However, there has been less of a focus on the indirect impacts of these measures on health behaviours and the consequent health risks, particularly in the most vulnerable. In this current debate piece, focusing on two of the four risk factors that contribute to >80% of the NCD burden, we consider the possible ways that the restrictions put in place to control the pandemic, have the potential to impact on dietary and physical activity behaviours and their determinants. By considering mitigation responses implemented by governments in several LMIC cities, we identify key lessons that highlight the potential of economic, political, food and built environment sectors, mobilised during the pandemic, to retain health as a priority beyond the context of pandemic response. Such whole-of society approaches are feasible and necessary to support equitable healthy eating and active living required to address other epidemics and to lower the baseline need for healthcare in the long term.","output":"Implications of COVID-19 control measures for diet and physical activity, and lessons for addressing other pandemics facing rapidly urbanising countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of a prevention strategy against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among dental hospital staff over a 3-month period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effectiveness of the prevention strategy, which adopted healthcare staff protective measures, including patient triage and correct usage of personal preventive equipment, was evaluated by SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing. Patients who visited the Affiliated Stomatology Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China, between January 31 and March 1 (lockdown period) and March 2 and April 27 (reopening period) in 2020 and in the same period in 2019 were included in the study. Patients' diagnosis, age, gender, and several undergoing aerosol-generating procedures during the study period were collected from the hospital's database. Corresponding data were compared year-on-year (2020-on-2019). A total of 757 hospital staff underwent SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing on April 28-29, 2020. RESULTS: During the lockdown and reopening period in 2020, the number of hospital visits was dramatically decreased to about 6% and 58%, respectively, compared with the same period in 2019. However, emergency visits were increased 16- and 6.4-fold. A total of at least 6654 patients (13.58%) underwent aerosol-generating procedures during the study period in the year 2020. All hospital staff were negative according to SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing (IgG, IgM) data. CONCLUSION: During the study period in 2020, the total number of hospital visits dramatically reduced but emergency visits significantly increased. The prevention strategy implemented successfully prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection spread among healthcare workers in a dental hospital. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The prevention strategy indicated patient triage and how to adopt preventive measures for controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread among healthcare workers.

Although most often used in the laboratory it has seen increasing application under field conditions. Air is drawn or pushed through a metabolic chamber or the nest with the animal, and the O2 depletion and/or CO2 accumulation in the air is analysed to calculate metabolic rate and energy expenditure. Under field conditions, animals are often measured within the microclimate of their nest and in contrast to laboratory work, the temperature of the air entering the nest cannot be controlled. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the explanatory power of respirometry in a set-up mimicking field conditions. We measured O2 consumption of 14 laboratory mice (Mus musculus) using three different flow rates [50 L*h-1 (834 mL*min-1), 60 L*h-1 (1000 mL*min-1) and 70 L*h-1 (1167 mL*min-1)] and two different temperatures of the inflowing air; either the same as the temperature inside the metabolic chamber (no temperature differential; 20 C), or cooler (temperature differential of 10 C). Our results show that the energy expenditure of the mice did not change significantly in relation to a cooler airflow, nor was it affected by different flow rates, despite a slight, but significant decrease of about 1.5 C in chamber temperature with the cooler airflow. Our study emphasises the validity of the results obtained by open-flow respirometry when investigating energy budgets and physiological responses of animals to ambient conditions. Nevertheless, subtle changes in chamber temperature in response to changes in the temperature and flow rate of the air pulled or pushed through the system were detectable. Thus, constant airflow during open-flow respirometry and consequent changes in nest/chamber temperature should be measured.","output":"Open-flow respirometry under field conditions: How does the airflow through the nest influence our results?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are the professional workers directly acquired infection during this coronavirus outbreak Coronavirus potentially severe acute respiratory infection caused by nCOVID-19 has been declared by pandemic on 11th March 2020 by Word health organisation (WHO) The pre-vious study has reported high susceptibility of respiratory infection in the HCWs The HCWs are at increased risk for severe respiratory syndrome coro-navirus infection The spread of coronavirus became global public health event, threatening physical and Mental Health of HCWs This study reviews the possible risk factors for being infected HCWs and avoid transmission of infection at the workplace Spreading the coronavirus day by day is the life-threatening condition for Health care workers during a pandemic The community should understand the HCWs increased responsibility during this public health emergency and must provide the necessary social support as well There should be enough protective and preventive measures for avoid-ing transmission in HCWs Apart from heavy duties HCWs while using PPEs they also have physical and mental exhaustion along with the fear produced out of risk-specific exposures","output":"Healthcare workers novel coronavirus (NCOVID 19) life-threatening situation during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the UK charity sector, outline possible opportunities for researchers in accounting/management as a consequence and discuss possible strategies to respond to the pandemic Design/methodology/approachLiterature-based personal critical reflection FindingsCOVID-19 has created a perfect storm for charities, as major swathes of income have been lost, demands on services have increased and some are unable to operate at all because of imposed constraints Originality/valuePossible avenues for research, arising from the context of the crisis in the sector, are highlighted Moreover, several useful strategies are emphasised to enable charities to navigate the crisis","output":"UK charities and the pandemic: navigating the perfect storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. This novel coronavirus emerged in China, quickly spreading to more than 200 countries worldwide. Although most patients are only mildly ill or even asymptomatic, some develop severe pneumonia and become critically ill. One of the biggest unanswered questions is why some develop severe disease, whilst others do not. Insight on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system and the contribution of dysfunctional immune responses to disease progression will be instrumental to the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, risk factors for worst outcome, and rational design of effective therapies and vaccines. In this review we have gathered the knowledge available thus far on the epidemiology of SARS-COV-2 infection, focusing on the susceptibility of older individuals, SARS-CoV-2-host cell interaction during infection and the immune response directed at SARS-CoV-2. Dendritic cells act as crucial messengers linking innate and adaptative immunity against viral infections. Thus, this review also brings a focused discussion on the role of dendritic cells and their immune functions during SARS-CoV-2 infection and how immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV-2 and advancing age mediate dendritic cell dysfunctions that contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis and increased susceptibility to worst outcomes. This review brings to light the hypothesis that concomitant occurrence of dendritic cell dysfunction/cytopathic effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 and/or aging may influence disease outcome in the elderly. Lastly, a detailed discussion on the effects and mechanisms of action of drugs currently being tested for COVID-19 on the function of dendritic cells is also provided.","output":"Dendritic cells in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis: insights for a possible role in determining disease outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On college campuses, effective management of vaccine-preventable transmissible pathogens requires understanding student vaccination intentions.

Little is known about the pathogenesis and innate antiviral response in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs) upon MERS-CoV infection. In this study, we assessed MERS-CoV replication as well as induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in MDMs and immature and mature MDDCs. Immature MDDCs and MDMs were permissive for MERS-CoV infection, while mature MDDCs were not, with stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine upregulation in MDMs, but not in MDDCs. To further evaluate the antiviral activity of well-defined drugs in primary antigen presenting cells (APCs), three compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine and toremifine), each with broad-spectrum antiviral activity in immortalized cell lines, were evaluated in MDMs and MDDCs to determine their antiviral effect on MERS-CoV infection. While chloroquine was not active in these primary cells, chlorpromazine showed strong anti-MERS-CoV activity, but it was associated with high cytotoxicity narrowing the potential window for drug utilization. Unlike in established cells, toremifene had marginal activity when tested in antigen presenting cells, with high apparent cytotoxicity, also limiting its potential as a therapeutic option. These results demonstrate the value of testing drugs in primary cells, in addition to established cell lines, before initiating preclinical or clinical studies for MERS treatment and the importance of carefully assessing cytotoxicity in drug screen assays.

In some cases, treating SARS-CoV-2 infection concomitant with other diseases can be particularly challenging, as finding an appropriate treatment may involve some risks. Case presentation: A 34-year-old SARS-CoV-2 positive patient admitted due to fever, dyspnoea, haemoptysis and pneumonia, developed alveolar haemorrhage and acute kidney injury. Due to his severe state, abnormalities in laboratory tests and rapidly progressing loss of kidney function, kidney biopsy, as well as antibody panel were carried out, in which perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) were found with a high titer (>200; N: <1:20). The results of kidney biopsy, combined with clinical manifestation and laboratory findings prompted the diagnosis of rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis (RPGN) in the course of p-ANCA vasculitis. Initial treatment consisted of heamodialyses, remdesivir, plasmaphereses, intravenous immunoglobulins, antibiotics, corticosteroids and fraxiparine. Once the haemorrhage had subsided, kidney function had been partially retrieved and heamodialyses had no longer been necessary, cyclophosphamide treatment was initiated, despite being contraindicated in COVID-19 according to its summary of product characteristics. Immunotherapy is still continued. The patient has already received a total of 2.4g of cyclophosphamide (4 cycles of 600mg each every three weeks). Pulmonary and radiological regression, as well as improvement of renal parameters have been achieved. Conclusions: We suspect that cyclophosphamide, the drug of choice in p-ANCA vasculitis, could be a potential factor providing regression of the radiological changes in the lungs and it could have prevented the patient from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. COVID-19 diagnosis should not exclude searching for other diseases which can have a similar course. When treating a patient in a life-threatening condition, a departure from trying to find the perfect timing of cyclophosphamide delivery should be considered, as delaying it could cause potentially greater harm.","output":"Case Report: Cyclophosphamide in COVID-19 C when an absolute contraindication is an absolute necessity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Avian cryptosporidiosis is a common parasitic disease that is caused by five species, which are well characterised at the molecular and biological level, and more than 18 genotypes for which we have limited information. In this study, we determined the occurrence and molecular characteristics of Cryptosporidium spp. in farmed ostriches in the Czech Republic. METHODS The occurrence and genetic identity of Cryptosporidium spp. were analysed by microscopy and PCR/sequencing of the small subunit rRNA, actin, HSP70 and gp60 genes. Cryptosporidium avian genotype II was examined from naturally and experimentally infected hosts and measured using differential interference contrast. The localisation of the life-cycle stages was studied by electron microscopy and histologically. Infectivity of Cryptosporidium avian genotype II for cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus (Kerr)), chickens (Gallus gallus f. domestica (L.)), geese (Anser anser f. domestica (L.)), SCID and BALB/c mice (Mus musculus L.) was verified. RESULTS A total of 204 individual faecal samples were examined for Cryptosporidium spp. using differential staining and PCR/sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of small subunit rRNA, actin, HSP70 and gp60 gene sequences showed the presence of Cryptosporidium avian genotype II (n = 7) and C. ubiquitum Fayer, Santn & Macarisin, 2010 IXa (n = 5). Only ostriches infected with Cryptosporidium avian genotype II shed oocysts that were detectable by microscopy. Oocysts were purified from a pooled sample of four birds, characterised morphometrically and used in experimental infections to determine biological characteristics. Oocysts of Cryptosporidium avian genotype II measure on average 6.13  5.15 m, and are indistinguishable by size from C. baileyi Current, Upton & Haynes, 1986 and C. avium Holubov, Sak, Hor?i?kov, Hlskov, Kvtoov, Menchaca, McEvoy & Kv?, 2016.

But the relationship between commuting time and work stress was different among groups with different commuting styles. For obese men who commuted on foot or motorcycle, commuting time had a significant impact on their job stress.

However, earlier studies used methods with low resolution to quantify MHC diversity and/or small sample sizes. Furthermore, high disease susceptibility was reported only for captive cheetahs, whereas free-ranging cheetahs show no signs of infectious diseases and a good general health status. We examined whether the diversity at MHC class I and class II-DRB loci in 149 Namibian cheetahs was higher than previously reported using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, cloning, and sequencing. MHC genes were examined at the genomic and transcriptomic levels. We detected ten MHC class I and four class II-DRB alleles, of which nine MHC class I and all class II-DRB alleles were expressed. Phylogenetic analyses and individual genotypes suggested that the alleles belong to four MHC class I and three class II-DRB putative loci. Evidence of positive selection was detected in both MHC loci. Our study indicated that the low number of MHC class I alleles previously observed in cheetahs was due to a smaller sample size examined. On the other hand, the low number of MHC class II-DRB alleles previously observed in cheetahs was further confirmed. Compared with other mammalian species including felids, cheetahs showed low levels of MHC diversity, but this does not seem to influence the immunocompetence of free-ranging cheetahs in Namibia and contradicts the previous conclusion that the cheetah is a paradigm species of disease vulnerability.","output":"Cheetah Paradigm Revisited: MHC Diversity in the World's Largest Free-Ranging Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The association between pet sensitization and pet ownership remains unclear.

However, vaccine refusals also occur among hospital workers, but the associated factors have not been described. OBJECTIVES: To describe: (1) the level of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, and; (2) the extent that history of pre-pandemic vaccine hesitancy and health beliefs regarding COVID-19 were associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among workers at a tertiary hospital in southern Thailand. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a paper-based self-administered questionnaire at a tertiary hospital in south Thailand in April 2021 and used multivariable logistic regression to identify psychological-behavioral factors associated with vaccine acceptance. RESULTS: Of 359 workers invited to participate, 226 participants returned the questionnaires, 67% of whom reported willingness to accept the vaccine. Vaccine acceptance was associated with perceived severity of disease (Adjusted OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.04, 4.10), perceived harm from non-vaccination (Adjusted OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.27, 4.96), and lower expectation of vaccine efficacy (Adjusted OR = 3.80, 95% CI = 1.87, 7.71).

We identified multiple screening tools across our enterprise leading to inconsistent documentation by staff and inability to rapidly change screening questions. We aimed to develop a customized screening tool within our electronic health record to address these challenges and provide real-time screening data to our Department of Infection Prevention. METHODS: Stakeholders from all clinical areas as well as family consultants and registration staff provided input on needs for an optimized screening tool. Process mapping across clinical areas of prior screening tools identified variation in decision support and screening questions for both countries and diseases, and demonstrated lack of clear communication between registration staff and clinical teams. Questions and decision support needed to identify communicable diseases in a waiting room setting were identified with stakeholders. Our informatics team reviewed multiple tool options available in the EHR including a built-in travel module with print groups and best practice alerts, a smartform, and flowsheets. RESULTS: Our informatics team designed a universal flowsheet with cascading rows that included clinical decision support with travel, exposure, and symptom screening. During the period of peak COVID-19 transmission in our region, an average of 1644 patients were screened daily. Of those, 2.8% screened positive for travel to an area of increased transmission with 14.9% of those who traveled reporting respiratory symptoms. An additional 4.1% of total patients screened positive for exposure to COVID-19, while 7.7% reported respiratory symptoms. Nine real-time updates to locations of increased disease transmission and symptoms have been made.

The early diagnosis of COVID-19 has become more important for its treatment and for controlling its spread due to its highly transmissible nature. In addition, the restricted supply of test kits calls for an alternative system for diagnosis. Since radiological images of chest of patients with COVID-19 show abnormalities, it is possible to diagnose COVID-19 utilizing chest X-ray images. Therefore, by applying deep convolution neural network (CNN), we have presented a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray images in this paper. For the diagnosis of COVID-19, an exhaustive comparative performance analysis of 16 state-of-the-art models is presented. Moreover, each model is trained with three approaches: transfer learning, fine tuning and scratch learning. The experiments were conducted on the dataset that comprises of 127 images of COVID-19, 500 images of Pneumonia and 500 images of normal cases. We have performed the experiments in two scenarios: binary classification (COVID-19 vs. Normal) and multiclass classification (COVID-19 vs. Pneumonia vs. Normal). Further, we have applied cost-sensitive learning technique to handle the class imbalance issue. In this study, InceptionResNetV2 model with fine-tuning approach achieved highest classification accuracy of 99.20% in binary classification and Xception model achieved classification accuracy of 89.33% in multiclass classification among all considered models. To validate our approach, we have presented the performance of our model on three other datasets and achieved adequate classification accuracy. Hence, the promising results demonstrate that the fine-tuning of deep CNN models is an effective way for diagnosis of COVID-19 and therefore, it can be deployed in diagnostic centers to assist radiologist after its validation with more prominent datasets.","output":"Diagnosis of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray images using pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectifs valuation des propositions de la Socit Francophone du diabte (SFD) et du National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) utilisant glycmie  jeun (GAJ) et HbA1c dans le dpistage des HG dans le contexte de la pandmie COVID-19.

In recent years, with the large-scale use of antibiotics, the detection rate and mortality of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) have gradually increased. This study explores the molecular characteristics and prevalence of CRKP isolated from the ICU ward of a tertiary hospital in China. METHODS: A total of 51 non-duplicated CRKP samples isolated from the ICU were collected from July 2018CJuly 2020. The enzyme production of the strains was preliminarily screened by carbapenemase phenotypic test, and drug-resistant and virulence genes were detected by PCR. The transferability of plasmid was verified by conjugation test. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by microbroth dilution method and genetic diversity was detected by multilocus sequence typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: bla(KPC-2) was the only carbapenemase detected. The major virulence genes were uge (100%), mrkD (94.1%), kpn (94.1%), and fim-H (72.5%), while wcag, ironB, alls and magA genes were not detected. One sequence type ST1373 strain, hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP), was detected. CRKP strains were highly resistant to quinolones, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and polymyxin, but susceptive to tigecycline and ceftazidimeCavibactam. The success rate of conjugation was 12.2%, indicating the horizontal transfer of bla(KPC-2). Homology analysis showed that there was a clonal transmission of ST11 CRKP in the ICU of our hospital. CONCLUSION: The present study showed the outbreak and dissemination in ICU were caused by ST11 CRKP, which were KPC-2 producers, and simultaneously, also carried some virulence genes. ST11 CRKP persisted in the ward for a long time and spread among different areas. Due to the widespread dispersal of the transferable bla(KPC-2) plasmid, the hospital should promptly adopt effective surveillance and strict infection control strategies to prevent the further spread of CRKP.

Suspected HNC referrals undergoing remote triage in UK secondary care centers were identified and followed up for a minimum of 6 months to record the cancer status. Triage was supported by risk stratification using a validated calculator. RESULTS: Data for 4568 cases were submitted by 41 centers serving a population of approximately 26 million. These represented 14.1% of the predicted maximum referrals for this population outside of pandemic times, and this gave the study a margin of error of 1.34% at 95% confidence. Completed 6-month follow-up data were available for 99.8% with an overall cancer rate of 5.6% (254 of 4557). The rates of triage were as follows: urgent imaging investigation, 25.4% (n = 1156); urgent face-to-face review, 27.8%; (n = 1268); assessment deferral, 30.3% (n = 1382); and discharge, 16.4% (n = 749).

Finally, the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of STING, observed during viral infections, confirmed the activation of cGAS/STING pathway by NiV and MeV. Our data suggest that cGAS/STING activation is critical in controlling paramyxovirus infection and possibly represents attractive targets to develop countermeasures against severe disease induced by these pathogens.","output":"Activation of cGAS/STING pathway upon paramyxovirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bovine enteric disease has a complex etiology that can include viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens and is a significant source of losses due to morbidity and mortality.

While in most applications, the FM is defined either by experts or numerically derived through optimization, these approaches are only viable if additional information on the sources is available. When such information is unavailable, as is commonly the case when sources are unknown a priori (e.g., in crowdsourcing), prior work has proposed the extraction of valuable insight (captured within FMs) directly from the evidence or input data by analyzing properties such as specificity or agreement amongst sources. Here, existing agreement-based FMs use established measures of similarity such as Jaccard and Dice to estimate the source agreement. Recently, a new similarity measure based on bidirectional subsethood was put forward to compare evidence, minimizing limitations such as aliasing (where different inputs result in the same similarity output) present in traditional similarity measures. In this paper, we build on this new similarity measure to develop a new instance of the agreement-based FM for interval-valued data. The proposed FM is purposely designed to support aggregation, and unlike previous agreement FMs, it degrades gracefully to an average operator for cases where no overlap between sources exists. We validate that it respects all requirements of a FM and explore its impact when used in conjunction with the Choquet FI for data fusion as part of both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing empirically that it generates robust and qualitatively superior outputs for the cases considered.","output":"A Bidirectional Subsethood Based Fuzzy Measure for Aggregation of Interval-Valued Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Objetivo: analizar la evidencia disponible y proponer el cuidado de la salud mental del adulto mayor en la transicin a la post-pandemia.

Amid the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in January 2020, strict policies were in place to restrict people's movement, bringing about steep reductions in pollution activities and notably lower ambient concentrations of primary pollutants. In this study, we report hourly measurements of fine particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5) and its comprehensive chemical speciation, including elemental and molecular source tracers, at an urban site in Shanghai spanning a period before the lockdown restriction (BR) (1 to 23 Jan. 2020) and during the restriction (DR) (24 Jan. to 9 Feb. 2020). The overall PM2.5 was reduced by 27% from 56.2  40.9 (BR) to 41.1  25.3 g m-3 (DR) and the organic carbon (OC) in PM2.5 was similar, averaged at 5.45  2.37 (BR) and 5.42  1.75 gC m-3 (DR). Reduction in nitrate was prominent, from 18.1 (BR) to 9.2 g m-3 (DR), accounting for most of the PM2.5 decrease. Source analysis of PM2.5 using positive matrix factorization modeling of comprehensive chemical composition, resolved nine primary source factors and five secondary source factors. The quantitative source analysis confirms reduced contributions from primary sources affected by COVID-19, with vehicular emissions showing the largest drop, from 4.6 (BR) to 0.61 g m-3 (DR) and the percentage change (-87%) in par with vehicle traffic volume and fuel sale statistics (-60% to -90%). In the same time period, secondary sources are revealed to vary in response to precursor reductions from the lockdown, with two sources showing consistent enhancement while the other three showing reductions, highlighting the complexity in secondary organic aerosol formation and the nonlinear response to broad primary precursor pollutants. The combined contribution from the two secondary sources to PM2.5 increased from 7.3  6.6 (BR) to 14.8  9.3 g m-3 (DR), partially offsetting the reductions from primary sources and nitrate while their increased contribution to OC, from 1.6  1.4 (BR) to 3.2  2.0 gC m-3 (DR), almost offset the decrease coming from the primary sources.

It is characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, severe cytopenia, serious liver dysfunction, coagulopathy and neurologic involvement. The principal treatment for patients with this syndrome includes etoposide 150 mg/2 M twice a week for two weeks, dexamethasone 10 mg/2 M for two weeks and cyclosporine 3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg for a longer period. Cases of relapse of macrophage activating syndrome are relatively rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 15-year-old Iraqi girl with Still's disease who developed macrophage activating syndrome with acute respiratory distress syndrome that required resuscitation and mechanical ventilation. Following intensive treatment, including high dose steroids and cyclosporine, the patient improved significantly. Two weeks after cyclosporine was discontinued, however, she was readmitted with an acute relapse of macrophage activating syndrome manifested by spiking fever, arthralgias, maculopapular rash and leukocytosis. This time the patient recovered following the reintroduction of treatment with cyclosporine and the addition of mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept). CONCLUSION: We believe that cyclosporine is a cornerstone for the treatment of Still's disease. We recommend continuing this medication for several weeks following the patient's clinical recovery in order to prevent macrophage activating syndrome relapses.","output":"Relapsing macrophage activating syndrome in a 15-year-old girl with Still's disease: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chinas 14th Five-Year Plan, for the period 2021C25, presents a real opportunity for China to link its long-term climate goals with its short-to medium-term social and economic development plans.

In this study, we identified endolysins ElyA1 and ElyA2 (GH108-PG3 family), present in the genome of bacteriophages Ab1051&#934; and Ab1052&#934;, respectively. The muralytic activity of these endolysins against MDR clinical isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) was tested using the turbidity reduction assay. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of endolysin, colistin and a combination of endolysin and colistin were determined, and the antimicrobial activity of each treatment was confirmed by time kill curves. Endolysin ElyA1 displayed activity against all 25 strains of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa tested and against 13 out of 17 strains of K. pneumoniae. Endolysin ElyA2 did not display any such activity. The combined antimicrobial activity of colistin and ElyA1 yielded a reduction in the colistin MIC for all strains studied, except K. pneumoniae. These results were confirmed in vivo in G. mellonella survival assays and in murine skin and lung infection models. In conclusion, combining colistin (1/4 MIC) with the new endolysin ElyA1 (350 g) enhanced the bactericidal activity of colistin in both in vitro and in vivo studies.

Although there is some controversy as to whether NETs are in fact beneficial or detrimental to the host, it mainly depends on the biological context. NETs can contribute to disease pathogenesis in certain types of diseases, while they are also undeniably critical components of the innate immune response. On the contrary, the role of eosinophils during host immune responses remains to be better elucidated. Eosinophils play an important role during helminthic infections and allergic responses. Eosinophils can function as effector cells in viral respiratory infections, gut bacterial infections, and as modulators of immune responses by driving the balance between Th1 and Th2 responses. In particular, eosinophils have biological activities that appear to be quite similar to those of neutrophils. Both possess bactericidal activity, can activate proinflammatory responses, can modulate adaptive immune responses, can form extracellular traps, and can be beneficial or detrimental to the host according to the underlying pathology.

We investigated the impact of the current pandemic among children with epilepsy from two distinct pediatric epilepsy centers. We also compared perceptions among those who received telemedicine against those who did not. Methods: We developed a questionnaire and invited families followed in Freiburg, Germany, and Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to participate during the initial 9 months of the pandemic. The survey contained 32 questions, 10 of which were stratified according to telemedicine exposure. Results: One hundred twenty-six families (80 in Freiburg, 46 in Calgary) participated, and 40.3% received telemedicine care. Most children (mean age 10.4 years, SD 5.1) had chronic epilepsy but poorly controlled seizures. Negative impacts were reported by 36 and 65% of families who had to reschedule appointments for visits and diagnostics, respectively. Nearly two-thirds of families reported no change in seizure frequency, while 18.2% reported either worsening or improvement of seizures. Although most families did not note behavioral changes, 28.2% reported behavior worsening. Families who received telemedicine care had a statistically significant reduction of parental self-reported anxiety level after virtual visits compared to those who did not experience telemedicine. Families with telemedicine consultations were more likely to consider future virtual care (84 vs. 65.2% of those without), even after the pandemic. Patient data safety, easy access to specialized services, and consistency with the same healthcare provider were graded as important in both centers, while a shorter waiting time was most relevant in Calgary. Conclusion: In our cohort, some children with epilepsy experienced increased seizures and worsening behavior during the first 9 months of the current pandemic. In addition, our data suggest that telemedicine might reduce parental anxiety symptoms, and families who experienced telehealth were more positive and open to similar appointments in the future.","output":"Telehealth for Children With Epilepsy Is Effective and Reduces Anxiety Independent of Healthcare Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has spread around the world, disrupting economies, societies and daily life.

Control non-diabetic and T1D female and male mice received: saline; vitamin D3; insulin; or vitamin D3 plus insulin, for 21a?days. KEY FINDINGS: Female and male T1D mice showed impaired bone healing, as indicated by histological and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis. Vitamin D3 or insulin improved the bone regeneration in T1D mice, irrespective of sex. Vitamin D3 plus insulin did not exhibit any additional effects. There were no differences regarding the numbers of TRAP-stained osteoclasts in either evaluated groups. The osteoblast-related gene osterix was upregulated in vitamin D3-treated male T1D mice, as revealed by RT-qPCR. Female T1D mice treated with vitamin D3, insulin, or vitamin D3 plus insulin presented an increased expression of insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA. Conversely, IGF-1 mRNA levels were reduced by the same treatments in male TD1 mice. SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, the results suggested that T1D similarly delayed the osseous healing in female and male mice, with beneficial effects for either vitamin D3 or insulin in T1D mice of both sexes.

Children are infected in a rate quite similar to adults, although in most cases they suffer mild or asymptomatic symptoms. Around 1% of those infected require hospitalization, less than 0.02% require intensive care, and mortality is very low and generally in children with comorbidities. The most common clinical diagnosis are upper or lower respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infection and, more seriously, multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Most episodes do not require treatment, except for MIS-C. Remdesivir has been widely used as a compassionate treatment and its role has yet to be defined. The newborn can become infected, although vertical transmission is very low (<1%) and it has been shown that the baby can safely cohabit with its mother and be breastfed. In general, neonatal infections have been mild. Primary care has supported a very important part of the management of the pandemic in pediatrics.

DESIGN: Quality improvement project. SETTING/LOCAL PROBLEM: A small nurse practitioner maternity care clinic in an academic health center at which only 74% of the women who attended two or more prenatal visits attended postpartum clinic visits. PARTICIPANTS: A diverse sample of 25 publicly insured women who gave birth during the 5-month implementation period. INTERVENTION/MEASUREMENTS: We added a 2- to 3-week postpartum appointment to our standard 6-week postpartum appointment. The measurable outcomes were the percentage of women who attended postpartum clinic visits and the number of days to the first postpartum visit. RESULTS: During the first 4 months of the 5-month project implementation phase, 14 of the 20 (70%) women who gave birth attended postpartum visits. The attendance at postpartum visits in the last month of the project was 100% (all five women). Days to first postpartum visit decreased from a mean of 40.7 in the baseline year to a mean of 21.8 by the last month of project implementation. CONCLUSION: Despite the small scope of this project, our outcomes support continuing the practice of scheduling an earlier postpartum clinic appointment. The timing for when to preschedule postpartum appointments and contextual factors, such as the availability and use of telehealth technology and COVID-19 pandemic challenges, should be considered when implementing similar projects in other settings.","output":"Quality Improvement Project to Increase Postpartum Clinic Visits for Publicly Insured Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single cell transcriptomics technologies have vast potential in advancing our understanding of biology and disease.

However, its development usually relies on the change of body of knowledge and class implementation. As a result, it might not succeed since it is compromised with issues in the deployment.

When the curriculum is improved, not only the body of knowledge is changed, the changes also affect all related resources and activities. If some of them was not well prepared, it would become the obstructions. The UX design/analysis is a process that uses meaningful experiences of all users in all aspects, such as resources, management, usability, and implementation. All related action roles to the system in the past is needed to be analyzed.

The epithelial surface of the GI tract is colonized by trillions of microorganisms, known as the gut microbiota, which is considered an organ with distinctive endocrine and immunoregulatory functions. Dysregulation of the gut microbiota composition, termed dysbiosis, has been associated with epithelial damage and translocation of microbial products into the circulating blood. Dysbiosis, increased gut permeability and chronic inflammation play a major role on the clinical outcome of inflammatory bowel diseases, graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) and HIV infection. In this review, we focus on GVHD and HIV infection, conditions sharing gut immune damage leading to dysbiosis. The degree of dysbiosis and level of epithelial gut damage predict poor clinical outcome in both conditions. Emerging interventions are therefore warranted to promote gut microbiota homeostasis and improve intestinal barrier function. Interventions such as anti-inflammatory medications, and probiotics have toxicity and/or limited transitory effects, justifying innovative approaches. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is one such approach where fecal microorganisms are transferred from healthy donors into the GI tract of the recipient to restore microbiota composition in patients with Clostridium difficile-induced colitis or inflammatory bowel diseases. Preliminary findings point toward a beneficial effect of FMT to improve GVHD and HIV-related outcomes through the engraftment of beneficial donor bacteria, notably those producing anti-inflammatory metabolites. Herein, we critically review the potential for FMT in alleviating dysbiosis and gut damage in patients with GVHD or HIV-infection. Understanding the underlying mechanism by which FMT restores gut function will pave the way toward novel scalable and targeted interventions.","output":"Treating From the Inside Out: Relevance of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation to Counteract Gut Damage in GVHD and HIV Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A consortium of Swiss universities has set up a dashboard providing daily 7-day epidemic forecasting for 209 countries and territories around the world.

METHODS One-hundred and fifty patients with wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms were enrolled at 21 US and six international centers. Angiograms from the index procedure, and 6-month and 1-year follow-up visits were all reviewed by a core laboratory. All adverse events were reviewed and adjudicated by a clinical events adjudicator. A data monitoring committee provided oversight during the trial to ensure subject safety. RESULTS One-hundred and forty-eight patients received the WEB implant. One (0.7%) primary safety event occurred during the study-a delayed ipsilateral parenchymal hemorrhage-on postoperative day 22. No primary safety events occurred after 30 days through 1 year. At the 12-month angiographic follow-up, 77/143 patients (53.8%) had complete aneurysm occlusion. Adequate occlusion was achieved in 121/143 (84.6%) subjects. CONCLUSIONS The prespecified safety and effectiveness endpoints for the aneurysms studied in the WEB-IT trial were met.

Patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pneumonia and respiratory distress often require hospitalization, ICU admission, intubation and/or non-invasive ventilation, and circulatory support. Some experts suggest that the pathophysiology of traditional ARDS and that of the lung disease associated with COVID-19 are different. It is proposed that the severe hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients is the result of hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction and a large burden of microthrombi which result in intrapulmonary shunting. Therefore, COVID-related ARDS-like patterns of disease may not respond to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for early intubation and ARDS Network (ARDSNet) recommendations for FiO2-titrated Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) administration and ventilator support. Given the distinct pathophysiology of COVID-19-related ARDS, higher PEEP may indicate mechanical over-inflation of the alveoli resulting in volume trauma in addition to compromising preload and decreasing cardiac output, worsening the pulmonary hypoperfusion. The aim of this study was to examine the rate of death associated with initial and subsequent (48-hour) PEEP settings of 10cmH2O and higher in COVID-19 patients. We hypothesized that higher PEEP settings may lead to increased mortality. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who presented or were transferred to our facility with COVID-19 and were subsequently intubated from March 1st until April 30th, 2020. Charts were reviewed for initial and 48-hour PEEP settings. Mortality, SARS CoV2 results, clinical data and demographics were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients were included in the review. Of these, 53 patients had initial PEEP setting of &gt;10cmH2O and 46 patients had PEEP settings &gt;10cmH2O 48 hours after intubation. Thirty-seven patients had PEEP settings &gt;10cmH2O both initially and 48 hours later. Thirty-seven patients who had an initial PEEP setting of &gt;10 cmH220 died, (70%). Forty patients who had PEEP settings &gt;10cmH2O at 48hrs died (87%). Twenty-seven patients who had both a PEEP setting &gt;10 cmH2O initially and at 48 hours died (73%). CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be an association in COVID-19 patients between high mortality rates and high PEEP settings. The marked association is strong enough, in our view, to suggest that conventional ventilator settings recommended by ARDSNet may not apply to patients experiencing COVID-19-associated ARDS and in fact, may be leading to worse patient outcomes.","output":"COVID-19 ventilator management strategies: What we have learned and future management options?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) are essential for all life, and their functions often depend on their secondary (2D) and tertiary structure.

However, previous studies have warned about the high risk of cancer of the rectal stump, especially considering the young age of these patients. This is a retrospective study whose aim was to assess both clinical and surgical features of patients who developed cancer of the rectal stump. The data reported show that IRA is a safe approach from an oncological perspective. Since early tumors of the rectal stump may be easily detected via endoscopic or minimally invasive approaches, strict surveillance is necessary. ABSTRACT: Background: The balance between quality of life and colorectal cancer risk in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients is of primary importance. A cut-off of less than 30 polyps under 1 cm of diameter in the rectum has been used as an indication for performing ileo-rectal anastomosis (IRA) in terms of lower rectal cancer risk. This study aimed to assess clinical and surgical features of FAP patients who developed cancer of the rectal stump. Methods: This retrospective study included all FAP patients who underwent total colectomy/IRA from 1977 to 2021 and developed subsequent rectal cancer. Patients features were reported using descriptive statistics by considering the overall case series and within pre-specified classes of age (<20, 20C30, and >30 years) at first surgery. Results: Among the 715 FAP patients, 47 (6.57%, 95% confidence interval: 4.87; 8.65) developed cancer in the rectal stump during follow-up. In total, 57.45% of the population were male and 38.30% were proband. The median interval between surgery and the occurrence of rectal cancer was 13 years. This interval was wider in the youngest group (p-value: 0.012) than the oldest ones. Twelve patients (25.53%) received an endoscopic or minimally invasive resection. Amongst them, 61.70% were Dukes stage A cancers. Conclusions: There is a definite risk of rectal cancer after total colectomy/IRA; however, the time interval from the index procedure to cancer developing is long. Minimally invasive and endoscopic treatments should be the procedures of choice in patients with early stage cancers.","output":"Prevalence and Management of Cancer of the Rectal Stump after Total Colectomy and Rectal Sparing in Patients with Familial Polyposis: Results from a Registry-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper illustrates the importance of moving beyond an economic focus, and towards an emotional one, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of why farmers can be reluctant to retire and/or pass their farm onto the next generation.

In an attempt to gain a deeper understanding of the emotional aspects of retirement and succession decision-making processes, and their relationship with place belonging, in the first phase of this research we employed an innovative Work and Talk method, whereby interviews were conducted while shadowing, or in some cases, co-working, with farmers on their land. The second phase of this research responded to restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, and involved remote telephone or online interviews with family farm members. This research revealed the complex relationships between a longing for belonging and emotional attachment to the family farm, and the challenges associated with patrilineal farming structures, expectations and identities, in planning for succession. The emotional impacts of strained relationships with policy makers around support for retirement emerged as a surprisingly dominant theme throughout the interview process, suggesting the need for greater emphasis on the emotional aspects of farming retirement and succession planning to inform future rural development policies targeted towards the sustainability of family farms.","output":"Sustainable Family Farming Futures: Exploring the Challenges of Family Farm Decision Making through an Emotional Lens of Belonging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Less than a year after its emergence, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 22 million people worldwide with a death toll approaching 1 million.

Besides this, molecular docking against G25K GTP-nucleotide binding protein (PDB ID: 1A4R) was also studied.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients presenting with uveitis after COVID-19 vaccination in tertiary uveitis services. RESULTS: In total, 25 patients, 76% females, mean age 43.2 years, were included. Uveitis occurred after Pfizer, Moderna, Astra-Zeneca and Covaxin vaccination. Anterior uveitis was the most frequent type of uveitis (56%). History of uveitis was found in 19 cases (76%), among whom 90.9% of the tested patients developed anti-Sars-CoV-2 spike antibodies after vaccination. In a mean follow-up of 5 months, one-line decrease in visual acuity was found in 12% of patients. During post-vaccine uveitis, 15.8% of cases needed an increase in their systemic therapy. According to Naranjo score, new-onset uveitis had a higher probability of being associated with vaccination (p < .01).

This study aims to evaluate the potential of indirect immunofluorescence as an in-house diagnostic method for SARS-CoV-2 antigens from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). Three primary antibodies raised from mice were used for immunofluorescence staining, including monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, and polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Smears of cells from NPS of 29 COVID-19 patients and 20 non-infected individuals, and cells from viral culture were stained by the three antibodies. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to identify respiratory epithelial cells with positive signals. Polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 N protein had the highest sensitivity and specificity among the three antibodies tested, detecting 17 out of 29 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and demonstrating no cross-reactivity with other tested viruses except SARS-CoV. Detection of virus-infected cells targeting SARS-CoV-2 N protein allow identification of infected individuals, although accuracy is limited by sample quality and number of respiratory epithelial cells. The potential of immunofluorescence as a simple diagnostic method was demonstrated, which could be applied by incorporating antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 into multiplex immunofluorescence panels used clinically, such as for respiratory viruses, thus allowing additional routine testing for diagnosis and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 even after the epidemic has ended with low prevalence of COVID-19.","output":"In-House Immunofluorescence Assay for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antigens in Cells from Nasopharyngeal Swabs as a Diagnostic Method for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading globally at an accelerated rate. There is some previous evidence that weather may influence the incidence of COVID-19 infection. We assessed the role of meteorological factors including temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) considering the concentrations of two air pollutants, inhalable coarse particles (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the incidence of COVID-19 infections in Finland, located in arctic-subarctic climatic zone. Methods: We retrieved daily counts of COVID-19 in Finland from Jan 1 to May 31, 2020, nationwide and separately for all 21 hospital districts across the country. The meteorological and air quality data were from the monitoring stations nearest to the central district hospital. A quasi-Poisson generalized additional model (GAM) was fitted to estimate the associations between district-specific meteorological factors and the daily counts of COVID-19 during the study period. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results. Results: The incidence rate of COVID-19 gradually increased until a peak around April 6 and then decreased. There were no associations between daily temperature and incidence rate of COVID-19. Daily average RH was negatively associated with daily incidence rate of COVID-19 in two hospital districts located inland. No such association was found nationwide. Conclusions: Weather conditions, such as air temperature and relative humidity, were not related to the COVID-19 incidence during the first wave in the arctic and subarctic winter and spring.

With her large population, Nigeria requires enormous energy for sustainability; this has caused somewhat an overdependence on crude oil and natural gas for energy. This overdependence constantly puts the country in an energy consumption crisis when these resources are not readily available. It has its disadvantages as it affects climate change and her economy. Solar energy growth and application/adoption from the global, African, West African, and Nigerian perspectives were expounded with that of Nigeria buttressed on to bring into view the contrast between her adoption of this technology and the world.

The slope coefficients of the model indicated the percentage change the dependent variable (i.e., the value of the OFDI stocks of CEE countries growth pace) changes if a given exogenous institutional variable decreases or grows by 1.0%, which enables to determine if the scale of outward FDI from the CEE region was significantly determined in the examined period by the considered key home country's institutional factors. Findings: The empirical results show that the home country's institutional factors determine OFDI stocks' scale from the CEE countries. Practical Implications: Improving the quality of the institutional environment of the country of origin of FDI would contribute to increasing the scale of foreign capital expansion of enterprises from the CEE region. Originality/value: The conducted study enabled to indicate the key directions of possible future improvements in the institutional environment of CEE enterprises, which would enable to significantly increase the scale of their foreign capital expansion, which would result in the growth of their exports that in turn would result in their further economic development, which was the case of many other well developed, as well as emerging economies.

Therefore, the aim of the present study is to determine the cut off values of the serum hsCRP, ferritin, IL-6 and plasma D-dimer in predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Four hundred RT-PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19 were sub divided into two groups based on their outcome during hospitalisation. Group I consisted of survivors and Group II consisted of non-survivors. The survivors were further divided into three sub-groups: mild, moderate and severe based on the severity of infection. The laboratory data of serum hsCRP, ferritin, IL-6 and plasma D-dimer for all these patients was retrieved from the Medical Record Section of the Hospital. RESULTS: Mean serum hsCRP, ferritin, IL-6 and plasma D-dimer levels were significantly higher in non-survivors as compared to survivors of COVID-19. The levels of these biomarkers correlated with the severity of COVID-19 illness. ROC curve analysis revealed that plasma D-dimer is having a better predictive value as compared to other parameters in predicting mortality in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The serum hsCRP, ferritin, IL-6 and plasma D-dimer levels could be used in risk stratification of COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 873 geriatric patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized between March 11, 2020 and March 11, 2021. Demographic, clinical, laboratory data, and treatment options were obtained from electronic medical records. Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors for in-hospital death. RESULTS: During the specified period, 643 patients were discharged, and 230 patients died in the hospital. The mean age was 75.08  7.39 years (mean  SD) and 51.8% were males. We found that older age ( 85), polypharmacy, dyspnea, abnormal thorax computed tomography (CT), lower doses of anticoagulation, and high values of white blood cell, aspartate aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin were associated with a significant increase in mortality (P < 0.001 for all). Although all of these values were significant in multivariate logistic regression analysis, the most important ones were dyspnea (Odds ratio (OR) 57.916, 95% confidence interval (CI) 23.439C143.104, P < 0.001), polypharmacy (OR 6.782, 95% CI 3.082C14.927, P < 0.001), and thorax CT classification (typical; OR 9.633, 95% CI 2.511C37.122, P < 0.001).

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the mainstreams of complementary and alternative medicine, and serves as rich resources for new drug development. Despite almost 100 plant-derived compounds are in clinical trials, few target HIV-1 infection. In this study, we discovered that extract of Sanguisorba officinalis (SOE) has anti-HIV-1 activities. Using a cell-based assay and single-cycle luciferase reporter viruses pseudotyped with envelopes from HIV-1 or control viruses, we found that SOE exhibited significant inhibitory ability against both CCR5 and CXCR4 tropic HIV-1 (ADA and HXB2) with respective IC(50) values of 1.910.16 g/ml and 3.700.53 g/ml. Interestingly, SOE also inhibited SIV infection but failed to block vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), SARS-CoV and influeunza H5N1 pseudoviruses. Furthermore, we showed that SOE had no effects on post-entry events of HIV-1 replication. It blocked entry by acting on viral envelope directly because SOE pre-treatment with the virus but not with cell lines expressing viral receptors showed the maximal inhibitory activity. In addition, SOE was able to inhibit reverse-transcription-inhibitor-resistant viruses (K103N, Y188L, and K103N/Y188L/G190A) and a protease-inhibitor-resistant strain (PI-2840).

For low values of the initial virus density (lower than the critical value) it is proved that the virus-diffusion behavior is safe and quantitatively similar to usual real epidemical data. However, it is revealed that very close to the critical point, the critical slowing-down (CSD) phenomenon, introduced by the theory of critical phenomena, emerges, leading to a tremendous increase of both the percentage of active carriers and the duration of the epidemic. A behavior of the epidemic obeying to a second order phase transition, also occurs. For virus density values higher than the critical value, the epidemic duration becomes extremely prolonged. Additionally, the effect of the closed system population size revealed interesting properties. All these results, together with an investigation of the effectiveness of applying physical contact restriction measures, document scientifically their worthiness, while they also demonstrate the limits for which herd immunity holds safely.

A whopping 13.3% case fatality rate (CFR) (as of 4 April 2020) has been recorded in Italy in contrast South Koreas 1.8% and Chinas 4% CFR;hence, Italys CFR is too high. In India, the first case was a student who had returned to Kerala from Wuhan City, China. A returnee from Italy followed this and, afterwards, an Italian tourist party with their guide who visited Rajasthan. Consequently, the number of infections rose in India, though slowly at first. Maharashtra and New Delhi had the highest number of cases since 14 March, with 14 and 7 cases, respectively. Currently, the total number of cases rose to 12,300 and 4100, respectively;however, Gujarat was overtaken by Delhi with over 5000 cases recently. As the infection tore through Wuhan and the bordering areas of China, leaving its path of disease and fatality, the federal government of India introduced a collection of speedy limitations. These started with shutting down of international trips, promptly proceeding with social distancing protocols and closing down of all public transportation (buses, trains and trips) to the announcement of lockdown at the national level on 24 March 2020. The present research study is an epidemiological effort to design the result of these steps using the ideal mathematical versions. The existing study recommends that pandemics normally reveal a rapid development pattern at the start, but then flatten out. In this research, scientists used various models to anticipate precisely how the rate of infection increases is examined. Exponential Phase: In the first stage, the rapid version serves as the mirror of the spread of infection, using a J-shaped curve. This version does not forecast the downward phase or degeneration of the contour as well as the plateau stage. The present stage of the pandemic in India, according to this research, is the second stage, where rapid development has actually paved the way to stable development. This kind of boost in cases cannot, as a result, be forecasted by the rapid version. Logistic Model: This model anticipates the program of illness spread in the existence of restraints, such as the constraints put on the flexibility of individuals, clinical centres committed to the treatment of COVID-19 patients and also complete lockdown problems. This causes an adjustment in various individuals categorised as prone to infection due to the seclusion enforced under these problems. The modification in the variety of infected individuals is determined alike. SEIR Model: SEIR describes the adjustment of a preferred standard used to forecast the development of a populace or the spread of a disease, particularly the Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR). In pandemics, this is changed, particularly the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) design, to make certain higher precision considering that it consists of many variables that affect the development rate as a result of the infection spread. Considering the activities taken by the federal government to limit the spread, scientists have thought of a formula to forecast the result in terms of caseload. The variety of verified instances was acquired from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) and COVID-19 web sites, starting from 5 March 2020, which marked the first day of the lockdown, to 23 April 2020. The scientists after that forecasted the pattern of spread over the next 42 days, starting from the completion of the second stage of the lockdown, that is, 2 May 2020, to 14 June 2020, readjusting for the impact of federal governments intervention. The 42-day duration was divided into three cycles, lasting 14 days each, constituting for one incubation duration each.

None of the patients had a newly developed intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraprocedural aneurysmal rupture occurred in 2 patients (5%). Cerebral infarction developed in 2 patients (5%). Ventriculostomy-related hemorrhage was seen in 2 of 10 patients in whom ventriculostomy was performed before or after coiling. Thirty-four (85%) patients had a good outcome (Glasgow Outcome Score of 4 or 5) at the time of discharge, but 1 patient died of cardiac arrest. None of the patients developed thrombocytopenia, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary bleeding related to tirofiban administration. CONCLUSIONS In our study, tirofiban showed a low risk of symptomatic hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications. Tirofiban may offer a safe and effective alternative as an antiplatelet premedication during stent-assisted coiling of acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms.","output":"Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous Tirofiban as Antiplatelet Premedication for Stent-Assisted Coiling in Acutely Ruptured Intracranial Aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the third quarter of 2021, government entities enacted vaccine requirements across multiple employment sectors, including healthcare. Experience from previous vaccination campaigns within healthcare emphasize the need to translate community modalities of vaccine outreach and education that partner with Black communities, Indigenous communities, and communities of Color stakeholders to increase vaccine confidence broadly. METHODS: This was an observational feasibility study conducted from August through October 2021 that deployed and measured the effect of a multimodal approach to increasing vaccine uptake in healthcare employees. Vaccine data were acquired through the Center for Disease Control Immunization Information Systems across Oregon and Washington. Rates of complete vaccination before the intervention were compared with rates after as a measure of feasibility of this intervention. These data were subdivided by race/ethnicity, age, gender, and job class. Complete vaccination was defined as completion of a 2-dose mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series or a 1-dose adenoviral vector SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. RESULTS: Overall preintervention and postintervention complete vaccination rates were 83.7% and 93.5%, respectively. Of those employees who identified as a certain race, black employees demonstrated the greatest percentage difference increase, 18.5% (preintervention, 72.1%; postintervention, 90.6%), followed by Hispanic employees, 14.1% (preintervention, 79.4%; postintervention, 93.5%), and employees who identify as 2 or more races, 13.9% (preintervention, 78.7%; postintervention, 92.6%) CONCLUSIONS: We found that a multimodal approach to improving vaccination uptake in employees was feasible.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the major causative pathogens of CAP. Early diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia is crucial for initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy. The aim of this study was to determine whether the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) guidelines on CAP are effective for diagnosing M. pneumoniae pneumonia. METHODS Between August 2008 and July 2009, adult outpatients with CAP were consecutively enrolled. The aetiology of CAP was determined by culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods to detect M. pneumoniae, urine antigen tests to detect Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumoniae, blood and sputum culture for bacteria and real-time PCR for eight common respiratory viruses. The predictive value of the JRS guidelines for differentiating M. pneumoniae pneumonia from typical bacterial and viral pneumonias was determined. RESULTS Data from 215 adult CAP outpatients was analyzed. An aetiological diagnosis was made for 105 patients (48.8%), including 62 patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia, 17 patients with typical bacterial pneumonia and 23 patients with viral pneumonia. According to the JRS criteria for differential diagnosis of atypical pneumonia, 55 of 62 patients were correctly diagnosed with M. pneumoniae pneumonia (sensitivity 88.7%), and 31 of 40 patients with bacterial and viral pneumonia were correctly excluded (specificity 77.5%).

Geniposide (GE) has anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and cholagogic effects. Whether GE provides inhibition on the development of sclerosing cholangitis is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of GE in a mouse model in which mice were fed with 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) for 4 weeks to induce sclerosing cholangitis. The results demonstrated that the increased hepatic gene expressions of pro-inflammatory (IL-6, VCAM-1, MCP-1, and F4/80) and profibrogenic markers (Col11, Col12, TGF-, and -SMA) in DDC feeding mice were reversed after treatment with GE. GE also suppressed expressions of CK19 and Ki67 in DDC-fed mice, suggesting that GE could ameliorate DDC-induced hepatocytes and cholangiocytes proliferation. In addition, GE significantly increased bile acids (BAs) secretion in bile, which correlated with induced expressions of hepatic FXR, BAs secretion transporters (BSEP, MRP2, MDR1, and MDR2), and reduced CYP7A1 mRNA expression. Furthermore, higher expressions of ileal FXR-FGF15 signaling and reduced ASBT were also observed after GE treatment. Taken together, these data showed that GE could modulate inflammation, fibrosis, and BAs homeostasis in DDC-fed mice, which lead to efficiently delay the progression of sclerosing cholangitis.","output":"Geniposide suppresses liver injury in a mouse model of DDC-induced sclerosing cholangitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has created a worldwide deadly pandemic that has become a major public health challenge.

Here, we present an efficient, competitive serological assay that can simultaneously determine an individual's seroreactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and determine the proportion of anti-Spike antibodies that block interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) required for viral entry. In this approach based on the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), we present natively folded viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-containing antigens via avidin-biotin interactions. Sera are then competed with soluble ACE2-Fc, or with a higher-affinity variant thereof, to determine the proportion of ACE2 blocking anti-RBD antibodies. Assessment of sera from 144 SARS-CoV-2 patients ultimately revealed that a remarkably consistent and high proportion of antibodies in the anti-RBD pool targeted the epitope responsible for ACE2 engagement (83%  11%; 50% to 107% signal inhibition in our largest cohort), further underscoring the importance of tailoring vaccines to promote the development of such antibodies.IMPORTANCE With the emergence and continued spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and of the associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is an urgent need for improved understanding of how the body mounts an immune response to the virus.

Using this assay and 144 SARS-CoV-2 patient serum samples, we found that a majority of anti-RBD antibodies compete for ACE2 binding.

In light of the outbreak of COVID-19, the study was aimed to explore factors that affect the couriers behaviors related to decreasing the risk of contracting an infectious disease. METHODS: A sample of 237 Israeli couriers, about half who drove a two-wheeled vehicles and the others who drove cars, answered an online survey questionnaire. The questionnaire examined organizational, occupational, and personal factors regarding their working conditions, behavior on the road, musculoskeletal disorders, road accidents, and perceptions of and compliance with regulations regarding COVID-19. The data were analyzed by multiple regression in SPSS 25, structural equation modeling and mediation tests in R 3.6.2. RESULTS: According to the couriers self-report, 37% reported musculoskeletal pains at least once a day, 13% of them were involved in work-related road accidents and 10% reported feeling stress at least once a week. More than 60% of the couriers reported increased stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Weekly working hours, shift duration and stress were related to involvement in accidents through the mediation of driving while feeling unwell. Reported stress and the weight of parcels were related to musculoskeletal pains.

RESULTS: A total of 737 participants with an average age of 27.4 (9.3) years completed the online questionnaire. The vast majority of respondents were soft CL wearers and reported at least two years of CL wear. Patients concerns about the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to CL wear (40.6 % of participants) were significantly related (&#967;2(1)a?=a?11.195, pa?<a?0.05) to CL discontinuation (46 % of participants) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In early 2021, a quarter of people in England who believed they could work entirely from home reported attending their workplace. To inform interventions to reduce this, this study examined associated factors. STUDY DESIGN: Data from the ongoing COVID-19 Rapid Survey of Adherence to Interventions and Responses survey series of nationally representative samples of people in the UK aged 16+ years in JanuaryCFebruary 2021 were used. METHODS: The study sample was 1422 respondents who reported that they could work completely from home. The outcome measure was self-reported workplace attendance at least once during the preceding week. Factors of interest were analysed in three blocks: 1) sociodemographic variables, 2) variables relating to respondents circumstances and 3) psychological variables. RESULTS: 26.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 24.5%C29.1%) of respondents reported having attended their workplace at least once in the preceding week. Sociodemographic variables and living circumstances significantly independently predicted non-essential workplace attendance: male gender (odds ratio [OR] = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.33C2.58); dependent children in the household (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.17C2.32); financial hardship (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.08C1.21); lower socio-economic grade (C2DE; OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.19C2.53); working in sectors such as health or social care (OR = 4.18, 95% CI = 2.56C6.81), education and childcare (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.45C4.14) and key public service (OR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.83C7.81) and having been vaccinated (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.33C3.24). CONCLUSIONS: Non-essential workplace attendance in the UK in early 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly independently associated with a range of sociodemographic variables and personal circumstances. Having been vaccinated, financial hardship, socio-economic grade C2DE, having a dependent child at home and working in certain key sectors were associated with higher likelihood of workplace attendance.","output":"Factors associated with non-essential workplace attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK in early 2021: evidence from cross-sectional surveys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Our aim was to describe the clinical features of mothers infected with COVID-19 and examine any potential vertical mother to newborn transmission.

Decisions regarding initiation or continuation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis have to consider the potential relevance to the pandemic. Understanding the mechanism of action and the possible idiosyncratic effects of each therapeutic agent on the immune system is imperative during this special time. The infectious side-effect profile as well as the route and frequency of administration of each therapeutic agent should be carefully considered when selecting a new treatment or deciding on risk mitigation strategies for existing therapy. More importantly, the impact of each agent on the future severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine should be carefully considered in treatment decisions. Moreover, some multiple sclerosis therapies may have beneficial antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 while others may have beneficial immune-modulating effects against the cytokine storm and hyperinflammatory phase of the disease. Conventional injectables have a favorable immune profile without an increased exposure risk and therefore may be suitable for mild multiple sclerosis during the pandemic. However, moderate and highly active multiple sclerosis will continue to require treatment with oral or intravenous high-potency agents but a number of risk mitigation strategies may have to be implemented. Immune-modulating therapies such as the fumerates, sphinogosine-1P modulators, and natalizumab may be anecdotally preferred over cell-depleting immunosuppressants during the pandemic from the immune profile standpoint. Within the cell-depleting agents, selective (ocrelizumab) or preferential (cladribine) depletion of B cells may be relatively safer than non-selective depletion of lymphocytes and innate immune cells (alemtuzumab). Patients who develop severe iatrogenic or idiosyncratic lymphopenia should be advised to maintain social distancing even in areas where lockdown has been removed or ameliorated. Patients with iatrogenic hypogammaglobulinemia may require prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in certain situations. When the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes available, patients with multiple sclerosis should be advised that certain therapies may interfere with mounting a protective immune response to the vaccine and that serological confirmation of a response may be required after vaccination. They should also be aware that most multiple sclerosis therapies are incompatible with live vaccines if a live SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is developed. In this article, we review and compare disease-modifying therapies in terms of their effect on the immune system, published infection rates, potential impact on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and vaccine-related implications.

Different geographical areas of the Northern Hemisphere in the United States and in Europe were selected in order to provide a wide range among the different parameters. The death rates were gathered from an available dataset. As a further control, we also included latitude, as a proxy for temperature. METHODS: Utilizing a publicly available dataset, we retrieved data for the months of March and April 2020 for 25 areas in Europe and in the US. We computed the monthly number of deaths/1 M people of confirmed COVID-19 cases and calculated the average monthly high temperatures and population density for all these areas. We determined the correlation between number of deaths/1 M people and the average monthly high temperatures, the latitude and the population density. RESULTS: We divided our analysis in two parts: analysis of the correlation among the different variables in the month of March and subsequent analysis in the month of April. The differences were then evaluated. In the month of March there was no statistical correlation between average monthly high temperatures of the considered geographical areas and number of deaths/1 M people. However, a statistically significant inverse correlation became significant in the month of April between average monthly high temperatures (p = 0.0043) and latitude (p = 0.0253) with number of deaths/1 M people. We also observed a statistically significant correlation between population density and number of deaths/1 M people both in the month of March (p = 0.0297) and in the month of April (p = 0.0116), when three areas extremely populated (NYC, Los Angeles and Washington DC) were included in the calculation. Once these three areas were removed, the correlation was not statistically significant (p = 0.1695 in the month of March, and p = 0.7076 in the month of April). CONCLUSIONS: The number of COVID-19-related deaths/1 M people was essentially the same during the month of March for all the geographical areas considered, indicating essentially that the infection was circulating quite uniformly except for Lombardy, Italy, where it started earlier. Lockdown measures were implemented between the end of March and beginning of April, except for Italy which started March 9th. We observed a strong, statistically significant inverse correlation between average monthly high temperatures with the number of deaths/1 M people. We confirmed the data by analyzing the correlation with the latitude, which can be considered a proxy for high temperature. Previous studies indicated a negative effect of high climate temperatures on Sars-COV-2 spreading. Our data indicate that social distancing measure are more successful in the presence of higher average monthly temperatures in reducing COVID-19-related death rate, and a high level of population density seems to negatively impact the effect of lockdown measures.","output":"Inverse correlation between average monthly high temperatures and COVID-19-related death rates in different geographical areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Increasing workloads and psychological pressure have led to fatigue among healthcare workers during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

As a source, contaminants are derived from both 'geogenic' and 'anthropogenic' origins. Typically, while some of the inorganic contaminants including potentially toxic elements are derived from geogenic origin (e.g. arsenic and selenium) through weathering of parent materials, the majority of organic (e.g. pesticides and microplastics) as well as inorganic (e.g. lead, cadmium) contaminants are derived from anthropogenic origin. As a sink, soil plays a critical role in the transformation of these contaminants and their subsequent transfer to environmental compartments, including groundwater (e.g. pesticides), surface water (phosphate and nitrate), ocean (e.g. microplastics) and atmosphere (e.g. nitrous oxide emission). A complex transformation process of contaminants in soil involving adsorption, precipitation, redox reactions and biodegradation control the mobility, bioavailability and environmental toxicity of these contaminants. Soil also plays a major role in the decontamination of contaminants, and the 'cleaning' action of soil is controlled primarily by the physico-chemical interactions of contaminants with various soil components, and the biochemical transformations facilitated by soil microorganisms.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS This review will scope the diverse literature surrounding sham surgery trials with the aim of informing a discrete choice experiment to empirically test patient and surgeon preferences for different sham surgery trial designs. The scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the methodological framework described in Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Protocols extension for Scoping Reviews. The review will be informed by a systematic search of Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL and EconLit databases (from database inception to 21 June 2019), a Google Scholar search, and hand searching of reference lists of relevant studies or reviews. Studies or opinion pieces that involve patient, surgeon or trial characteristics, which influence the decision to participate in a trial, will be included.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical impact of COVID-19 infection on outcome and oncologic treatment of cancer patients. PATIENT AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled cancer patients with laboratory and/or radiologic confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, admitted to our center from February to April 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the clinical data and univariate analyses were performed to investigate the impact of anticancer treatment modifications due to COVID-19 outbreak on the short-term overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Among 61 patients enrolled, 49 (80%) were undergoing anticancer treatment and 41 (67%) had metastatic disease. Most patients were men; median age was 68 years. Median OS was 46.6 days (40% of deaths occurred within 20 days from COVID-19 diagnosis). Among 59 patients with available data on therapeutic course, 46 experienced consequences on their anticancer treatment schedule. Interruption or a starting failure of the oncologic therapy correlated with significant shorter OS. Anticancer treatment delays did not negatively affect the OS. Lymphocytopenia development after COVID was significantly associated with worst outcome.

COVID-19 has led to programmatic impacts and changes in donor and recipient selection. Several studies have evaluated the course, optimal treatment, and prevention of COVID-19 in SOT recipients. OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on COVID-19 in SOT recipients. SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched. The search was restricted to articles published between January 1, 2019, and December 1, 2021. CONTENT: The COVID-19 pandemic initially led to a decreased volume of solid organ transplants. However, transplant volumes at most centers have rebounded. Donor selection remains an incompletely defined issue. Several reports suggests that donor-derived SARS-CoV-2 infections occur only in lung transplant recipients, and that other organs from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive donors could potentially be safely used. However, these data are limited to case series. Transplantation for end-stage lung disease after COVID-19 infection is increasingly common and has been performed with acceptable outcomes. In acute COVID-19 in a transplant candidate, transplantation should be delayed when feasible. After adjustment, mortality after COVID-19 appear similar in SOT recipients as compared to the general population, with notable increased use of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory treatment options. Prevention of COVID-19 is key in SOT recipients. Vaccination of SOT recipients and anyone who is in contact with SOT recipients is one of the cornerstones of prevention. Non-pharmacological interventions such as face coverings, hand hygiene, and physical distancing remain ever important as well. IMPLICATIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an important impact on SOT candidates and recipients. Prevention of infection is the most important measure, and requires careful attention to approaches to vaccination, and messaging of the ongoing need for face coverings, physical distancing, and hand hygiene.","output":"An Overview of COVID-19 in solid organ transplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 pandemic has drastically altered all facets of clinical care and research.

By promoting distinct representations of Self and Other in international affairs and by investing foreign policy making as a site to perform a rupture with technocratic elites, populist practices contribute to enable or constrain certain policy choices and mode of diplomatic actions.

The current study aims to assess the effect of interpregnancy weight change on the risk of developing gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension, preterm birth, or delivering a large- or small-for-gestational age neonate. METHODS Pubmed, Ovid Embase, ClinicalTrial.gov and the Cochrane library were systematically searched up until July 24th, 2019. Interpregnancy weight change was defined as the difference between pre-pregnancy weight of an index pregnancy and a consecutive pregnancy. Inclusion criteria included full text original articles reporting quantitative data about interpregnancy weight change in multiparous women with any time interval between consecutive births and the risk of any perinatal complication of interest. Studies reporting adjusted odds ratios and a reference group of - 1 to + 1 BMI unit change between pregnancies were harmonised by meta-analysis. RESULTS Twenty-three cohort studies identified a total of 671,906 women with two or more consecutive pregnancies. Seven of these studies were included in the meta-analysis (280,672 women). Interpregnancy weight gain was consistently associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension and large-for-gestational age births. In contrast, interpregnancy weight loss was associated with a lower risk of delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate. The effect magnitude (relative risk) of interpregnancy weight gain on pregnancy induced hypertension or delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate was greater among women with a normal BMI in the index pregnancy compared to women with a starting BMI 25 kg/m2. CONCLUSION These findings confirm that interpregnancy weight change impacts the risk of developing perinatal complications in a subsequent pregnancy. This provides evidence in support of guidelines encouraging women to achieve post-partum weight loss, as their risk of perinatal complications might be minimised if they return to their pre-pregnancy weight before conceiving again.

METHODS: A population-based household survey was performed, from July 27, 2020 to August 8, 2020. The estimates considered clustering, stratification and non-response. Qualitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies was performed in a fully-automated Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on the Cobas? e601 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). RESULTS: In total, 3,156 individuals were interviewed. Seroprevalence of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 40.4% (95%CI 35.6-45.3). Population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions was higher at the beginning of the pandemic than in the last month. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were significantly lower among mask wearers and among those who maintained social and physical distancing in the last month compared to their counterparts. Among the infected, 26.0% were asymptomatic. The infection fatality rate (IFR) was 0.14%, higher for men and older adults. The IFR based on excess deaths was 0.28%. The ratio of estimated infections to reported cases was 22.2.

Elective surgeries were temporarily suspended, with surgeries being performed only for emergent/urgent medical conditions such as hip fractures where early surgical intervention has shown decreased rates of morbidity/mortality. OBJECTIVES To assess the indirect influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown on hip fracture patients, considering factors such as time to surgery, early postoperative complications, and ambulation status. METHODS A comparative retrospective study was conducted on consecutive patients presenting to our emergency department (ED) with hip fractures that were treated surgically (N=29) during a 1-month period during the government lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The treatments were compared to consecutive patients who presented with hip fractures and were treated surgically (N=44) during the same timeframe in the previous year (control). Comparisons were made using t-test, ANOVA test, Fisher's exact test, and chi-square test. RESULTS The COVID-19 group was operated on sooner (20.34 vs. 34.87 hours), had fewer early postoperative complications (10.3% vs. 31.8%), had better ambulatory status at discharge, and experienced a shorter hospital stay (5.93 vs. 8.13 days) with more patients being discharged home (72.4% vs. 22.7%).

An important factor for this success is the production of venoms, a refined biological fluid rich in proteins, short peptides and cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs). These toxins may present pharmacologically relevant biological actions, as antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer activities, for instance. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in the exploration of venom toxins for therapeutic reasons, such as drug development. However, the process of peptide sequencing and mainly the evaluation of potential biological activities of these peptides are laborious, considering the low yield of venom extraction and the high variability of toxins present in spider venoms. Here we show a robust methodology for identification, sequencing, and initial screening of potential bioactive peptides found in the venom of Acanthoscurria rondoniae. This methodology consists in a multiomics approach involving proteomics, peptidomics and transcriptomics analyses allied to in silico predictions of antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and anticancer activities. Through the application of this strategy, a total of 92,889 venom gland transcripts were assembled and 84 novel toxins were identified at the protein level, including seven short peptides and 10 fully sequenced CRPs (belonging to seven toxin families). In silico analysis suggests that seven CRPs families may have potential antimicrobial or antiviral activities, while two CRPs and four short peptides are potentially anticancer. Taken together, our results demonstrate an effective multiomics strategy for the discovery of new toxins and in silico screening of potential bioactivities. This strategy may be useful in toxin discovery, as well as in the screening of possible activities for the vast diversity of molecules produced by venomous animals.","output":"A Multiomics Approach Unravels New Toxins With Possible In Silico Antimicrobial, Antiviral, and Antitumoral Activities in the Venom of Acanthoscurria rondoniae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Individual enteropathogen infections in healthy and clinically ill cats are well described, but prevalence and patterns of enteropathogen co-infection have only been reported on a limited basis. We studied enteropathogen co-infection in diarrhoeic UK cats using results of a real time PCR assay for 8 enteropathogenic species; feline coronavirus (Co), feline panleukopenia virus (Pa), Clostridium perfringens (Cl), Salmonella enterica (Sa), Giardia spp. (Gi), Tritrichomonas foetus (Tr), Cryptosporidium spp. (Cr), and Toxoplasma gondii (To). Age, gender, breed and history were recorded. PCR panels from 1088 diarrhoeic cats were available for analysis. RESULTS: Overall enteropathogen prevalence was 56.9% (Co), 22.1% (Pa), 56.6% (Cl), 0.8% (Sa), 20.6% (Gi), 18.8% (Tr), 24.4% (Cr) and 1.0% (To). Prevalence of Co, Gi and Tr was higher in pedigree cats compared to non-pedigree cats (DSH) and prevalence decreased with increasing age for Co, Pa, Gi, Cr and Tr. Co-infection was common: 2 enteropathogens were detected in 62.5% of cats, and 13.3% of cats had 4 enteropathogens. Mean ( [Formula: see text]) enteropathogen co-infection 2.01 (1.3 SD), was significantly higher in pedigree cats ( [Formula: see text] =2.51) compared to DSH ( [Formula: see text] =1.68) and decreased with age ( [Formula: see text] =2.64 <6 months, [Formula: see text] =1.68 for >1 yr). More cats were negative for all 8 enteropathogens tested (12.7%) than expected. When exact combinations of co-infection were examined, Tr tended to be found in combinations with Co, Cl, and Gi. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple infections should be considered the most likely result of faecal testing in cats, and case management needs to take this into account. In contrast, the relatively high percentage of cats negative for all 8 enteropathogens tested could indicate an innate resistance to infection. Alternatively it could indicate a lack of exposure to these 8 enteropathogens or the presence of other enteropathogens not assessed by this assay.","output":"Enteropathogen co-infection in UK cats with diarrhoea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

This human alveolar chip reproduced the key features of alveolar-capillary barrier by co-culture of human alveolar epithelium, microvascular endothelium and circulating immune cells under fluidic flow in normal and disease. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, the epithelium exhibited higher susceptibility to virus than endothelium. Transcriptional analyses showed activated innate immune responses in epithelium and cytokine-dependent pathways in endothelium at 3 days post-infection, revealing the distinctive responses in different cell types. Notably, viral infection caused the immune cell recruitment, endothelium detachment, and increased inflammatory cytokines release, suggesting the crucial role of immune cells involving in alveolar barrier injury and exacerbated inflammation.

We investigated different strategies by combining the contact patterns observed between different age groups during both baseline and \\"lockdown\\" periods. We also tested the robustness of our strategy to the assumption of lower susceptibility to infection in children under age 15 years. RESULTS: We find that reopening schools for all children would maintain a post-intervention R0 < 1 up to a baseline R0 of approximately 3.3 provided that daily contacts among children 10-19 years are reduced to 33% of baseline. This finding was robust to various estimates of susceptibility to infection in children relative to adults (up to 50%) and to estimates of various levels of concomitant reopening in the rest of the community (up to 40%). However, full school reopening without any degree of contact reduction in the school setting returned R0 virtually back to baseline, highlighting the importance of mitigation measures.

Those wishing to assess life impact face several challenges: First, various measurement instruments are available, including of global functioning, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and well-being. Existing reviews have tended to focus on one of these domains; consequently, a comprehensive overview is lacking. Second, the extent to which such instruments truly capture distinct concepts is unclear. Third, many available scales conflate symptoms and their impact, thus undermining much needed analyses of associations between the two. Methods and analysis: A scoping umbrella review will examine existing reviews of life impact measures for use with 6-24-year-olds in the context of mental health and well-being research. We will systematically search five bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science), and conduct systematic record screening, data extraction and charting based on methodological guidance by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Data synthesis will involve the tabulation of scale characteristics, feasibility, and measurement properties, and the use of summary statistics to synthesize how these instruments operationalize life impact. Ethics and dissemination: This study will provide a comprehensive road map for researchers and clinicians seeking to assess life impact in youth mental health, providing guidance in navigating available measurement options. We will seek to publish the findings in a leading peer-reviewed journal in the field. Formal research ethics approval will not be required.

DESIGN: A phone survey administered between August and October 2020 to participants of a population-based longitudinal cohort study established in 2002 comprising two cohorts born in 1994-1995 and 2001-2002 in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), Peru and Vietnam. We use logistic regressions to examine associations between mental health and pandemic-related stressors, structural factors (gender, age), and lifelong protective/risk factors (parent and peer relationship, wealth, long-term health problems, past emotional problems, subjective well-being) measured at younger ages. SETTING: A geographically diverse, poverty-focused sample, also reaching those without mobile phones or internet access. PARTICIPANTS: 10 496 individuals were approached; 9730 participated. Overall, 8988 individuals were included in this study; 4610 (51%) men and 4378 (49%) women. Non-inclusion was due to non-location or missing data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms consistent with at least mild anxiety or depression were measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (&#8805;5) or Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (&#8805;5). RESULTS: Rates of symptoms of at least mild anxiety (depression) were highest in Peru at 41% (32%) (95% CI 38.63% to 43.12%; (29.49-33.74)), and lowest in Vietnam at 9% (9%) (95% CI 8.16% to 10.58%; (8.33-10.77)), mirroring COVID-19 mortality rates. Women were most affected in all countries except Ethiopia. Pandemic-related stressors such as health risks/expenses, economic adversity, food insecurity, and educational or employment disruption were risk factors for anxiety and depression, though showed varying levels of importance across countries. Prior parent/peer relationships were protective factors, while long-term health or emotional problems were risk factors. CONCLUSION: Pandemic-related health, economic and social stress present significant risks to the mental health of young people in LMICs where mental health support is limited, but urgently needed to prevent long-term consequences.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depression symptoms of young people in the global south: evidence from a four-country cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health crisis that has prompted an unprecedented response Drastic and previously unthinkable steps have been t","output":"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Federalism: Who Decides?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To assess the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and related knowledge and attitudes during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in Croatia METHODS: The online survey, conducted on social media in May 2020, yielded 1393 responses across the country (66% from the Adriatic area) The questionnaire consisted of socio-demographic questions and questions on the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to PPE use The 2 test, t test, and multivariate logistic regression were used in data analysis RESULTS: As many as 84 0% of participants reported the compliance with social distancing measures, while 52 8% reported using PPE (mask and/or gloves) when shopping or visiting friends and family Participants demonstrated good knowledge (mean of 10 4 [95% CI 10 3-10 4] correct answers out of 13 questions) and neutral to moderately positive attitude about PPE use (mean of 36 6 [36 1-37 1] out of 50 points) Participants with higher education, women, and health care workers had a greater probability for having a high knowledge score Women, older individuals, public transport users, people with more positive PPE use attitude, and those who complied with social distancing had a higher probability of PPE use, while health care workers and highly educated participants had a reduced probability of PPE use in public CONCLUSIONS: Croatians had good knowledge and neutral to moderately positive attitudes about PPE use Nevertheless, health authorities need to promote positive attitudes about PPE use in order to retain trust and compliance with epidemiological measures","output":"Adherence to epidemiological measures and related knowledge and attitudes during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in Croatia: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study is to assess the risk of newly acquired RNA detection-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection after previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods: The study subjects were derived from the follow-up cohort of chronic hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis who received antiviral therapy in the Department of Infectious Diseases of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from February 2004 to September 2019. LC patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. The life-table method was used to calculate the incidence of liver cancer. Multivariable Cox regression model was used to analyze the risk factors that may affect the development of liver cancer in patients with LC. A subgroup analysis was conducted in liver cirrhotic patients who developed liver cancer to evaluate the effectiveness of antiviral treatment compliance. The (2) test was used for rate comparison. Results: The median follow-up time of 198 LC cases treated with NAs was 6.0 years (1.0-15.3 years). By the end of the visit: (1) 16.2% (32/198) of LC patients had developed liver cancer, and the cumulative incidence of liver cancer in 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 years were 0, 8.9%, 14.3%, 18.6%, and 23.4%, respectively, with an average annual incidence of 3.1%. Among the 32 cases with liver cancer, 68.7% had developed small liver cancer (22/32). (2) Univariate Cox model analysis showed that the development of liver cancer was related to four factors, i.e., the presence or absence of LC nodules, whether the baseline was first-line medication, the family history of liver cancer, and patient compliance. The results of multivariate Cox model analysis showed that poor patient compliance and baseline non-first-line medication were risk factors for liver cancer. (3) The results of log-rank test subgroup analysis showed that the 5-year cumulative incidence of liver cancer in patients with hardened nodules was significantly higher than that of patients without hardened nodules (21.7% vs. 11.5%, P = 0.029). The 5-year cumulative incidence of liver cancer in patients with non-first-line drugs was significantly higher than that of patients with first-line drugs (22.0% vs.8.2%, P = 0.003). The 5-year cumulative incidence of liver cancer in patients with poor compliance was significantly higher than that of patients with good compliance (21.3% vs. 12.7%, P = 0.014). The 5-year cumulative incidence of liver cancer in patients with a family history of liver cancer was significantly higher than that of patients without a family history of liver cancer (22.3% vs. 8.1%, P = 0.006). (4) Compared with patients with poor compliance, patients with good compliance had higher HBV DNA negative serconversion rate (98.7% vs. 87.8%, P = 0.005), and a lower virological breakthrough rate (12.1% vs. 29.3%, P = 0.007). Conclusion: The long-term NAs antiviral therapy can reduce the risk of liver cancer, but it cannot completely prevent the development of liver cancer, especially in patients with a family history of liver cancer and baseline hardened nodules (high risk of liver cancer). Furthermore, the complete management can improve patient compliance, ensure the efficacy of antiviral therapy, and reduce the risk of liver cancer development, so to achieve secondary prevention of liver cancer, i.e., early detection, diagnosis and treatment.","output":"[Risk factors for the development of liver cancer in patients with hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis treated with long-term nucleos(t)ide analogues]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report 11 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCW) na?ve for COVID-19 and seropositive after the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

In a randomized trial, we tested the long-term intervention effects of Family Foundations on parent, child, and family wellbeing one to two months after the imposition of a national shelter-in-place public health intervention in 2020. We used regression models to test intervention impact on outcomes reported on by parents in a standard questionnaire format and a series of 8 days of daily reports. We also tested moderation of intervention impact by parent depression and coparenting relationship quality. Relative to control families, intervention families demonstrated significantly lower levels of individual and family problems (general parent hostility, harsh and aggressive parenting, coparenting conflict, sibling relationship conflict, and childrens negative mood and behavior problems), and higher levels of positive family relationship quality (positive parenting, couple relationship quality, sibling relations, and family cohesion). For some outcomes, including coparenting conflict, harsh parenting, and child behavior problems, intervention effects were larger for more vulnerable familiesthat is, families with higher pre-pandemic levels of parent depression or lower levels of coparenting relationship quality. We conclude that targeted family prevention programming is able to promote healthy parent and child functioning during unforeseen future periods of acute stress.

In this study, to unveil the mechanism, one target of Ghd2, the Rubisco activase gene RCA, was identified through the combined analysis of Ghd2-CRISPR transcriptome data and Ghd2-overexpression microarray data. Ghd2 binds to the \\"CACA\\" motif in the RCA promoter by its CCT domain and upregulates RCA expression. RCA has alternative transcripts, RCAS and RCAL, which are predominantly expressed under normal conditions and drought stress, respectively. Similar to Ghd2-overexpressing plants, RCAL-overexpressing plants were more sensitive to drought stress than the wild type. However, the plants overexpressing RCAS showed a weak drought-sensitive phenotype. Moreover, RCAL knockdown and knockout plants did not show yield loss under normal conditions but exhibited enhanced drought tolerance and delayed leaf senescence. The chlorophyll content, the free amino acid content and the expression of senescence-related genes in the RCAL mutant were lower than those in the wild-type plants under drought stress. Taken together, Ghd2 induces leaf senescence by upregulating RCAL expression under drought stress, and the RCAL mutant has important values in breeding drought-tolerant varieties.","output":"A long transcript mutant of the Rubisco activase gene RCA upregulated by the transcription factor Ghd2 enhances drought tolerance in rice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: The clinical manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2 infection are mainly respiratory but the virus can cause a variety of symptoms.

Emotional disclosure-based interventions hold potential as a way of providing support remotely. However, evidence of their efficacy in people with terminal illness is mixed. Reviews have highlighted this may be due to interventions not being tailored to the unique needs of this population. In response to this, we are developing Let It Out (LIO), an online, self-guided emotional disclosure-based intervention tailored for people living with terminal illness. AIMS: The primary objective of the study is to optimise the design of the LIO intervention. Secondary objectives include assessing its acceptability and feasibility; exploring potential impact on well-being; identifying potential adverse effects; and informing choice of outcome measures for potential future evaluation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single arm, mixed-methods, multisite, longitudinal study. Up to 40 people living with a terminal illness under the care of hospices in England and Scotland will receive the online LIO intervention. LIO consists of 3, self-guided expression sessions over 2 weeks. The primary outcome measures are (1) a structured feedback form completed by participants after the final expression session; and (2) semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 15 patient participants, 30 hospice staff and 15 informal carers. These quantitative and qualitative data will be triangulated via process evaluation to inform optimisation of the intervention design.

Because the preliminary analyses suggested that the risk was dependent on the age at exposure, a model was applied that considered risk differences depending on this factor. The model analysis revealed a three-fold, significantly decreased risk per Gy in mice exposed to 21 mGy per day compared to that in acutely irradiated mice.

We examined the associations of COVID-19 lockdown with gestational length and preterm birth (PTB) in a Chinese population. Methods: We obtained medical records of 595396 singleton live infants born between 2015 and 2020 in 5 cities in Guangdong Province, South China. The exposed group (N=101900) included women who experienced the COVID-19 Level I lockdown (1/23-2/24/2020) during pregnancy, while the unexposed group (N=493496) included women who were pregnant during the same calendar months in 2015-2019. Cumulative exposure was calculated based on days exposed to different levels of emergency responses with different weighting. Generalized linear regression models were applied to estimate the associations of lockdown exposure with gestational length and risk of PTB (<37 weeks). Results: The exposed group had a shorter mean gestational length than the unexposed group (38.66 vs 38.74 weeks: adjusted =-0.06 week [95%CI, -0.07, -0.05 week]). The exposed group also had a higher risk of PTB (5.7% vs 5.3%;adjusted OR=1.08 [95%CI, 1.05, 1.11]). These associations seemed to be stronger when exposure occurred before or during the 23 rd gestational week (GW) than during or after the 24 th GW. Similarly, higher cumulative lockdown exposure was associated with a shorter gestational length and a higher risk of PTB. Conclusions: The COVID-19 lockdown measures were associated with a slightly shorter gestational length and a moderately higher risk of PTB.

This pandemic has managed to overwhelm the health care system of the most advanced countries in the world. As the whole of the medical fraternity stands robed as health care professionals to fight against COVID-19, specialty emergencies like trauma continue to pester the already overburdened health care community. This situation calls for the need for a pandemic response protocol (PREP) in each specialty that helps the doctors to manage specialty emergencies without chaos and at the same time allowing them to play their part in pandemic management. CONCLUSION: PREP as an integrated pragmatic approach is essential in containing pandemics as they need international cooperation at various levels starting from knowledge sharing to monetary support.

Studies have shown that the prevalence of epilepsy in low\\\\ and middle\\\\income countries is substantially greater than in more resourced countries. The objective of this report was to demonstrate that mobile Health (mHealth) technologies have the potential to improve the management of epilepsy in Africa. METHODS: The feasibility of technology\\\\based home monitoring was investigated in an observational study of 40 children with refractory epilepsy or epilepsy associated with intellectual disability and/or behavior difficulties in South Africa. Technology\\\\based home monitoring was implemented for six months. Physical activity, sleep, and heart rate were continuously monitored with a wearable device. Caregivers completed regular mobile Patient Reported Outcomes (mPROs) and reported seizures and ad hoc events using a dedicated app. Feasibility was assessed and descriptively measured for recruitment, retention, and engagement of the participants. RESULTS: The mHealth technology was able to capture important information that gives an impression of the overall experience of the children and their caregivers. Thirty\\\\seven participants (94.9%) reported at least one clinical event. Seventy\\\\nine percent of caregivers reported seizure events in their children, which were the primary event anticipated. Median engagement with the wearable device and monthly mPROs was 30.8% and 57.1%, respectively. However, most participants (87%) had to be given smartphones for them to have Bluetooth capabilities and access to the study app. Tolerability to the device was impacted by the difficult living circumstances of caregivers that induced fear of loss or theft. SIGNIFICANCE: The study showed how the use of remote patient monitoring in the form of mHealth can benefit epilepsy patients, despite highly variable engagement with the technology. The combination of mPROs and wearable devices generated informative datasets that will allow clinicians but also the children and their caregivers to better understand and manage the disease.","output":"Demonstrating the feasibility of digital health to support pediatric patients in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Covid-19 pandemic in Italy, official data are collected with medical swabs following a pure convenience criterion which, at least in an early phase, has privileged the exam of patients showing evident symptoms. However, there are evidences of a very high proportion of asymptomatic patients. In this situation, in order to estimate the real number of infected (and to estimate the lethality rate), it should be necessary to run a properly designed sample survey through which it would be possible to calculate the probability of inclusion and hence draw sound probabilistic inference. Unfortunately, the survey run by the Italian Statistical Institute encountered many field difficulties. Some researchers proposed estimates of the total prevalence based on various approaches, including epidemiologic models, time series and the analysis of data collected in countries that faced the epidemic in earlier times. In this paper, we propose to estimate the prevalence of Covid-19 in Italy by reweighting the available official data published by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit so as to obtain a more representative sample of the Italian population. Reweighting is a procedure commonly used to artificially modify the sample composition so as to obtain a distribution which is more similar to the population. In this paper, we will use post-stratification of the official data, in order to derive the weights necessary for reweighting the sample results, using age and gender as post-stratification variables, thus obtaining more reliable estimation of prevalence and lethality. Specifically, for Italy, we obtain a prevalence of 9%. The proposed methodology represents a reasonable approximation while waiting for more reliable data obtained with a properly designed national sample survey and that it could be further improved if more data were made available.","output":"Observed and estimated prevalence of Covid-19 in Italy: How to estimate the total cases from medical swabs data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: No specific scale to measure Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease in Nursing Homes (QoL-AD NH) exists in French. We aimed to translate and culturally adapt the QoL-AD NH participant scale into a French version and evaluate its psychometric properties with residents in French nursing homes (EHPAD). METHODS: First, the QoL-AD NH was cross-culturally adapted into French according to guidelines. Secondly, a convenience group of residents with mild to moderate dementia answered the Folsteins test and the QoL-AD NH. They also answered the Dementia Quality of Life and the Geriatric Depression Scale to test convergent and divergent validity. Known-group validity was tested with a comparison group of residents without dementia. Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM) was used after Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to identify factors and measure invariance across age and mental state groups. Reliability (internal consistency, McDonalds omega and testCretest) were also measured. RESULTS: Following successful adaptation of the QoL-AD NH, 174 residents (mean age 86.6) from 7 nursing homes with mild to moderate dementia participated in the validation study. We retained a 3-factor model of the scale after ESEM identifying: Intra & interpersonal environment-related QoL, Self-functioning-related QoL and Perceived current health-related QoL that were invariant across age and mental state groups. The QoL-AD NH had acceptable convergent ( range 0.24C0.53) and divergent validity ( range ? 0.43 to ? 0.57) and good known-group validity with 33 residents without dementia (t(205) = 2.70, p = .007). For reliability, the results revealed very good and adequate internal consistency ( = 0.86 for total scale and  0.71 for subscales). All total omega values exceeded the threshold 0.70. The hierarchical omega was 0.50, supporting the multidimensionality of the scale. Hierarchical omega subscale values exceeded the minimal level 0.50 except for the third factor, although reliable, would deserve more items. TestCretest was good with ICC (3,1) = 0.76. CONCLUSIONS: The QoL-AD NH French participant version has globally good reliability and validity for evaluating residents' quality of life. However, further studies must rework and confirm the factor structure, test sensitivity to change and responsiveness.

In this work, we studied the relationship between myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and monocytes subsets with the immunological responsiveness of TB patients. Individuals with active TB were classified as low responders (LR-TB) or high responders (HR-TB) according to their T cell responses against a cell lysate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb-Ag). Thus, LR-TB, individuals with severe disease, display a weaker immune response to Mtb compare to HR-TB, subjects with strong immunity against the bacteria. We observed that LR-TB presented higher percentages of CD16 positive monocytes as compared to HR-TB and healthy donors. Moreover, monocyte-like (M-MDSC) and polymorphonuclear-like (PMN-MDSC) MDSC were increased in patients and the proportion of M-MDSC inversely correlated with IFN- levels released after Mtb-Ag stimulation in HR-TB. We also found that LR-TB displayed the highest percentages of circulating M-MDSC. These results demonstrate that CD16 positive monocytes and M-MDSC frequencies could be used as another immunological classification parameter. Interestingly, in LR-TB, frequencies of CD16 positive monocytes and M-MDSC were restored after only three weeks of anti-TB treatment. Together, our findings show a link between the immunological status of TB patients and the levels of different circulating myeloid cell populations.","output":"Circulating Monocyte-Like Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells and CD16 Positive Monocytes Correlate With Immunological Responsiveness of Tuberculosis Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is responsible for more fatalities than the SARS coronavirus, despite being in the initial stage of a global pandemic. The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases were reported as of March 1. We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila. CASE PRESENTATION: Both patients were previously healthy Chinese nationals on vacation in the Philippines travelling as a couple during January 2020. Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25. Physical examination was unremarkable. Influenza B, human coronavirus 229E, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NPS/OPS) swabs. On January 30, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs and she was identified as the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Philippines. Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged. Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. Influenza B and Streptococcus pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated and he required intubation. On January 31, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs, and he was identified as the 2nd confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Philippines. On February 1, the patients condition deteriorated, and following a cardiac arrest, it was not possible to revive him. He was thus confirmed as the first COVID-19 death outside of China. CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues. Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease.

Data were collected from 19 June 2020 to 26 June 2020. The medical students of Suez Canal University fulfilled the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study were included by using convenience and snowball sampling technique (283 students). The total related knowledge score was 80.9%. The majority (83%) feel that coronavirus infection is a life-threatening illness. About 86.9% of the students perceived a COVID-19-infected person as a serious threat to society. However, three-quarters of the students (76.3%) perceived risk of infection with COVID-19 during ward rotations. About 92% of the students are practicing preventive behaviors. Female senior students have higher percentages in regard to related knowledge and practicing preventive behaviors. Students who received education about Covid-19 and students perceived higher risk of infection were more adherent to preventive measures. There is a moderate correlation between related knowledge and practicing preventive behaviors.

Though drugs like remdesivir, favipiravir, and dexamethasone found beneficial for COVID-19 management, they have limitations clinically, and vaccine development takes a long time. The researchers have reported key proteins which could act as druggable targets. Among them, the major protease Mpro is first published, plays a prominent role in viral replication and an attractive drug-target for drug discovery. Hence, to target Mpro and inhibit it, we accomplished the virtual screening of US-FDA approved drugs using well-known drug repurposing approach by computer-aided tools. METHODS: The protein Mpro, PDB-ID 6LU7 was imported to Maestro graphical user interphase of Schr?dinger software. The US-FDA approved drug structures are imported from DrugBank and docked after preliminary protein and ligand preparation. The drugs are shortlisted based on the docking scores in the Standard Precision method (SP-docking) and then based on the type of molecular interactions they are studied for molecular dynamics simulations. RESULTS: The docking and molecular interactions studies, five drugs emerged as potential hits by forming hydrophilic, hydrophobic, electrostatic interactions. The drugs such as arbutin, terbutaline, barnidipine, tipiracil and aprepitant identified as potential hits. Among the drugs, tipiracil and aprepitant interacted with the Mpro consistently, and they turned out to be most promising. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the possible exploration for drug repurposing using computer-aided docking tools and the potential roles of tipiracil and aprepitant, which can be explored further in the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease: A Computational Drug Repurposing Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and possible induction of pregnancy complications, including miscarriage, fetal malformations, fetal growth restriction and/or stillbirth, are serious concerns for pregnant individuals with COVID-19.

However, even if a neonate tests negative for SARS-CoV-2, frequent abnormal findings, including fetal and maternal vascular malperfusion, have been reported in cases of COVID-19-positive mothers. Primary receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

However other route of transplacental infection cannot be ruled out. Pathological examinations have demonstrated that syncytiotrophoblasts are often infected with SARS-CoV-2, but fetuses are not always infected. These findings suggest the presence of a placental barrier, even if it is not completely effective. As the frequency and molecular mechanisms of intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have not been determined to date, intensive clinical examinations by repeated ultrasound and fetal heart rate monitoring are strongly recommended for pregnant women infected with COVID-19.

While much research has been dedicated to understanding the genetic causes of the disease, our understanding of the mechanistic impacts of GRN deficiency has only recently begun to take shape. With no known cure or treatment available for GRN-related FTD, there is a growing need to rapidly advance genetic and/or small-molecule therapeutics for this disease. This issue is complicated by the fact that, while lysosomal dysfunction seems to be a key driver of pathology, the mechanisms linking a loss of GRN to a pathogenic state remain unclear. In our attempt to address these key issues, we have turned to the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, to model, study, and find potential therapies for GRN-deficient FTD. First, we show that the loss of the nematode GRN ortholog, pgrn-1, results in several behavioral and molecular defects, including lysosomal dysfunction and defects in autophagic flux. Our investigations implicate the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in the regulation of many of the in vivo defects associated with pgrn-1 loss. Finally, we utilized these nematodes as an in vivo tool for high-throughput drug screening and identified two small molecules with potential therapeutic applications against GRN/pgrn-1 deficiency. These compounds reverse the biochemical, cellular, and functional phenotypes of GRN deficiency.

An optimized use of biasing restraints and the use of multiple starting models led to enhanced sampling. The new protocol generally improved the model quality. In comparison with our previous protocols, the CASP14 protocol showed clear improvements. Our approach was successful with most initial models, many based on deep learning methods. However, we found that our approach was not able to refine machine-learning models from the AlphaFold2 group, often decreasing already high initial qualities.

We continue to find that MD-based refinement has the potential to improve AI predictions. We also identified several practical issues that make it difficult to realize that potential. Increasingly important is the consideration of inter-domain and oligomeric contacts in simulations; the presence of large kinetic barriers in refinement pathways also continues to present challenges.

One-third of patients hospitalized due to severe COVID-19 develops macrovascular thrombotic complications, including venous thromboembolism, myocardial injury/infarction and stroke. Concurrently, the autopsy series indicate multiorgan damage pattern consistent with microvascular injury. PROPHYLAXIS, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT: COVID-19 associated coagulopathy has distinct features, including markedly elevated D-dimers concentration with nearly normal activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and platelet count. The diagnosis may be challenging due to overlapping features between pulmonary embolism and severe COVID-19 disease, such as dyspnoea, high concentration of D-dimers, right ventricle with dysfunction or enlargement, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Both macro- and microvascular complications are associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Therefore, early recognition of coagulation abnormalities among hospitalized COVID-19 patients are critical measures to identify patients with poor prognosis, guide antithrombotic prophylaxis or treatment, and improve patients clinical outcomes. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICIANS: Most of the guidelines and consensus documents published on behalf of professional societies focused on thrombosis and hemostasis advocate the use of anticoagulants in all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as well as 2-6 weeks post hospital discharge in the absence of contraindications. However, since there is no guidance for deciding the intensity and duration of anticoagulation, the decision-making process should be made in individual-case basis.

Recently, several lines of evidence pointed to the fact that oncogenic activation of Myc family proteins is concomitant with reprogramming of tumor cells to cope with an enhanced need for metabolites during cell growth. These adaptions are driven by the ability of Myc proteins to act as transcriptional amplifiers in a tissue-of-origin specific manner. Here, we describe the effects of N-Myc overexpression on metabolic reprogramming in neuroblastoma cells. Ectopic expression of N-Myc induced a glycolytic switch that was concomitant with enhanced sensitivity towards 2-deoxyglucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis. Moreover, global metabolic profiling revealed extensive alterations in the cellular metabolome resulting from overexpression of N-Myc. Limited supply with either of the two main carbon sources, glucose or glutamine, resulted in distinct shifts in steady-state metabolite levels and significant changes in glutathione metabolism. Interestingly, interference with glutamine-glutamate conversion preferentially blocked proliferation of N-Myc overexpressing cells, when glutamine levels were reduced.

Some developed countries integrated telemedicine to reduce the impacts of the shortage of healthcare professionals and potentially reduce the risk of exposure, ensuring easy delivery of quality health services while limiting regular physical contact and direct hospitalization. However, the adoption of telemedicine and telehealth is still nascent in many sub-Saharan Africa countries. Therefore, this study reflects on progress made towards the use of telemedicine, virtual health care services, challenges encountered, and proffers ways to address them.

The study revealed that telemedicine provides unprecedented benefits such as improving efficiency, effective utilization of healthcare resources, forward triaging, prevention of medical personnel infection, aiding medical students' clinical observation and participation, and assurance of social support for patients. However, the absence of policy on virtual care and political will, cost of sustenance of virtual health care services, inadequate funding, technological and infrastructural barriers, patient and healthcare personnel bias on virtual care and cultural barriers are identified as limiting factors to the adoption of virtual health care in many African health systems. To alleviate some of these barriers, we recommend the development of robust policies and frameworks for virtual health care, the inclusion of virtual care in the medical school curriculum, supporting virtual care research and development, increasing health funding, removing monopolisation of telecommunication services, developing of virtual health solutions that address eccentricities of African health systems.","output":"Are we there yet?

METHODOLOGY: We propose an alternative modeling approach in which the model is created largely independent of the occupancy data being simulated. The distribution of bed occupancies for patient cohorts is calculated directly from occupancy data from sentinel clinics. By coupling with infection scenarios, the prediction error is constrained by the error of the infection dynamics scenarios. The model allows systematic simulation of arbitrary infection scenarios, calculation of bed occupancy corridors, and sensitivity analyses with respect to protective measures. RESULTS: The model was based on hospital data and by adjusting only two parameters of data in the Aachen city region and Germany as a whole. Using the example of the simulation of the respective bed occupancy rates for Germany as a whole, the loading model for the calculation of occupancy corridors is demonstrated. The occupancy corridors form barriers for bed occupancy in the event that infection rates do not exceed specific thresholds. In addition, lockdown scenarios are simulated based on retrospective events. DISCUSSION: Our model demonstrates that a significant reduction in forecast uncertainty in occupancy forecasts is possible by selectively combining data from different sources. It allows arbitrary combination with infection dynamics models and scenarios, and thus can be used both for load forecasting and for sensitivity analyses for expected novel spreading and lockdown scenarios.","output":"Bundesweites Belastungsmodell fr Intensivstationen durch COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cancer patients suffer from many complications caused by both the disease itself and the side effects of anticancer treatment Many symptoms go unnoticed by doctors because of the patient's remote location, significant interruptions between face-to-face visits to the doctor and differences in the individual course of the disease In a pandemic caused by Covid 19, cancer patients are at great risk The practical impossibility of patient's visit to a doctor, conduct clinical trials determines the highest risk for this group of patients Thus the relevance of remote support for these patients in isolation increases many times Objective: The goal was to create and implement in a pilot project a digital service (ONCONET system) for remote monitoring of cancer patients outside the hospital as well as adaptation to COVID 19 pandemic Methods: The developed platform is a cloud service hosted in a data processing center which provides healthcare organizations with a ready-made service The system is based on specialized questionnaires developed by oncologists for remote assessment of the patient's condition The important component of the system are content libraries for patients and doctors, information and reference materials as the collection of video-schools from leading experts of nosology, rules of life, nutrition, rehabilitation and care Results: To evaluate the effectiveness of the ONCONET system, 2 groups of patients were formed: ONCONET group - 206 patients and retrospective control group - 209 patients Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between groups as a whole, as well as between individual factors of complications Conclusion: The study demonstrates the usefulness and high medical efficiency of the ONCONET system for remote monitoring of cancer patients, especially against the background of a pandemic and the necessary self-isolation of cancer patients ?

MATERIALS AND METHODS MW ablations were performed at power outputs of 25W, 35W, and 45W using a 915-MHz frequency generator and a 2-cm active tip antenna. RF ablations were performed with a bipolar RF system with 2- and 3-cm active tip electrodes. Tissue temperatures were continuously monitored during ablation. RESULTS The mean short-axis diameters of the coagulation zones were 1.34  0.14, 1.45  0.13, and 1.74  0.11 cm for MW ablation at outputs of 25W, 35W, and 45W. For RF ablation, the corresponding values were 1.16  0.09 and 1.26  0.14 cm with electrodes having 2- and 3-cm active tips, respectively. The mean coagulation volumes were 2.27  0.65, 2.85  0.72, and 4.45  0.47 cm(3) for MW ablation at outputs of 25W, 35W, and 45W and 1.18  0.30 and 2.29  0.55 cm(3) got RF ablation with 2- and 3-cm electrodes, respectively. MW ablations at 35W and 45W achieved significantly longer short-axis diameters than RF ablations (P < 0.05). The highest tissue temperature was achieved with MW ablation at 45W (P < 0.05). On histological examination, the extent of the ablation zone in MW ablations was less affected by tissue heterogeneity than that in RF ablations.

Serial serum samples from eight patients collected during the first, third, and ninth months after the onset of infection were evaluated. It was found that low-avidity IgG antibodies were detected in 15/15 (100%), 1/5 (20%), and 0/8 (0%) serum samples collected during the first, third, and ninth months after the onset of symptoms, respectively. Low-avidity antibodies of IgA and IgM subclasses were detected in 14/14 (100%) and 3/14 (21%) serum samples, respectively, collected in the first month after the onset of infection. However, IgA antibodies remained low in avidity in a proportion of patients even during late convalescence. As a consequence, IgG antibody avidity assays gave better discrimination between acute-phase and late-convalescent-phase serum samples than IgM, IgA, or IgGAM assays. In two of these patients, sequential serum samples were also tested for IgG avidity against human CoV strains OC43 and 229E in parallel. While SARS CoV infections induced an anamnestic IgG antibody response to the 229E and OC43 viruses, these cross-reactive antibodies remained of high avidity from early (the first month) postinfection. The results showed that assays to detect low-avidity antibody may be useful for discriminating early from late antibody responses and also for distinguishing anamnestic cross-reactive antibody responses from primary specific responses.

In our study, we have characterized the immune phenotype of B cells from 15 recovered COVID-19 patients, and found that healthy controls and recovered patients had similar B-cell populations before and after BCR stimulation, but the frequencies of PBC in patients were significantly increased when compared to healthy controls before stimulation. However, the percentage of unswitched memory B cells was decreased in recovered patients but not changed in healthy controls upon BCR stimulation. Interestingly, we found that CD19 expression was significantly reduced in almost all the B-cell subsets in recovered patients. Moreover, the BCR signaling and early B-cell response were disrupted upon BCR stimulation. Mechanistically, we found that the reduced CD19 expression was caused by the dysregulation of cell metabolism.

In this study, we use the data from a chronic disease management information system in Shanghai to estimate vaccination coverage and characterize predictors of seasonal influenza and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) vaccination among people with chronic disease in Shanghai. METHODS: The Shanghai Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have information systems related to chronic disease management, hospital records, and immunizations. Data from individuals with hypertension, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were abstracted during July 2017. The main outcome was coverage of pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Vaccination coverage was calculated across demographic groups. Significance in bivariate associations was assessed through Pearsons chi-square tests, and in multivariable models through logistic regression models with a forward stepwise method to select variables. RESULTS: In the sample of 2,531,227 individuals 15 years, 22.8% were vaccinated for pneumonia from January 2013 to July 2017, and the vaccination coverage of influenza in the 2016/17 influenza season was 0.4%. Vaccination coverage was highest in those 70C79 and lowest in those younger than 60.

Conversely, other studies added to the smokers paradox controversy with findings of increased risk for COVID-19 in heavy smokers. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) within the ciliated epithelium of the nasal tract can be stimulated to a higher frequency and provide increased protection against transient exposure to airway irritants. Smokers as well as non-smokers exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke were found to have higher CBFs. However, with extended exposure to irritants, persistent upregulated CBF can damage and remodel the epithelial layer with fewer protective cilia. Additionally, mucociliary clearance (MCC), the innate defense mechanism of the respiratory system, traps particles and pathogens within the mucous layer of the epithelium and propels them out of the airways through ciliary activity. However, this mechanism becomes defective as disease progresses, increasing susceptibility to viral respiratory infections. This paper proposes that a smokers paradox associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients may be mediated by upregulated ciliary beating frequency and mucociliary clearance with transient exposure to tobacco smoke, and downregulated CBF and MCC with extended exposure to tobacco smoke.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and Smokers Paradox: Mediation by Ciliary Beat Frequency and Mucociliary Clearance?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Klebsiella species are a common cause of community- and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia.

Therefore, we decided to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the redeployment of DCTs across the UK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for this study was collected and shared between three project researchers. All researchers were undergoing dental core training in Oral Surgery and Restorative dentistry at Guy's Hospital, London. An online survey was sent out via email and online social media platforms to reach as many DCTs as possible in the United Kingdom. Implied consent was obtained by respondents on submission of the survey.The survey consisted of five sections and was branched, with respondents answering different sections depending on their redeployment status. No qualitative data was collected, as all questions included in the survey were dichotomous or multiple-choice questions. The last two questions were in the form of a 5-point Likert scale, inviting respondents to rate five statements from strongly agree to strongly disagree. RESULTS: A total of 150 participants responded, of which 34% had been redeployed due to the pandemic. The majority of DCTs were redeployed to an intensive care unit or similar setting, and over 75% of those redeployed were working with either COVID-19 positive/suspect patients. Additionally, 23.8% of respondents had stopped patient contact due to their medical status. CONCLUSION: Many DCTs have been deployed to departments outside of their specialty and expressed some anxiety as a result.

This necessary step in sperm maturation includes posttranslational modification of sperm membrane proteins that includes protein processing by proteases. However, the molecular mechanism underpinning this epididymal sperm maturation remains unknown. In this study, we focused on transmembrane serine protease 12 (Tmprss12). Based on multi-tissue expression analysis by PCR, Tmprss12 was specifically expressed in the testis, and its expression started on day 10 postpartum, corresponding to the stage of zygotene spermatocytes. TMPRSS12 was detected in the acrosomal region of spermatozoa by immunostaining. To reveal the physiological function of TMPRSS12, we generated two knockout (KO) mouse lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Both indel and large deletion lines were male sterile showing that TMPRSS12 is essential for male fertility. Although KO males exhibited normal spermatogenesis and sperm morphology, ejaculated spermatozoa failed to migrate from the uterus to the oviduct. Further analysis revealed that a disintegrin and metalloprotease 3 (ADAM3), an essential protein on the sperm membrane surface that is required for sperm migration, was disrupted in KO spermatozoa. Moreover, we found that KO spermatozoa showed reduced sperm motility via computer-assisted sperm analysis, resulting in a low fertilization rate in vitro. Taken together, these data indicate that TMPRSS12 has dual functions in regulating sperm motility and ADAM3-related sperm migration to the oviduct. Because Tmprss12 is conserved among mammals, including humans, our results may explain some genetic cases of idiopathic male infertility, and TMPRSS12 and its downstream cascade may be novel targets for contraception.","output":"Tmprss12 is required for sperm motility and uterotubal junction migration in mice(?)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing novel coronavirus epidemic has been announced a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, and the Govt. of India has declared a nationwide lockdown from March 25, 2020, to prevent community transmission of COVID-19.

Existing tools/interventions, approaches to care, and resources to support mental health for people treated with dialysis in Canada are not well known. The aim of this scoping review was to systematically describe how mental health care is provided to adults treated with dialysis in Canada. The research questions we sought to answer were the following: (1) What mental health assessment tools and interventions for adults treated with dialysis have been investigated and utilized in Canada? (2) what is the structure and process of mental health care delivered by kidney care to adults treated with dialysis in Canada? and (3) what is the availability of mental health care resources developed for adults treated with dialysis in Canada? SOURCES OF INFORMATION: Electronic databases included Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed literature, and Google search engine for gray literature. METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted to identify peer-reviewed and gray literature that focused on mental health care or support offered to adults receiving any form of dialysis in Canadian kidney care settings and/or community organizations. Mental health care and support was defined to include mental health assessment tools, interventions, resources, guidelines, and/or pathways used in dialysis in Canada. Title, abstracts, and full texts were screened independently by 2 reviewers with discrepancies resolved by additional team members. Web sites were screened by individual members. Data from included studies and Web sites were extracted based on the abovementioned research questions. KEY FINDINGS: We identified 8 peer-reviewed articles from electronic databases, and 28 separate Web site addresses. Of the 8 articles, 4 investigated mental health assessment tools and 4 examined mental health interventions for individuals treated with dialysis in Canada. The mental health assessment tools that have been used are Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Edmonton System Assessment Scale (ESAS), Edmonton System Assessment Scale revised (ESAS-r): Renal, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Distress Assessment and Response Tool (DART), and the nonpharmacological interventions that have been investigated are intradialytic exercise, tai chi exercise program, medical music therapy, and brief mindfulness meditation. Of the 28 Web site addresses, 2 contained clinical tools for kidney care providers for the management of depression and anxiety in individuals treated with dialysis. The 26 remaining Web sites contained mental health resources for individuals with kidney disease, which presented different types of resources, including psychoeducation, peer support, and linkage to other services. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found only a limited number of studies investigating mental health assessment tools and interventions in Canada; there was a paucity of randomized controlled trials. Clinical pathways for the assessment and management of mental illness or symptoms in individuals treated with dialysis in Canada are also limited, and no clinical practice guidelines exist. Several mental health resources for people living with dialysis are available, predominantly focused on psychoeducation and peer support. Despite increasing prevalence of mental health concerns by people treated with dialysis, mental health care remains underaddressed. LIMITATIONS: It is plausible that additional literature related to mental health assessment tools, interventions, resources, guidelines, and pathways exists that we did not find during our systematic search, especially in gray literature that was limited to one search engine. In addition, health care agencies or organizations may have developed other mental health resources, which may not be available on the Internet.","output":"Mental Health Care for Adults Treated With Dialysis in Canada: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hand washing and maintaining social distance are the main measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to avoid contracting COVID-19.

For these reasons, laparoscopy could be particularly advantageous to patients in low to middle income countries (LMICs). Unfortunately, sterile processing departments in LMIC hospitals are faced with limited access to equipment and trained staff which poses an obstacle to safe surgical care. The reprocessing of laparoscopic devices requires specialised equipment and training. Therefore, when LMIC hospitals invest in laparoscopy, an update of the standard operating procedure in sterile processing is required. Currently, it is unclear whether LMIC hospitals, that already perform laparoscopy, have managed to introduce updated reprocessing methods that minimally invasive equipment requires. The aim of this study was to identify the laparoscopic sterile reprocessing procedures in rural India and to test the effectiveness of the sterilisation equipment. METHODS: We assessed laparoscopic instrument sterilisation capacity in four rural hospitals in different states in India using a mixed-methods approach. As the main form of data collection, we developed a standardised observational checklist based on reprocessing guidelines from several sources. Steam autoclave performance was measured by monitoring the autoclave cycles in two hospitals. Finally, the findings from the checklist data was supported by an interview survey with surgeons and nurses. RESULTS: The checklist data revealed the reprocessing methods the hospitals used in the reprocessing of laparoscopic instruments. It showed that the standard operating procedures had not been updated since the introduction of laparoscopy and the same reprocessing methods for regular surgical instruments were still applied. The interviews confirmed that staff had not received additional training and that they were unaware of the hazardous effects of reprocessing detergents and disinfectants. CONCLUSION: As laparoscopy is becoming more prevalent in LMICs, updated policy is needed to incorporate minimally invasive instrument reprocessing in medical practitioner and staff training programmes. While reprocessing standards improve, it is essential to develop instruments and reprocessing equipment that is more suitable for resource-constrained rural surgical environments.

Many groups recently presented results using heat processing method of respiratory samples prior to RT-qPCR as an economical method enabling an extremely fast streamlining of the processes at virtually no cost. Here, we present our results using this method and highlight some major pitfalls that diagnostics laboratories should be aware of before proceeding with this methodology. We first investigated various treatments using different temperatures, incubation times and sample volumes to optimise the heat treatment conditions. Although the initial data confirmed results published elsewhere, further investigations revealed unexpected inhibitory properties of some commonly used universal transport media (UTMs) on some commercially available RT-qPCR mixes, leading to a risk of reporting false-negative results. This emphasises the critical importance of a thorough validation process to determine the most suitable reagents to use depending on the sample types to be tested. In conclusion, a heat processing method is effective with very consistent Ct values and a sensitivity of 96.2% when compared to a conventional RNA extraction method.

From 97 cases with all four samples, there were 24 with at least one positive result for viral infection. Some cases had multiple positive results and a total of 27 respiratory tract viruses were identified, of which rhinovirus, influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common. Seventeen of the 27 viral infections (63%) were identified in all four samples. However, in nearly all cases (96%) the nasopharyngeal swab detected the infective agent when the multiplex PCR panel had detected infection in any of the four sample types. A nasopharyngeal swab is considered to be an optimal sample for detection of respiratory tract viral infection.

The rising cases of new strains and resultant infection waves create an urgent need to assess the readiness of countries especially in Africa to mitigate the impact on community transmission. This paper delivers a brief synopsis of the novel SARS-CoV-2, emerging cases of new variants reported worldwide, and implications for genetic surveillance of disease transmission in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) especially Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature search used keywords like SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19 epidemiology; pandemic waves; corona outbreak, clinical syndromes, treatments, prevention and control. Cross-sectional and observational studies published on COVID-19 from 2019 till date of study provided main information sources. Databases such as Web of Science, Embase, PubMed and Google Scholar were utilised. MAIN FINDINGS: Over 220 countries have documented COVID-19 cases with varied severity till date. Before the spikes in resurgence, a highly virulent mutated (>90% fatality rate) novel strain of COVID-19 had been documented. There is very little data to ascertain the impact of the COVID-19 infection waves in LMICs. DISCUSSION: LMICs especially African countries still grapple with significant challenges like inefficient surveillance mechanisms, inadequate vaccination coverage, inadequate enforcement of environmental health strategies, poor health systems etc. Hence, Africas fate remains dicey in the face of the dynamic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 and other identified challenges.

Methods: A nationwide face-to-face survey was carried out using the discrete choice experiment method. The survey included 1200 consumers stratified by gender, age and region. Results: Heterogeneity analysis using the probabilistic segmentation model revealed three types of consumers: A price-sensitive segment, non-demanding consumers without specific preferences and selective consumers with a preference shifted toward specific Jalape?o characteristics. Thus, detail-oriented producers must compete through price strategies, based on the marketplace (markets on wheels, grocery stores, or supermarkets) and through some quality attributes preferred by selective consumers.

In this population-based cohort study, we estimated the BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against any PCR-confirmed (symptomatic or not) SARS-CoV-2 infections caused by the Delta and Omicron variant among adolescents (12-17-years-old) in Norway from August 2021 to January 2022. MethodsUsing Cox proportional hazard models, we estimated the BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against any Delta and Omicron infections. Vaccine status was included as a time-varying covariate and models were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, county of residence, country of birth, and living conditions. Data were obtained from the National Preparedness registry for COVID-19, which contains individual-level data from national health and administrative registries. FindingsVaccine effectiveness against Delta infection peaked at 68% (95%CI: 64-71%) and 62% (95%CI: 57- 66%) in days 21-48 after the first dose among 12-15-year-olds and 16-17-year-olds respectively. Among 16-17-year-olds that received two doses, vaccine effectiveness peaked at 93% (95%CI: 90-95%) in days 35-62 and declined to 84% (95%CI: 76-89%) in 63 days or more after the second dose. For both age-groups, we found no protection against Omicron infection after receiving one dose. Among 16-17-year-olds, vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infection peaked at 53% (95%CI: 43-62%) in 7-34 days after the second dose and decreased to 23% (95%CI: 3-40%) in 63 days or more after vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness decreased with time since vaccination for both variants, but waning was observed to occur faster for Omicron. InterpretationOur results suggest reduced protection from BNT162b2 vaccination against any SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the Omicron variant compared to the Delta. In addition, waning immunity was observed to occur faster for Omicron. The impact of vaccination among adolescents on reducing infection and thus transmission is limited during omicron dominance. FundingNo funding was received. Research in context Evidence before this studyBNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Spikevax, Moderna) vaccines have been approved for use in adolescents, based on results from randomized placebo-controlled trials demonstrating comparable immunogenicity and safety profile as in young adults. In addition, observational studies from Israel, the USA and England have reported high protection of BNT162b2 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 Delta infection among adolescents. These studies also reported decrease in effectiveness with time since last vaccine dose. Evidence on the effect of an extended interval between doses, longer time since vaccination and the effect against different variants is limited. When we first planned this study in early February 2022, no data were available regarding vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection among adolescents. To our knowledge when we completed this study and before submitting this article, only one study from England reported results in a preprint on vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection among adolescents. We searched for studies that evaluated vaccine efficacy or effectiveness after vaccination of adolescents during 2021-2022 in PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN. We searched for studies with several variations of the primary key search terms \\"COVID-19\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", and \\"vaccine\\" (including names of specific vaccines, as BNT162b2), \\"vaccine effectiveness\\", \\"adolescents\\", \\"children\\". Added value of this studyThe rapid increase in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the Omicron variant in highly vaccinated populations has raised concerns about the effectiveness of current vaccines in adults but also adolescents. In this population-based cohort study, we showed that the vaccine effectiveness against Omicron is lower than against Delta infections among adolescents, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. We should note that evidence suggests higher rates of asymptomatic carriage for Omicron than other variants of concern. Vaccine effectiveness that includes asymptomatic cases, as in the study from England, is expected to be lower than when including symptomatic cases only. We found that one and two doses of BNT162b2 among adolescents protected well against Delta. Vaccination provided high protection against Delta infections (>91%) among Norwegian 16-17-year-olds 7-62 days after the second dose. We found no protection against Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection after one vaccine dose, and moderate effectiveness after two doses (peaked at 53%) among the 16-17-year-olds. Moreover, waning immunity was observed to occur faster for Omicron. Implications of all the available evidenceBased on the available evidence, the vaccine effectiveness among adolescents is similar to that reported among adults, also with an extended period of 8-12 weeks between doses which was used in Norway. Protection is significantly lower against Omicron than Delta infections and immunity wanes faster against Omicron. The impact of vaccination among adolescents on reducing infection and thus transmission is limited during omicron dominance. Policies should take into account the impact of vaccination campaigns among adolescents and their primary objective. Vaccine effectiveness should be re-evaluated when other variants appear as they might have different outcomes as shown between Delta and Omicron infections.","output":"Vaccine effectiveness with BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine against reported SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron infection among adolescents, Norway, August 2021 to January 2022"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To identify global research trends in teleophthalmology, as well as productivity and its association with Human development index (HDI). METHODS: A cross-sectional study. The main outcome measures were publication count, citation count, and publications count per million populations. Bibliographic data were derived from the Web of Science website. HDI data were derived from Human Development Report [2020]. One-way ANOVA test was used to examine the association between HDI and the outcome measures. We studied the correlation between continuous variables using Spearman's. Bibliometric analysis software's VOSviewer and Citspace were used to analyse results and creating visualizing maps. RESULTS: The results retrieved 355 publications, one-third of them have been published in the year of the COVID-19 pandemic; (2020). The USA has contributed to one-half of all publications, and just five countries have contributed to about 90% of all records. Very high HDI countries had significantly more publications count per million populations, than high (p-value = 0.0047), medium (p-value = 0.0081) or low HDI countries (p-value = 0.002). The main themes are screening programmes, reliability, photography, COVID-19, access, artificial intelligence, and cost-effectiveness. The leading countries in terms of both publications and citation count are the USA and India.

This study assessed the risk perception of COVID-19 and practice of precautionary measures against its spread by primary care workers. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study of primary care workers in the General Practice Clinic (GPC) of University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH), Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa. A pretested self-administered semi-structured questionnaire was employed to obtain data on Socio-demographic characteristics, Risk perception of COVID-19, and Practice of precautionary measures from the respondents. Obtained data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). Chi-square test, Ordinal regression analysis and logistic regression analysis were performed. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Health Research Ethics Committee. RESULTS: Most respondents (39.6%) had moderate risk perception of COVID-19. High risk perception was more frequent in females than males (27.8 vs 11.9%; Chi-square test; p-value = 0.001). Majority (76.0%) of the respondents had good practice of precautionary measures against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Most HCWs surveyed in this study had moderate-risk perception of COVID-19 and good practice of precautionary measures. It is recommended that formal training and retraining on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) of infections, including COVID-19, should be regularly provided for all cadres of healthcare staff.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic: an assessment of risk perception and the implementation of precautionary measures in a group of primary care workers in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since 2007, many cases of fever, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia syndrome (FTLS) have emerged in Henan Province, China. Patient reports of tick bites suggested that infection could contribute to FTLS. Many tick-transmitted microbial pathogens were tested for by PCR/RT-PCR and/or indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). However, only 8% (24/285) of samples collected from 2007 to 2010 tested positive for human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), suggesting that other pathogens could be involved. Here, we used an unbiased metagenomic approach to screen and survey for microbes possibly associated with FTLS. BLASTx analysis of deduced protein sequences revealed that a novel bunyavirus (36% identity to Tehran virus, accession: HQ412604) was present only in sera from FTLS patients. A phylogenetic analysis further showed that, although closely related to Uukuniemi virus of the Phlebovirus genus, this virus was distinct. The candidate virus was examined for association with FTLS among samples collected from Henan province during 2007C2010. RT-PCR, viral cultures, and a seroepidemiologic survey were undertaken. RT-PCR results showed that 223 of 285 (78.24%) acute-phase serum samples contained viral RNA. Of 95 patients for whom paired acute and convalescent sera were available, 73 had serologic evidence of infection, with 52 seroconversions and 21 exhibiting a 4-fold increase in antibody titer to the virus. The new virus was isolated from patient acute-phase serum samples and named Henan Fever Virus (HNF virus). Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that the virus was a novel bunyavirus with genetic similarity to known bunyaviruses, and was most closely related to the Uukuniemi virus (34%, 24%, and 29% of maximum identity, respectively, for segment L, M, S at maximum query coverage). After the release of the GenBank sequences of SFTSV, we found that they were nearly identical (>99% identity). These results show that the novel bunyavirus (HNF virus) is strongly correlated with FTLS.","output":"Metagenomic Analysis of Fever, Thrombocytopenia and Leukopenia Syndrome (FTLS) in Henan Province,

reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province (1) The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a virus also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified by China in January 2020 On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and on March 11, it announced that COVID-19 could develop into a global pandemic (2-3) As of February 8, 2021, there had been 105,805,951 confirmed cases, 2,312,278 confirmed deaths, and 223 countries, areas or territories were effected (4) Through one years efforts, different countries around the world achieved varying results in pandemic control In some countries like China, the pandemic has been well controlled, while in other countries the situation is still grim China initiated a national campaign against COVID-19 immediately after identifying this new virus In around two months, the daily increase in domestic cases fell to single digits;and in approximately three months, a decisive victory was secured in the battle to defend Hubei Province and its capital city of Wuhan (5) The overarching strategy was early containment, and the key was active case identification and management (6) Four Earlies (early detection, early reporting, early isolation/quarantine, and early treatment) were the primary requirements for the implementation of all control measures All communities, organizations and citizens were mobilized to participate in pandemic prevention and control (7-8) Then a suppression strategy was implemented by establishing a strong and flexible response mechanism, implementing, or lifting control measures based on the results of surveillance and risk assessment in different regions Now we have entered the late stage of suppression In the winter and spring season of 2020C2021, large-scale local outbreaks were detected in the rural areas of Hebei, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, and more than 2,000 cases were reported in total (9-10) After unremitting efforts of containment and suppression, the local outbreaks were successfully controlled As of January 2021, more than 230 COVID-19 candidate vaccines had been in clinical or pre-clinical development globally (11), including inactivated or live virus vaccines, virus vectored vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines (mRNA and DNA), virus-like particles, and nanoparticles, each having discrete advantages and shortcomings China has chosen 5 platforms to develop COVID-19 vaccines As of February 3, 2021, 31 million doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines had been administered in China, targeting high-risk groups, including healthcare/frontline personnel, essential workers who are critical to maintain the social performance, cold-chain industry employees and people working or studying overseas (12) As vaccination started smoothly and progressed as scheduled, China CDC has been closely monitoring vaccination coverage and adverse events following immunization (AEFI) The data shows that the reported rate of serious adverse events is no higher than that of the influenza vaccine, reflecting the fact that the currently used inactivated COVID-19 vaccines (13) are safe This is because the Chinese government has always made the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines a priority and the Chinese vaccine manufactures are pushing forward vaccine development in strict scientific and regulatory process;2021 will be a year of vaccination against COVID-19 among broad populations based on the strategy of prioritization COVID-19 vaccines have raised hope of reducing infected cases and virus transmission and getting life back to normal soon Looking into the future, there will still be many uncertainties in 2021 One of them is that the COVID-19 pandemic might become a lasting epidemic or endemic Furthermore, many new characteristics of COVID-19 have been reported, such as long-term sequelae, reinfection, reoccurrence of viral RNA, and long-time or intermittent latency Therefore, although we have developed vaccines, there are still many uncertainties The emergence of new virus variants of concern (VOC) leading to increased transmissibility and deteriorating epidemiological situations have brought greater challenges, leaving us a lot of work to do When facing a new virus, mankind still needs to keep doing research and develop a deeper understanding of it Our sincere gratitude goes to the 15 internationally renowned health experts who we invited to give their comments on the COVID-19

These workers are mostly middle-aged women and racial/ethnic minorities who typically earn low wages. Despite being integral to patient care, these workers are often neglected by the medical community and society at large; thus, developing a health care system capable of addressing the COVID-19 crisis and future pandemics requires a better understanding of the experiences of home health care workers. Objective: To understand the experiences of home health care workers caring for patients in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: From March to April 2020, a qualitative study with 1-to-1 semistructured interviews of 33 home health care workers in New York City was conducted in partnership with the 1199SEIU Home Care Industry Education Fund, a benefit fund of the 1199 Service Employees International Union United Healthcare Workers East, the largest health care union in the US. Purposeful sampling was used to identify and recruit home health care workers. Main Outcomes and Measures: Audio-recorded interviews were professionally transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory. Major themes and subthemes were identified. Results: In total, 33 home health care workers employed by 24 unique home care agencies across the 5 boroughs of New York City participated. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 47.6 (14.0) years, 32 (97%) were women, 21 (64%) were Black participants, and 6 (18%) were Hispanic participants. Five major themes emerged: home health care workers (1) were on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic but felt invisible; (2) reported a heightened risk for virus transmission; (3) received varying amounts of information, supplies, and training from their home care agencies; (4) relied on nonagency alternatives for support, including information and supplies; and (5) were forced to make difficult trade-offs in their work and personal lives. Conclusions and Relevance: In this qualitative analysis, home health care workers reported providing frontline essential care, often at personal risk, during the COVID-19 pandemic. They experienced challenges that exacerbated the inequities they face as a marginalized workforce. Interventions and policies to better support these frontline health care professionals are urgently needed.","output":"Experiences of Home Health Care Workers in New York City During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Qualitative Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine was adopted to minimize exposure risks for patients and staff during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This study measured patient satisfaction and telemedicine usability in breast cancer care. METHODS: Adult breast cancer patients who had a telemedicine visit at a single academic institution (with surgical, radiation, or medical oncology) from 15 June 2020 to 4 September 2020 were surveyed anonymously. Patient and cancer characteristics were collected, and patient satisfaction and telemedicine usability were assessed using a modified Telehealth Usability Questionnaire with a 7-point Likert scale. Associations of satisfaction and usability with patient characteristics were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sum and KruskalCWallis tests. RESULTS: Of 203 patients who agreed to be contacted, 78 responded, yielding a response rate of 38%. The median age of the respondents was 63 years (range 25C83 years). The majority lived in an urban area (61%), were white (92%), and saw a medical oncologist (62%). The median patient satisfaction score was 5.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 4.25C6.25). The median telemedicine usability score was 5.6 (IQR 4.4C6.2). A strong positive correlation was seen between satisfaction and usability, with a Spearman correlation coefficient () of 0.80 (p < 0.001). Satisfaction and usability scores did not vary significantly according to patient age, race, location of residence, insurance status, previous visit commute time, oncology specialty seen, prior telemedicine visits, or whether patients were actively receiving cancer treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer patients were satisfied with telemedicine and found it usable. Patient satisfaction and telemedicine usability should not limit the use of telemedicine in future post-pandemic breast cancer care.

The findings of this study can be used to improve support for those quarantined or isolated and to develop strategies to reduce the stigma associated with coronavirus and COVID-19. METHODS: The study is based on qualitative one-to-one interviews with households with at least two members and at least one PCR confirmed COVID-19 case. Recruitment took place via website or SMS messages sent to PCR confirmed cases in the capital area of Helsinki. Sampling was based on maximum variation to acquire different types of respondents. The framework of health stigma was used to develop question guides and analyze stigma. Quarantine and isolation experiences were explored through open-ended questions. The analysis was based on thematic analysis. RESULTS: The study included 64 participants from 24 households. Perceived stigma among respondents was driven by fear and blame for infection, and it manifested in various ways leading to a reluctance to disclose their coronavirus status to others. Self-stigma developed from conflicting information and advice about coronavirus and COVID-19 led to difficulties interacting with others outside of the house and reluctance to meet people after quarantine and isolation. Quarantine and isolation experiences included uncertainty, health concerns, and boredom. Communication with others in similar situations was perceived vital, whereas discussions with family members about worries and fears related to coronavirus and COVID-19 was not preferred.

Initially care home-residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and adults from age 80 were targeted. In phase 3 trials, BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1nCoV-19 demonstrated 95% and 70% efficacy, respectively, after two doses against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, few data exist regarding the effectiveness of these vaccines in elderly frail people. Evaluation following implementation to determine the effectiveness of one dose in reducing hospitalisations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in elderly adults is urgent.Methods: A prospective single-centre test-negative design case-control study of adults aged 80 years hospitalised with COVID-19 disease or other acute respiratory disease. We conducted logistic regression controlling for time (week), gender, index of multiple deprivations (IMD), and care residency status (CRS), and sensitivity analyses matched for time and gender using a conditional logistic model adjusting for IMD and CRS.Findings: First dose vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 was 71.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 46.5-90.6).

Vitamin D deficiency, notably common in Black and Brown people and elderly, is associated with an increased susceptibility to many of the diseases comorbid with COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency can cause over-activation of the pulmonary renin-angiotensin system (RAS) leading to the respiratory syndrome. RAS is regulated in part at least by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which also acts as a primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells. Hence, vitamin D deficiency can exacerbate COVID-19, via its effects on ACE2.

Polymyxins are considered as last-resort drugs for CRAB infections, but there is still controversy regarding the efficacy and safety of polymyxins based therapies in CRAB infections. The present systematic review was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of polymyxins based therapies versus non-polymyxins based therapies in CRAB infections. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov to identify eligible studies reporting the clinical outcomes of patients with CRAB infections. The meta-analysis employed a random-effects model to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary outcome was 1-month mortality for any cause. We also examined clinical response, microbiological response, length of stay in hospital, and adverse events. RESULTS: Eleven eligible studies were analyzed (1052 patients in total), including 2 randomized clinical trials. Serious risk of bias was found in 8 out of the 11 studies. There was no statistically significant difference between polymyxins based therapies and non-polymyxins based therapies in 1-month mortality for any cause (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.53), microbiological response (OR, 3.83; 95% CI, 0.90 to 16.29) and length of stay in hospital (SMD, 0.24; 95% CI, ? 0.08 to 0.56). The pooled OR of clinical response indicated a significant difference in favor of polymyxin based therapies (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.31 to 3.03). The pooled OR of adverse events showed that non-polymyxins based therapies were associated with fewer adverse events (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 1.39 to 13.48). CONCLUSION: The performance of polymyxins based therapies was better than non-polymyxin based therapies in clinical response rate and similar to non-polymyxin based therapies in terms of 1-month mortality and microbiological response in treating CRAB infections. Due to the limitations of our study, we cannot draw a firm conclusion on the optimal treatment of CRAB infections, but polymyxins would be a relatively effective treatment for CRAB infections.

In particular, we aimed at examining the scope of the frameworks and the content of included constructs (e.g., referring to implementation processes, determinants, or implementation evaluation), the level at which these constructs operate (e.g., the individual level, the organizational/community level), relationships between the constructs, and the inclusion of equity factors. METHODS: A systematic review (the PROSPERO registration no. CRD42019133251) was conducted using 9 databases and 8 stakeholder websites. The content of 38 policy implementation frameworks was coded and analyzed. RESULTS: Across the frameworks, 47.4% (18 in 38) addressed three aims: description of the process, determinants, and the evaluation of implementation. The majority of frameworks (65.8%; 25 in 38) accounted for constructs from three levels: individual, organizational/community, and the system level. System-level constructs were included less often (76.3%; 29 in 38) than individual-level or organizational/community-level constructs (86.8% [33 in 38 frameworks] and 94.7% [36 in 38 frameworks] respectively). The majority of frameworks (84.2%, 32 in 38) included at least some sections that were solely of descriptive character (a list of unassociated constructs); 50.0% (19 in 38) included sections of prescriptive character (general steps of implementation); 60.5% (23 in 38) accounted for explanatory sections (assuming bi- or uni-directorial associations). The complex system approach was accounted for only in 21.1% (8 in 38) of frameworks. More than half (55.3%; 21 in 38) of frameworks did not account for any equity constructs (e.g., socioeconomic status, culture). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of policy implementation frameworks have two or three aims (combining processes, determinants and/or the evaluation of implementation), include multi-level constructs (although the system-level determinants are less frequently included than those from the individual- or organizational/community-level), combine sections of purely descriptive character with sections accounting for prescriptive and/or explanatory associations, and are likely to include a little or no equity constructs.

Women's changing lifestyles and increasing lifespan make it difficult to pinpoint the factors affecting their well-being during menopause, warranting continuous research in this field. Therefore, this study developed a structural equation model, based on the transactional model of stress and coping, to test the significance of positive and negative factors associated with psychological health during menopause. METHODS This study validated a structural equation model based on the empirical data collected using a cross-sectional study. We analyzed 300 questionnaire responses completed between May 15 and July 10, 2020, by South Korean middle-aged women (aged 45-60 y) who agreed to participate. The study's structural equation model used self-efficacy as an exogenous variable and perceived stress, menopausal management, self-compassion, menopausal symptoms, and psychological well-being as endogenous variables. Educational and economic levels were set as control variables. RESULTS We observed statistical support for 9 out of 10 hypotheses; the predictor variables had an explanatory power of 79.5% for psychological well-being. Self-efficacy was positively associated with the psychological well-being of middle-aged menopausal women and appeared to be mediated by perceived stress, menopausal management, menopausal symptoms, and self-compassion. CONCLUSIONS To improve the psychological well-being of middle-aged women, it is important to increase their self-efficacy and minimize stress. Moreover, managing menopausal symptoms and increasing self-compassion through effective coping may maximize psychological well-being.

We have taken advantage of an unusual mutation in the C. elegans Hox gene lin-39, lin-39(ccc16), which transforms neuronal fates in the C. elegans male ventral nerve cord in a manner that depends on a second Hox gene, mab-5. We have performed a genetic analysis centered around this homeotic allele of lin-39 in conjunction with reporters for neuronal target genes and protein interaction assays to explore how LIN-39 and MAB-5 exert both flexibility and specificity in target regulation. We identify cis-regulatory modules in neuronal reporters that are both region-specific and Hox-responsive. Using these reporters of neuronal subtype, we also find that the lin-39(ccc16) mutation disrupts neuronal fates specifically in the region where lin-39 and mab-5 are coexpressed, and that the protein encoded by lin-39(ccc16) is active only in the absence of mab-5. Moreover, the fates of neurons typical to the region of lin-39-mab-5 coexpression depend on both Hox genes. Our genetic analysis, along with evidence from Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) protein interaction assays, supports a model in which LIN-39 and MAB-5 act at an array of cis regulatory modules to cooperatively activate and to individually activate or repress neuronal gene expression, resulting in regionally specific neuronal fates.","output":"Hox proteins interact to pattern neuronal subtypes in C. elegans males."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory tract infections account for high morbidity and mortality around the world. Fragile patients are at high risk of developing complications such as pneumonia and may die from it.

Clinical and laboratory data from hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections during the period October 2016-March 2019 were analysed. The retrospective analysis included 17 viral agents detected by FilmArray test and clinical data from medical records and hospital discharge sheets. Models were adjusted for relevant confounders such as clinical severity and risk of death, socio-demographic characteristics and surgical procedures. From a total of 539 specimens analysed, 180 (33.39%) were positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Among them, 83 (46.1 %) were positive for influenza viruses (FLU), 36 (20%) rhino/enteroviruses (RHV/EV), 17 (9.44%) human coronaviruses (HCOV-229E, -HKU1, -NL63, and -OC43), 17 (9.44%) respiratory syncytial virus, 15 (8.33%) human metapneumovirus (HMPV), 8 (4.44%) parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and 4 (2.22%) adenoviruses (ADV).

Sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and idiopathic acute facial paralysis (Bell's palsy) are otologic emergencies that are frequently encountered by otorhinolaryngology specialists. Although there are many articles describing SSNHL and Bell's palsy in the literature, the literature describing their relationship to COVID-19 is limited. In our study, we aimed to present the neuro-otologic relationship of SSNHL and Bell's palsy with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The pretreatment real-time oronasopharyngeal PCR tests, COVID-19 symptomatology and COVID-19 infection statuses of patients who presented to our clinic with isolated SSNHL and Bell's palsy between April 2020 and April 2021 were questioned, and the data of the patients were collected. Throughout their treatment, the patients were followed-up in terms of COVID-19 infection. This is a prospective study. Moreover, to observe the change in the incidence, the data of patients visiting between January 2019 and January 2020 were also collected. The data of the patients were statistically analyzed using SPSS. RESULTS: The study included a total of 177 patients. The SSNHL group consisted of 91 patients, and the Bell's palsy group consisted of 86 patients. Neither group showed a statistically significant difference in comparison to the year without the pandemic in terms of the patient numbers (incidence), sex, age, morbidity, response to treatment or social habits. There was a statistically significant difference in age only in the Bell's palsy group, but this difference was not medically significant. CONCLUSION: As a result of our study, we did not observe a relationship between COVID-19 and cases of SSNHL and Bell's palsy.

Tools to identify patients suitable for community-based management are urgently needed. MethodsWe prospectively recruited adults presenting to two hospitals in India with moderate symptoms of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in order to develop and validate a clinical prediction model to rule-out progression to supplemental oxygen requirement. The primary outcome was defined as any of the following: SpO2 < 94%; respiratory rate > 30 bpm; SpO2/FiO2 < 400; or death. We specified a priori that each model would contain three clinical parameters (age, sex and SpO2) and one of seven shortlisted biochemical biomarkers measurable using near-patient tests (CRP, D-dimer, IL-6, NLR, PCT, sTREM-1 or suPAR), to ensure the models would be suitable for resource-limited settings. We evaluated discrimination, calibration and clinical utility of the models in a temporal external validation cohort. Findings426 participants were recruited, of whom 89 (21{middle dot}0%) met the primary outcome. 257 participants comprised the development cohort and 166 comprised the validation cohort. The three models containing NLR, suPAR or IL-6 demonstrated promising discrimination (c-statistics: 0{middle dot}72 to 0{middle dot}74) and calibration (calibration slopes: 1{middle dot}01 to 1{middle dot}05) in the validation cohort, and provided greater utility than a model containing the clinical parameters alone. InterpretationWe present three clinical prediction models that could help clinicians identify patients with moderate COVID-19 suitable for community-based management. The models are readily implementable and of particular relevance for locations with limited resources. FundingMedecins Sans Frontieres, India. RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA living systematic review by Wynants et al. identified 137 COVID-19 prediction models, 47 of which were derived to predict whether patients with COVID-19 will have an adverse outcome. Most lacked external validation, relied on retrospective data, did not focus on patients with moderate disease, were at high risk of bias, and were not practical for use in resource-limited settings. To identify promising biochemical biomarkers which may have been evaluated independently of a prediction model and therefore not captured by this review, we searched PubMed on 1 June 2020 using synonyms of \\"SARS-CoV-2\\" AND [\\"biomarker\\" OR \\"prognosis\\"]. We identified 1,214 studies evaluating biochemical biomarkers of potential value in the prognostication of COVID-19 illness. In consultation with FIND (Geneva, Switzerland) we shortlisted seven candidates for evaluation in this study, all of which are measurable using near-patient tests which are either currently available or in late-stage development. Added value of this studyWe followed the TRIPOD guidelines to develop and validate three promising clinical prediction models to help clinicians identify which patients presenting with moderate COVID-19 can be safely managed in the community. Each model contains three easily ascertained clinical parameters (age, sex, and SpO2) and one biochemical biomarker (NLR, suPAR or IL-6), and would be practical for implementation in high-patient-throughput low resource settings. The models showed promising discrimination and calibration in the validation cohort. The inclusion of a biomarker test improved prognostication compared to a model containing the clinical parameters alone, and extended the range of contexts in which such a tool might provide utility to include situations when bed pressures are less critical, for example at earlier points in a COVID-19 surge. Implications of all the available evidencePrognostic models should be developed for clearly-defined clinical use-cases. We report the development and temporal validation of three clinical prediction models to rule-out progression to supplemental oxygen requirement amongst patients presenting with moderate COVID-19. The models are readily implementable and should prove useful in triage and resource allocation.

To elucidate the nutritional regulation of adipogenic TN from diets containing different sources of fatty acids (saturated, n-6, n-3) in adipocytes, we cloned the coding region of porcine TN from a cDNA library and analyzed tissue expressions in weaned piglets fed with 2% soybean oil (SB, enriched in n-6 fatty acids), docosahexaenoic acid oil (DHA, an n-3 fatty acid) or beef tallow (BT, enriched in saturated and n-9 fatty acids) for 30 d. Compared with tissues in the BT- or SB-fed group, expression of TN was reduced in the adipose, liver and lung tissues from the DHA-fed group, accompanied with lowered plasma levels of triglycerides and cholesterols. This in vivo reduction was also confirmed in porcine primary differentiated adipocytes supplemented with DHA in vitro. Then, promoter analysis was performed. A 1956-bp putative porcine TN promoter was cloned and transcription binding sites for sterol regulatory-element binding protein (SREBP)-1c or forkhead box O proteins (FoxO) were predicted on the TN promoter. Mutating binding sites on porcine TN promoters showed that transcriptional suppression of TN by DHA on promoter activity was dependent on specific response elements for SREBP-1c or FoxO. The inhibited luciferase promoter activity by DHA on the TN promoter coincides with reduced gene expression of TN, SREBP-1c, and FoxO1 in human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells supplemented with DHA. To conclude, our current study demonstrated that the adipogenic TN was negatively regulated by nutritional modulation of DHA both in pigs in vivo and in humans/pigs in vitro. The transcriptional suppression by DHA on TN expression was partly through SREBP-1c or FoxO. Therefore, down-regulation of adipogenic tetranectin associated with fibrinolysis and adipogenesis may contribute to the beneficial effects of DHA on ameliorating obesity-induced metabolic syndromes such as atherosclerosis and adipose dysfunctions.","output":"Docosahexaenoic Acid Suppresses Expression of Adipogenic Tetranectin through Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein and Forkhead Box O Protein in Pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Este artculo busc identificar el efecto que tuvo la implementacin del aislamiento social preventivo obligatorio en las dinmicas de seguridad y convivencia de Medelln, Colombia.

Since these processes are involved in COVID-19 infection, acute hemolytic anemia, a severe complication of the G6PDD, can occur in these patients. In this context, the role of HCQ, usually effective, safe, and well tolerated in G6PD deficient patients, must be redefined in these patients with COVID-19.As consequence, answering the question: \\"Hydroxychloroquine: Culprit or Innocent Bystander in G6PD-Deficient Patients with COVID-19?\\", we state that it is risky to believe that HCQ may be an \\"innocent bystander\\" in G6PD-deficient COVID-19 patients.","output":"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and hydroxychloroquine in the COVID-19 era: a mini review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To navigate the unchartered terrain that has resulted from the pandemic, there is a palpable need for hotels to re-assess current business practices, and quickly devise new and innovative strategies that safeguard the health and safety of guests as well as employees and, consequently, restore consumer confidence The objective of this article is to assess the utility of these new innovations by looking at shareholders' perceptions The empirical application shows that the innovations implemented are seen as effective, although differential effects exist among innovation types The results could help hotels sustain and expand the innovative responses that work (among which product innovations stand out), and discontinue those that are less effective","output":"HOTELS' COVID-19 innovation and performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of COVID-19, which has affected the international healthcare systems since the beginning of 2020.

In Veneto, health personnel tested both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects, while in Lombardy only symptomatic cases were investigated. We analyzed the evolution of the epidemic in these regions and showed that testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases is a more effective strategy to mitigate the epidemic impact. We strongly recommend that decision-makers: ensure early isolation of symptomatic patients and rapid identification of their contacts; maximize testing rapidly, especially among people with multiple daily contacts with infected populations, high exposure to the public in essential services; rapidly increase diagnostic capacity by mobilizing trained personnel capable of performing rRT-PCR on respiratory samples; equip the population with protective masks.","output":"The COVID-19 infection: lessons from the Italian experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: At present, the COVID-19 pandemic remains the most pressing global health issue. Given the significant amount of public awareness, the infection rate and rehabilitation efforts are governed not only by the compliance of transmission mitigation strategies but also by the understanding of coexisting diseases and COVID-19 in patients with chronic infectious diseases. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the differences in demographics, as well as awareness, risk perception, and emotional reactions, among imprisoned drug addicts with and without tuberculosis (TB) regarding their perceptions of and feelings toward the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary goal of the study was also to measure how the psychological health and nutritional indices of the drug addicts with TB changed during their ongoing rehabilitation. Methods: A total of 265 male drug addicts, 45 of which were positive for TB and another 220 who were negative, were selected as subjects from a mandatory detoxification and rehabilitation center (MDRC). Data were collected through a combination of questionnaires (questions regarding COVID-19 awareness, emotional knowledge and responses, and SCL-90 tests), anthropometric examination, and laboratory blood tests, with which inferential and descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Results: During a period of 1 week in early 2021, the differences in the accuracy of the responses from the questions probing the awareness of COVID-19 symptoms, transmission, susceptible populations, what kind of mask should be worn, and preventive measures between TB addicts to non-TB addicts were 11.11 vs. 60.45%, 57.78 vs. 77.27%, 66.67 vs. 78.64%, 97.98 vs. 97.73%, and 93.33 vs. 65.91%, respectively. In the risk perception and emotional reaction sections of the questionnaire, there was a significant difference in the responses to What you were more worried about was? (p < 0.001) and Alteration in your mood since the outbreak? (p = 0.002) between the two cohorts. In the section assessing the 10 dimensions of the SCL-90 scale, there were significant differences between the TB addicts and the Chinese norm. In addition, the BMI (21.06  2.65 kg/m(2)) and total serum protein (77.14  6.12 g/L) levels of the TB addicts were normal, but the serum hemoglobin (117.02  4.97 g/L) and albumin (42.08  1.81 g/L) levels were significantly lower in the TB addicts compared to the norm (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic we are facing is both an epidemiologic and a psychological crisis. However, while the COVID-19 epidemic will eventually disappear (or become manageable, similar to the flu), the TB epidemic may still persist. To avoid the deleterious consequences of multiple simultaneous epidemics, complementary response measures to COVID-19 and TB can help curb the exacerbation of both situations and, therefore, save lives.

Our study aims to examine the incidence and risk factors of SPI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center study of adult COVID-19 patients with radiographic evidence of pneumonia admitted to a regional tertiary care hospital. SPI was defined as microorganisms identified on the respiratory tract with or without concurrent positive blood culture results for the same microorganism obtained at least 48 hours after admission. RESULTS: Thirteen out of 244 (5%) had developed SPI during hospitalization. The median of the nadir lymphocyte count during hospitalization was significantly lower in patients with SPI as compared to those without SPI [0.4 K/uL (IQR 0.3-0.5) versus 0.6 K/uL (IQR 0.3-0.9)]. Patients with lower nadir lymphocyte had an increased risk of developing SPI with odds ratio (OR) of 1.21 (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.47, p=0.04) per 0.1 K/uL decrement in nadir lymphocyte. The baseline median inflammatory markers of CRP [166.4 mg/L vs. 100.0 mg/L, p=0.01] and D-dimer (18.5 mg/L vs. 1.4 mg/L, p<0.01), and peak procalcitonin (1.4 ng/mL vs. 0.3 ng/mL, p<0.01) and CRP (273.5 mg/L vs. 153.7 mg/L, p<0.01) during hospitalization were significantly higher in SPI group. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SPI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 5%. Lower nadir median lymphocyte count during hospitalization was associated with an increased OR of developing SPI.

Aims We studied the correlation of IgG anti BP180 and anti BP230 antibody titer with disease severity and clinical features in bullous pemphigoid. Settings and Design This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care center in western India. Materials and Methods Forty-two clinically diagnosed treatment-naive cases of bullous pemphigoid were enrolled and investigated with skin punch biopsy, IgG anti BP180, and anti BP230 ELISA, direct immunofluorescence, and indirect immunofluorescence tests. Disease severity was assessed by calculating modified Autoimmune Bullous Skin Disorder Intensity Score (ABSIS) score. Thirty patients with a final diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid were included in the statistical analysis. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was used to study correlation. Results The mean ABSIS skin score was 32.81 when both tests were negative, 42.13 when only BP230 was positive, 76.28 when only BP180 was positive, and 78.16 when both were positive. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) for BP180 and ABSIS skin score was 0.6 (P value: 0.0005), and for BP230 was -0.055 (P value: 0.600).

However, each technology has its own drawbacks. It is difficult to balance the advantages and disadvantages of these internet technologies and identify an optimal solution for the development of medical imaging apps. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to compare different internet platform technologies for remotely viewing radiological images and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. METHODS Oracle Java, Adobe Flash, and HTML5 were each used to develop a comprehensive web-based medical imaging app that connected to a medical image server and provided several required functions for radiological interpretation (eg, navigation, magnification, windowing, and fly-through). Java-, Flash-, and HTML5-based medical imaging apps were tested on different operating systems over a local area network and a wide area network. Three computed tomography colonography data sets and 2 ordinary personal computers were used in the experiment. RESULTS The experimental results demonstrated that Java-, Flash-, and HTML5-based apps had the ability to provide real-time 2D functions. However, for 3D, performances differed between the 3 apps. The Java-based app had the highest frame rate of volume rendering. However, it required the longest time for surface rendering and failed to run surface rendering in macOS. The HTML5-based app had the fastest surface rendering and the highest speed for fly-through without platform dependence. Volume rendering, surface rendering, and fly-through performances of the Flash-based app were significantly worse than those of the other 2 apps. CONCLUSIONS Oracle Java, Adobe Flash, and HTML5 have individual strengths in the development of remote access medical imaging apps.

At Boston Medical Center (BMC), a regional safety net hospital, the Department of Surgery created a dedicated, COVID-19 Procedure Team to ease the burden on other providers coping with the surge of infected patients. As restrictions on social distancing are lifted, health systems are bracing for additional surges in COVID-19 cases. Our objective is to quantify the volume and types of procedures performed, review outcomes, and highlight lessons for other institutions that may need to establish similar teams. STUDY DESIGN: Procedures were tracked prospectively along with patient demographics, immediate complications, and time from donning to doffing of the personal protective equipment (PPE). Retrospective chart review was conducted to obtain patient outcomes and delayed adverse events. We hypothesized that a dedicated, surgeon-led team would perform invasive bedside procedures expeditiously and with few complications. RESULTS: From March 30 to April 30, 2020, there were 1,196 COVID-19 admissions. The Procedure Team performed 272 procedures on 125 patients, including placement of 135 arterial catheters, 107 central venous catheters, 25 hemodialysis catheters, and 4 thoracostomy tubes. Specific to central venous access, the average procedural time was 47 minutes, and the rate of immediate complications was 1.5%, including 1 arterial cannulation and 1 pneumothorax. CONCLUSIONS: Procedural complication rate was less than rates reported in the literature. The team saved approximately 192 hours of work that could be re-directed to other patient care needs.

This concept of CIoT is best suited to this pandemic as every person is to be connected and monitored through a massive network that requires efficient spectrum management. METHODS: An extensive literature survey is conducted in the Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, Research Gate, and IEEE Xplore databases using the terms COVID-19\\" and Cognitive IoT or Corona virus and IoMT. The latest data and inputs from official websites and reports are used for further investigation and analysis of the application areas. RESULTS: This review encompasses different novel applications of CIoMT for fighting the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis. The CR based dynamic spectrum allocation technique is the solution for accommodating a massive number of devices and a wide number of applications. The CIoMT platform enables real-time tracking, remote health monitoring, rapid diagnosis of the cases, contact tracking, clustering, screening, and surveillance thus, reducing the workload on the medical industry for prevention and control of the infection. The challenges and future research directions are also identified.

The Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA), primarily serving as an ion transporter, also regulates epithelial barrier function via modulation of tight junctions. However, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we show that overexpression of the NKA ?1 subunit upregulates the expression of tight junction proteins, leading to increased alveolar epithelial barrier function by an ion transport-independent mechanism. Using IP and mass spectrometry, we identified a number of unknown protein interactions of the ?1 subunit, including a top candidate, myotonic dystrophy kinase-related cdc42-binding kinase &#945; (MRCK&#945;), which is a protein kinase known to regulate peripheral actin formation. Using a doxycycline-inducible gene expression system, we demonstrated that MRCK&#945; and its downstream activation of myosin light chain is required for the regulation of alveolar barrier function by the NKA ?1 subunit. Importantly, MRCK&#945; is expressed in both human airways and alveoli and has reduced expression in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a lung illness that can be caused by multiple direct and indirect insults, including the infection of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. Our results have elucidated a potentially novel mechanism by which NKA regulates epithelial tight junctions and have identified potential drug targets for treating ARDS and other pulmonary diseases that are caused by barrier dysfunction.","output":"The Na+, K+-ATPase ?1 subunit regulates epithelial tight junctions via MRCK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to assess the COVID-19 seroprevalence in HCW at the Hospital Central de la Defensa Gmez Ulla (HCDGU) (Madrid).

Employees were classified according to their exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection as high, moderate, and low exposure groups (level 1, level 2, and level 3, respectively). A specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was run to diagnose each patient, whereas the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was performed by means of an immunoassay. In total, 2781 HCW were screened. From this sample, 30 employees (1.1%) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 450 (16.2%) were positive to SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. The seroprevalence was higher in the high exposure group.The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among employees without any COVID-19 training was higher than in those who received COVID-19 training (14.5% vs 18.6%, P = 0.035).

This study specifically investigates the association between family history of alcohol problems (FHAP) and family history of depression (FHD), and how these relate to different clusters of depressive symptoms. Methods: Correlations between FHAP and FHD and different clusters of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were studied. We sampled 333 employees from a general hospital who had been receiving a psychiatric consultation between 2005 and 2012. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were conducted to explore these correlations. Results: There was a significant positive correlation between FHAP and BDI affective score. This result remained significant even after the adjustment for other variables considered as important factors for MDD, such as gender, age, marital status, education, ethnic group and FHD. More specifically, FHAP was correlated with dissatisfaction and episodes of crying among the affective symptoms. FHAP showed no statistical difference in any of the other clusters score or in the BDI total score. Moreover, as expected, we found a correlation between FHD and BDI total score and Somatic and Cognitive clusters. Conclusion: FHAP should be routinely investigated in individuals presenting with depressive symptoms. This is especially important in cases presenting with dissatisfaction and episodes of crying in patients who do not endorse criteria for MDD.

While 73.9% of study subjects displayed clinical lymphocytopenia upon hospital admission, a significant reduction of CD4 or CD8 T-cell frequency was found in all asymptomatic, symptomatic, and convalescent cases. CD4 and CD8 T cells with increased MD were found in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients within the first week of symptom onset.

To ensure that the undergraduate teaching curriculum does not become another victim of the virus, online teaching was started in most medical schools. The undergraduate students enrolled in our institution hail mostly from rural areas and small townships with limited internet connectivity and accessibility due to poor socioeconomic status. This study highlights the students perception of and motivation towards online classes in respect to internet connectivity and accessibility during COVID-19 pandemic. Since online teaching is essentially a student-centered learning approach, the motivational level of students plays an important role in making teaching protocols effective. METHODS: A prospective qualitative and quantitative assessment of perceptions of 498 medical undergraduate students from 1st, 2nd and 3rd year of Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Vibhuti Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India was done using validated online questionnaires and anonymous voluntary feedback during the government-imposed lockdown from March 2020 to November 2020. RESULTS: On evaluation of 260 responses received, it was found that the majority of students were motivated to attend the online classes but external factors like internet connectivity and household environment were affecting their motivation on a daily basis and thus decreasing the motivation levels. Validity of feedback by Cronbachs alpha was 0.907 and Pearson coefficient between internet connectivity and motivation factors was 0.419 (p-value <0.001). CONCLUSION: The extrinsic factors of internet connectivity and household environment hamper the motivation of students to attend online classes; this should be considered as an important factor to enable the desired student-led learning as mandated by competency-based medical education.","output":"Assessing the Role of Internal Motivation and Extrinsic Factors on Online Undergraduate Medical Teaching in a Resource-Poor Setting During Covid-19 Pandemic in North India: An Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Selenium is a trace element essential to human health largely because of its incorporation into selenoproteins that have a wide range of protective functions. Selenium has an ongoing history of reducing the incidence and severity of various viral infections; for example, a German study found selenium status to be significantly higher in serum samples from surviving than non-surviving COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, a significant, positive, linear association was found between the cure rate of Chinese patients with COVID-19 and regional selenium status. Moreover, the cure rate continued to rise beyond the selenium intake required to optimise selenoproteins, suggesting that selenoproteins are probably not the whole story. Nonetheless, the significantly reduced expression of a number of selenoproteins, including those involved in controlling ER stress, along with increased expression of IL-6 in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in culture suggests a potential link between reduced selenoprotein expression and COVID-19-associated inflammation. In this comprehensive review, we describe the history of selenium in viral infections and then go on to assess the potential benefits of adequate and even supra-nutritional selenium status. We discuss the indispensable function of the selenoproteins in coordinating a successful immune response and follow by reviewing cytokine excess, a key mediator of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19, and its relationship to selenium status. We comment on the fact that the synthetic redox-active selenium compound, ebselen, has been found experimentally to be a strong inhibitor of the main SARS-CoV-2 protease that enables viral maturation within the host. That finding suggests that redox-active selenium species formed at high selenium intake might hypothetically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteases. We consider the tactics that SARS-CoV-2 could employ to evade an adequate host response by interfering with the human selenoprotein system. Recognition of the myriad mechanisms by which selenium might potentially benefit COVID-19 patients provides a rationale for randomised, controlled trials of selenium supplementation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Selenium and selenoproteins in viral infection with potential relevance to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted healthcare education and delivery, including both theory and practice learning.

ZINC101291108 (lead 1) and ZINC16449029 (lead 2) were identified as potent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors with IC(50) values of 0.085 M and 0.063 M, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations (MD) were carried out for lead 1, 2 and several reported SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Analysis results of the simulations confirmed the stability of both compounds and showed that they adopted two confirmations along the simulation period. The per-residue decomposition results revealed that the key residues involved in inhibitor binding were E167, P247, P248, Y264, Y268 and Q269. H-bond analyses showed H-bonds with G266 and N267 and salt bridges with G209 and Y273, which are essential for strengthening the substrate-binding pocket. Both inhibitors showed hydrophobic interactions with the S4 site and BL2 loop residues. The RMSD of the BL2 loop with the two inhibitors was investigated, and the results showed that the Y268 and Q269 BL2 loop residues moved outward to accommodate the large size of lead 2. The van der Waals interaction was the main energy contribution that stabilized lead 2, while van der Waals and electrostatic interactions were the main energy contributions stabilizing lead 1. Rational design strategies were suggested to replace the 2-(2-hydroxybenzylidene) hydrazine moiety with naphthalene or nitrobenzene at the P4 position of lead 2 and introduce polar substituents as aniline and benzoate groups at position P1 to enhance hydrophobic interactions and H-bonds, respectively.","output":"In silico analysis of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease potential inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since being declared a global pandemic, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) took over healthcare providers and researchers interest. However, other epidemic diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), are still a health issue that aggravate under the umbrella of health facilities exhaustion. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tuberculosis management. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the quarterly reports issued by a tuberculosis management unit from 2017 to June 2021, including data of 12 subunits. The changes in pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis incidence trends (new + relapsed cases) throughout the 4 years were reported. The quarterly changed percentages in cases numbers along 2020 and first half of 2021 was compared with that of the same periods in 2019. RESULTS: Incidence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis was higher than pulmonary tuberculosis throughout the 4 year study periods (7.69 vs. 4.49, 9.44 vs. 4.33, 7.75 vs. 3.58, and 7.82 vs. 2.94/100.000 population, respectively) with a noticeable decline in the incidence of pulmonary TB during 2020. The second quarter of 2020 showed the lowest tuberculosis incidence rate with a 41.6% decline in the total number of diagnosed cases while 2nd quarter of 2021 showed 21.2% decline. During 2020, only 4 cases of multidrug-resistant TB were reported (compared to an average of 8 cases of MDR-TB yearly before the COVID-19 era). CONCLUSION: There was a noticeable drop in tuberculosis case detection during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdown, started in Egypt by the end of March 2020, could contribute to the marked drop in the second quarter.

Metabolic alterations were investigated intra- and extracellularly with liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. Ion mobility was added as an extra separation dimension for untargeted lipidomics to improve annotation confidence. Distinctive patterns between exposed and control cells were consistently observed, with intracellular upregulation of di- and triglycerides, downregulation of phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines, sphingomyelins, and S-adenosylmethionine, among others. Several intracellular metabolic patterns could be related to changes in the extracellular environment, such as increased intracellular hydrolysis of sphingomyelins, leading to increased phosphorylcholine secretion. Carnitines showed alterations depending on the size of their carbon chain, which highlights the interplay between ?-oxidation in mitochondria and peroxisomes. Potential new biomarkers of ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity have been observed, such as ceramides with a sphingadienine backbone, octanoylcarnitine, creatine, acetylcholine, and ethoxylated phosphorylcholine.

Thus far it appears that with the current strains of these two viruses, the clinical outcome of co-infection is not significantly worse than infection with COVID-19 alone. However, several strains of influenza circulate, including strains still to come. Similarly, COVID-19 has several strains, with probably more to come. This paper discusses these issues and estimates ideal minimum influenza vaccination coverage based on an estimated influenza Basic Reproduction Number (R0) of 0.9C2.1 so as to obtain herd immunity or approach it.

Studies that addressed vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (concept) among pregnant women infected by Covid-19 (population) in any setting (community, hospital, or home) in any country or context were considered for inclusion. Any types of studies or reports published between December 2019 and September 2020 addressing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnant women and their newborn babies were included. Studies were screened for eligibility against the inclusion criteria for the review by two reviewers. RESULTS: We identified 51 studies reporting 336 newborns screened for COVID-19. From the 336 newborns screened for COVID-19, only 15 (4.4%) were positive for throat swab RT-PCR. All neonates with positive throat swab RT-PCR were delivered by cesarean section. Among neonates with throat swab SARS-CoV-2 positive only five (33.3%) had concomitant placenta, amniotic fluid, and cord blood samples tested, of which only one amniotic fluid sample is positive for RT PCR. Five neonates had elevated IgG and IgM but without intrauterine tissue tested. Four neonates had chest imaging suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia.

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the practices of DI clinics, and investigate the reasons for the change in their operations during the initial period of the pandemic starting in mid-March 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was created and distributed to the managers of eighteen outpatient DI clinics in London, Hamilton, and Halton, Ontario, Canada. The managers indicated whether their clinics had closed or decreased operations, the reasons for closure, and the types of imaging examinations conducted in the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Fifty percent of the DI clinics surveyed (9/18) closed as a result of COVID-19, and those that remained open had decreased hours of operation. The clinics that closed indicated decreased referrals as the primary reason for closure, followed by staff shortage, concerns for safety, and suspension of elective imaging. Chest radiography and obstetric ultrasound were the most commonly conducted examinations. Clinics that were in close geographical proximity were able to redistribute imaging examinations amongst themselves. All DI clinics had suspended BMD examinations and elective breast screening, and some transitioned to booked appointments only. CONCLUSION: Many DI clinics needed to close or decrease operations as a result of COVID-19, a phenomenon that is unprecedented in radiological practice.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has also been used in the manufacture of 11 approved vaccines against hepatitis B virus and one against human papillomavirus; in both cases, the recombinant protein forms highly immunogenic virus-like particles. SUMMARY Advances in our understanding of how a yeast cell responds to the metabolic load of producing recombinant proteins will allow us to identify host strains that have improved yield properties and enable the synthesis of more challenging antigens that cannot be produced in other systems. Yeasts therefore have the potential to become important host organisms for the production of recombinant antigens that can be used in the manufacture of subunit vaccines or in new vaccine development.","output":"Recombinant protein subunit vaccine synthesis in microbes: a role for yeast?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) is dangerous to human health.

A large number of inbound travelers from other regions could lead to a renewed outbreak of COVID-19 in the local regions. Globally, as a result of the imbalance in the control of the epidemic, all countries are facing the risk of a renewed COVID-19 outbreak brought about by travelers from epidemic areas. Therefore, studies on a proper management of the inbound travelers are urgent. Methods: We collected a total of 4,733,414 inbound travelers and 174 COVID-19 diagnosed patients in Yunnan province from 21 January 2020 to 20 February 2020. Data on place of origin, travel history, age, and gender, as well as whether they had suspected clinical manifestations for inbound travelers in Yunnan were collected. The impact of inbound travelers on the local epidemic was analyzed with a collinear statistical analysis and the effect of the control measures on the epidemic was evaluated with a sophisticated modeling approach. Results: Of the 174 COVID-19 patients, 60.9% were not from Yunnan, and 76.4% had a history of travel in Hubei. The amount of new daily cases in Yunnan was significant correlated with the number of inbound travelers from Hubei and suspected cases among them. Using Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model analysis, we found that the prevention and control measures dropped the local R0 down to 1.07 in Yunnan province. Conclusions: Our preliminary analysis showed that the proper management of inbound travelers from outbreak areas has a significantly positive effect on the prevention and control of the virus. In the process of resettlement, some effective measures taken by Yunnan province may provide an important reference for preventing the renewed COVID-19 outbreak in other regions.","output":"Impact of the Inflow Population From Outbreak Areas on the COVID-19 Epidemic in Yunnan Province and the Recommended Control Measures: A Preliminary Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTS), known as stress cardiomyopathy, is a rare disorder characterized by acute and transient left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, often associated with a stressful, emotional or physical event.

Managing multiple medications produces issues of unrivalled complexity for those involved. Despite increasing literature on the subject, gaps remain in understanding how, why and for whom complex medication management works, and therefore how best to improve practice and outcomes. MEMORABLE, MEdication Management in Older people: Realist Approaches Based on Literature and Evaluation, aimed to address these gaps. METHODS: MEMORABLE used realism to understand causal paths within medication management. Informed by RAMESES (Realist And Meta-narrative Evidence Synthesis: and Evolving Standards) guidelines, MEMORABLE involved three overlapping work packages: 1) Realist Review of the literature (24 articles on medication management exploring causality); 2) Realist Evaluation (50 realist-informed interviews with older people, family carers and health and care practitioners, explaining their experiences); and 3) data synthesis and theorising from 1) and 2). RESULTS: Medication management was viewed from the perspective of implementation and structured into five stages: identifying a problem (Stage 1), getting a diagnosis and/or medications (Stage 2), starting, changing or stopping medications (Stage 3), continuing to take medications (Stage 4), and reviewing/reconciling medications (Stage 5). Three individual stages (1, 3 and 4) are conducted by the older person sometimes with family carer support when they balance routines, coping and risk. Stages 2 and 5 are interpersonal where the older person works with a practitioner-prescriber-reviewer, perhaps with carer involvement. Applying Normalisation Process Theory, four steps were identified within each stage: 1) sense making: information, clarification; 2) action: shared-decision-making; 3) reflection/monitoring; and 4) enduring relationships, based on collaboration and mutual trust. In a detailed analysis of Stage 5: Reviewing/reconciling medications, adopting the lens of burden, MEMORABLE identified five burdens amenable to mitigation: ambiguity, concealment, unfamiliarity, fragmentation and exclusion. Two initial improvement propositions were identified for further research: a risk screening tool and individualised information. CONCLUSIONS: Older people and family carers often find medication management challenging and burdensome particularly for complex regimens. Practitioners need to be aware of this potential challenge, and work with older people and their carers to minimise the burden associated with medication management.

Inflammatory stimuli alter the expression status of their surface molecule toolset, while inflammation-stimulated granulopoiesis might also influence their maturation status. Data on neutrophil status in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are scarce. The present study aims to evaluate the role of neutrophil CD11b, CD66b and CD64 expression in HFrEF. Methods: A total of 135 HFrEF patients and 43 controls were recruited. Mean fluorescence intensity of the activation/maturation markers CD11b, CD66b and CD64 was measured on neutrophils by flow cytometry. CD10 (neprilysin) expression was simultaneously determined. Results: Neutrophil CD64 expression was higher in HFrEF compared with controls, while CD11b/CD66b levels were similar. Neutrophil CD11b and CD66b showed a significant direct correlation to neutrophil CD10 expression (rs = 0.573, p < 0.001 and rs = 0.184, p = 0.033). Neutrophil CD11b and CD66b correlated inversely with heart failure severity reflected by NT-proBNP and NYHA class (NT-proBNP: rs = ?0.243, p = 0.005 and rs = ?0.250, p = 0.004; NYHA class: p = 0.032 and p = 0.055), whereas no association for CD64 could be found. Outcome analysis did not reveal a significant association between the expression of CD11b, CD66b and CD64 and all-cause mortality (p = ns).

However, the requirement for serum/plasma limits serological testing to clinical settings where it is feasible to collect and process venous blood. To address this problem we developed a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that requires only a single drop of finger stick capillary whole blood, collected in the home and dried on filter paper (dried blood spot, DBS). We describe assay performance and demonstrate its utility for remote sampling with results from a community-based study. METHODS: An ELISA to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was optimized to quantify IgG antibodies in DBS. Samples were self-collected from a community sample of 232 participants enriched with health care workers, including 30 known COVID-19 cases and their household members. RESULTS: Among 30 individuals sharing a household with a virus-confirmed case of COVID-19, 80% were seropositive. Of 202 community individuals without prior confirmed acute COVID-19 diagnoses, 36% were seropositive. Of documented convalescent COVID-19 cases from the community, 29 of 30 (97%) were seropositive for IgG antibodies to the receptor binding domain. CONCLUSION: DBS ELISA provides a minimally-invasive alternative to venous blood collection. Early analysis suggests a high rate of transmission among household members. High rates of seroconversion were also noted following recovery from infection. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in DBS samples can facilitate seroprevalence assessment in community settings to address epidemiological questions, monitor duration of antibody responses, and assess if antibodies against the spike protein correlate with protection from reinfection.","output":"High seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 among household members of essential workers detected using a dried blood spot assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND MRI-guided laparoscopic assisted anorectoplasty (MRI-LAARP), a new approach for surgical correction of high imperforate anus, does not bisect the sphincter complex as in the PSARP and is able to pull the neorectum through the entire sphincter complex unlike the LAARP.

Initial studies of posttraumatic stress (PTS) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have found that approximately one-third of patients may experience significant PTS symptoms including flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, disrupted sleep, and low mood. We aim to better characterize PTS in IBD and its relationship with patient outcomes in a large cohort of patients with IBD. METHODS: Adult patients registered with the Crohns & Colitis Foundation/University of North Carolina IBD Partners database were invited to complete a supplementary survey between February and July 2020. The Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5th edition was administered as a supplemental survey. Additional data from IBD Partners included disease severity, surgery and hospital history, demographics, and health care utilization. RESULTS: A total of 797 patients participated (452 with Crohn disease, 345 with ulcerative colitis). No impacts on response patterns because of the COVID-19 pandemic were found. Although 5.6% of the sample reported an existing PTS diagnosis because of IBD experiences, 9.6% of participants met the full IBD-related PTS diagnostic criteria per the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5th edition. Female patients, younger patients, those with less educational attainment, non-White patients, and Hispanic patients reported higher levels of PTS symptoms. Patients with higher PTS symptoms were more likely to have been hospitalized, have had surgery, have more severe symptoms, and not be in remission. Increased PTS was also associated with increased anxiety, depression, pain interference, fatigue, and health care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings support prior research that approximately one-quarter to one-third of patients with IBD report significant symptoms of PTS directly from their disease experiences, and certain demographic groups are at higher risk. In addition, PTS is associated with several IBD outcomes. Patients with higher PTS symptoms are less likely to be in remission and may utilize more outpatient gastrointestinal services.

Although aging impairs the integrity of the BBB, the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not clear. As mitochondrial components activate inflammation as mitochondria become dysfunctional, we examined how aging impacts cerebrovascular mitochondrial function, mitophagy, and inflammatory signaling; and whether any alterations correlate with BBB function. METHODS AND RESULTS: We isolated cerebral vessels from young (2C3 months of age) and aged (18C19 months of age) mice and found that aging led to increases in the cyclin\\\\dependent kinase inhibitor 1 senescence marker with impaired mitochondrial function, which correlated with aged mice exhibiting increased BBB leak compared with young mice. Cerebral vessels also exhibited increased expression of mitophagy proteins Parkin and Nix with aging. Using mitophagy reporter (mtKeima) mice, we found that the capacity to increase mitophagy from baseline within the cerebral vessels on rotenone treatment was reduced with aging. Aging within the cerebral vessels also led to the upregulation of the stimulator of interferon genes and increased interleukin 6 (IL\\\\6), a cytokine that alters mitochondrial function. Importantly, exogenous IL\\\\6 treatment of young cerebral vessels upregulated mitophagy and Parkin and impaired mitochondrial function; whereas inhibiting IL\\\\6 in aged cerebral vessels reduced Parkin expression and increased mitochondrial function. Furthermore, treating cerebral vessels of young mice with mitochondrial N\\\\formyl peptides upregulated IL\\\\6, increased Parkin, and reduced Claudin\\\\5, a tight junction protein integral to BBB integrity. CONCLUSIONS: Aging alters the cerebral vasculature to impair mitochondrial function and mitophagy and increase IL\\\\6 levels.

We thus propose that coevolution of microbes with their hosts may favour microbes that induce their host to cooperate. Using computational modelling, we show that microbe-induced cooperation can evolve and be maintained in a wide range of conditions, including when facing hosts' resistance to the microbial effect.

METHODS: A 46-item survey was sent by email to representatives of 30 oncological centres in 12 of the most affected countries. The survey inquired about preventive measures established to reduce virus spread, patient education and processes employed for risk reduction in each oncological unit. RESULTS: Investigators from 21 centres in 10 countries answered the survey between 10 April and 6 May 2020. A triage for patients with cancer before hospital or clinic visits was conducted by 90.5% of centres before consultations, 95.2% before day care admissions and in 100% of the cases before overnight hospitalisation by means of phone calls, interactive online platforms, swab test and/or chest CT scan. Permission for caregivers to attend clinic visits was limited in many centres, with some exceptions (ie, for non-autonomous patients, in the case of a new diagnosis, when bad news was expected and for terminally ill patients). With a variable delay period, the use of personal protective equipment was unanimously mandatory, and in many centres, only targeted clinical and instrumental examinations were performed. Telemedicine was implemented in 76.2% of the centres. Separated pathways for COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients were organised, with separate inpatient units and day care areas. Self-isolation was required for COVID-19-positive or symptomatic staff, while return to work policies required a negative swab test in 76.2% of the centres.

Simulation attributes including fluid flow and geometrical parameters are optimized so that the maximum capture efficiency of 85.63% is achieved.

While the detection limit is reduced utilizing the single-electrode mode compared to the latter one, surface treatment of the triboelectric pair contributes to the sensitivity enhancement.

Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate changes in the expression of SIRT1, JNK/ERK/MAPK/AKT signaling, and pro-apoptotic caspase-3 in experimental rats and CI patients. The study findings demonstrated that, in aged experimental rats, SIRT1 activation positively influenced JNK and ERK phosphorylation and modulated neuronal survival in AKT-dependent manner. Further, the protection conferred by SIRT1 was effectively reversed by JNK inhibition and increased pro-apoptotic caspase-3 expression. In young experimental rats, SIRT1 activation decreased the phosphorylation of stress-induced JNK, ERK, caspase-3, and increased the phosphorylation of AKT after CI. Inhibition of SIRT1 reversed the protective effect of resveratrol.

METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between October 1 and December 1, 2020, in Iran. The study population consisted of patients who used the service. Three hundred-ninety-six patients were enrolled in the study by convenience sampling. Data were collected by a researcher-made questionnaire. The face, comprehensibility, and content validity of the questionnaire were tested and met. The reliability of this questionnaire was confirmed (r = 0.9). Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression were conducted. Data were analyzed using STATA 14.0 software. RESULTS: In total, 396 patients responded to the online questionnaire. The mean age of patients was 37  10.31 years. More than half of them had an academic degree (65.40 %). Teleconsultation was considered satisfactory by 172 patients (43.43 %), while more than half of the patients (56.57 %) were unsatisfied with teleconsultation. In terms of \\"quality of care provided\\" and \\"patient information privacy\\" components, around 41 % of patients were satisfied. However, the number of patients who feel satisfied with teleconsultation's similarity to a face-to-face encounter was lower (37.88 %).

The best anticoagulation strategy for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in such patients is still under debate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact that different anticoagulation protocols have on filter clotting risk. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study comparing two different anticoagulation strategies (citrate only and citrate plus intravenous infusion of unfractionated heparin) in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), associated or not with COVID-19 (COV + AKI and COV ? AKI, respectively), who were submitted to CRRT. Filter clotting risks were compared among groups. RESULTS: Between January 2019 and July 2020, 238 patients were evaluated: 188 in the COV + AKI group and 50 in the COV ? AKI group. Filter clotting during the first filter use occurred in 111 patients (46.6%). Heparin use conferred protection against filter clotting (HR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.25C0.55), resulting in longer filter survival. Bleeding events and the need for blood transfusion were similar between the citrate only and citrate plus unfractionated heparin strategies. In-hospital mortality was higher among the COV + AKI patients than among the COV ? AKI patients, although it was similar between the COV + AKI patients who received heparin and those who did not. Filter clotting was more common in patients with D-dimer levels above the median (5990 ng/ml). In the multivariate analysis, heparin was associated with a lower risk of filter clotting (HR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.18C0.43), whereas an elevated D-dimer level and high hemoglobin were found to be risk factors for circuit clotting. A diagnosis of COVID-19 was marginally associated with an increased risk of circuit clotting (HR = 2.15, 95% CI 0.99C4.68). CONCLUSIONS: In COV + AKI patients, adding systemic heparin to standard regional citrate anticoagulation may prolong CRRT filter patency by reducing clotting risk with a low risk of complications.

Other facilitators included concerns about future care needs, increasing awareness among respondents' children about the advantages of ACP, and respondents' desire to avoid \\"burdening\\" their children. The most commonly mentioned barrier was respondents' lack of knowledge about ACP. Other barriers were language issues, a lack of urgency about ACP discussion, reliance on familial support, and older adults' fear of triggering negative emotions in themselves and their children.

Despite a growing literature on economic evaluation of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), including several systematic reviews, there is no conclusive evidence regarding their cost-effectiveness. This paper reviews the methodology used to determine their cost-effectiveness and assesses whether this meets the requirements for decision-making. In doing so we consider the challenges specific to the economic evaluation of DMHIs, and identify where consensus and possible further research is warranted. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify all economic evaluations of DMHIs published between 1997 and December 2018. The searches included databases of published and unpublished research, reference lists and citations of all included studies, forward citations on all identified protocols and conference abstracts, and contacting authors researchers in the field. The identified studies were critiqued against a published set of requirements for decision-making in healthcare, identifying methodological challenges and areas where consensus is required. RESULTS: The review identified 67 papers evaluating DMHIs. The majority of the evaluations were conducted alongside trials, failing to capture all relevant available evidence and comparators, and long-term impact of mental health disorders. The identified interventions are complex and heterogeneous. As a result, there are a number of challenges specific to their evaluation, including estimation of all costs and outcomes, conditional on analysis viewpoint, and identification of relevant comparators.

Universities are considered the hubs of the transition of individuals to young adults, understanding the hesitancy of this population stratum and addressing apprehensions that may exist is of utmost importance. This study aims to explore the attitude and hesitancy of students in UAE universities toward the COVID-19 vaccines along with comparing two particular demographics to see if there exists a difference in outcomes-medical and nonmedical students. Methods: A web-based self-administered questionnaire was sent following Ethics Committee approval, to students at various universities in the UAE containing questions regarding general demographic data, COVID-19 related anamnestic characteristics as well as questions on motivational factors and refusal factors regarding the vaccine. Using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 28, descriptive analyses were performed for the demographic variables and inferential statistics were carried out using Pearson's Chi-squared (2) test. Results: A total of 385 participants consented to the survey, with a majority of female respondents (76.6%). In our demographics which included respondents of an average age of 21 years, 91.4% were expatriates, and 48.1% were based in Dubai.

Several recent studies suggest that a significant number of COVID-19 patients display no physical symptoms whatsoever. Therefore, it is unlikely that these patients will undergo COVID-19 testing, which increases their chances of unintentionally spreading the virus. Currently, the primary diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 is a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test from the respiratory specimens of the suspected patient, which is invasive and a resource-dependent technique. It is evident from recent researches that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients cough and breathe in a different way than healthy people. AimThis paper aims to use a novel machine learning approach to detect COVID-19 (symptomatic and asymptomatic) patients from the convenience of their homes so that they do not overburden the healthcare system and also do not spread the virus unknowingly by continuously monitoring themselves. MethodA Cambridge University research group shared such a dataset of cough and breath sound samples from 582 healthy and 141 COVID-19 patients. Among the COVID-19 patients, 87 were asymptomatic while 54 were symptomatic (had a dry or wet cough). In addition to the available dataset, the proposed work deployed a real-time deep learning-based backend server with a web application to crowdsource cough and breath datasets and also screen for COVID-19 infection from the comfort of the users home. The collected dataset includes data from 245 healthy individuals and 78 asymptomatic and 18 symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Users can simply use the application from any web browser without installation and enter their symptoms, record audio clips of their cough and breath sounds, and upload the data anonymously. Two different pipelines for screening were developed based on the symptoms reported by the users: asymptomatic and symptomatic. An innovative and novel stacking CNN model was developed using three base learners from of eight state-of-the-art deep learning CNN algorithms. The stacking CNN model is based on a logistic regression classifier meta-learner that uses the spectrograms generated from the breath and cough sounds of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients as input using the combined (Cambridge and collected) dataset. ResultsThe stacking model outperformed the other eight CNN networks with the best classification performance for binary classification using cough sound spectrogram images. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were 96.5%, 96.42%, and 95.47% and 98.85%, 97.01%, and 99.6%, respectively. For breath sound spectrogram images, the metrics for binary classification of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were 91.03%, 88.9%, and 91.5% and 80.01%, 72.04%, and 82.67%, respectively. ConclusionThe web-application QUCoughScope records coughing and breathing sounds, converts them to a spectrogram, and applies the best-performing machine learning model to classify the COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects. The result is then reported back to the test user in the application interface. Therefore, this novel system can be used by patients in their premises as a pre-screening method to aid COVID-19 diagnosis by prioritizing the patients for RT-PCR testing and thereby reducing the risk of spreading of the disease.","output":"QUCoughScope: An Intelligent Application to Detect COVID-19 Patients Using Cough and Breath Sounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS To critically appraise the evidence of the impact of exposure to salutogenic green environment on mortality, which is an important endpoint in epidemiological and clinical studies. METHODS We searched for studies published and indexed in three databases (PubMed, AMED, and CINAHL Plus) from inception until 31 March 2020, complemented with a search of cited literature for articles describing the effects of greenness on mortality in Asia-Pacific region. Eligible articles were screened and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. A random-effects model was utilised to obtain pool hazard ratio (HR) and risk ratio of all-cause mortality outcome. RESULTS The search identified 3239 studies, of which 20 studies reporting 133,363 participants from longitudinal cohort studies and 202 million people from population-based prevalence studies were included in the review. The majority of the studies (60%) were conducted in high-income countries in Asia-Pacific. All participants of the longitudinal cohort studies were aged 60 years or older, whereas the prevalence studies involved people of all age groups. A significant protective association of green environment exposure with all-cause mortality was reported in 18 studies. Pooled results from five studies showed increased level of greenness exposure was associated with a significant decrease in all-cause mortality (pooled HR = 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93 to 1.02; p < 0.01; I2= 87.8%). Meta-analysis of total number of deaths in different quartiles of green spaces noted decreased risks of mortality with all causes of death with increased surrounding greenness. CONCLUSIONS Some limited evidence suggests that populations exposed to the greener environment have a lower risk of mortality, implying the potential role of greenness in increasing longevity. Further studies with standardised design and outcome reporting should be conducted in low- and middle-income countries and in populations of low socioeconomic status to glean more generalisable and complete evidence for public health policy implications.","output":"The influence of residential greenness on mortality in the Asia-Pacific region: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented strike on humanity around the world. The scenario in Bangladesh is getting worse day by day, and every aspect of the society is observing its impact. Health care professionals are at a greater risk of contracting the disease while caring for patients. Objective: The research objective is to explore knowledge, awareness, and practices of registered dentists regarding COVID-19 epidemiology and transmission during the rapid outbreak of this highly contagious virus in Bangladesh. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted among the dentists who were enrolled with their valid unique Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BMDC) registration number. A structured questionnaire was distributed among the dentists through different social media platforms. A total of 184 dentists participated in the survey between March and April 2020. Both descriptive analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: The dentists' mean age was 31.75 years, with a standard deviation of 6.5 years. About 29.3% of dentists completed their postgraduate qualification, and 76% of them were engaged in private practice at the time of data collection. Compared to the dentists with undergraduate education, the dentists with a postgraduate education are three times (OR=3.1, 95%CI 1.2-7.9 and over 5 times (OR=5.3, 95% CI: 1.2-23.3) more likely to have) better knowledge and practices toward COVID-19 respectively.

In this work, the objective is to determine an optimal control strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment considering real data from China. Two optimal control problems (mono- and multi-objective) to determine a strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment are proposed. The first consists of minimizing the quantity of infected individuals during the treatment. The second considers minimizing together the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine concentration during the treatment. Methods: An inverse problem is formulated and solved in order to determine the parameters of the compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model. The solutions for both optimal control problems proposed are obtained by using Differential Evolution and Multi-objective Optimization Differential Evolution algorithms. Results: A comparative analysis on the influence related to the inclusion of a control strategy in the population subject to the epidemic is carried out, in terms of the compartmental model and its control parameters. The results regarding the proposed optimal control problems provide information from which an optimal strategy for vaccine administration can be defined. Conclusions: The solution of the optimal control problem can provide information about the effect of vaccination of a population in the face of an epidemic, as well as essential elements for decision making in the economic and governmental spheres.","output":"Determination of an Optimal Control Strategy for Vaccine Administration in COVID-19 Pandemic Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread across the globe affecting 213 countries or territories with greater than six million confirmed cases and about 0.37 million deaths, with World Health Organization categorizing it as a pandemic. Infected patients present with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and critical cases show acute respiratory infection and multiple organ failure. Likelihood of these severe indications is further enhanced by age as well as underlying comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular, or thoracic problems, as well as due to an immunocompromised state. Currently, curative drugs or vaccines are lacking, and the standard of care is limited to symptom management. Natural products like ginger, turmeric, garlic, onion, cinnamon, lemon, neem, basil, and black pepper have been scientifically proven to have therapeutic benefits against acute respiratory tract infections including pulmonary fibrosis, diffuse alveolar damage, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, as well as associated septic shock, lung and kidney injury, all of which are symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection.

However, little is known about the impact of coinfection with tuberculosis. We aimed to compare the risk of death and recovery, as well as time-to-death and time-to-recovery, in COVID-19 patients with and without tuberculosis. METHODS We created a 4:1 propensity score matched sample of COVID-19 patients without and with tuberculosis, using COVID-19 surveillance data in the Philippines. We conducted a longitudinal cohort analysis of matched COVID-19 patients as of May 17, 2020, following them until June 15, 2020. The primary analysis estimated the risk ratios of death and recovery in patients with and without tuberculosis. Kaplan-Meier curves described time-to-death and time-to-recovery stratified by tuberculosis status, and differences in survival were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS The risk of death in COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis was 2.17 times higher than in those without (95% CI: 1.40-3.37). The risk of recovery in COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis was 25% lower than in those without (RR = 0.75,05% CI 0.63-0.91). Similarly, time-to-death was significantly shorter (p = .0031) and time-to-recovery significantly longer in patients with tuberculosis (p = .0046).

METHODS: Hospital staff who had recovered from mild forms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two assays: a rapid immunodiagnostic test (99.4% specificity) and the S-Flow assay (~99% specificity). The neutralizing activity of the sera was tested with a pseudovirus-based assay. FINDINGS: Of 162 hospital staff who participated in the investigation, 160 reported SARS-CoV-2 infection that had not required hospital admission and were included in these analyses. The median time from symptom onset to blood sample collection was 24 days (IQR: 21C28, range 13C39). The rapid immunodiagnostic test detected antibodies in 153 (95.6%) of the samples and the S-Flow assay in 159 (99.4%), failing to detect antibodies in one sample collected 18 days after symptom onset (the rapid test did not detect antibodies in that patient). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detected in 79%, 92% and 98% of samples collected 13C20, 21C27 and 28C41 days after symptom onset, respectively (P = 0.02). INTERPRETATION: Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in virtually all hospital staff sampled from 13 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This finding supports the use of serologic testing for the diagnosis of individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The neutralizing activity of the antibodies increased overtime. Future studies will help assess the persistence of the humoral response and its associated neutralization capacity in recovered patients.

Objective To compare the effect of an internet-based self-management and symptom monitoring program targeted to patients with 2 or more chronic diseases (internet chronic disease management [CDM]) with usual care on hospitalizations over a 2-year period. Design, Setting, and Participants This single-blinded randomized clinical trial included patients with multiple chronic diseases from 71 primary care clinics in small urban and rural areas throughout British Columbia, Canada. Recruitment occurred between October 1, 2011, and March 23, 2015. A volunteer sample of 456 patients was screened for eligibility. Inclusion criteria included daily internet access, age older than 19 years, fluency in English, and the presence of 2 or more of the following 5 conditions: diabetes, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A total of 230 patients consented to participate and were randomized to receive either the internet CDM intervention (n = 117) or usual care (n = 113). One participant in the internet CDM group withdrew from the study after randomization, resulting in 229 participants for whom data on the primary outcome were available. Interventions Internet-based self-management program using telephone nursing supports and integration within primary care compared with usual care over a 2-year period. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was all-cause hospitalizations at 2 years. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, quality of life, self-management, and social support. Additional outcomes included the number of participants with at least 1 hospitalization, the number of participants who experienced a composite outcome of all-cause hospitalization or death, the time to first hospitalization, and the number of in-hospital days. Results Among 229 participants included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 70.5 (9.1) years, and 141 participants (61.6%) were male; data on race and ethnicity were not collected because there was no planned analysis of these variables. The internet CDM group had 25 fewer hospitalizations compared with the usual care group (56 hospitalizations vs 81 hospitalizations, respectively [30.9% reduction]; relative risk [RR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.43-1.10; P = .12). The intervention group also had 229 fewer in-hospital days compared with the usual care group (282 days vs 511 days, respectively; RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.24-1.10; P = .09). Components of self-management and social support improved in the intervention group. Fewer participants in the internet CDM vs usual care group had at least 1 hospitalization (32 of 116 individuals [27.6%] vs 46 of 113 individuals [40.7%]; odds ratio [OR], 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31-0.96; P = .03) or experienced the composite outcome of all-cause hospitalization or death (37 of 116 individuals [31.9%] vs 51 of 113 individuals [45.1%]; OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33-0.98; P = .04). Participants in the internet CDM group had a lower risk of time to first hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39-0.97; P = .04) than those in the usual care group. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, an internet-based self-management program did not result in a significant reduction in hospitalization. However, fewer participants in the intervention group were admitted to the hospital or experienced the composite outcome of all-cause hospitalization or death. These findings suggest the internet CDM program has the potential to augment primary care among patients with multiple chronic diseases.

Subjects/Methods: 95 consecutive patients with COVID-19 (78 males and 18 females) were admitted to ICU and included in the study. Height, weight, BMI, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, CRP, CPK, as well as ICU and hospital length of stay and comorbidities were evaluated. Results: : Participants with obesity had a lower 28 day survival rate from ICU admission than normal weight subjects. Cox proportional hazard model-derived estimates, adjusted for age, gender and comorbidity, confirmed the results of the survival analysis (HR:5.30,95%C.I.1.26-22.34). In the full adjusted model, age was independently associated with mortality (HR:1.13,95%C.I:1.05-1.21).Obese subjects showed longer hospital and ICU stay as compared with normal weight counterpart.Subjects with obesity showed significantly higher CRP and CPK levels than normal weight subjects. Conclusions: : Our study shows that in COVID-19 subjects admitted to ICU obesity is a risk factor for unfavourable health outcomes with higher mortality and longer hospital stay. The increase in CRP and CPK levels observed in this population could at least in part explain the unfavourable outcomes observed in individuals with obesity.

Methods A total of 22,016 patients with diagnostic confirmation for COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed between March 4 and May 5, 2020, nationwide. Based on information from the Chilean Ministry of Health and ministerial announcements in the media, the overall availability of critical care beds was estimated at 1,900 to 2,000. The Gompertz function was used to estimate the expected number of COVID-19 patients and to assess their exposure to the available supply of intensive care beds in various possible scenarios, taking into account the supply of total critical care beds, the average occupational index, and the demand for COVID-19 patients who would require an intensive care bed. Results A 100% occupancy of critical care beds could be reached between May 11 and May 27. This condition could be extended for around 48 days, depending on how the expected over-demand is managed.

OBJECTIVE To characterise the epidemiology of the injuries caused by e-scooter related accidents and to study their indirect economic impact in work-related accidents hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective and descriptive study in which has been checked all the medical information about the patients attended in the ER (emergency room) of the Hospital Asepeyo Sant Cugat, who suffered e-scooter accident from January 2018 to December 2020. RESULTS 167 patients were included in the study. 55% (92) were male and 45% (75) were female. The average of age was 37.4 years-old. There were quantified 117 different fractures in 105 patients (63%). Other injuries documented were: 36 patients with multiple contusions, 16 head traumas and 4 wounds which required suture. The most frequent ligamentous injuries were 4 ACL ruptures, 3 ACJ dislocations and 2 patients with rupture of the UCL of the thumb. 105 patients required hospital admission, 3 of them in ICU. The 51% of the cases required surgical treatment of their injuries. In that period, as a consequence of the work inabilities generated by the total of the patients included in the study, the added cost for the hospital was around 1,062,444. CONCLUSIONS The popularisation of e-scooters between the employed population has caused a high increased number of accidents in this range of age. Most of the injuries observed may be compared with those seen in high-energy traumas. These cause an important socio-economic impact due to the nature of the injuries and the potential complications that could appear.

We explored qualitatively, the vulnerabilities (characteristics that decreased resilience) and stressors that impacted intimate relationships following the initial COVID- 19 lockdown. 45 semi-structured interviews were undertaken with participants who had completed a national web-panel survey (Natsal- COVID) and agreed to follow-up. Here we draw on the accounts of 19 participants in steady relationships who reported relationship difficulties. Analysis drew on Karney and Bradbury's 'Vulnerability-stress-adaptation' model. The sample comprised 12 women and 7 men, 13 were living with their partner and 6 were not. Participant's preexisting attachment, coping, and communication styles shaped their susceptibility to relationship difficulties. The stress of COVID-19, amplified by financial strain and health issues, affected couple's ability to adapt. In live-in relationships, childcare, divisions of housework, and a lack of space in which to unwind and escape from negative behaviours intensified pressures on relationship quality. One participant described these in the context of a violent relationship that worsened during lockdown, which she had managed to leave. Participants who did not live with their partners described struggling with phone/digital communication, physical distance, and a lack of certainty in the future of their relationship. In adapting to 'pandemic life', tensions arose over how much time to spend together. Those in non-cohabiting relationships were torn between balancing risks of COVID-19 against those of not seeing each other, with many reporting feeling they had placed their relationship on hold. For some, their sex life improved their adaptation, while for others it was a further source of stress.

In this study, we explored the potential mechanism of QFDY with regard to its anti-COVID-19 effect. We first screened the active chemical constituents of QFDY based on the pharmacodynamic activity parameters, followed by screening with the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform. The Uniprot database was used for querying the corresponding genes of the target, and Cyoscape 3.6.1 software was used to construct the network of herb-compound-target. Protein interaction analysis, target gene function enrichment analysis, and signal pathway analysis were performed via STRING database, Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery, and KEGG Pathway database. Molecular docking was used to predict the binding capacity of the core compound with COVID-19 hydrolase 3CL and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The results showed that a network of herb-compound-target was successfully constructed, with key targets involving PTGS2, HSP90AA1, CAMKK2, NCOA2, and ESR1. Major metabolic pathways affected were those in cancer, procancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and apoptosis. The core compounds, such as quercetin, luteolin, and naringenin, showed a strong binding ability with COVID-19 3CL hydrolase; compounds such as anemasaponin C and medicocarpin showed a strong binding ability with ACE2. Thus, it is predicted that QFDY has the characteristics for multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel overall control. The mechanism of action of QFDY in the treatment of COVID-19 may be associated with the regulation of genes co-expressed with ACE2, the regulation of inflammation and immune-related signaling pathways, and the influence of COVID-19 3CL hydrolase and ACE2 binding ability.","output":"Network Pharmacology Integrated Molecular Docking Reveals the Anti-COVID-19 Mechanism of Qing-Fei-Da-Yuan Granules"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity is highly prevalent in hospitalized patients admitted with COVID-19.

SETTING: Two mixed medical-surgical tertiary (30 beds) and secondary (22 beds) ICUs. PATIENTS: All critically ill adult coronavirus disease 2019 survivors treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between March 10, and April 30, 2020. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The last available lung function and 6-minute walking tests, performed after a median of 178 days (ranges, 72C232 d) from ICU admission, were analyzed. Among the 32 coronavirus disease 2019 patients treated by venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the study period, 11 (34%; median age 56 yr; median duration of mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy of 26 and 15 d, respectively) were successfully weaned and discharged home. Spirometry was performed in nine patients; the volumetric lung function was preserved, that is, median forced vital capacity was 83% of predicted value (51C99% of predicted value), and median forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 82% of predicted value (60C99% of predicted value). Also, the median residual volume and the lung capacity were 100% of predicted value (50C140% of predicted value) and 90% of predicted value (50C100% of predicted value); only the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide and 6-minute walking test were decreased (58% of predicted value [37C95% of predicted value] and 468 meters (365C625 meters), corresponding to [63C90% of predicted value], respectively).

METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted at a PCR center between October 7 and December 5, 2020. The included patients were referred from a local public health center and 89 primary care facilities. We simultaneously obtained two nasopharyngeal samples with flocked swabs; one was used for the antigen test and the other for real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Using the results of real-time RT-PCR as a reference, the performance of the antigen test was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 1186 patients were included in this study, and the real-time RT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in 105 (8.9%). Of these 105 patients, 33 (31.4%) were asymptomatic. The antigen test provided a 98.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 98.0%-99.4%) concordance rate with real-time RT-PCR, along with a sensitivity of 86.7% (95% CI: 78.6%-92.5%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 99.7%-100%). False-negatives were observed in 14 patients, 8 of whom were asymptomatic and had a low viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) > 30). In symptomatic patients, the sensitivity was 91.7% (95% CI: 82.7%-96.9%). CONCLUSION: QuickNavi&#8482;-COVID19 Ag showed high specificity and sufficient sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. This test is a promising potential diagnostic modality especially in symptomatic patients.","output":"The evaluation of a newly developed antigen test (QuickNavi?-COVID19 Ag) for SARS-CoV-2: A prospective observational study in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a new viral infection that is usually accompanied by respiratory complications. Air pollution has been linked to cardiorespiratory-related diseases and even premature mortality. The short-term exposure to air pollution may aggravate pulmonary symptoms in COVID-19 patients. The relationship between the short-term exposure to air pollution and hospital admission and mortality resulting from COVID-19 will be examined in Tehran, Iran, during the spring and summer of 2020. The statistics of PM(2.5), PM(10), and 8-h maximum ozone (O(3)) concentrations, meteorological conditions, and COVID-19 hospital admissions/mortality were analyzed. The cross-correlation and temporal relationship between the daily concentration of the aforementioned pollutants (as well as the meteorological conditions) and the COVID-19 hospital admissions/mortality rate was calculated for each month. The concentration of PM(2.5), PM(10), and 8-h maximum O(3), along with temperature, increased in the summer. The hospital admissions and mortality associated with COVID-19 decreased from the first peak in the spring and then increased to its second peak in the summer. The short-term exposure to ambient PM(2.5), PM(10), O(3), and elevated temperatures is associated with higher rates of COVID-19-related hospital admissions/mortality throughout the summer. Among these variables, the correlation with O(3) was statistically significant in more summer months. The short-term exposure to air pollution (especially O(3)) may increase the susceptibility of the population infected with COVID-19 and, therefore, increases the rate of hospital admissions and mortality even during the warm seasons.","output":"Association between short-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 hospital admission/mortality during warm seasons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of reported Covid-19 cases are increasing so rapidly that even developed countries are being unable to afford to get a bed in hospitals for every Covid-19 positive patient Shortage in number of doctors is also a problem This is the reason why physicians encourage patients to stay at home and take care of themselves Our intention is to formulate a system for patients with home ICU This application will help to archive every patients health response and alert people nearby A threshold of each body parameter has been set so that an alarming system can call for help immediately For constant checking of every patients health condition for making further decision is fulfilled by developing a real time database system that helps to store and share data in remote areas A data management system allows the clinician to access important information through one platform for avoiding crucial details A password system makes the stored data secured for not to compromise with patients privacy ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"A healthcare system for in-home icu during covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay argues for the importance of error as an organizing concept in the management of hazardous technical systems to high levels of reliability and safety.

Uncertainty has been conceived by some analysts as a condition that can convey little or no reliable information about its own boundary conditions or its specific threat to the operation of complex systems. The argument here is that uncertainty is differentiated and specified in HROs and provides important information in relation to error. Uncertainty does not, in the special context of HROs, end the possibility and practice of reliable management. In fact, error in HROs can be a starting point for the further analysis of ways in which uncertainty itself can be managed reliably.

The general hypothesis of signature based drug repurposing is that drugs with inverse similarity to a disease signature can reverse disease phenotype and thus be effective against it. However, in the case of viral infection diseases, like SARS-CoV-2, infected cells also activate adaptive, antiviral pathways, so that the relationship between effective drug and disease signature can be more ambiguous. To address this question, we analysed gene expression data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines, and gene expression signatures of drugs showing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Our extensive functional genomic analysis showed that both infection and treatment with in vitro effective drugs leads to activation of antiviral pathways like NFkB and JAK-STAT. Based on the similarity - and not inverse similarity - between drug and infection-induced gene expression signatures, we were able to predict the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs. We also identified SREBF1/2, key regulators of lipid metabolising enzymes, as the most activated transcription factors by several in vitro effective antiviral drugs. Using a fluorescently labeled cholesterol sensor, we showed that these drugs decrease the cholesterol levels of plasma-membrane. Supplementing drug-treated cells with cholesterol reversed the in vitro antiviral effect, suggesting the depleting plasma-membrane cholesterol plays a key role in virus inhibitory mechanism. Our results can help to more effectively repurpose approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2, and also highlights key mechanisms behind their antiviral effect.","output":"Computational drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 reveals plasma membrane cholesterol depletion as key factor of antiviral drug activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), sarcolemma fragility and myofiber necrosis produce cellular debris that attract inflammatory cells.

This immunological scenario was extended by the discovery of a specific response to muscle antigens and a role for regulatory T cells (Tregs) in muscle regeneration. Normally, autoimmunity is avoided by autoreactive T-lymphocyte deletion within thymus, while in the periphery Tregs monitor effector T-cells escaping from central regulatory control.

The comparison of physical appearance with others on social media and the exposure to fitness-related content on social media (i.e., image-centric social media use) may have a profound role in using these compounds due to its role in creating negative body images in male gym users. OBJECTIVE: Provide contemporary data on the use of dietary supplements, AAS and SARM among young male gym users, and test the hypothesis that social media is associated with the use of dietary supplements, AAS and SARM, as a result of a negative body image. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, conducted in the Netherlands, male gym users (N = 2269; 24  6 years) completed an online questionnaire including self-reported measures regarding resistance training participation, image-centric social media use, dietary supplement intake, and body image. The prevalence of AAS and SARM use was assessed with randomized response, a technique to ask sensitive questions indirectly. RESULTS: Of all participants, 83% used ergogenic dietary supplements (mainly protein and creatine), and an estimated 9 versus 2.7% had ever used AAS versus SARM. Image-centric social media use was positively associated with the use of dietary supplements (r = .26; p < 0.01) and AAS (p < 0.05), but not SARM. Image-centric social media use was associated with a more dissatisfied body image (r = .34; p < 0.01).

Therefore sustained cardiac involvement after recovery from COVID-19 in athletes is of particular relevance for the prevention of sudden cardiac arrest/sudden cardiac death (SCA/SCD). To date, only small sample-size studies are available, or studies predominantly focusing on hospitalized and severely ill patients. We aimed to address this knowledge gap in a comprehensive, systematic review of peri-/myocardial involvement after SARS-CoV-2 infection in athletes versus healthy non-athletes. PURPOSE: Quantification of peri-/myocardial involvement and risks of SCA/SCD after SARS-CoV-2 infection in athletes as compared with healthy non-athletes. METHODS: We performed a systematic search with a combination of key terms in Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and Scopus (through March 8th 2021). To capture potential non- peer-reviewed COVID-19 SCA/SCD reports we performed monthly scoping internet searches. Inclusion criteria: athletes/non-athletes, with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) or echocardiography after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection, including arrhythmia outcomes. Exclusion criteria: study population 1 individual comorbidity and mean age <18/>64 years. RESULTS: We included 16 manuscripts (933 papers reviewed) comprising 1129 athletes (284 college/student-, 807 professional- and 38 elite athletes) and 382 healthy non-athletes. Athletes vs non-athletes reported myocarditis on echocardiography and/or CMR in 0C15% vs 45C60%, LGE in 0C46% vs 0C74% (Figure 1), and pericardial effusion in 8C58% vs 0C47% (Figure 2). Weighted means of diagnosed myocarditis were 3% in athletes (3.5% college/student-, and 0% elite athletes) and 56.6% in non-athletes. No important arrhythmias were reported. Systematic internet query identified 2 collapsed post-COVID-19 athletes during exercise, 1 lethal. Ten studies (n=1301) reporting post-recovery troponin T/I found no clear relationship with cardiac abnormalities. SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS: Rates of peri-/myocardial abnormalities in athletes/healthy non-athletes after SARS-CoV-2 infection are variable, ranging from 0C74%, and predominantly seen on CMR. Athletes have a lower risk of peri-/myocardial involvement, and myocarditis (0C3.5% vs 56.5%) than non-athletes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Risks of SCA/SCD appear low, but data are lacking.

Materials and Methods: Retrospective observational multi-centered cohort study. Results: In total, 151 patients (mean age 6117 years, 66% male) with COVID-19 pneumonia were included: 68 patients received combination therapy, i.e., Lpv/r in addition to HQ, and 83 patients received only HQ. The patients in both groups were similar regarding the majority of baseline variables except for white blood cell count, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase levels, intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates, which were significantly higher, and decreased oxygen saturation in the combination group. The mean duration of symptoms and hospital stay were 5.62.3 days and 12.79.4 days, respectively. Nearly 43% (n=65) of patients were admitted to the ICU. Patients in the HQ monotherapy group had a shorter stay in hospital than those in the combination group (10 vs. 16 days, p<0.005). The primary end points were 14- and 28-day mortality. Neither treatment group revealed significant differences with respect to 14-day and 28-day survival before and after propensity score matching.

Methods: Between February 9 and 21, 2020, a total of 3,114 frontline HCWs from 26 hospitals in Shanghai completed an online survey. The questionnaire included questions on their sociodemographic characteristics, 15 stress-related questions, and General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Exploratory factor analysis was applied to the 15 stress-related questions which produced four distinct factors for evaluation. Multiple linear regression models were performed to explore the association of personal characteristics with each score of the four factors. Binary logistic analysis was used to explain the association of personal characteristics and these four factors with the GHQ-12. Results: There were 2,691 valid surveys received. The prevalence of emotional distress (defined as GHQ-12  12) was noted in 47.7% (95%CI:45.7C49.6%) HCWs. Females (OR = 1.43, 95%CI:1.09C1.86) were more likely to have a psychological distress than males.

As they might be potential mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, effective preparation methodsincluding extraction, isolation, and purification of caffeoylquinic acids from plant sourcesare in great demand. The aim of this study was to fractionate the caffeoylquinic acids from cultivated wormwood (Artemisia absinthium L.) and silver wormwood (Artemisia ludoviciana Nutt.) herb acetone extracts and evaluate their phytochemical profiles, antioxidant activity (radical scavenging and reducing activities), effects on kidney mitochondrial functions, and cytochrome-c-reducing properties. The main findings of our study are as follows: (1) Aqueous fractions purified from wormwood and silver wormwood herb acetone extracts are rich in monocaffeoylquinic acids (chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid), while methanolic fractions purified from wormwood and silver wormwood herb acetone extracts are rich in dicaffeoylquinic acids (4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid). Aqueous fractions purified from wormwood and silver wormwood herb acetone extracts were solely composed of monocaffeoylquinic acids. Methanolic fractions purified from wormwood and silver wormwood herb acetone extracts contained only dicaffeoylquinic acids. (2) Fractions purified from silver wormwood herb acetone extracts stood out as having the greatest content of caffeoylquinic acids. (3) The greatest radical scavenging activity was determined in the dicaffeoylquinic-acid-rich fraction purified from silver wormwood herb acetone extract; the greatest reducing activity was determined in the dicaffeoylquinic-acid-rich fraction purified from wormwood herb acetone extract. (4) The effect of both fractions on mitochondrial functions was dose-dependent; lower concentrations of caffeoylquinic-acid-rich fractions had no effect on mitochondrial functions, whereas higher concentrations of caffeoylquinic-acid-rich fractions reduced the state 3 respiration rate (with the complex-I-dependent substrate glutamate/malate). (5) Both monocaffeoylquinic- and dicaffeoylquinic-acid-rich fractions possessed cytochrome-c-reducing properties; the greatest cytochrome c reduction properties were determined in the dicaffeoylquinic-acid-rich fraction purified from wormwood herb acetone extract.

We studied the difference in risk perception in these two groups, and how this related to demographic variables and psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and death anxiety. To this aim, we administered an online questionnaire about COVID-19 together with other questionnaires assessing the psychological condition of participants. First, we found that the exposition to infection risk, due to living area or job, increased the perceived stress and anxiety (i.e. medical staff in North Italy was more stressed and anxious respect to both medical- and non-medical participants from Center and South Italy). Then, we conducted hierarchical logistic regression models on our data to assess the response odds ratio relatively to each predictor on each dependent variable. We found that health workers reported higher risk perception, level of worry, and knowledge as related to COVID-19 infection compared to general population. Also psychological state, gender, and living area were important predictors of these factors. Instead, judgments about behaviors and containment rules were more linked to demographics, such as gender and alcohol consumption.

We therefore used the gold-standard technique of liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (LCMSMS) to address this uncertainty. DesignAll patients admitted to Cambridge University Hospitals with COVID-19 between March 10, 2020 and May 13, 2021, and in whom a stored blood sample was available for analysis, were eligible for inclusion. MethodsAldosterone was measured by LCMSMS and by immunoassay; cortisol and renin were determined by immunoassay. ResultsUsing LCMSMS, aldosterone was below the limit of detection (<70 pmol/L) in 74 (58.7%) patients. Importantly, this finding was discordant with results obtained using a commonly employed clinical immunoassay (Liaison Diasorin(R)), which over-estimated aldosterone compared to the LCMSMS assay (intercept 14.1 [95% CI -34.4 to 54.1] + slope 3.16 [95% CI 2.09 to 4.15] pmol/L). The magnitude of this discrepancy did not clearly correlate with markers of kidney or liver function. Solvent extraction prior to immunoassay improved the agreement between methods (intercept -14.9 [95% CI -31.9 to -4.3] and slope 1.0 [95% CI 0.89 to 1.02] pmol/L) suggesting the presence of a water-soluble metabolite causing interference in the direct immunoassay. We also replicated a previous finding that blood cortisol concentrations were often increased, with increased mortality in the group with serum cortisol levels >744 nmol/L (p=0.005). ConclusionWhen measured by LCMSMS, aldosterone was found to be profoundly low in a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 at the time of hospital admission. This has likely not been detected previously due to high levels of interference with immunoassays in patients with COVID-19, and this merits further prospective investigation.","output":"Unquantifiably low aldosterone concentrations are prevalent in hospitalised COVID-19 patients but may not be revealed by chemiluminescent immunoassay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a flavin-dependent mitochondrial enzyme catalyzing the fourth step in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway.

A substantial portion of this increase is attributable to the widespread access to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, either used alone or encountered as adulterants in heroin or psychostimulants such as cocaine or methamphetamine. Vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (mAb) offer prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against opioid overdose by binding to the target opioids in serum, and reducing drug distribution to the brain. Here, the efficacy of anti-fentanyl vaccines and mAb for prevention and reversal of fentanyl-induced overdose was investigated in rats. Rats were immunized with a candidate vaccine consisting of a fentanyl-based hapten (F) conjugated to a diphtheria toxin carrier protein (CRM), or with a control vaccine. Rats were challenged subcutaneously with doses of 0.25 mg/kg fentanyl every 15 minutes to a cumulative dose of 2.25mg/kg, or until cardiac and/or respiratory arrest occurred. Prophylactic immunization with F-CRM was effective in counteracting fentanyl-induced respiratory depression, bradycardia, and antinociception;and reduced the incidence of mortality compared to control. Additionally, a murine anti-fentanyl mAb was isolated from mice immunized against fentanyl. Purified mAb had previously shown pre-exposure efficacy in protecting mice and rats from fentanyl challenges. To evaluate the efficacy of mAb in reversing fentanyl overdose post-exposure, rats were dosed with 0.1-0.5 mg/kg fentanyl, and 15 minutes later received 40 mg/kg mAb, 0.1 mg/kg naloxone, or both intravenously. Within 15 minutes, treatment with mAb reduced fentanyl-induced respiratory depression and bradycardia, and compared favorably to naloxone in terms of the degree and rate of onset of protection. One week later, rats retained mAb-induced protection from the effects of additional doses of fentanyl, as confirmed by a 10-fold reduction of the distribution of fentanyl to the brain compared to control. These results support translation of vaccines and mAb as medical interventions to prevent and reverse opioid overdose related to fentanyl and its analogs.","output":"Anti-fentanyl Vaccines and Monoclonal Antibodies are Effective in Prevention and Reversal of Fentanyl-induced Overdose in Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics have been explored to treat various genetic disorders.

METHODS: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2200 self-selected, assessed volunteers and their children. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale, emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. Descriptive analysis was carried out to summarize demographic and participant characteristics, Chi-square analysis to explore associations between categorical variables and anxiety levels and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of anxiety levels in adults and emotional problems in children. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%). Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for GAD-7 scores showed that being female, high levels of worry associated with COVID-19, intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smoking were associated with higher levels of anxiety. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for SDQ showed that higher emotional problems were reported for children in lower and higher secondary education, and parents who had severe anxiety were seven times more likely to report emotional problems in their children.

Studies report an increase in perinatal parental distress as well as symptoms of anxiety or depression in children during the pandemic. Currently, little is known about the impact of the pandemic on infants and their development. Infant regulatory problems (RPs) have been identified as early indicators of child socio-emotional development, strongly associated with maternal mental health and the early parentCinfant interaction. Our study investigates whether early parenthood under COVID-19 is associated with more maternal depressive symptoms and with a perception of their infants as having more RPs regarding crying/fussing, sleeping, or eating, compared to mothers assessed before the pandemic. Methods As part of a longitudinal study, 65 women who had given birth during the first nationwide disease control restrictions in Northern Germany, were surveyed at 7 months postpartum and compared to 97 women assessed before the pandemic. RPs and on maternal depressive symptoms were assessed by maternal report. Number of previous children, infant negative emotionality, and perceived social support were assessed as control variables. Results Compared to the control cohort, infants born during the COVID-19 pandemic and those of mothers with higher depressive symptoms were perceived as having more sleeping and crying, but not more eating problems. Regression-based analyses showed no additional moderating effect of parenthood under COVID-19 on the association of depressive symptoms with RPs. Infant negative emotionality was positively, and number of previous children was negatively associated with RPs. Limitations Due to the small sample size and cross-sectional assessment, the possibility for more complex multivariate analysis was limited. The use of parent-report questionnaires to assess infant RPs can support but not replace clinical diagnosis. Conclusions The pandemic conditions affecting everyday life may have a long-term influence on impaired infant self- and maternal co-regulation and on maternal mental health. This should be addressed in peripartum and pediatric care.

This US survey of breast cancer survivors characterizes treatment delays early period in the pandemic. METHODS: We developed a survey and administered it to 609 adult breast cancer survivors in the US. We used snowball sampling with invitations distributed via social media. We used logistic regression to select a model of delay from a pool of independent variables including race, cancer stage, site of care, health insurance, and age. We used descriptive statistics to characterize delay types. RESULTS: Forty-four percent of participants reported cancer care treatment delays during the pandemic. Delays in all aspects of cancer care and treatment were reported. The only variable which had a significant effect was age (97 (.95, 99), p < 0.001) with younger respondents (M = 45.94, SD = 10.31) reporting a higher incidence of delays than older respondents (M = 48.98, SD = 11.10).

One of the most effective strategies in reducing the severity of the pandemic is social distancing, where members of the population systematically reduce their interactions with others to limit the transmission rate of the virus. However, the implementation of social distancing can be difficult and costly, making it imperative that both policy makers and the citizenry understand the potential benefits if done correctly and the risks if not. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to study the effects of social distancing on the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Canada. The model is based upon a standard epidemiological SEIRD model that has been stratified to directly incorporate the proportion of individuals who are following social distancing protocols. The model parameters characterizing the disease are estimated from current epidemiological data on COVID-19 using machine learning techniques. The results of the model show that social distancing policies in Canada have already saved thousands of lives and that the prolonged adherence to social distancing guidelines could save thousands more. Importantly, our model indicates that social distancing can significantly delay the onset of infection peaks, allowing more time for the production of a vaccine or additional medical resources. Furthermore, our results stress the importance of easing social distancing restrictions gradually, rather than all at once, in order to prevent a second wave of infections. Model results are compared to the current capacity of the Canadian healthcare system by examining the current and future number of ventilators available for use, emphasizing the need for the increased production of additional medical resources.","output":"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 containment strategies with considerations for limited medical resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is currently a global health crisis. This viral infection is frequently associated with hypercoagulability with a high incidence of thromboembolic complications that can be fatal. In many situations, the standard coagulation tests (SCT) fail to detect this state of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 since clotting times are not or only mildly affected. The role of viscoelastic tests such as rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM?) during this pandemic has been explored in this review. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy as evident from thromboelastometry parameters can vary from hypercoagulability due to increased fibrin polymerization and decreased fibrinolysis to bleeding from hypocoagulability. A multi-modal diagnostic and monitoring approach including both thromboelastometry and SCT such as plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations is recommended. Thromboelastometry provides comprehensive information about the full coagulation status of each patient and detects individual variations. Since COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is a very dynamic process, the phenotype can change during the course of infection and in response to anticoagulation therapy. Data from published literature provide evidence that combined thromboelastometry and SCT analysis will be helpful in detecting hemostasis issues, guiding anticoagulant therapy and improving outcome in COVID-19 patients.

Loci AC-1, AC-3, AC-4 and GCP-7 showed 5, 8, 2 and 4 alleles, respectively. The allelic frequencies ranged from 0.0070 to 0.8560 and were significantly different between strains. In addition, nucleotide diversity analyses showed a significant variation within and between strains. The variations in the nucleotide sequence of the different alleles were translated in some cases into changes in the amino acid sequence.

Widespread acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is crucial for achieving adequate immunization coverage to end the global pandemic. However, to date, there are still hesitant people, especially among the younger population groups. For this reason, it is essential to identify the psychological variables that may affect vaccination intention among these at risk groups and to select possible successful communication frames in order to increase vaccination rates. An online cross-sectional survey was carried out on 208 Italian citizens younger than 50 years old, to explore message framing effects on their intention to receive the vaccination and to understand the psychological factors influencing it. Results showed that depending on the goal (stimulate vaccination intention, vaccination trust, or vaccine attitude), not all the communication stimuli are equally effective on this target population. Furthermore, the study showed that sociodemographic variables do not help to explain the vaccination intention of the younger population groups, while the psychological variables have been found to have a stronger impact on such attitude. Trust and attitudes towards vaccines, concern about the pandemic and concern about infecting others have been found to be the most effective predictive variables of people vaccination intention. The study results underline the importance of understanding the psychological roots behind vaccine hesitancy to shape sensitization actions and vaccination campaigns targeting this population group.","output":"The Effect of Message Framing on COVID-19 Vaccination Intentions among the Younger Age Population Groups: Results from an Experimental Study in the Italian Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recombinant antibodies (Abs) against the SARS-CoV-2 virus hold promise for treatment of COVID-19 and high sensitivity and specific diagnostic assays. Here, we report engineering principles and realization of a Protein-fragment Complementation Assay (PCA) detector of SARS-CoV-2 antigen by coupling two Abs to complementary N- and C-terminal fragments of the reporter enzyme Gaussia luciferase (Gluc). Both Abs display comparably high affinities for distinct epitopes of viral Spike (S)-protein trimers. Gluc activity is reconstituted when the Abs are simultaneously bound to S-protein bringing the Ab-fused N- and C-terminal fragments close enough together (8 nm) to fold. We thus achieve high specificity both by requirement of simultaneous binding of the two Abs to the S-protein and also, in a steric configuration in which the two Gluc complementary fragments can fold and thus reconstitute catalytic activity. Gluc activity can also be reconstituted with virus-like particles that express surface S-protein with detectable signal over background within 5 min of incubation. Design principles presented here can be readily applied to develop reporters to virtually any protein with sufficient available structural details. Thus, our results present a general framework to develop reporter assays for COVID-19, and the strategy can be readily deployed in response to existing and future pathogenic threats and other diseases.","output":"Structure-based Design of a Specific, Homogeneous Luminescence Enzyme Reporter Assay for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The wide-scale use of liposomal delivery systems is challenged by difficulties in obtaining potent liposomal suspensions.

We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: This randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) is assessing several possible treatments in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. The trial is underway at 177 NHS hospitals from across the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either usual care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus high-titre convalescent plasma (convalescent plasma group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936. FINDINGS: Between May 28, 2020, and Jan 15, 2021, 11558 (71%) of 16287 patients enrolled in RECOVERY were eligible to receive convalescent plasma and were assigned to either the convalescent plasma group or the usual care group. There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the two groups: 1399 (24%) of 5795 patients in the convalescent plasma group and 1408 (24%) of 5763 patients in the usual care group died within 28 days (rate ratio 100, 95% CI 093C107; p=095). The 28-day mortality rate ratio was similar in all prespecified subgroups of patients, including in those patients without detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at randomisation. Allocation to convalescent plasma had no significant effect on the proportion of patients discharged from hospital within 28 days (3832 [66%] patients in the convalescent plasma group vs 3822 [66%] patients in the usual care group; rate ratio 099, 95% CI 094C103; p=057). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients meeting the composite endpoint of progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death (1568 [29%] of 5493 patients in the convalescent plasma group vs 1568 [29%] of 5448 patients in the usual care group; rate ratio 099, 95% CI 093C105; p=079).

However, there are no reports about the effect of the ongoing pandemic on arrhythmias in the non-infected population. We measured the arrhythmia burden in a non-infected population with cardiac implantable devices. METHODS: The arrhythmia burden during the COVID-19 pandemic was compared to a 6-month interval in the pre-COVID-19 period. The COVID-19 pandemic was divided into high-risk (17 January 2020 to 16 March 2020) and low-risk periods (17 March 2020 to 17 July 2020) according to whether there were locally infected patients. Arrhythmia burdens were compared among the pre-COVID-19, high-risk, and low-risk periods. RESULTS: A total of 219 patients with 1859 episodes were included. We observed a larger proportion of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) during the COVID-19 pandemic (38.36% vs 26.03%, p = 0.006). There was not significantly more ventricular arrhythmia during the COVID period than the pre-COVID-19 period (p > 0.05). During the high-risk period, daily frequency of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) (0.0172, 0.0475 vs 0.0109, 0.0164, p < 0.05), atrial tachycardia (AT) (0.0345, 0.0518 vs 0.0164, 0.0219 p < 0.05) and AF (0.0345, 0.0432 vs 0.0164, 0.0186, p < 0.05) and daily duration of NSVT (0.1982, 0.2845 vs 0.0538, 0.1640 p < 0.05) were higher and longer than those in the pre-COVID-19 period. Regression modeling showed that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic lead to an increased onset of AF (odds ratio 2.465; p < 0.01). Patients with paroxysmal AF who had undergone a previous radiofrequency ablation had a lower burden of AF (incidence 21.43% vs 55.00%, P = 0.049, daily frequency 0.0000, 0.0027 vs 0.0000, 241.7978, P = 0.020) during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a higher burden of arrhythmias in non-infected patients. Patients would experience a lower burden of AF following radiofrequency ablation treatment, and this effect persisted during the pandemic.","output":"One-Year Recording of Cardiac Arrhythmias in a Non-Infected Population with Cardiac Implantable Devices During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a demonstration of our PAAMS 2021 paper using data-driven analysis of airport terminal operations and An Agent-based Airport Terminal Operations Model Simulator (AATOM).

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) are the most commonly performed metabolic surgeries worldwide, but comparative efficacy is uncertain. This study employed network meta-analysis to compare weight loss, T2DM remission and perioperative complications in adults between RYGB, SG and OAGB. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, trial registries were searched for randomised trials comparing RYGB, SG and OAGB. Study outcomes were excess weight loss (at 1, 2 and 3C5 years), trial-defined T2DM remission at any time point and perioperative complications. RESULTS: Twenty randomised controlled trials were included involving 1803 patients investigating the three metabolic surgical interventions. RYGB was the index for comparison. The excess weight loss (EWL) demonstrated minor differences at 1 and 2 years, but no differences between interventions at 3C5 years. T2DM remission was more likely to occur with either RYGB or OAGB when compared to SG. Perioperative complications were higher with RYGB when compared to either SG or OAGB. Two-way analysis of EWL and T2DM remission against the risk of perioperative complications demonstrated OAGB was the most positive on this assessment at all time points. CONCLUSION: OAGB offers comparable metabolic control through weight loss and T2DM remission to RYGB and SG whilst minimising perioperative complications.

Methods A retrospective, observational study using nasopharyngeal swab specimens from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) inpatients was conducted using Lumipulse? SARS-CoV-2 antigen test. Diagnostic accuracy was examined for the early (up to 10 days after onset) and late (over 10 days after onset) stages. Time-course QAT changes and reverse\\\\transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction tests results were displayed as locally estimated scatterplot smoothing curve, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to determine the appropriate cutoff value for differentiating the early and late stages. Results We obtained 100 specimens from 68 COVID-19 patients, including 51 early-stage and 49 late-stage specimens. QAT sensitivity and specificity were 0.82 (0.72C0.90) and 0.95 (0.75C0.99) for all periods, 0.93 (0.82C0.98) and 1.00 (0.39C1.00) for the early stage, and 0.66 (0.48C0.82) and 0.93 (0.69C0.99) for the late stage, respectively. The ROC analysis indicated an ideal cutoff value of 6.93 pg/mL for distinguishing early-from late-stage specimens.

The pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel Betacoronavirus, was subsequently isolated as the causative agent. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by respiratory droplets and fomites and presents clinically with fever, fatigue, myalgias, conjunctivitis, anosmia, dysgeusia, sore throat, nasal congestion, cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. In most critical cases, symptoms can escalate into acute respiratory distress syndrome accompanied by a runaway inflammatory cytokine response and multiorgan failure. As of this article's publication date, COVID-19 has spread to approximately 200 countries and territories, with over 4.3 million infections and more than 290,000 deaths as it has escalated into a global pandemic. Public health concerns mount as the situation evolves with an increasing number of infection hotspots around the globe. New information about the virus is emerging just as rapidly. This has led to the prompt development of clinical patient risk stratification tools to aid in determining the need for testing, isolation, monitoring, ventilator support, and disposition. COVID-19 spread is rapid, including imported cases in travelers, cases among close contacts of known infected individuals, and community-acquired cases without a readily identifiable source of infection. Critical shortages of personal protective equipment and ventilators are compounding the stress on overburdened healthcare systems. The continued challenges of social distancing, containment, isolation, and surge capacity in already stressed hospitals, clinics, and emergency departments have led to a swell in technologically-assisted care delivery strategies, such as telemedicine and web-based triage. As the race to develop an effective vaccine intensifies, several clinical trials of antivirals and immune modulators are underway, though no reliable COVID-19-specific therapeutics (inclusive of some potentially effective single and multi-drug regimens) have been identified as of yet.

Very little research exists on the effects of social distancing measures on this pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of government implemented social distancing measures on the cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19 in the United States on a state level, and in the 25 most populated cities, while adjusting for socio-demographic risk factors. The social distancing variables assessed in this study were: days to closing of non-essential business; days to stay home orders; days to restrictions on gathering, days to restaurant closings and days to school closing. Using negative binomial regression, adjusted rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated comparing two levels of a binary variable: above median value, and median value and below for days to implementing a social distancing measure. For city level data, the effects of these social distancing variables were also assessed in high (above median value) vs low (median value and below) population density cities. For the state level analysis, days to school closing was associated with cumulative incidence, with an adjusted rate ratio of 1.59 (95% CI:1.03,2.44), p=0.04 at 35 days. Some results were counterintuitive, including inverse associations between cumulative incidence and days to closure of non-essential business and restrictions on gatherings. This finding is likely due to reverse causality, where locations with slower growth rates initially chose not to implement measures, and later implemented measures when they absolutely needed to respond to increasing rates of infection. Effects of social distancing measures seemed to vary by population density in cities. Our results suggest that the effect of social distancing measures may differ between states and cities and between locations with different population densities. States and cities need individual approaches to containment of an epidemic, with an awareness of their own structure in terms of crowding and socio-economic variables. In an effort to reduce infection rates, cities may want to implement social distancing in advance of state mandates.","output":"Effects of Government Mandated Social Distancing Measures on Cumulative Incidence of COVID-19 in the United States and its Most Populated Cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emotional mental disorders can occur due to pandemic COVID-19.

Sixty-six percent of respondents (n=101) expressed a desire to extend their residency period. Conclusions The pandemic has had an extremely severe impact on all areas of the health system, with trainee physicians being one of the most affected groups. Among neurology residents, the crisis has caused significant shortcomings in their training and clinical activities, through the suspension of specific rotations. A high percentage of respondents wished to extend the residency period.","output":"Repercusin de la pandemia por COVID-19 en la formacin de los residentes de neurologa espa?oles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: There is compelling scientific evidence about the role of physiotherapists in vestibular rehabilitation. However, patients with vestibular-associated dizziness and balance disturbances are seldom referred to physiotherapists in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, this study aims to achieve insight into perceptions, knowledge, attitudes, and referral practices among Saudi Arabian medical doctors relating to the role of physiotherapists in vestibular rehabilitation. METHODS: A sample of 381 medical doctors practicing in Saudi Arabia participated in this nationwide cross-sectional study. The sample was obtained from 226 hospitals across 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia by stratified sampling method. The 23-item questionnaire developed by a team of experts was emailed to medical doctors practicing in various hospitals across Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: Out of 1,231 medical doctors invited, 381 medical doctors responded, giving a response rate of 30.9%. One hundred ninety-three (50.6%) medical doctors reported managing patients with vestibular rehabilitation. The most preferred specialist for managing patients with vestibular disorders was an Ear Nose Throat (ENT) specialist (n = 173, 89.6%). Related Sample Cochrans Q test showed statistically significant difference between preferred specialist for managing patients with vestibular disorders (ENT specialists, physiotherapists, nurses, occupational therapists and audiologists) (2(4) = 482.476, p = 0.001). Out of 193 medical doctors, 153 (79.2%) reported no role of the physiotherapist in vestibular rehabilitation. One hundred forty-five (75.1%) of medical doctors reported that they were not aware of the role of physiotherapists in vestibular rehabilitation. Only 27 (15.5%) medical doctors reported referring patients with vestibular disorders to physiotherapists. CONCLUSION: The study reports that physiotherapy services are underutilized in vestibular rehabilitation due to limited referral from Saudi Arabian medical doctors. Therefore, there is a need to increase the awareness among Saudi Arabian doctors about the physiotherapists role in vestibular rehabilitation.","output":"Perception, knowledge, and attitude of medical doctors in Saudi Arabia about the role of physiotherapists in vestibular rehabilitation: a cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context: The exchange of health information on the Internet has been heralded as an opportunity to improve public health surveillance. In a field that has traditionally relied on an established system of mandatory and voluntary reporting of known infectious diseases by doctors and laboratories to governmental agencies, innovations in social media and so-called user-generated information could lead to faster recognition of cases of infectious disease. More direct access to such data could enable surveillance epidemiologists to detect potential public health threats such as rare, new diseases or early-level warnings for epidemics. But how useful are data from social media and the Internet, and what is the potential to enhance surveillance? The challenges of using these emerging surveillance systems for infectious disease epidemiology, including the specific resources needed, technical requirements, and acceptability to public health practitioners and policymakers, have wide-reaching implications for public health surveillance in the 21st century. Methods: This article divides public health surveillance into indicator-based surveillance and event-based surveillance and provides an overview of each. We did an exhaustive review of published articles indexed in the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Scirus between 1990 and 2011 covering contemporary event-based systems for infectious disease surveillance. Findings: Our literature review uncovered no event-based surveillance systems currently used in national surveillance programs. While much has been done to develop event-based surveillance, the existing systems have limitations. Accordingly, there is a need for further development of automated technologies that monitor health-related information on the Internet, especially to handle large amounts of data and to prevent information overload. The dissemination to health authorities of new information about health events is not always efficient and could be improved. No comprehensive evaluations show whether event-based surveillance systems have been integrated into actual epidemiological work during real-time health events. Conclusions: The acceptability of data from the Internet and social media as a regular part of public health surveillance programs varies and is related to a circular challenge: the willingness to integrate is rooted in a lack of effectiveness studies, yet such effectiveness can be proved only through a structured evaluation of integrated systems. Issues related to changing technical and social paradigms in both individual perceptions of and interactions with personal health data, as well as social media and other data from the Internet, must be further addressed before such information can be integrated into official surveillance systems.","output":"Social Media and Internet-Based Data in Global Systems for Public Health Surveillance: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The weekday-weekend effect of anthropogenic emissions in cities, driven by the associated weekly changes in human activities, provides a unique opportunity to assess the sensitivity of observation networks (e.g., ground-based and space-borne instruments) on urban emissions. In this study, we focus on the weekly cycle amplitudes of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Los Angeles (LA) megacity, where a significant weekly cycle of human activities exists. In addition, abundant observations are being produced continuously from existing ground-based, mountaintop, and satellite platforms to monitor carbon emissions and air quality in LA. From our analysis, significant agreement can be found in observations from different platforms. For NO2, a 30%C35% Sunday decline relative to mid-week mixing ratios can be observed from both ground-based and satellite observations. For CO, the Sunday drops from ground-based, mountain-top and satellite observations are 13%C20%. The TROPOMI instrument with its high spatial resolution provides detailed spatial information on the reduction of tropospheric NO2 and CO columns on Sundays. The spatial pattern is in good agreement with traffic density in LA. Impact due to the prevailing winds from the coast in the afternoon can also be observed. For anthropogenic CO2, we show that the weekly cycle of XCO2 enhancement above background from OCO-2 observations has a Sunday decline (15%C20%) consistent with ground-based observations and TCCON. This weekly pattern of CO2 in a megacity directly detected by OCO-2 is reported for the first time. In addition, we also investigate the weekly cycles in the stable carbon isotopic composition of CO2 (13C) from ground-based observations, which demonstrates the weekly variation in fossil fuel usage in LA. Finally, using the COVID-19 lockdown period as an example of a short-term perturbation on anthropogenic emissions, we found that the weekly cycle amplitude became larger during the lockdown period primarily because of the traffic volume changes in light-duty vehicles. This study highlights the consistencies and effectiveness of existing observing platforms in monitoring the anthropogenic emissions of the LA megacity.","output":"Consistent weekly cycles of atmospheric NO2, CO, and CO2 in a North American megacity from ground-based, mountaintop, and satellite measurements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Obesity is a leading comorbidity in psoriatic disease, including both psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and is associated with adverse metabolic and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. Anthropometric parameters, such as weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio, have been extensively reported in psoriatic disease. However, the associations of body composition and fat distribution with psoriasis have not yet been fully defined. OBJECTIVES To identify whether patients with psoriatic disease, including psoriatic arthritis, have altered body composition compared with the general population, and to review existing modalities for the assessment of body composition. METHODS Electronic searches of the literature were conducted in PubMed, Medline (Ovid?), Embase (Ovid?), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Google Scholar. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by two authors independently against a set of prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria. The research question was answered with a systematic literature review and results were summarized narratively. RESULTS Twenty-five full text articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final narrative analysis. The studies were of heterogeneous design and used a range of objective measures to assess body composition, including simple anthropometric measures, bioimpedance analysis (BIA), dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT). Few studies met all the quality assessment criteria. Clinical heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS Patients with psoriatic disease reveal defined body composition changes that are independent of obesity and the customary metabolic syndrome, including higher overall body fat, visceral fat and sarcopenia. These findings emphasize that patients with psoriatic disease should be screened for abnormal adipose effects beyond their weight and body mass index (BMI). Our findings show that the last decade has seen an exciting expansion of research interest in the development and validation of new modalities for the assessment of body composition. There is no consensus on the optimal assessment method of body composition for this diverse group; hence there is a need for validation of existing modalities and standardization of assessment tools.","output":"Psoriatic disease and body composition: A systematic review and narrative synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automatic medical image segmentation plays an important role as a diagnostic aid in the identification of diseases and their treatment in clinical settings. Recently proposed models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their potential in image processing tasks, including some medical image analysis tasks. Those methods can learn various feature representations with numerous weight-shared convolutional kernels, however, the missed diagnosis rate of regions of interest (ROIs) is still high in medical image segmentation. Two crucial factors behind this shortcoming, which have been overlooked, are small ROIs from medical images and the limited context information from the existing network models. In order to reduce the missed diagnosis rate of ROIs from medical images, we propose a new segmentation framework which enhances the representative capability of small ROIs (particularly in deep layers) and explicitly learns global contextual dependencies in multi-scale feature spaces. In particular, the local features and their global dependencies from each feature space are adaptively aggregated based on both the spatial and the channel dimensions. Moreover, some visualization comparisons of the learned features from our framework further boost neural networks' interpretability. Experimental results show that, in comparison to some popular medical image segmentation and general image segmentation methods, our proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the liver tumor segmentation task with 91.18% Sensitivity, the COVID-19 lung infection segmentation task with 75.73% Sensitivity and the retinal vessel detection task with 82.68% Sensitivity. Moreover, it is possible to integrate (parts of) the proposed framework into most of the recently proposed Fully CNN-based architectures, in order to improve their effectiveness in medical image segmentation tasks.","output":"2D Medical Image Segmentation via Learning Multi-scale Contextual Dependencies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The monetary policy response to COVID-19 in various economies around the world was in many ways exceptional. This paper investigates several aspects of this response among 28 inflation targeters by looking at actions undertaken by selected monetary authorities at the outset of the pandemic-induced crisis. Evidently, the reviewed central banks assessed the pandemic to be a clear-cut case for loosening monetary policy. They promptly announced expansionary decisions, often at extraordinary meetings, using a possibly broad set of measures, with not much hesitation before reaching for unconventional ones. One of the key aspects of the response was how quickly the authorities reacted to the shock. It turned out that, on average, advanced economies announced their initial policy actions within a month, whereas emerging market economies were twice as fast. As shown by a simple econometric exercise, this difference can to a great extent be explained by the time when the first COVID-19 cases were recorded in a country, the stringency of the adopted pandemic restrictions, and the need for liquidity provisions in economies with less deep financial systems. Of relevance were also variables related to having room for manoeuvre with respect to nonstandard measures and the deviation of inflation from the target.","output":"Initial Monetary Policy Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Inflation Targeting Economies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Long-term health effects have been indicated following COVID-19; however, the impact of COVID-19 on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), including who may experience ongoing symptoms, is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To identify change in HRQOL following COVID-19 compared to pre-infection HRQOL and a matched control group, and identify predictors of patients who worsen. DESIGN: Retrospective pre-post cohort study with a matched control group. SETTING: Large healthcare system in northeast Ohio. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3,690 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who completed HRQOL surveys during routine care for ambulatory visits before and after infection. Propensity-score 1:1 match was utilized to identify controls without COVID who completed HRQOL at two time points. MAIN OUTCOMES: HRQOL was assessed with PROMIS Global Health: global mental and physical health summary scores. Pre- and post-COVID PROMIS Global Health was completed as part of routine care from 1/1/2019 to 2/29/2020 and 4/4/2020 to 11/1/2021, respectively, and extracted from the electronic health record. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients (mean age 5315; 66% female) completed PROMIS Global Health in the year prior (median 11.1 months) and after diagnosis (median 7.8 months). Compared to before infection, COVID-19 patients had a significant reduction in global mental health and stable global physical health (?0.85 and 0.05 T-score points, respectively) with clinically meaningful reduction (5 T-score points) experienced by 27% and 23% of patients, respectively. Predictors of worsening global health included being female, having depression, being hospitalized for COVID-19, and better pre-COVID global health. Compared to the control group, there was significantly worse global mental and physical health decline following COVID-19 (?0.53 and ?0.37 T-score points, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A quarter of patients with COVID-19 experienced meaningful reductions in HRQOL. Reductions in global mental and physical health were modest, although significantly worse than a control group. Additionally, identified predictors of patients who worsen may assist clinicians when counseling patients of their risk of worse HRQOL following COVID-19.","output":"Health-Related Quality of Life Mildly Affected Following COVID-19: a Retrospective Pre-post Cohort Study with a Propensity ScoreCMatched Control Group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent overdose trends are characterized by increased toxicological detection of stimulants with opioids, yet it is unclear whether these substances are mixed prior to consumption or purposefully used simultaneously. METHODS: Postmortem toxicology data were collected in Marion County, Indiana, from 45 fatal overdose cases involving heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamine, or cocaine. Substances found by death scene investigators at the scene of the fatal overdose (57 samples) were tested using high-pressure liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. We compared toxicology and LC-MS results to understand whether substances contributing to overdose were found in combination or separately at the scene of the overdose. RESULTS: Comparing toxicology reports with LC-MS results from substances found at the scene of overdose deaths involving opioids and stimulants reveal that deaths are largely the result of the co-use of opioids and stimulants, rather than use of stimulants combined with opioids. CONCLUSIONS: Collecting and testing physical samples from fatal overdose scenes and comparing these to post-mortem toxicology results is a new way to examine polydrug use patterns.

One of the key segments of the introduction of European standards is the establishment of an effective mechanism for the protection of competition in legislative and institutional terms. With the adoption of the Competition Law in 2005, which brings new solutions and is largely in line with the acquis, Bosnia and Herzegovina has made a significant step forward from the previous state of legal irregularity in this important segment. However, sixteen years of the enforcement of the BiH Competition Law have shown certain shortcomings regarding the particular solutions contained in it. These shortcomings concern the part of the provision of the law that regulates procedural issues, but also the functioning of the authority responsible for the protection of competition in Bosnia and Herzegovina and it can be assumed that these are obstructive elements in response to the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic. In order to follow the international trends, companies in BiH have entered into a process of business digitalization, which, however, being accelerated due to COVID-19 pandemic, has created many challenges before the Council of Competition ofBiH for public enforcement of the competition law.

However, there are few studies on depression in older adults and the few existing results may be contradictory, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to determine the factors associated with depression in older adults in two coastal regions of Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study uses an analytical cross-sectional design in a population of older adults, who participated in a non-governmental ambulatory social support program in Callao and Ica, two coastal regions of Peru. We administered an on-site structured questionnaire to record sociodemographic data, the Geriatric Depression Scale by Yesavage to measure depression, and the Barthel Index to assess physical function. In order to determine cognitive impairment as an exclusion criterion, the MEC-30 was used. The association between variables was assessed through contingency tables, using the odds ratio (OR) with its corresponding confidence interval (95% CI) and the X2 test. Finally, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: Out of the 244 older adults surveyed, 39% had depressive symptoms, of which 28.3% (n=69) and 10.7% (n=26) were moderately and severely depressive, respectively. The findings significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms were being 76 years old or older [p=0.005, OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.29-4.20], not participating in weekly recreational activities [p=0.004, OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.31-3.99] and the presence of comorbidities [p=0.026, OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.07-3.29].

Little is known, however, about the nuanced public opinions on the coming vaccines. We adopt a human-guided machine learning framework (using more than 40,000 rigorously selected tweets from more than 20,000 distinct Twitter users) to capture public opinions on the potential vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, classifying them into three groups: pro-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant, and anti-vaccine. We aggregate opinions at the state and country levels, and find that the major changes in the percentages of different opinion groups roughly correspond to the major pandemic-related events. Interestingly, the percentage of the pro-vaccine group is lower in the Southeast part of the United States. Using multinomial logistic regression, we compare demographics, social capital, income, religious status, political affiliations, geo-locations, sentiment of personal pandemic experience and non-pandemic experience, and county-level pandemic severity perception of these three groups to investigate the scope and causes of public opinions on vaccines. We find that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are more likely to hold polarized opinions on potential COVID-19 vaccines. The anti-vaccine opinion is the strongest among the people who have the worst personal pandemic experience. Next, by conducting counterfactual analyses, we find that the U.S. public is most concerned about the safety, effectiveness, and political issues regarding potential vaccines for COVID-19, and improving personal pandemic experience increases the vaccine acceptance level.

Healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients are on the frontline and thereby confronted with enormous demands. Although early reports exist on the psychological impact of the pandemic on frontline medical staff working in Asia, little is known about its impact on healthcare professionals in other countries and across various work sectors. The present cross-sectional, online survey sought to investigate common work stressors among healthcare professionals, their psychological stress as well as coping resources during the pandemic. METHODS: A sample of 575 healthcare professionals (57% male) in three different sectors (hospital, prehospital emergency care, and outpatient service) reported their experiences concerning work and private stressors, psychological stress, and coping strategies between April 17, 2020 and June 5, 2020. To capture pandemic-specific answers, most of the items were adapted or newly developed. Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) were conducted to detect underlying latent factors relating to COVID-specific work stressors. In a next step, the effects of these latent stressors across various work sectors on psychological stress (perceived stress, fatigue, and mood) were examined by means of structural equation models (SEM). To add lived experience to the findings, responses to open-ended questions about healthcare professionals stressors, effective crisis measures and prevention, and individual coping strategies were coded inductively, and emergent themes were identified. RESULTS: The EFA revealed that the examined work stressors can be grouped into four latent factors: fear of transmission, interference of workload with private life, uncertainty/lack of knowledge, and concerns about the team. The SEM results showed that interference of workload with private life represented the pivotal predictor of psychological stress. Concerns about the team had stress-reducing effects. The latent stressors had an equal effect on psychological stress across work sectors. On average, psychological stress levels were moderate, yet differed significantly between sectors (all p < .001); the outpatient group experienced reduced calmness and more stress than the other two sectors, while the prehospital group reported lower fatigue than the other two sectors. The prehospital group reported significantly higher concerns about the team than the hospital group (p < .001). In their reports, healthcare professionals highlighted regulations such as social distancing and the use of compulsory masks, training, experience and knowledge exchange, and social support as effective coping strategies during the pandemic. The hospital group mainly mentioned organizational measures such as visiting bans as effective crisis measures, whereas the prehospital sector most frequently named governmental measures such as contact restrictions. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the need for sector-specific crisis measures to effectively address the specific work stressors faced by the outpatient sector in particular. The results on pandemic-specific work stressors reveal that healthcare professionals might benefit from coping strategies that facilitate the utilization of social support. At the workplace, team commitment and knowledge exchange might buffer against adverse psychological stress responses. Schedules during pandemics should give healthcare workers the opportunity to interact with families and friends in ways that facilitate social support outside work. Future studies should investigate cross-sector stressors using a longitudinal design to identify both sector- and time-specific measures. Ultimately, an international comparison of stressors and measures in different sectors of healthcare systems is desirable.","output":"Stressors faced by healthcare professionals and coping strategies during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper reviews the COVID-19 stay home regulations as enacted by the government of Uganda in relation to the freedom of Movement with the objective of discovering whether the stay home rules are integrated into the mainstream limitation-upon-limitation Test as set out by the judicial jurisprudence and, if so, whether they are justified, thus invalidating a state of emergency as suggested by other Human Rights Activists.

RECENT FINDINGS: Molecular biology approaches, including PCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS), have become powerful tools for epidemiological investigation. PCR approaches form the basis for many high-sensitivity diagnostic tests and can supplement traditional contact tracing and surveillance strategies to define risk networks and transmission patterns. WGS approaches can further define the causative agents of disease, trace the origins of the pathogen, and clarify routes of transmission. When coupled with clinical datasets, such as electronic medical record data, these approaches can investigate co-correlates of disease and pathogenesis. In the ongoing HIV epidemic, these approaches have been effectively deployed to identify treatment gaps, transmission clusters and risk factors, though significant barriers to rapid or real-time implementation remain critical to overcome. Likewise, these approaches have been successful in addressing some questions of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenesis, but the nature and rapid spread of the virus have posed additional challenges.

Here, we highlight the v3 integrin as the main molecule responsible for SARS-CoV-2 infection of HL-mECs via a clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Indeed, pretreatment of virus with v3 integrin or pretreatment of cells with a monoclonal antibody against v3 integrin was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into HL-mECs. Surprisingly, the anti-Spike antibodies evoked by vaccination were neither able to impair Spike/integrin interaction nor to prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry into HL-mECs. Our data highlight the RGD motif in the Spike protein as a functional constraint aimed to maintain the interaction of the viral envelope with integrins.

Few large studies on this issue have been conducted and most of them have been performed as part of penicillin hypersensitivity studies. OBJECTIVE: We described our 26-year experience exploring cephalosporin drug hypersensitivity, from which we identified epidemiological and cross-reactivity data. METHODS: We included 476 patients who reported Drug Hypersensitivity Reaction (DHR) to cephalosporin and underwent an allergy workup between January 1992 and July 2018 in the Allergy Unit of the University Hospital of Montpellier (France). According to their structural side chain R1 homology we worked with four classes of cephalosporins. Logistic regression analysis was used to search for risk factors for hypersensitivity to cephalosporin (positive skin test or provocation test results). RESULTS: Cephalosporin hypersensitivity was proven in 22.3% of the patients referred in our Unit, according to positive ST (51.9%) or DPT to the culprit drug (48.1%). One in five patients were children and cephalosporin hypersensitivity was confirmed in 15% (47.6% of them by means of ST). In the cephalosporin hypersensitive population, initial reactions were mostly immediate (68.9%) and anaphylactic (72.7%). Cross-reactivity with aminopenicillins was the most frequent pattern of cross-reactivity. In multivariate analysis, immediate reactions (OR=3 (95%CI [1.6-5.5]), p<0.001)), anaphylactic shock (OR=6.5 (95%CI [3.3-13.1], p<0.001)) and anaphylaxis (OR=3.1 (95%CI [1.6-6.1], p<0.001)) and multiple reactions to the same or several cephalosporins (OR=2.0 (95% CI [1-3.5], p=0.04)) were statistically associated with confirmed DHR. DPT was generally safe, but elicited anaphylaxis in 20% of patients. Systemic reactions during skin testing occurred in 9.1% of positive patients, almost always related to anaphylactic index reactions. Non-immediate confirmed DHR to cephalosporins were rare and occurred in less than 10% of the positive patients. CONCLUSION: Almost a quarter of the tested patients were confirmed as hypersensitive to cephalosporins; sensitivity of skin testing was 51.9%, thus, half of the positive patients needed a DPT in order to prove the diagnosis.","output":"Cephalosporin hypersensitivity: descriptive analysis, cross-reactivity and risk factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Primary rhesus monkey kidney cells (RhMK) can be used for the detection of respiratory viruses, including influenza and parainfluenza. The human colon adeno-carcinoma cell line, CACO-2, has been previously used for the growth of multiple influenza viruses, including seasonal, novel and avian lineages. OBJECTIVE We compared CACO-2, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK), and RhMK cells for the isolation of viruses from patients presenting with influenza like-illness (ILI). STUDY DESIGN Nasopharyngeal specimens from patients with ILI in primary care settings were processed for conventional viral culture in MDCK, RhMK, and CACO-2. Cells were examined microscopically for cytopathic effect (CPE) and confirmatory testing included immunofluorescent antigen (IFA) detection and real-time RT-PCR. Additionally, 16 specimens positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by PCR were inoculated on CACO-2 cells. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test with IBM Statistical Program. RESULTS Of 1031 respiratory specimens inoculated, viruses were isolated and confirmed from 331 (32.1%) in MDCK cells, 304 (29.5%) in RhMk cells, and 433 (42.0%) in CACO-2 cells. These included influenza A/(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), influenza B, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1, 2, and 3, human coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E), human adenovirus (HAdV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV 1), and enterovirus (EV). Influenza A viruses grew best in the CACO-2 cell line. Time to observation of CPE was similar for all three cell types but unlike RhMK and MDCK cells, virus-specific morphological changes were indistinguishable in CACO-2 cells. None of the 16 specimens positive for RSV by PCR grew on CACO-2 cells. CONCLUSIONS The overall respiratory virus culture isolation rate in CACO-2 cells was significantly higher than that in RhMK or MDCK cells (p < 0.05). CACO-2 cells also supported the growth of some viruses that did not grow in either RhMK or MDCK cells.

The incomplete remissions favor the aggravation of neurobiological dysfunctions and pathogenesis of severe somatic comorbidities. The etiopathogenic mechanisms of depression are complex and involve multisystemic risk factors (genetic, neuroanatomic, neurobiochemical, neuroendocrine and psychosocial). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is used in all the stages of depression, as independent therapeutic method or as support of pharmacotherapy. Patients, Materials and Methods: This study has evaluated the therapeutic response of depression in M (medication) group with 136 patients under pharmacotherapy, compared with P (psychotherapy and medication) group with 137 patients treated simultaneously with medication and CBT, and the factors that can improve therapeutic management. Results: Patients with depression had predominantly a reactive onset, recurrent evolution of at least four episodes, and frequent somatic comorbidities. After treatment, a significant improvement of depressive symptomatology was recorded especially in M group (72.06%), compared to P group (88.32%), p<0.01, as well as a significant difference in regaining functional skills (69.12% C M group, 93.43% C P group; p<0.001). The therapeutic response was significantly correlated with age (p<0.01), social-economical involvement and education level. Conclusions: CBT demonstrated efficiency in the treatment of major depressive disorder in association with pharmacotherapy.

Consequently, OT localization in the lower right quadrant is more frequent, and therefore it can mimic acute appendicitis clinical onset.In most cases, OT is defined as \\"primary\\" in the absence of any other underlying pathologies, or, rarely, \\"secondary\\", when caused by other intra-abdominal diseases such as inguinal hernia, tumors, cysts or post-surgical scarring. To date, clinical diagnosis of OT still remains a challenging one in a preoperative setting and most cases are diagnosed intraoperatively. If diagnosis is correctly achieved preoperatively by adequate imaging examinations, most patients presenting with OT do not undergo surgery anymore. Such considerations gain importance at the time of COVID 19 pandemic, where a conservative management and an early discharge may be preferred owing to in-hospital morbidity after abdominal surgery whenever surgery may be avoided. METHODS AND RESULTS We present a case of an OT successfully treated in a non-operative manner during COVID-19 outbreak in Norhern Italy and offer a review of the literature that supports such a clinical attitude. Conclusions: OT preoperative diagnosis is challenging and is usually achieved by abdominal CT-scan. The suggested OT initial management is conservative, leaving a surgical approach, preferably by laparoscopy, for the 15% of cases not improving with a non-surgical approach.","output":"Omental torsion at the time of COVID-19 in Northern Italy: a case report of conservative management with a review of the pertinent literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: and Importance: Gastric diverticula (GDs) are typically formed on the posterior wall due to congenital or acquired causes. Although diverticula are not uncommon throughout the gastrointestinal tract, GDs are the least common type, and their presence in the prepyloric area is extremely rare. GDs are frequently asymptomatic but can present with serious complications that require surgical intervention in rare cases. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (DM) presents with acute onset left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain. Based on presenting symptoms, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed to evaluate possible causes of abdominal pain. Interestingly, EGD revealed a moderately sized (3 cm) prepyloric diverticulum with a small polyp surrounded by normal gastric tissue. Biopsying of the intra-diverticular polyp revealed no abnormal pathology. Further assessment with Computerized Tomographic (CT) scan identified the diverticulum but with no other related gastric or gastrointestinal changes or pathology. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The diverticulum was excluded as a cause of the pain. Hence, a conservative management approach was followed with no change in status for the following three months of observation. The patient continued to report non-specific symptoms but denied further episodes of abdominal pain or serious symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: GDs present with a wide variety of symptoms making the diagnosis difficult without thoroughly examining the entire anatomic region of potential pathology. Although GDs are rare, they are easily identified via EGD or imaging modalities.

In the human hemo-chorial placentation the chorionic villi penetrate the wall of the uterine spiral arteries, to provide increasing amounts of nutrients and oxygen for optimal fetal growth. In any physiological pregnancy the natural maternal response is of a Th1 inflammatory type, aimed at avoiding blood loss through the arteriolar wall openings. The control of the vascular function, during gestation as in any other condition, is achieved through the action of two main types of prostanoids: prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane on the one hand (for vasoconstriction and coagulation), prostacyclin on the other (for vasodilation and blood fluidification). The control of the maternal immune response is upon the responsibility of the fetus itself. Indeed, the chorionic villi are able to counteract the natural maternal response, thus changing the inflammatory Th1 type into the anti-inflammatory Th2. Clinical and experimental research in the past half century address to inflammation as the leading cause of abortion, pregnancy loss, premature delivery and related pulmonary, cerebral, intestinal fetal syndromes. Increased level of Interleukin 6, Interleukin 1-beta, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alfa, Interferon-gamma, are some among the well-known markers of gestational inflammation. On the other side, COVID-19 pneumonia is a result of extensive inflammation induced by viral replication within the cells of the respiratory tract. As it may happen in the uterine arteries in the absence of an effective fetal control, viral pneumonia triggers pulmonary vascular coagulation. The cytokines involved in the process are the same as those in gestational inflammation. As the fetus breathes throughout the placenta, fetal death from placental thrombosis is similar to adult death from pulmonary thrombosis. Preventing and counteracting inflammation is mandatory in both conditions.

Several studies have investigated the use of colchicine in COVID-19 due to its anti-inflammatory effects. However, the data regarding its efficacy is still limited and conflicting. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of colchicine on mortality and the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search of electronic databases from inception through April 10, 2021, for all peer-reviewed studies that evaluated the clinical benefits of colchicine COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was the mortality rate. The secondary outcomes included the risk of mechanical ventilation, improvement in systematic inflammation as indicated by changes in serum C-reactive protein, and the risk of adverse events. Pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained by the Mantel-Haenszel method within a random-effect model. RESULTS: A total of eight studies involving 926 COVID-19 patients (406 patients received colchicine along with standard-of-care (SOC) therapy and 520 received SOC therapy alone) were included. The mean age was 63.714.7 years, and males represented 63.3%. Mortality rate was significantly lower in the colchicine group compared to SOC (RR 0.49 (95% CI: 0.34-0.72, P = 0.0002). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.31-1.57, P = 0.38). Furthermore, colchicine significantly lowered serum CRP levels (MD -0.40, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.03, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that colchicine showed improvement in mortality in COVID-19 patients. However, there was no significant improvement in the risk of mechanical ventilation. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Colchicine may be a potential therapeutic option for COVID-19. Even though the results are encouraging, we need more large-scale RCTs to better characterize the clinical benefits of colchicine in COVID-19 patients.

Melt blending is one of the easy ways to increase the usage of lignin in commercial applications. However, the degradation of the final product performance and increase in the production time and costs are of major concern. In the current work, the effects of blending lignin, extracted from tobacco plants, with polypropylene (PP) on the injection molding parameters, physical, thermal and mechanical properties are investigated. Blends of lignin (5, 15 and 30% by wt.) with PP were prepared using a Filabot single screw extruder. Results show that tensile strength decreases by 3.2%, 9.9% and 5.4% at 5 wt. %, 15 wt. %, and 30 wt. % of lignin addition, respectively. The tensile stiffness was almost unaffected by the addition of up to 15% lignin, but a 23% increase was observed at 30 wt. % loading. When compared to lignin processed via expensive processes, such as acetylation, tobacco lignin showed superior performance. The DSC results show unaffected crystallization and melting temperatures but a decrease in enthalpies and percentage of crystallinity. The SEM and optical micrographs of the coupon cross-sections show that the extrusion process has achieved a uniform distribution of lignin particles in the PP. Thermogravimetric analysis results show that tobacco lignin accelerates the onset decomposition temperature but does not influence the decomposition peak temperature. The increase in lignin content did not have a significant influence on the injection molding parameters, implying no additional processing costs for adding lignin to the PP.

Fifty episodes of sustained atrial tachycardias, five episodes of sustained ventricular arrhythmias and thirty bradycardic events were documented. Sustained new onset atrial arrhythmias were associated with hemodynamic deterioration in 13 cases (35.1%). Patients with new onset atrial arrhythmias were older, showed higher levels of Hs-Troponin and NT-proBNP, and a more severe course of disease. The 5 ventricular arrhythmias (two ventricular tachycardias, two episodes of ventricular fibrillation, and one torsade de pointes tachycardia) were observed in 4 patients. All episodes could be terminated by immediate defibrillation/cardioversion. Five bradycardic events were associated with hemodynamic deterioration.

Given the threat to public health posed by sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the literature surrounding patient presentation in severe and non-severe cases, transmission rates and routes, management strategies, and initial clinical trial results have become available at an unprecedented pace. In this review we collate current clinical and immunologic reports, comparing these to reports of previous coronaviruses to identify mechanisms driving progression to severe disease in some patients. In brief, we propose a model wherein dysregulated type I interferon signalling leads to aberrant recruitment and accumulation of innate immune lineages in the lung, impairing establishment of productive adaptive responses, and permitting a pathologic pro-inflammatory state. Finally, we extend these findings to suggest possible treatment options that may merit investigation in randomized clinical trials.","output":"Mechanistic inferences from clinical reports of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the globe have implemented a certain degree of lockdown, restricting citizens' freedom of movement and freedom of assembly.

The quantitative and qualitative data on urban forest visits from that study were supplemented with new census data supported by selected expert interviews. We found that visitor numbers since the inception of COVID-19 measures in March 2020 have more than doubled. Visitor patterns have drastically shifted, from an even distribution throughout the day with small peaks before and after office hours to a culmination in the late afternoon. Lastly, the interviewed forestry professionals have noted that a new set of visitors, i.e. young people, families with children and non-locals, has arrived to the forest. This influx of more and novice visitors poses challenges for forest managers and urban forest policy. It is, however, also a unique opportunity for a substantial engagement of forestry with society at large, that has implications for forest policy, especially in urban areas, possibly beyond the COVID-19 pandemic era.","output":"COVID-19-induced visitor boom reveals the importance of forests as critical infrastructure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although flow diversion is a promising procedure for aneurysm treatment, the safety and efficacy of this strategy have not been sufficiently characterized. Both mechanical properties and flow reduction effects are important factors in the design of an optimal stent. OBJECTIVE We aimed to clarify the contributions of strut size and pitch to the mechanical properties (radial stiffness and longitudinal flexibility) and geometric characteristics (porosity and pore density) related to flow reduction effects. METHODS Crimping and bending behaviors of the stents were simulated with the finite element method. The relationships between the mechanical properties and geometric characteristics were investigated by changing the strut size and pitch. RESULTS Within the porosity range of 79-82%, the radial stiffness of the stent was similarly influenced by either the strut size or pitch. However, the longitudinal flexibility tended to be influenced more by strut size than by pitch. CONCLUSIONS Adjusting the strut size rather than the pitch can change the mechanical properties while minimizing the change in porosity or pore density related to flow reduction effects.","output":"Relationships between geometrical parameters and mechanical properties for a helical braided flow diverter stent."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of October 5, 2020, China has reported 2,921 cases imported from overseas. Assessing the effectiveness of China's current policies on imported cases abroad is very important for China and other countries that are facing or will face overseas imported cases. In April, we used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model to simulate the epidemic in seven foreign countries, China and the three Chinese key cities. Based on the model outside China, we estimated the proportion of people in incubation period and calculated the risk indexes for Chinese cities through analyzing aviation traffic data from these countries. Based on the model in China and the three key cities, we collected information on control measures and quantified the effectiveness of implementing the current policies at different times and intensities. Our model results showed that Shanghai, Beijing, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and Tianjin have the top five risk indexes. As of April 20, 2020, under current measures, the number of confirmed cases could be reduced by 99% compared with no air traffic restrictions and isolation measures; the reduction could be 93% with isolation of passengers only from key countries. If the current policy were postponed for 7, 10, or 20 days, the increase in the number of confirmed cases would be 1,329, 5,524, and 779,245 respectively, which is 2(.)1, 5(.)7, and 662(.)9 times the number of confirmed cases under current measures.

Our aim is to assess whether patients receiving chronic statin treatment who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have reduced in-hospital mortality if statin therapy is maintained during hospitalization. METHODS: This work is a cross-sectional, observational, retrospective multicenter study that analyzed 2921 patients who required hospital admission at 150 Spanish centers included in the nationwide SEMI-COVID-19 Network. We compared the clinical characteristics and COVID-19 disease outcomes between patients receiving chronic statin therapy who maintained this therapy during hospitalization versus those who did not. Propensity score matching was used to match each statin user whose therapy was maintained during hospitalization to a statin user whose therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, continuation of statin therapy was associated with lower all-cause mortality (OR 0.67, 0.54C0.83, p < 0.001); lower incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 0.76,0.6C0.97, p = 0.025), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR 0.78, 0.69- 0.89, p < 0.001), and sepsis (4.82% vs 9.85%, p = 0.008); and less need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (5.35% vs 8.57, p < 0.001) compared to patients whose statin therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Patients previously treated with statins who are hospitalized for COVID-19 and maintain statin therapy during hospitalization have a lower mortality rate than those in whom therapy is withdrawn. In addition, statin therapy was associated with a decreased probability that patients with COVID-19 will develop AKI, ARDS, or sepsis and decreases the need for IMV.","output":"Prior Treatment with Statins is Associated with Improved Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19: Data from the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The catalytic oxidation of CO by N2O promoted by Co+ was studied as a function of temperature in a variable-ion source temperature-adjustable selected-ion flow tube (VISTA-SIFT).

To model the pharmacokinetics of CFZ, the volume of distribution (Vd) was considered as a varying parameter that increases with continuous drug loading. Fitting the time-dependent change in drug mass and concentration data obtained from CFZ-treated mice, we performed a quantitative analysis of the systemic disposition of the drug over a 20-week treatment period. The pharmacokinetics data were fitted using various classical compartmental models sampling serum and spleen concentration data into separate matrices. The models were constructed in NONMEM together with linear and nonlinear sigmoidal expansion functions to the spleen compartment to capture the phase transition in Vd. The different modeling approaches were compared by Akaike information criteria, observed and predicted concentration correlations, and graphically. Using the composite analysis of the modeling predictions, adaptive fractional CFZ sequestration, Vd and half-life were evaluated. When compared to standard compartmental models, an adaptive Vd model yielded a more accurate data fit of the drug concentrations in both the serum and spleen. Including a nonlinear sigmoidal equation into compartmental models captures the phase transition of drugs such as CFZ, greatly improving the prediction of population pharmacokinetics and yielding further insight into the mechanisms of drug disposition.","output":"An Adaptive Biosystems Engineering Approach towards Modeling the Soluble-to-Insoluble Phase Transition of Clofazimine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the discovery of two enteroviruses detected in nasopharyngeal samples obtained from subjects with respiratory disease in Peru.

METHODS We performed a content analysis on video proposals to address stigma and mental health at universities, submitted by 15 teams from nine Asian-Pacific countries as part of a case competition. We examined five domains: (1) tone; (2) cultural context; (3) mental health issue of focus; (4) prevention versus secondary prevention; and (5) main intervention strategies. RESULTS Five main intervention strategies emerged: (1) educational campaigns; (2) peer interaction and support; (3) counseling; (4) screening; and (5) self-management. The results suggest that mental health literacy is low among students. Educational campaigns and events to increase awareness and reduce stigma were the most commonly incorporated strategy, through film screenings, mental health days, and social media. Building empathy through personal stories from celebrities and other students was also highly recommended. Second, counseling was incorporated in 80% of proposals, with a preference for peers and staff support, and web-based therapy over professional counselors, except in severe cases. Programs to increase social contact were the third most common strategy, suggesting students may feel isolated and disconnected. Creating common spaces for students to interact and pairing of students with and without mental health issues were widely suggested. The use of technology was recommended for self-management of mental health and for mandatory mental health screening, which was generally only recommended for incoming students.

Therefore, our present study aimed to (i) assess the prevalence of burnout and level of job satisfaction among physicians in Jordan, and (ii) explore physicians opinions, experiences, and perceptions during the pandemic crisis. Methods: This was a mixed-method study that utilized a structured web-based questionnaire and semi-structured individual interviews. The 10-Item Burnout Measure, Short version (BMS), and the 5-Item Short Index of Job Satisfaction (SIJS) were adopted to assess occupational burnout and job satisfaction, respectively. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, based on a conceptual framework that was developed from Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation and Job Demands-Resources Model. Descriptive statistics and regression models as well as inductive thematic analysis were used to analyze quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. Results: A total of 973 survey responses and 11 interviews were included in our analysis. The prevalence of burnout among physicians was (57.7%). Several significant factors were positively associated with burnout, including female gender, working at highly loaded hospitals, working for long hours, doing night shifts, lack of sufficient access to personal protective equipment, and being positively tested for SARS-CoV-2. Regarding job satisfaction, regression analysis revealed that age was positively associated with higher levels of job satisfaction. On contrary, being a general practitioner or specialist, working at highly loaded hospitals, low salaries, and suffering from burnout have predicted lower levels of job satisfaction.Besides, four themes have emerged from the thematic analysis: (i)Work-induced psychological distress during the pandemic, (ii)Decision-driven satisfactory and dissatisfactory experiences, (iii)Impact of the pandemic on doctor-patient communication and professional skills, and (iv)Economic impacts of the pandemic crisis and lockdown. Conclusion: A significant physical and psychological burden was associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

CoVs have exhibited a penchant for jumping species barriers throughout history with devastating effects. The emergence of highly pathogenic or infectious CoVs in humans over the past 20 years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), and most recently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underscores the significant threat that CoV spillovers pose to humans.

These naturally occurring animal CoV infections provide important examples for understanding CoV disease as many animal CoVs have complex pathogenesis similar to SARS-CoV-2 and can shed light on the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We provide an overview and update regarding selected existing animal CoVs and their primary host species, diseases caused by CoVs, how CoVs jump species, whether these CoVs pose an outbreak risk or risk to humans, and how we can mitigate these risks.","output":"Naturally Occurring Animal Coronaviruses as Models for Studying Highly Pathogenic Human Coronaviral Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The anxiety-related insomnia and other sleep disorders were mentioned as possible side effects of quarantine and stay-at-home conditions. The questions to be explored were: Are there discernable differences in hours of sleep and sleep habits between the normal operational environment and the stay-at-home condition? and How seriously anxiety-induced insomnia or other sleep disorders may affect individuals during the stay-at-home? METHODS: This international prospective study analyzed results from the sleep-wake patterns questionnaire, daily logs, and interviews. During COVID-19 pandemic, surveys were administered to the healthy volunteers with stay-at-home for 14 days or more, without previous sleep disorders; volunteers were not involved in online education/work daily timetable-related activities. RESULTS: We analyzed 14,000 subjects from 11 countries with average stay-at-home of 62 days. The most significant changes in sleep occurred during the first 14 days of stay-at-home. The difference in the sleep duration between weekdays and weekends disappeared. Most of the participants discontinued using alarm clocks. The total sleep time increased in duration up to 9:10  1:16 to the end of the quarantine/stay-at-home (+1:34, p = 0.02). The age-dependent changes in napping habits occurred. Only 1.8% of participants indicated insomnia during the first 14-day period with a decline to 0.5% after two months of stay-at-home. CONCLUSION: During the stay-at-home situation, both duration and timing of sleep significantly differ from those of daily routine and most humans sleep longer than in a schedule-dependent operational environment. An appearance of anxiety-induced insomnia is extremely rare if a healthy individual is already in the stay-at-home situation.","output":"Stay-at-home circumstances do not produce sleep disorders: An international survey during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 positive patients are being discharged from hospital to care homes approved by the Care Quality Commission for safe, high-quality care.

METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively through completion and return of a specific form by the participating centers. RESULTS: Data from 97 centers (67 public, 30 private) were analyzed. A total of 15 169 ablation procedures were reported with a mean of 155117 and a median [interquartile range] of 115 [62-227]. Because of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, both procedures and participating centers markedly decreased (-3380 procedures,-18%) and there were 5 centers less than in 2019. The most common procedure continued to be atrial fibrillation ablation (4513; 30%), well ahead of the remaining substrates, followed by ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (3188; 21%), and intranodal re-entry tachycardia (2808; 18%). Ablation of these 3 substrates continued to form the bulk of the procedures. The total success rate was slightly lower than in previous years (88%) with a similar complication rate (n=309; 2%) and mortality (n=7; 0.04%). A total of 243 procedures were performed in pediatric patients (1.6%).

Improving the diagnosis and the development of targeted therapies is still needed. The molecular pathomechanisms driving HGSC progression are not fully understood though crucial for effective diagnosis and identification of novel targeted therapy options. The oncogene CTCFL (BORIS), the paralog of CTCF, is a transcriptional factor highly expressed in ovarian cancer (but in rarely any other tissue in females) with cancer-specific characteristics and therapeutic potential. In this work, we seek to understand the regulatory functions of CTCFL to unravel new target genes with clinical relevance. We used in vitro models to evaluate the transcriptional changes due to the presence of CTCFL, followed by a selection of gene candidates using de novo network enrichment analysis. The resulting mechanistic candidates were further assessed regarding their prognostic potential and druggability. We show that CTCFL-driven genes are involved in cytoplasmic membrane functions; in particular, the PI3K-Akt initiators EGFR1 and VEGFA, as well as ITGB3 and ITGB6 are potential drug targets. Finally, we identified the CTCFL targets ACTBL2, MALT1 and PCDH7 as mechanistic biomarkers to predict survival in HGSC.

Methodology: For this purpose, the present theoretical foray will make the documentary analysis of the statistical instruments that show the marks of structural racism and necropolitics, as an instrument of social segregation, with theoretical bibliographic contributions to support the study in a critical and reflective way. In addition, the research will draw on qualitative data on coronavirus cases in the country and their projections of contagion among vulnerable populations. Results: It remains to be demonstrated that the Brazilian territory was built from the policies of spatial segregation of the peoples who were enslaved here. The marks of structural racism and necropolitical elements show that the formation of the geographical space and the absence of effective public policies to promote equality were designed to eliminate the black body and exclude the most vulnerable classes from social interaction. Such conjectures gain even greater contours when we observe the high contamination of COVID-19 in the country and the collapse of the health system, in a true tragedy announced by those who will die.

Effective nursing care includes actions to develop nurse-patient relationships and deliver physical and psychosocial care to patients. The high risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus compromises nursing care. No evidence-based nursing guidelines exist for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, leading to potential variations in patient experience, outcomes, quality and costs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: we aim to recruit 840 in-patient participants treated for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus from 14 UK hospitals, to a cluster randomised controlled trial, with embedded process and economic evaluations, of care as usual and a fundamental nursing care protocol addressing specific areas of physical, relational and psychosocial nursing care where potential variation may occur, compared with care as usual. Our coprimary outcomes are patient-reported experience (Quality from the Patients' Perspective; Relational Aspects of Care Questionnaire); secondary outcomes include care quality (pressure injuries, falls, medication errors); functional ability (Barthell Index); treatment outcomes (WHO Clinical Progression Scale); depression Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), anxiety General Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2), health utility (EQ5D) and nurse-reported outcomes (Measure of Moral Distress for Health Care Professionals).

Information on MERS-CoV has relied on small sample of patients. We updated the epidemiology, laboratory and clinical characteristics, and survival patterns of MERS-CoV retrospectively with the largest sample of followed patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of line-listed records of non-random, continuously admitted patients who were suspected (6,873) or confirmed with MERS-CoV (501) admitted to one of the four MERS-CoV referral hospitals in Saudi Arabia, 2014-2019. FINDINGS: Of the 6,873 MERS-CoV suspected persons, the majority were male (56%) and Saudi nationals (83%) and 95% had no known history that increased their risk of exposure to MERS-CoV patients or vectors (95%). More confirmed cases reported history that increased their risk of MERS-CoV infection (41%). Among the suspected, MERS-CoV confirmation (7.4% overall) was independently associated with being male, known transmission link to MERS-CoV patients or vectors, fever, symptoms for 7 days, admission through intensive care unit, and diabetes. Among persons with confirmed MERS-CoV, single symptoms were reported by 20%, 3-symptom combinations (fever, cough and dyspnea) reported by 21% and 2-symptom combinations (fever, cough) reported by 16%. Of the two-thirds (62%) of MERS-CoV confirmed patients who presented with co-morbidity, 32% had 2-\\"comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension). More than half of the MERS-CoV patents showed abnormal chest X-ray, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine kinase. About a quarter of MERS-CoV patients had positive cultures on blood, urine, or respiratory secretions. During an average hospital stay of 18 days (range 11 to 30), 64% developed complications involving liver, lungs, or kidneys. Ventilation requirement (29% of MERS-CoV cases) was independently associated with abnormal chest X-ray, viremia (Ct value <30), elevated creatinine, and prothrombin time. Death (21% overall) was independently associated with older age, dyspnea and abnormal chest X-ray on admission, and low hemoglobulin levels. INTERPRETATIONS: With two-thirds of the symptomatic persons developing multiorgan complications MERS-CoV remains the coronavirus with the highest severity (29%) and case fatality rate (21%) among the three lethal coronaviruses. Metabolic abnormalities appear to be an independent risk factor for sustained MERS-CoV transmission. The poorly understood transmission dynamics and non-specific clinical and laboratory features call for high index of suspicion among respiratory disease experts to help early detection of outbreaks.

We find that a resurgent continental epidemic could occur as many as 5 weeks earlier when well-connected countries with stringent existing interventions end their interventions prematurely.

Mucosal delivery of adenovirus (Ad) vaccines could induce anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA in the serum and in the mucosal, respectively as indicated by vaginal wash (vw) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG but not IgA in the vw and BALF was induced by AdCoV2-S s.c.. Administration of AdCoV2-S i.n. was able to induce higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibody levels than s.c. injection. AdCoV2-SdTM i.n. induced a lower antibody responses than AdCoV2-S i.n.. Induced anti-S antibody responses by AdCoV2-S via i.n. or s.c. were not influenced by the pre-existing serum anti-Ad antibody. Novelty, S-specific IgG1 which represented Th2-mediated humoral response was dominantly induced in Ad i.n.-immunized serum in contrast to more IgG2a which represented Th1-mediated cellular response found in Ad s.c.-immunized serum. The activation of S-specific IFN-? and IL-4 in splenic Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively, was observed in the AdCoV2-S i.n. and s.c. groups, indicating the Th1 and Th2 immunity were activated.

Methods A total of 445 nasopharyngeal swabs specimens from patients with AFRS were analyzed using the RespiFinderSmart22kit (PathoFinder BV, Netherlands) and the LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system. Results Among the 225 (225/445, 51%) positive specimens, 329 positive pathogens were detected, including 298 (90.58%) viruses and 31 (9%) bacteria. The most commonly detected pathogens were influenza virus (IFV; 37.39%; 123/329), adenovirus (AdV; 17.02%; 56/329), human coronaviruses (HCoVs; 10.94%; 36/329), rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV; 10.03%; 33/329), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs; 8.51%; 28/329), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneu; 8.51%; 28/329), respectively. Among the co-infected cases (17.53%; 78/445), IFV/AdV and IFV/M. pneu were the most common co-infections. Most of the respiratory viruses were detected in summer and fall. Conclusion In our study, IFV-A was the most common respiratory pathogen among 22 detected pathogens, followed by AdV, HCoV, RV/EV, PIV, and M. pneu. Bacteria appeared less frequently than viruses, and co-infection was the most common phenomenon among viral pathogens. Pathogens were distributed among different age groups and respiratory viruses were generally active in July, September, and November.

In particular, urbanisation trends and the increasing demands of urban mobility place additional pressure on existing transportation infrastructure, and this creates new challenges for urban planners in terms of developing integrated and sustainable urban mobility policies. Here, we take a novel and holistic approach to analysing transformative pathways towards sustainable urban mobility, considering the complex dynamics in metropolitan regions. To achieve this, we develop a toolset to assess the impact of potential measures to be taken by decision makers. Our innovative approach is based on the introduction of a new system framework to link the interrelated sector parameters of mobility systems by considering the effects of innovative mixed methods (both qualitative and quantitative) on scenario development and evaluation on the basis of global trends at the macro scale and their specific influences on the mobility sector at the local scale. To this end, we used a participatory modelling approach to develop scenarios and evaluate them as integrated simulation runs via a comprehensive and holistic system dynamics (SD) model. Thus, we estimated dynamic interdependencies between all of the factors relating to the mobility sector and then assigned business decision-making criteria to the urban systems. Furthermore, we introduced a sustainable net present value framework to estimate the sustainability outcomes of government investment in urban mobility infrastructure. A case study relating to the Rhine-Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region in Germany was applied in order to simulate four scenarios co-created with stakeholders involved in our study, namely, Smart City, Sustainable/Healthy City, Deurbanisation and Business-as-Usual (BaU), which served as a solid basis from which to quantify path dependencies in terms of policy implementation.

Here we propose comparing radiation treatment delivery metrics pre- and during COVID-19 at a large Canadian radiation treatment program. Materials and Methods: Appointment information and timestamps on patient arrival, treatment mode up and completion for patients treated on nine linear accelerators between January 1, 2020 and June 22, 2020 were extracted from the electronic radiation treatment record. Data points collected (n=23,761) were initially reviewed for validity. 23,333 radiation treatment appointments were retained for analysis and divided into two comparison cohorts (pre-COVID-19 January 1st - March 13th;during COVID-19 March 16th - June 22nd). Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the timing of patient arrival against their scheduled appointment, the scheduled appointment duration, the initiation of the treatment site set-up against the scheduled appointment time, the completion of the appointment against the scheduled appointment end time, the overall time the patient spent in the department and the number of patient visits per hour. Results: Patients arrived earlier for their treatment appointment pre-COVID-19 (mean =22.33min versus 17.10 min). The average scheduled appointment was shorter pre-COVID-19 (mean=19.91min versus 21.98 min). RTs started to set-up the patient earlier than the scheduled appointment start pre COVID-19 (mean = 0.2 min early), but later during COVID-19 (mean = 3.63 min late). RTs completed the procedure ahead of schedule for both periods (mean= 6.52 min versus 5.91 min). Patients spent more time in the radiation treatment department pre COVID-19 (35.22min versus 33.17min). More patients per hour were treated pre COVID-19 (2.68 patients/hour versus 2.33 patients/hour). Conclusions: According to our data analysis, additional precaution measures introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic increased the amount of time RTs needed to complete treatment procedures, reduced treatment capacity and changed patients' habits while in and out of the radiation treatment department. Operational throughput assumptions may need to be adjusted to forecast future need for space, human resources and capital equipment investments if these measures extend beyond the pandemic.","output":"Covid-19 Pandemic Impact on Radiation Treatment Delivery Metrics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a 1-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug that shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. This compound is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). While antiviral effects have been demonstrated in cell culture and in non-human primates, the mechanism of action of Ebola virus (EBOV) inhibition for remdesivir remains to be fully elucidated. The EBOV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex was recently expressed and purified, enabling biochemical studies with the relevant triphosphate (TP) form of remdesivir and its presumptive target. In this study, we confirmed that remdesivir-TP is able to compete for incorporation with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Enzyme kinetics revealed that EBOV RdRp and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RdRp incorporate ATP and remdesivir-TP with similar efficiencies. The selectivity of ATP against remdesivir-TP is ~4 for EBOV RdRp and ~3 for RSV RdRp. In contrast, purified human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) effectively discriminates against remdesivir-TP with a selectivity value of ~500-fold. For EBOV RdRp, the incorporated inhibitor at position i does not affect the ensuing nucleotide incorporation event at position i+1. For RSV RdRp, we measured a ~6-fold inhibition at position i+1 although RNA synthesis was not terminated. Chain termination was in both cases delayed and was seen predominantly at position i+5. This pattern is specific to remdesivir-TP and its 1-cyano modification. Compounds with modifications at the 2-position show different patterns of inhibition. While 2-C-methyl-ATP is not incorporated, ara-ATP acts as a non-obligate chain terminator and prevents nucleotide incorporation at position i+1. Taken together, our biochemical data indicate that the major contribution to EBOV RNA synthesis inhibition by remdesivir can be ascribed to delayed chain termination. The long distance of five residues between the incorporated nucleotide analogue and its inhibitory effect warrant further investigation.","output":"Mechanism of Inhibition of Ebola Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase by Remdesivir"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Gastric reflux leading to pulmonary aspiration is a frequent event in mechanically ventilated, gastric-fed patients, which can lead to ventilator-associated complications and pneumonia. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were to determine the association between gastric reflux and aspiration using the presence of pepsin in oral or tracheal secretions as a marker of reflux or aspiration and to determine the association between the pH (range, 0-14) and the presence of pepsin in oral secretions. METHODS A descriptive correlational study was conducted in mechanically ventilated surgical or medical patients receiving gastric tube feedings. Oral secretions were suctioned hourly and tracheal secretions every 2 to 3 hours for 12-hour periods over 1 to 2 days in 15 patients. RESULTS There were 142 paired samples of oral tracheal secretions. A majority of samples (60%) had the same results, with 32% both pepsin-positive and 27% both pepsin-negative. The range of pH measurements was 4 to 8, with a mean of 6.3  0.05. Ninety oral specimens had a pH of 4 to 6. Forty-seven of the oral specimens with pH measures between 4 and 6 (52%) were pepsin-positive. The correlation of pH percent pepsin-positive oral secretions was not significant. CONCLUSION Aspiration events were more frequent than reflux events. Measurement of actual pepsin concentration to detect new reflux and aspiration events is recommended in future studies.

Under these circumstances, experts instead of admitting ignorance, feel obliged to give an answer, often pressurized by political or other authorities, even when such an answer is unavailable. Under these circumstances, publications based on fallacious reasoning are virtually unavoidable. In the present review, we summarize examples underlying fallacious reasoning recommendations regarding treatment with Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone inhibitors (RAASi) in the COVID-19 context. Most scientific societies emphasize that RAASi use is safe and that these agents should not be discontinued, based mainly on the results of observational studies (OSs) and occasionally preprints, as relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are currently lacking. However, over the past 4 decades, results from successful RCTs have repeatedly proved that practices based on OSs were wrong. Lack of RCTs results in uncertainty. In this setting, the physician's wisdom and knowledge related to pathophysiologic mechanisms and effect of pharmacologic agents become even more important as they may limit fallacies. Based on these principles, in diseases (e.g., mild, or moderate arterial hypertension, etc.) where equally effective alternative therapies to RAASi are available, these therapies should be applied, whereas in diseases (e.g., heart failure, diabetic kidney disease, etc.), where equally effective alternative therapy compared to RAASi is not available, RAASi should be used.

The objectives of this study were to summarize the literature on lanthanum carbonate opacities and present a visual overview. METHODS A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. We included all types of studies, including case reports/studies, describing radiological findings of lanthanum carbonate opacities in patients with chronic kidney disease. No filter for time was set. RESULTS A total of 36 articles were eligible for data extraction, and 33 articles were included in the narrative synthesis. Lanthanum carbonate opacities were most commonly reported in the intestines (26 studies, 73%), stomach (8 studies, 21%), and the aerodigestive tract (2 studies, 6%). The opacities in the intestine were most frequently described as multiple, scattered radiopaque densities, compared with the aerodigestive tract, where the opacities were described as a single, round foreign body. Suspicion of contrast medium or foreign bodies was the most common differential diagnosis. LC opacities in patients with CKD are commonly misinterpreted as foreign bodies or suspect contrast media. CONCLUSIONS CKD patients treated with LC may have opacities throughout the digestive tract that can vary in appearance. Stopping LC treatment or changing to an alternative phosphate binder prior to planned image studies can avoid diagnostic confusion.

Additionally, the molecular classification of CRC has led to the identification of different immune microenvironments linked to distinct prognosis and therapeutic response. However, the association between tumor budding and the different molecular subtypes of CRC and distinct immune profiles have not been fully elucidated. This study focused, firstly, on the validation of derived xenograft models (PDXs) for the evaluation of tumor budding and their human counterparts and, secondly, on the association between tumor budding and the immune tumor microenvironment by the analysis of gene expression signatures of immune checkpoints, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and chemokine families. Clinical CRC samples with different grades of tumor budding and their corresponding PDXs were included in this study. Tumor budding grade was reliably reproduced in early passages of PDXs, and high-grade tumor budding was intimately related with a poor-prognosis CMS4 mesenchymal subtype. In addition, an upregulation of negative regulatory immune checkpoints (PDL1, TIM-3, NOX2, and IDO1), TLRs (TLR1, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR6), and chemokine receptors and ligands (CXCR2, CXCR4, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL6, and CXCL9) was detected in high-grade tumor budding in both human samples and their corresponding xenografts. Our data support a close link between high-grade tumor budding in CRC and a distinctive immune-suppressive microenvironment promoting tumor invasion, which may have a determinant role in the poor prognosis of the CMS4 mesenchymal subtype.

Distance to outpatient clinics and high opportunity costs for caregivers can represent major barriers to access. Reducing the frequency of outpatient visits while providing training to caregivers to recognize clinical danger signs at home between outpatient visits may increase acceptability, coverage, and public health impact of SAM treatment. We investigated the effectiveness of monthly clinic visits compared to the standard weekly follow-up in the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated SAM in northwestern Nigeria. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cluster randomized crossover trial to test the noninferiority of nutritional recovery in children with uncomplicated SAM receiving monthly follow-up compared to the standard weekly schedule. From January 2018 to November 2019, 3,945 children aged 6 to 59 months were enrolled at 10 health centers (5 assigned to monthly follow-up and 5 assigned to weekly follow-up) in Sokoto, Nigeria. In total, 96% of children (n = 1,976 in the monthly follow-up group and 1,802 in the weekly follow-up group) were followed until program discharge, and 91% (n = 1,873 in the monthly follow-up group and 1,721 in the weekly follow-up group) were followed to 3 months postdischarge. The mean age at admission was 15.8 months (standard deviation [SD] 7.1), 2,097/3,945 (53.2%) were girls, and the mean midupper arm circumference (MUAC) at admission was 105.8 mm (SD 6.0). In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, the primary outcome of nutritional recovery, defined as having MUAC 125 mm on 2 consecutive visits, was analyzed using generalized linear models, with generalized estimating equations to account for clustering. Nutritional recovery was lower in the monthly follow-up group compared to the weekly group (1,036/1,976, 52.4% versus 1,059/1,802, 58.8%; risk difference: ?6.8%), and noninferiority was not demonstrated (lower bound of the confidence interval [CI] was ?11.5%, lower than the noninferiority margin of 10%). The proportion of children defaulting was lower in the monthly group than in the weekly group (109/1,976, 5.5% versus 151/1,802, 8.4%, p = 0.03). Three months postdischarge, children in the monthly group were less likely to relapse compared to those in the weekly group (58/976, 5.9% versus 78/1,005, 7.8%, p = 0.03), but cumulative mortality at 3 months postdischarge was higher in the monthly group (159/1,873, 8.5% versus 106/1,721, 6.2%, p < 0.001). Study results may depend on context-specific factors including baseline level of care and the clinical status of children presenting to health centers, and, thus, generalizability of these results may be limited. CONCLUSIONS: Where feasible, a weekly schedule of clinic visits should be preferred to maintain effectiveness of SAM treatment. Where geographic coverage of programs is low or frequent travel to outpatient clinics is difficult or impossible, a monthly schedule of visits may provide an alternative model to deliver treatment to those in need. Modifications to the outpatient follow-up schedule, for example, weekly clinic visits until initial weight gain has been achieved followed by monthly visits, could increase the effectiveness of the model and add flexibility for program delivery.

International central bankers claim that banks are solid. They have accumulated significant capital buffers. Those buffers should be further more augmented by 2027 in line with Basel III reforms. However, disregarding such a consecutive rise in the banking capital adequacy requirements, the US financial authorities undertook an unprecedented step. First time in the country history they lowered the reserve requirement to zero at the end of March 2020. Friedrich von Hayek demonstrated the fragility of the modern fractional reserve banking systems. Together with Ludwig von Mises (von Mises, 1978) he was thus able to predict the Great Depression of 1929 and explain its mechanics much in advance. Thus, we wish to utilize the agent-based modeling technique to extend von Hayek's rationale to the previously unstudied interaction of capital adequacy and reserve requirement regulation. We find that the full reserve requirement regime even without capital adequacy regulation provides more stable financial environment than the existing one. Rise in capital adequacy adds to modern banking sustainability, but it still preserves the system remarkably fragile compared to the full reserve requirement. We also prove that capital adequacy regulation is redundant when the latter environment is in place. We discuss our findings application to the potential Central Bank Digital Currencies regulation. ? 2021-IOS Press.

To identify predictors associated with disease progression, we evaluated clinical risk factors for exacerbation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was used for PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019)-diagnosed hospitalized cases between January 19, 2020, and February 19, 2020, in Zhejiang, China. We systematically analysed the clinical characteristics of the patients and predictors of clinical deterioration. RESULTS: One hundred patients with COVID-19, with a median age of 54 years, were included. Among them, 49 patients (49%) had severe and critical disease. Age ([36-58] vs [51-70], P = 0.0001); sex (49% vs 77.6%, P = 0.0031); Body Mass Index (BMI) ([21.53-25.51] vs [23.28-27.01], P = 0.0339); hypertension (17.6% vs 57.1%, P < 0.0001); IL-6 ([6.42-30.46] vs [16.2-81.71], P = 0.0001); IL-10 ([2.16-5.82] vs [4.35-9.63], P < 0.0001); T lymphocyte count ([305-1178] vs [167.5-440], P = 0.0001); B lymphocyte count ([91-213] vs [54.5-163.5], P = 0.0001); white blood cell count ([3.9-7.6] vs [5.5-13.6], P = 0.0002); D2 dimer ([172-836] vs [408-953], P = 0.005), PCT ([0.03-0.07] vs [0.04-0.15], P = 0.0039); CRP ([3.8-27.9] vs [17.3-58.9], P < 0.0001); AST ([16, 29] vs [18, 42], P = 0.0484); artificial liver therapy (2% vs 16.3%, P = 0.0148); and glucocorticoid therapy (64.7% vs 98%, P < 0.0001) were associated with the severity of the disease.

In our cohort, we found that multiple factors were associated with the severity of COVID19. Early detection and monitoring of these indicators may reduce the progression of the disease. Removing these factors may halt the progression of the disease.

In this study, we assessed the value of mNGS for bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples in the diagnosis of pulmonary infections. METHODS: From February 2018 to April 2019, BAL samples were collected from 235 patients with suspected pulmonary infections. mNGS and microbial culture were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of mNGS in pulmonary infection diagnosis. RESULTS: We employed mNGS to evaluate the alpha diversity, results suggesting that patients with confirmed pathogens had a lower microbial diversity index compared to that of patients with uncertain pathogens. For the patients admitted to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) or on a ventilator, they experienced a lower diversity index than that of the patients in the general ward or not on a ventilator. In addition, mNGS of BAL had a diagnostic sensitivity of 88.89% and a specificity of 14.86% in pulmonary infection, with 21.16% positive predictive value (PPV) and 83.87% negative predictive value (NPV). When rare pathogens were excluded, the sensitivity of mNGS decreased to 73.33%, and the specificity increased to 41.71%. For patients in the simple pulmonary infection group and the immunocompromised group, the main infection types were bacterial infection (58.33%) and mixed-infection (43.18%). Furthermore, mNGS had an advantage over culture in describing polymicrobial ecosystem, demonstrating the microbial distribution and the dominant strains of the respiratory tract in patients with different underlying diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that mNGS of BAL samples could provide more accurate diagnostic information in pulmonary infections and demonstrate the changes of respiratory microbiome in different underlying diseases.

However, very few African countries have undertaken the collection and processing of CCP. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of collecting and processing of CCP, in preparation for a randomized clinical trial of CCP for treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda. Methods In a cross-sectional study, persons with documented evidence of recovery from COVID-19 in Uganda were contacted and screened for blood donation via telephone calls. Those found eligible were asked to come to the blood donation centre for further screening and consent. Whole blood collection was undertaken from which plasma was processed. Plasma was tested for transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) and anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody titers. SARS-CoV-2 testing was also done on nasopharyngeal swabs from the donors. Results 192 participants were contacted of whom 179 (93.2%) were eligible to donate. Of the 179 eligible, 23 (12.8%) were not willing to donate and reasons given included: having no time 7(30.4%), fear of being retained at the COVID-19 treatment center 10 (43.5%), fear of stigma in the community 1 (4.3%), phobia for donating blood 1 (4.3%), religious issues 1 (4.4%), lack of interest 2 (8.7%) and transport challenges 1 (4.3%).

Currently, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms, clinical course, and prognostic implications of comorbid COVID-19 in patients with GBS. We reviewed COVID-19-associated GBS case reports published since the outbreak of the pandemic, with a database search up to August 2020, including a manual search of the reference lists for additional relevant cases. Fifty-one (51) case reports of COVID-19 patients (aged 23-84 years) diagnosed with GBS in 11 different countries were included in this review. The results revealed atypical manifestations of GBS, including para-infectious profiles and onset of GBS without antecedent COVID-19 symptoms. Although all tested patients had signs of neuroinflammation, none had SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and only four (4) patients had antiganglioside antibodies. The majority had a 1- to 10-day time interval between the onset of COVID-19 and GBS symptoms, and many had a poor outcome, with 20 out of the 51 (39.2%) requiring mechanical ventilation, and two deaths within 12 to 24 h. The atypical manifestations of COVID-19-associated GBS, especially the para-infectious profile and short time interval between the onset of the COVID-19 and GBS symptoms, increase the likelihood of symptom overlap, which can complicate the treatment and result in worsened disease progression and/or higher mortality rates.

METHODS: Rapid response teams conducted repeated assessments of IPC and monitored implementation of corrective measures using a detailed structured checklist. We ascertained the epidemiologic link between patients and calculated the secondary attack rate per 10,000 patients visiting the ER (SAR/10,000) in 3 phases of the outbreak. RESULTS: In phase I, 6 primary cases gave rise to 48 secondary cases over 4 generations, including a case that resulted in 9 cases in the first generation of secondary cases and 21 cases over a chain of 4 generations. During the second and third phases, the number of secondary cases sharply dropped to 18 cases and 1 case, respectively, from a comparable number of primary cases. The SAR/10,000 dropped from 75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55-99) in phase I to 29 (95% CI, 17-46) and 3 (95% CI, 0-17) in phases II and III, respectively.

Since the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) enzyme is the receptor that allows SARS COV2 entry into cells, the fear was that pre-existing treatment with ACEi or ARB might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection. The present article discusses these concerns. ACE2 is a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase) that contributes to the inactivation of angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters angiotensin II effects. ACEis do not inhibit ACE2. Although ARBs have been shown to up-regulate ACE2 tissue expression in experimental animals, evidence was not always consistent in human studies. Moreover, to date there is no evidence that ACEi or ARB administration facilitates SARS-COV2 cell entry by increasing ACE2 tissue expression in either animal or human studies. Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection. In summary, based on the currently available evidence and as advocated by many medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be discontinued because of concerns with COVID-19 infection, except when the hemodynamic situation is precarious and case-by-case adjustment is required.","output":"Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines are one of the most effective weapons of humankind in the fight against various infectious diseases.

The disease swept through Lombardy, which remained in lockdown for about two months, starting from the 8th of March. As of that day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy were extended to the entire country. Here, assuming that effectively there was one case \\"zero\\" that introduced the virus to the region, we provide estimates for: (a) the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population until March 8; (c) the basic (R0)and the effective reproduction number (Re) based on the estimation of the actual number of infected cases. To demonstrate the efficiency of the model and approach, we also provide a tentative forecast two months ahead of time, i.e. until May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced, on the basis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29. METHODS: To deal with the uncertainty in the number of the actual asymptomatic infected cases in the total population Volpert et al. (2020), we address a modified compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious Asymptomatic/ Infected Symptomatic/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the cases in the population that are asymptomatic or experience very mild symptoms and another modelling the infected cases with mild to severe symptoms. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the \\"effective\\" per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the proposed SEIIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem. Based on the computed parameters, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number R0 and the evolution of the effective reproduction number Re. To examine the efficiency of the model and approach, we ran the simulator to \\"forecast\\" the epidemic two months ahead of time, i.e. from March 8 to May 4. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, and the effects of social distancing and of the very strict measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020. RESULTS: Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the expected day-zero was January 14 (min-max rage: January 5 to January 23, interquartile range: January 11 to January 18). The actual cumulative number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases, while the expected value of the basic reproduction number R0 was found to be 4.53 (min-max range: 4.40- 4.65). On May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced the effective reproduction number was found to be 0.987 (interquartiles: 0.857, 1.133). The model approximated adequately two months ahead of time the evolution of reported cases of infected until May 4, the day on which the phase I of the relaxation of measures was implemented over all of Italy. Furthermore the model predicted that until May 4, around 20% of the population in Lombardy has recovered (interquartile range: a??10% to a??30%).","output":"Tracing day-zero and forecasting the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: A compartmental modelling and numerical optimization approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic represents the primary public health concern nowadays, and great efforts are made worldwide for efficient management of this crisis.

The suggested models are verified with the example of epitaxial growth of -, - and -FeSi2 silicide thin films on silicon substrates. The density of near-coincidence sites is shown to have a decisive role in the determination of epitaxial thin film orientation and explains the superior quality of -FeSi2 thin grown on Si(111) over Si(001) substrates despite larger lattice misfits. Ideal conjunctions for interfaces between the silicide phases are predicted and this allows for utilization of a thin buffer -FeSi2 layer for oriented growth of -FeSi2 nanostructures on Si(001). The thermal expansion coefficients are obtained within quasi-harmonic approximation from the DFT calculations to study the influence of temperature on the lattice strains in the derived interfaces. Faster decrease of misfits at the -FeSi2(001)||Si(001) interface compared to -FeSi2(001)||Si(001) elucidates the origins of temperature-driven change of the phase growing on silicon substrates. The proposed approach guides from bulk phase unit cells to the construction of the interface atomic structures and appears to be a powerful tool for the prediction of interfaces between arbitrary phases for subsequent theoretical investigation and epitaxial film synthesis.","output":"Prediction of orientation relationships and interface structures between -, -, -FeSi2 and Si phases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wabah Coronavirus Disease 2019 pertama kali dikonfirmasi di Indonesia per- tanggal2 Maret 2020.

The excessive inflammation and tissue damage associated with COVID-19 can lead to immediate (i.e. respiratory failure, sepsis, and ultimately, death) or long-term health problems (i.e. fatigue, dyspnea, cough, joint pain, anosmia) and the risk for these complications are higher in the elderly population, certain ethnic groups, as well as those with various co-morbid conditions. Cellular caspases play a role in the pathophysiology of a number of disorders that overlap with the list of co-morbid conditions seen in severe COVID-19. In this study, we assessed transcriptional states of caspases in immune cells from COVID-19 patients and profiled intra-cellular caspases in immune cells and red blood cells derived from a spectrum of COVID-19 patients hospitalized with acute disease or convalescent. Gene expression levels of select caspases were increased in in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection models and single cell RNA-Seq data of peripheral blood from COVID-19 patients showed a distinct pattern of caspase expression in T cell, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Flow cytometric evaluation of CD4 T cells showed up-regulation of caspase-1 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to unexposed controls, with the exception of a subset of patients with asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Convalescent COVID-19 patients with lingering symptoms (long haulers) showed persistent up-regulation of caspase-1 in CD4 T cells that was attenuated ex vivo following co-culture with a select pan-caspase inhibitor. Further, we observed elevated caspase 3 levels in red blood cells from COVID-19 patients compared to controls that were responsive to caspase inhibition. Taken together, our results expose an exuberant caspase response in COVID-19 that may facilitate immune-related pathological processes leading to severe outcomes.

Cancer pain resulting from PNI is well-documented, but the mechanisms leading to peripheral sensitization because of tumor growth are not fully known. METHODS: A retrospective study was used to examine how the use of anti-inflammatory medications affected preoperative pain in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma cancer. We then used an in vitro coculture model in which dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were incubated together with Fadu human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cancer cells to explore how cancer cells affect the electrical membrane properties of sensory neurons. RESULTS: We found that inflammation contributes to preoperative pain in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. After coculture with Fadu human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cancer cells, we identified markers of inflammation in coculture media and found evidence of neuronal sensitization, including spontaneous activity, reduced current thresholds, depolarized resting membrane potential, and enhanced responses to current stimulation in human and rat DRG neurons. In rats, these effects were influenced by sex and age: neurons from young adult female rats were resistant to changes in neuronal activity, in contrast to neurons from older adult female rats or male rats of either age group. CONCLUSIONS: Pro-inflammatory substances released in cancer cellCDRG coculture promoted neuronal hyperexcitability and may contribute to cancer pain after PNI, and these effects may differ across age groups and sexes.","output":"Fadu head and neck squamous cell carcinoma induces hyperexcitability of primary sensory neurons in an in vitro coculture model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lipid second messengers have essential roles in cellular function and contribute to the molecular mechanisms that underlie inflammation, malignant transformation, invasiveness, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious and other pathophysiological processes. The phospholipase D (PLD) isoenzymes PLD1 and PLD2 are one of the major sources of signal-activated phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) generation downstream of a variety of cell-surface receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and integrins. Recent advances in the development of isoenzyme-selective PLD inhibitors and in molecular genetics have suggested that PLD isoenzymes in mammalian cells and pathogenic organisms may be valuable targets for the treatment of several human diseases. Isoenzyme-selective inhibitors have revealed complex inter-relationships between PtdOH biosynthetic pathways and the role of PtdOH in pathophysiology. PLD enzymes were once thought to be undruggable owing to the ubiquitous nature of PtdOH in cell signalling and concerns that inhibitors would be too toxic for use in humans. However, recent promising discoveries suggest that small-molecule isoenzyme-selective inhibitors may provide novel compounds for a unique approach to the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative disorders and other afflictions of the central nervous system, and potentially serve as broad-spectrum antiviral and antimicrobial therapeutics.","output":"Targeting phospholipase D in cancer, infection and neurodegenerative disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several recent surges in COVID-19 cases due to newly emerging variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 with greater transmissibility have highlighted the viruss capability to directly modulate spike-ACE2 interactions and promote immune evasion by sterically masking the immunogenic epitopes. Recently, there have also been reports of the bidirectional transfer of coronavirus between different animal species and humans. The ability of coronavirus to infect and adapt to a wide range of hosts can be attributed to new variants that modify the molecular recognition profile of the spike protein (S protein). The receptor-binding domain of the spike protein specifically interacts with key host receptor molecules present on the host cell membranes to gain entry into the host and begin the infection cycle. In this review, we discuss the molecular, structural, and functional diversity associated with the coronavirus receptors across their different phylogenetic lineages and its relevance to various symptomatology in the rapid human-to-human infection in COVID-19 patients, tropism, and zoonosis. Despite this seeming diversity of host receptors, there may be some common underlying mechanisms that influence the host range, virus transmissibility, and pathogenicity.

A low-dosage challenge would also be less likely to rule out a vaccine candidate that would have potentially been effective, particularly in certain target uses. A key ethical advantage of a low-dosage challenge over a conventional challenge is that both it and its dose escalation process are safer for each participant.

One year after the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) initiated its Zika response, more than 30 variants of preventive behaviors were being promoted. This situation challenged social and behavior change (SBC) programming efforts that require a coordinated response and agreed upon set of focus behaviors to be effective. To support USAID implementing partners in harmonizing prevention efforts to reduce Zika infection, we developed an evidence-based process to identify behaviors with the highest potential to reduce Zika infection and transmission. We compiled a full list of behaviors and selected the most promising for a full evidence review. The review included systematic keyword searches on Google Scholar, extraction of all relevant published articles on Aedes-borne diseases between 2012 and 2018, review of seminal papers, and review of gray literature. We examined articles to determine each behavior's potential effectiveness in preventing Zika transmission or reducing the Aedes aegypti population. We also developed assessment criteria to delineate the ease with which the target population could adopt each behavior, including: (1) required frequency; (2) feasibility of the behavior; and (3) accessibility and cost of the necessary materials in the setting. These behaviors were refined through a consensus-building process with USAID's Zika implementing partners, considering contextual factors. The resulting 7 evidence-based preventive behaviors have high potential to strengthen SBC programming's impact in USAID's Zika response: (1) apply mosquito repellent, (2) use condoms during pregnancy, (3) remove standing water, (4) cover water storage containers, (5) clean/remove mosquito eggs from water containers, (6) seek antenatal care, and (7) seek family planning counseling.

The data were collected online, by questionnaire containing 20 questions using Google form, in both Arabic and English, and were distributed to friends, families, and relatives through mail, WhatsApp groups, and Twitter. The questionnaire was randomly given out to the people living in five provinces of Saudi Arabia. Results: A sum of 1,713 participants responded to the online survey. The greatest number of participants were at the age between 31 years and 45 years (36.6%) and 56.4% were females. The results showed that 74.6% have not registered for the vaccination and 44.9% responded not to take the vaccine. About 60.80% were concerned about the side effects, and 48.2% were worried about the allergic reaction to COVID-19 vaccine.

Deprivation is commonly proposed as explaining such differences. During the period of localised restrictions in late 2020, areas with higher restrictions tended to be more deprived. We explore how this impacted the relationship between deprivation and mortality and see whether local or regional deprivation matters more for inequalities in COVID-19 mortality. Methods: We use publicly available population data on deaths due to COVID-19 and all-cause mortality between March 2020 and April 2021 to investigate the scale of spatial inequalities. We use a multiscale approach to simultaneously consider three spatial scales through which processes driving inequalities may act. We go on to explore whether deprivation explains such inequalities. Results Adjusting for population age structure and number of care homes, we find highest regional inequality in October 2020, with a COVID-19 mortality rate ratio of 5.86 (95% CI 3.31 to 19.00) for the median between-region comparison. We find spatial context is most important, and spatial inequalities higher, during periods of low mortality. Almost all unexplained spatial inequality in October 2020 is removed by adjusting for deprivation. During October 2020, one standard deviation increase in regional deprivation was associated with 2.45 times higher local mortality (95% CI, 1.75 to 3.48). Conclusions Spatial inequalities are greatest in periods of lowest overall mortality, implying that as mortality declines it does not do so equally. During the prolonged period of low restrictions and low mortality in summer 2020, spatial inequalities strongly increased. Contrary to previous months, we show that the strong spatial patterning during autumn 2020 is almost entirely explained by deprivation. As overall mortality declines, policymakers must be proactive in detecting areas where this is not happening, or risk worsening already strong health inequalities.","output":"Continuing inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in England and Wales, and the changing importance of regional, over local, deprivation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to perform a comparative and economic analysis of the degree of development of anxiety-depressive disorder in patients with different types of extrasystolic arrhythmia using different assessment scales.

If symptoms of depressive disorder are detected in a timely manner, the risk of adverse cardiovascular diseases may be reduced. RESULTS: Depression and anxiety indicators on all three scales differed significantly (p  0.05) in patients with supraventricular extrasystole (more than 40 points on the Zung scale, 14 points on the Montgomery-Asberg depression scale, more than 38 points on Zung and 3 points on Covi anxiety scales). For patients with ventricular extrasystole, a significant difference was established between groups 1 and 2 only in terms of the level of depression on the Zung scale. Factors of psychogenic origin determine the development of cardiac rhythm disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that for supraventricular extrasystoles, these factors determine the overall health of the patient. The differences between the three groups are significant on all scales of depression and anxiety (p  0.05). The most susceptible to depression and anxiety are patients with extrasystolic arrhythmias diagnosed with CHD, as well as MCD.","output":"Quality of life, anxiety and depressive disorders in patients with extrasystolic arrhythmia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Universities have quickly shifted to remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study compared two versionsemergency remote teaching (ERT) and conventional face-to-face class (FFC)of a course design based on the instructional design ARCS model for effectiveness and issues. The current study comprised 46 third-year nursing students who attended an FFC course in 2019, and 56 third-year students who took the ERT version in 2020. Students self-rated goal attainment and knowledge of genetics scores were compared before and after taking the courses. Scores between the two class types were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The students worksheets were evaluated using keyword frequency and content analyses. Both classes achieved their goals satisfactorily, and this study confirmed that for this course, ERT was as effective as FFC. A comparison of the increase in domain goal attainment scores per student showed that only the psychomotor domain item, I can fully explain human diversity using genomic information, was significantly different, as it was significantly higher for ERT (p = 0.003).

The educational process was transferred to an on-line environment, in person contact becoming nonexistent outside the group of people from ones household. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the mental health status in medical undergraduates in Romania during lockdown. A questionnaire was used in April 2020 to collect information regarding the life of students during social isolations and to assess the mental health of students using a self-reported 1-7 scale on 21 relevant endpoints. After data quality control, the remaining 1978 data entries were analysed in SPSS 20. We identified multiple factors that may contribute to the mental health of undergraduate students, such as: partner status and offline contact, personality traits, social media and streaming platforms usage. There were differences regarding the mental health status indicated by endpoints between: genders, living environment, owning a pet, etc. This study describes how mental health, a neglected subject in the Romanian public health arena, is influenced by various factors during lockdowns.

The proposed basis for the activity against negative-sense RNA viruses is the binding to exposed 5'-triphosphates (5'-ppp) on the genome of viral RNA. However, recent studies reported relatively low binding affinities of IFIT1 for 5'-ppp RNA, suggesting that IFIT1 may not interact efficiently with this moiety under physiological conditions. To evaluate the ability of IFIT1 to have an impact on negative-sense RNA viruses, we infected Ifit1(-/-) and wild-type control mice and primary cells with four negative-sense RNA viruses (influenza A virus [IAV], La Crosse virus [LACV], Oropouche virus [OROV], and Ebola virus) corresponding to three distinct families. Unexpectedly, a lack of Ifit1 gene expression did not result in increased infection by any of these viruses in cell culture. Analogously, morbidity, mortality, and viral burdens in tissues were identical between Ifit1(-/-) and control mice after infection with IAV, LACV, or OROV. Finally, deletion of the human IFIT1 protein in A549 cells did not affect IAV replication or infection, and reciprocally, ectopic expression of IFIT1 in HEK293T cells did not inhibit IAV infection. To explain the lack of antiviral activity against IAV, we measured the binding affinity of IFIT1 for RNA oligonucleotides resembling the 5' ends of IAV gene segments. The affinity for 5'-ppp RNA was approximately 10-fold lower than that for non-2'-O-methylated (cap 0) RNA oligonucleotides. Based on this analysis, we conclude that IFIT1 is not a dominant restriction factor against negative-sense RNA viruses. IMPORTANCE Negative-sense RNA viruses, including influenza virus and Ebola virus, have been responsible for some of the most deadly outbreaks in recent history. The host interferon response and induction of antiviral genes contribute to the control of infections by these viruses. IFIT1 is highly induced after virus infection and reportedly has antiviral activity against several RNA and DNA viruses. However, its role in restricting infection by negative-sense RNA viruses remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the ability of IFIT1 to inhibit negative-sense RNA virus replication and pathogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Detailed cell culture and animal studies demonstrated that IFIT1 is not a dominant restriction factor against three different families of negative-sense RNA viruses.","output":"Human and Murine IFIT1 Proteins Do Not Restrict Infection of Negative-Sense RNA Viruses of the Orthomyxoviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Filoviridae Families."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 9-year-old previously healthy, fully immunized female is seen in the pediatricians office for a 3 day history of fevers to 102 F, cough, and right-sided abdominal pain.

The objective of this electronic monograph is to show the impact of pandemics on the economic performance of any country anytime and anywhere This first chapter explains each chapter of this electronic monograph The second chapter analyses the impact of Globalization as in the main reason of the fast spread of COVID-2019 worldwide We divided into three large sections how Globalization is the main reason of the faster COVID-19 spread worldwide followed by: (a ) the institutional, legal, and political approach of Globalization;(b ) the massive transportations systems and the development of information communication technologies (ICTs);(c ) the free trade liberalization and labor mobility Hence, the main objective of this research is to show that Globalization is the major responsible of the fast and unstoppable spread of COVID-2019 globally Finally, the same research suggests a deep reform of Globalization to avoid again any massive contagious epidemic diseases to reduce its impact economically and socially The third chapter tries to expose how poverty can be a crucial issue in the faster expansion of COVID-19 in developing countries like Guatemala This research chapter's primary objective is to prove that the rapid development of COVID-19 infected cases is directly involved in the massive poverty levels in developing countries However, this chapter also looks at the dramatic reduction of the middle class and the expansion of poverty This research focuses on how developing, and least developed countries are extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), how developing countries such as Guatemala got exponential COVID-19 contagious cases growth rates of 300% daily According to our preliminary results in the case of Guatemala, we can observe that poverty originated from enormous inflation, massive unemployment, deep-rooted discrimination -by race and economic-, income inequality -the largest in Latin America-, a large informal economy Curban and rural-, and a vast corruption -myopic governments with personal agendas- Finally, this chapter tries to present policies (Ruiz Estrada, 2011) and (Ruiz Estrada and Park, 2018) to the Guatemalan government, the private sector, and civil society from a holistic approach to Guatemala conditions and characteristics In the fourth chapter, we evaluate visually how the COVID-19 quarantines can generate massive unemployment, the constant expansion of inflation, the reduction of the purchasing power parity, and the poverty expansion from a multidimensional perspective This visualization is only possible under the creation of a new multidimensional graphical modeling is called The Multidimensional Poverty Kaleidoscope Graph  The multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph is not intended to use a forecasting model in any case However, its application is not limited to the study of a select group of countries It is not constrained by issues about the region or countries interested in applying the multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph There are four primary phases in the implementation of the multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph The first phase is the design of the input-output-table The second phase is divided into two sections of analysis: the first section of study assumes that the COVID-19 quarantine time framework growth rate (Y = Independent variable) impact directly on our four variables in the report such as the inflation growth rate (X1), the unemployment growth rate (X2), purchasing power parity growth rate (X3) and the government budget deficit (X4) In the second section of the analysis, the last past four variables in analysis became our dependent variables and directly affected the poverty growth rate (Z) The third phase is the construction of the multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph Finally, the multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph was applied to three countries: The U S , Malaysia, and Guatemala The chapter fifth exposes a new view of COVID-19 in general We are interested in going more rooted in the transformation from COVID-19 to COVID-20 This research aims to prove that COVID-19 can transform anytime and anywhere quantitatively and qualitatively, respectively This research believes that COVID-19 is transforming and generating a new mutation that can change in a new virus This new virus will be entitled COVID-20  The COVID-20 is going to be more potent and complex than COVID-19, according to our observations We are considering that COVID-20 started massively from January 2020 until the end of December 2020, according to this research This transformation is not only in symptoms and characteristics but also in its way of transmission, controls, treatments, and eradication The sixth chapter tries to compare the characteristics of the animal viral strain (e g , avian influenza and rabies) and the new viral strain called the COVID-19 The main idea is to evaluate a serial of parameters such as the composition, behavior, structure, environments, reproduction, mutation periods, and the reaction together of different viral strains under the use of an extensive database according to twenty-six variables with his twenty-six large databases respectively This research aims to plot the twenty-six databases in the viral strain coordinate space (VS-Coordinate Space) to generate different viral strain surfaces (VS-Surfaces) Therefore, we will build three different VS-Surfaces with similar sizes and colors to identify different viral strains' characteristics and behavior simultaneously Hence, we can compare the COVID-19 viral strain surface with each animal viral strain surface, such as avian influenza and rabies If the COVID-19 viral strain surface cannot show similitudes with the other VS-surfaces from the animal viral strain surfaces (avian influenza and rabies), we can confirm that the new COVID-19 viral strain surface has a possible human intervention, manipulation, and reproduction Finally, we can generate a list of possible origins of the latest COVID-19 viral strain surface according to missing characteristics and behavior from the animal viral strains surfaces as soon as possible It is to control this worldwide pandemic urgently The chapter seventh intends to evaluate how long any country it takes for its economic recovery from the Post-COVID-19 period under the application of a new indicator called \\"COVID-19 Waves Oscillations \\" The main objective is to evaluate the world economy economic recovery time framework from COVID-19, respectively The calculation of COVID-19 Waves Oscillation requests a holistic mathematical approach under the creation of a simple formula This formula uses the interval of COVID-19 cases daily to elaborate a series of waves from Nano-Waves until Mega-Waves At the same time, we will demonstrate how the COVID-19 waves oscillation can significantly impact COVID-19 openness behavior (full business and financial activities reactivation Ccommonly) Finally, we can elaborate on a large number of simulations to evaluate how long it can take different countries to full economic recovery from COVID-19 According to chapter eighth evaluates the big socio-economic dilemma of COVID-19, such as whether we stay at home in quarantine or work as usual We try to assess quarantines' pros and cons or work in pandemic times from a multidimensional perspective This research chapter's primary objective is to prove the final impact in both scenarios and the ultimate effect on any country's socio-economic performance However, this chapter also looks at the negative implications of quarantine (s) on different social groups from low-income people (informal labor sector) to high-income people (formal labor sector) This research focuses on how quarantine or without quarantine is not the most significant public health policy to solve COVID-19 in the medium and long run Simultaneously, we did many simulations to evaluate the negative impact of COVID-19 on socio-economic performance in households and firms Additionally, we propose a new socio-economic simulator to assess the decision to implement full quarantine or without quarantine and its negative impact in the short run The new simulator is entitled \\"The Virtual Socio-Economic Evaluation of

pandemic in China and explore the subtypes of physicians regarding their mental workload. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 1,934 physicians primarily in 24 hospitals in 6 provinces in Eastern, Central, and Western China was conducted from November 2020 to February 2021. A latent profile analysis was performed to identify clusters based on the six subscales of the Chinese version of physician mental workload scale developed by our research team. Chi-square tests were performed to explore the differences in demographic characteristics of the subtypes among the subgroups, and multinomial logistic regression analysis was further conducted to identify the determinants of the subtypes of physicians. Results: Overall, the participating physicians reported high levels of task load but with high self-assessed performance (68.01  14.25) while performing communication work tasks characterized by direct patient interaction in outpatient clinics. About 33.8% of the participating physicians were identified as high workload and high self-assessment subtype, compared to 49.7% medium workload and medium self-assessment subtype and 16.4% low workload and low self-assessment subtype. Physicians in high workload and high self-assessment subtype had the highest mean mental workload score. Physicians who were female, younger, married, worse health status, those who had lower educational level and an average monthly income of 5,001C10,000 RMB, those who worked in tertiary A hospitals, more hours per week and more than 40 h per week in outpatient clinics, and those who saw more outpatients per day, and spent more time per patient but with higher outpatient satisfaction were more likely to belong to high workload and high self-assessment subtype. Conclusion: Our findings can help provide a solid foundation for developing targeted interventions for individual differences across physicians regarding their mental workload. We suggest the hospital managers should pay more attention to those physicians with characteristics of the high workload and high self-assessment subtype and strengthen the management of the workload of this subtype of physicians to reduce the risks of their mental health, and to maintain their high work performance in outpatient clinics.","output":"Identifying the Subtypes and Characteristics of Mental Workload Among Chinese Physicians in Outpatient Practice: A Latent Profile Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text.","output":"Acute Kidney Allograft Rejection Following Coronavirus mRNA Vaccination: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to examine the impact of E-learning quality on students' satisfaction and performance before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and the role of gender as a moderating variable.

Since piroxicam is soluble in supercritical CO(2) (scCO(2)), the present study aims, for the first time, to adsorb PRX onto mesoporous silica using scCO(2), which is known to be a safer and greener technique compared to the organic solvent-based ones. For comparison, PRX is also loaded by adsorption from solution and incipient wetness impregnation using ethanol as solvent. Two different commercial mesoporous silicas are used (SBA-15 and Grace Syloid(?) XDP), which differ in porosity order and surface silanol population. Physico-chemical analyses show that the most promising results are obtained through scCO(2), which yields the amorphization of PRX, whereas some crystallization occurs in the case of adsorption from solution and IWI.

Regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is associated with improved mental well-being, reduced likelihood of developing mental illness, and improved symptom management. Despite these benefits, most people fail to achieve minimum recommended levels of MVPA. Population levels of physical activity have further declined since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of public health measures (e.g., shelter-in-place protocols). The potential impact of this decline on mental heath outcomes warrants ongoing investigation. Purpose: To investigate associations between changes in MVPA and mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and life satisfaction) in adults impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Research followed a cross-sectional design. English-speaking adults were invited to complete an online questionnaire. MVPA was assessed retrospectively (before COVID-19) and currently (during COVID-19) with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Mental health was assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire, 9-Item (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 7-Item (GAD-7), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Regression was used to assess relationships between MVPA and mental health. ANOVA with follow-up tests examined whether participants who differed in mental health status (e.g., no symptoms vs. severe symptoms) differed in their change in MVPA. T-tests were used to examine differences in mental health symptomatology between participants who were sufficiently (i.e., achieving MVPA guidelines of &#8805; 150 min/week) vs. insufficiently active. Results: Prior to COVID-19, 68.2% of participants were classified as being sufficiently active, vs. 60.6% during COVID-19. The majority of participants reported experiencing some level of depressive symptoms (62.0%) or anxiety symptoms (53.7%). After controlling for covariates, changes in MVPA accounted for significant variability in the PHQ-9 (7.7%), GAD-7 (2.5%), and SWLS (1.5 %). Participants with clinically significant mental health symptomatology reported greater declines in MVPA than those who reported no symptoms. Conversely, participants who were sufficiently active during COVID-19 reported significantly lower depression and anxiety, and higher life satisfaction. Conclusion: Participants who experienced the greatest declines in MVPA reported relatively greater psychological distress and lower life satisfaction. While preliminary, these findings suggest the importance of maintaining and promoting physical activity during a period of pandemic.","output":"Strange Days: Adult Physical Activity and Mental Health in the First Two Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 pandemic poses particular challenges to the management of persons with chronic disease. Reports of a possible neuroinvasiveness of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 as well as pathophysiological mechanisms and indirect consequences in severe COVID\\\\19 cases raise the question of whether the infection can be associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence or the development of new onset and acute symptomatic seizures. Although the literature does not provide relevant evidence for seizure worsening in persons with epilepsy during the course of a SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, there are theoretical risks, for example, seizures triggered by fever. Moreover, a severe disease course and advanced disease stages can, for instance, result in hypoxic encephalopathy, cerebrovascular events, and cytokine storm, which may trigger the development of acute seizures. This is further confirmed by reports of occasional seizures in COVID\\\\19 patients. Although the low number of reports so far suggests that the risk may be relatively low, the reports indicate that an early neurological manifestation with seizures should not be ruled out.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early indirect impact of COVID-19 on the utilization of reproductive, maternal, and newborn health services at government health facilities in South West Ethiopia, and its consequences. METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study was employed. The collected data were entered into Microsoft excel 2010 and then exported to SPSS 25 and R3.5.0 software for analysis. Independent sample t-test and two-sample test of proportion were computed, and the results were presented in text, tables, and graphs. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: This study showed that there was a significant reduction in mean utilization of antenatal care (943.25 visits vs 694.75 visits), health facility birth (808.75 births vs 619 births), family planning (4744.5 visits vs 3991.25 visits), and newborn immunization (739.5 given vs 528.5 given) between MarchCJune 2019 and MarchCJune 2020. However, there were significant increases in proportion of teenage pregnancy (7.5% vs 13.1%), teenage abortion care user (21.3% vs 28.5%), institutional stillbirth (14% vs 21.8%) and neonatal death (33.1% vs 46.2%) during the same period. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: This study showed that utilization of reproductive, maternal, and newborn health-care services was affected by the pandemic with deterioration of maternal and perinatal outcomes. An increase in the proportion of teenage pregnancy who seeks abortion care and the rising cesarean section rate with no improvement in perinatal outcome is a great concern that needs further investigation. Further research is also needed to explore the main reason for an increase in teenage pregnancy, abortion care users, stillbirth, and neonatal death during COVID-19.","output":"Impact of Coronavirus Diseases-2019 (COVID-19) on Utilization and Outcome of Reproductive, Maternal, and Newborn Health Services at Governmental Health Facilities in South West Ethiopia, 2020: Comparative Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to compare the value of D-dimer measured on the 3rd day of hospitalization with admission D-dimer level in predicting in-hospital mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases METHOD: In total, 231 patients with COVID-19 disease were included in the study D-dimer levels were estimated using immunoturbidimetric assay with normal range of 0-500 g/mL In the current research, the primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality RESULTS: In the present research, 39 (16 8%) COVID-19 cases died during the index hospitalization In a multivariable analysis;age, D-dimer (3(rd) day) (OR: 1 00, 95% CI: 1 00-1 00, p&lt;0 001), WBC count, and creatinine were independent predictors of the in-hospital death for COVID-19 cases The ideal value of D-dimer level on the 3(rd) day of hospitalization was 774 q/mL (area under curve (AUC): 0 903, 95% CI: 0 836-0 968;p&lt;0 01) with sensitivity of 83 2% and specificity of 83 6% It was noted that D-dimer level on the 3(rd) day of hospitalization had a higher sensitivity (83 2% vs 67 6%, respectively) and AUC value than that of D-dimer level on admission (0 903 vs 0 799, respectively) CONCLUSION: The main finding in this investigation was that D-dimer elevation on the 3(rd) of hospitalization is more sensitive predictor of in-hospital mortality than D-dimer elevation on admission in COVID-19 patients Even though further investigations are needed to forecast precise prognosis in patients with COVID-19 disease in terms of D-dimer levels, we believe that D-dimer levels on the 3(rd) day of hospitalization have an enhanced potential to be used as a prognostic marker in routine clinical practice","output":"Comparison of D-dimer Level Measured on the Third Day of Hospitalization with Admission D-dimer Level in Predicting In-hospital Mortality in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has attracted the attention of researchers and clinicians whom have provided evidence about risk factors and clinical outcomes. Research on the COVID-19 pandemic benefiting from open-access data and machine learning algorithms is still scarce yet can produce relevant and pragmatic information. With country-level pre-COVID-19-pandemic variables, we aimed to cluster countries in groups with shared profiles of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Unsupervised machine learning algorithms (k-means) were used to define data-driven clusters of countries; the algorithm was informed by disease prevalence estimates, metrics of air pollution, socio-economic status and health system coverage. Using the one-way ANOVA test, we compared the clusters in terms of number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, case fatality rate and order in which the country reported the first case. Results: The model to define the clusters was developed with 155 countries. The model with three principal component analysis parameters and five or six clusters showed the best ability to group countries in relevant sets. There was strong evidence that the model with five or six clusters could stratify countries according to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (p<0.001). However, the model could not stratify countries in terms of number of deaths or case fatality rate. Conclusions: A simple data-driven approach using available global information before the COVID-19 pandemic, seemed able to classify countries in terms of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Interview responses were coded and stratified by youth age:  12 years (youth aged  12 years) and between 13 and 18 years (youth aged > 12 years). The connections between the responses were identified based on either positive or negative content of the reported experience. Data were analyzed in accordance with an inductive reasoning methodology. RESULTS: A total of 318 participants (mean age of 40.3  8.1 years old) were included, representing caregivers of youth aged 11.7  4.3-year-old with diabetes duration of 5.1  3.8 years. The preponderance of negative feelings was noteworthy. Regarding diabetes care, more than 80% of participants reported concern and anxiety about the changes in habits that accompanied the pandemic. Also, more than half of caregivers regretted the isolation of their youth, factors that were associated with greater difficulty in achieving good glycemic control.

This is less than the pledge taken under the Abuja 2001 Declaration to allocate at least 15% of national budget to the health sector. The latest National Health Accounts also urged for an expansion in the fiscal space for health. As public hospitals in Mauritius absorb 70% of GGHE, maximising returns of hospitals is essential to achieve Universal Health Coverage. More so, as Mauritius is bracing for its worst recession in 40 years in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic public health financing will be heavily impacted. A thorough assessment of hospital efficiency and its implications on effective public health financing and fiscal space creation is, therefore, vital to inform ongoing health reform agenda. OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to examine the trend in hospital technical efficiency over the period 2001C2017, to measure the elasticity of hospital output to changes in inputs variables and to assess the impact of improved hospital technical efficiency in terms of fiscal space creation. METHODS: Annual health statistics released by the Ministry of Health and Wellness and national budget of the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Development were the principal sources of data. Applying Stochastic Frontier Analysis, technical efficiency of public regional hospitals was estimated under CobbCDouglas, Translog and Multi-output distance functions, using STATA 11. Hospital beds, doctors, nurses and non-medical staff were used as input variables. Output variable combined inpatients and outpatients seen at Accident Emergency, Sorted and Unsorted departments. Efficiency scores were used to determine potential efficiency savings and fiscal space creation. FINDINGS: Mean technical efficiency scores, using the Cobb Douglas, Translog and Multi-output functions, were estimated at 0.83, 0.84 and 0.89, respectively. Nurses and beds are the most important factors in hospital production, as a 1% increase in the number of beds and nurses, result in an increase in hospital outputs by 0.73 and 0.51%, respectively. If hospitals are to increase their inputs by 1%, their outputs will increase by 1.16%. Hospital output process has an increasing return to scale. With technical efficiencies improving to scores of 0.95 and 1.0 in 2021C2022, potential savings and fiscal space creation at hospital level, would amount to MUR 633 million (US$ 16.2 million) and MUR 1161 million (US$ 29.6 million), respectively. CONCLUSION: Fiscal space creation through full technical efficiency, is estimated to represent 8.9 and 9.2% of GGHE in fiscal year 2021C2022 and 2022C2023, respectively. This will allow without any restrictions the funding of the national response for HIV, vaccine preventable diseases as well as building a resilient health system to mitigate impact of emerging infectious diseases as experienced with COVID-19.","output":"Improving public hospital efficiency and fiscal space implications: the case of Mauritius"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It has been hypothesized that the COVID-19 is less prevalent in regions with warm climates.

As a result, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are frequently treated with immune suppressing medications have questions about COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness. Data of vaccine effectiveness and immune response in the IBD population are urgently needed to guide vaccination strategies. This study aimed to assess serologic response after completion of COVID-19 vaccine series in a large IBD population across the US. Methods: Partnership to Report Effectiveness of Vaccination in populations Excluded from iNitial Trials of COVID (PREVENT-COVID) is a prospective observational cohort study of IBD patients who received any COVID-19 vaccine granted EUA in the US. Enrolled participants had the option to provide serum samples to evaluate antibody development 8 weeks following completion of COVID-19 vaccine series. Quantitative analysis of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 was performed using the LabCorp Cov2Quant IgG assay. Qualitative assessment of nucleocapsid antibodies as an indicator of past infection was also completed. This analysis included participants who completed vaccination series and laboratory testing prior to 6/17/ 21. Individuals who reported prior COVID infection and/or had positive nucleocapsid antibody were excluded. Descriptive statistics were performed to characterize the study population and antibody response. Results: A total of 788 participants with IBD (mean age 48 yrs, 73% female) were included, and 752/ 788 [95.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 93.7-96.7%] had detectable anti-RBD antibodies. Additional demographic characteristics and distribution of antibody response across medication classes are shown in Table 1. Antibody response was generally similar across age group, vaccine type, and IBD medication class (Figure 1);however, individuals receiving corticosteroids (n=35) had reduced antibody response with 85.7% (95% CI 70.6-93.7) having detectable antibodies vs 95.9% (95% CI 94.2-97.1) in non-steroid users. Conclusion: A vast majority of our IBD cohort including those on immunosuppressive therapies demonstrated humoral immune response after completion of COVID-19 vaccine series. Longer term data are needed to assess durability of antibody response, but this emerging data provides reassurance that most IBD medications do not significantly diminish response to COVID-19 vaccination.","output":"Humoral immune response after completion of covid-19 vaccine series among patients with ibd"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Concerns surrounding COVID-19 have transformed since its initial outbreak in December 2019.

If this simple and costless technical change is routinely applied to thoracic spine CT many concomitant extraspinal pathologies can be ruled out, from neoplasms to pneumonia; the suggested modification also allows an early diagnosis and avoids recalling and re-irradiating the patient in case these findings are partially included in the study.

AIMS: Our organisation increased Balint group provision during unfamiliar challenges of COVID-19. This unique context allowed comparison of multiple new virtual and face-to-face (F2F) Balint experiences. METHOD: Following March 2020 lockdown, four existing Balint groups for doctors in psychiatry moved to online, with two new groups established virtually in specific response to the pandemic. All participants and facilitators of these virtual Balint groups were sent a questionnaire to anonymously rate their experience and provide qualitative feedback. RESULTS: The response rate was 89% for participants (51 respondents) and 100% for facilitators (5 respondents). Participants found both formats supportive; providing a space to talk, feel heard and validated, helping work feel less stressful. Participant ratings slightly favoured F2F, but some prefer to continue virtually. Facilitators felt virtual attendance was easier, but adherence to conventional Balint group structure and format more difficult. CONCLUSIONS: Participant and facilitator responses demonstrate Balint groups, when both F2F and virtual, were experienced as a source of support and connectivity, being valued across different psychiatry grades. Notable virtual benefits seem to be limited to more practical aspects, that is, time, flexibility, logistics and accessibility. There are expressed challenges of virtual Balint; however, some participants still favour this format going forward.

Some countries have taken mass home quarantine to control the virus. However, the side effects of quarantine have rarely been interrogated by current COVID-19 research. This study thus investigates the effects of online social support on the public's beliefs in overcoming COVID-19 by embracing their cognition and emotion during the epidemic. First, by crawling and content analysis of the messages posted on \\"Baidu COVID-19 bar\\", this study identified 5 types of online social support given or received by the public during COVID-19. On this basis, a model explaining the public's beliefs was developed from the perspectives of online social support, cognition and emotion. 334 valid online questionnaires were collected to examine the proposed model and hypotheses. The results show that cognition has a direct effect on the belief, while emotion affects the belief via a full mediating effect of cognition. Tangible support and esteem support can directly affect the public's beliefs, and educational level significantly moderates these effects. In addition, the public's cognition is influenced by informational support, however, emotion is not influenced by social support but by other factors (e.g., information disclosure, material supplies and frustration caused by the epidemic). These research results provide a deep insight into how to reduce the negative effects of quarantine, consolidate the theoretical basis of the public's beliefs, and have important practical implications for individuals and the government in dealing with such emergencies.","output":"Influence of Online Social Support on the Public's Belief in Overcoming COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we report the reaction in the biphasic system of the in situ prepared selenols and thiols with 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione (1) or prednisone acetate (2) having ,-unsaturated ketone as an electrophilic functionalization.

Carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1 (Ceacam1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein found on epithelium, T cells, and many tumors. It regulates a variety of physiologic and pathological processes such as tumor biology, leukocyte activation, and energy homeostasis. Previous studies suggest that Ceacam1 negatively regulates inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease models. METHODS: We studied Ceacam1 as a regulator of GVHD and GVT after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) in mouse models. In vivo, Ceacam1(?/?) T cells caused increased GVHD mortality and GVHD of the colon, and greater numbers of donor T cells were positive for activation markers (CD25(hi), CD62L(lo)). Additionally, Ceacam1(?/?) CD8 T cells had greater expression of the gut-trafficking integrin (4)(7), though both CD4 and CD8 T cells were found increased numbers in the gut post-transplant. Ceacam1(?/?) recipients also experienced increased GVHD mortality and GVHD of the colon, and alloreactive T cells displayed increased activation. Additionally, Ceacam1(?/?) mice had increased mortality and decreased numbers of regenerating small intestinal crypts upon radiation exposure. Conversely, Ceacam1-overexpressing T cells caused attenuated target-organ and systemic GVHD, which correlated with decreased donor T cell numbers in target tissues, and mortality. Finally, graft-versus-tumor survival in a Ceacam1(+) lymphoma model was improved in animals receiving Ceacam1(?/?) vs. control T cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Ceacam1 regulates T cell activation, GVHD target organ damage, and numbers of donor T cells in lymphoid organs and GVHD target tissues. In recipients of allo-BMT, Ceacam1 may also regulate tissue radiosensitivity. Because of its expression on both the donor graft and host tissues, this suggests that targeting Ceacam1 may represent a potent strategy for the regulation of GVHD and GVT after allogeneic transplantation.","output":"Ceacam1 Separates Graft-versus-Host-Disease from Graft-versus-Tumor Activity after Experimental Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay intends to outline a synthetic excursus on my research, didactical and consultancy experience in the field of bioclimatic design for architecture.

Twenty countries (67%) have formally accredited paediatric cardiology training programmes, seven (23%) have substantial informal (not accredited or certified) training, and three (10%) have very limited or no programme. Twenty-two countries have a curriculum. Twelve countries have a national training director. There was one paediatric cardiology centre per 2.66 million population (range 0.87-9.64 million), one cardiac surgical centre per 4.73 million population (range 1.63-10.72 million), and one training centre per 4.29 million population (range 1.63-10.72 million population).

Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) showed a number of patients with elevated d-dimer, whether those patients combined with pulmonary embolism got our attention. Methods: Data on clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment, and disease progression of 19 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia,who completed computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) during hospitalization in the Central Hospital of Wuhan from January 2 to March 26, 2020, were reviewed. Results: Of the 19 suspected pulmonary embolism and subjected to CTPA patients, six were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. The Wells score of the six patients with pulmonary embolism was 0C1, which suggested a low risk of pulmonary embolism. The median level of d-dimers collected at the day before or on the day of CTPA completion in the patients with pulmonary embolism was 18.36 (interquartile range [IQR]: 6.69C61.46) g/mL, which was much higher than that in the patients without pulmonary embolism (median 9.47 [IQR: 4.22C28.02] g/mL). Of the 6 patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism, all patients received anticoagulant therapy, 5 of which survived and were discharged and 1 died. Conclusion: A potential causal relationship exists between COVID-19 infection and pulmonary embolism, but whether this phenomenon is common remains uncertain. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients who developed pulmonary embolism are similar to those of patients with increased d-dimer alone, prompting a significant challenge on differential diagnoses.","output":"Acute Pulmonary Embolism in Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solid tumors form a permissive microenvironment with irregular features, including high pressured tumor interstitial fluid with acidic pH, co-adaptation of cancer cells with other cells like the immune system cells, abnormal metabolism and anomalous overexpression of various pieces of molecular machinery.

In the past several months, experimentally, many human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were successfully extracted from plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients. Currently, several mAbs targeting the SARS-CoV-2's spike glycoprotein (S-protein) are in clinical trials.

Additional proteolytic activities of PLpro include deubiquitination and deISGylation, which can reverse the post-translational modification of cellular proteins conjugated with ubiquitin or (Ub) or Ub-like interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15). These activities regulate innate immune responses against viral infection. Thus, PLpro is a potential antiviral target. Here, we have described the structural and energetic basis of recognition of PLpro by the human ISG15 protein (hISG15) using atomistic molecular dynamics simulation across the CoV family, i.e., MERS-CoV (MCoV), SARS-CoV (SCoV), and SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV2). The cumulative simulation length for all trajectories was 32.0 s. In the absence of the complete crystal structure of complexes, proteinCprotein docking was used. A mutation (R167E) was introduced across all three PLpro to study the effect of mutation on the proteinCprotein binding. Our study reveals that the apo-ISG15 protein remains closed while it adopts an open conformation when bound to PLpro, although the degree of openness varies across the CoV family. The binding free energy analysis suggests that hISG15 binds more strongly with SCoV2-PLpro compared to SCoV or MCoV. The intermolecular electrostatic interaction drives the hISG15-PLpro complexation. Our study showed that SCoV or MCoV-PLpro binds more strongly with the C-domain of hISG15, while SCoV2-PLpro binds more favorably the N-domain of hISG15. Overall, our study explains the molecular basis of differential deISGylating activities of PLpro among the CoV family and the specificity of SCoV2-PLpro toward hISG15.","output":"Unraveling the Molecular Mechanism of Recognition of Human Interferon-Stimulated Gene Product 15 by Coronavirus Papain-Like Proteases: A Multiscale Simulation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal of this study was to characterize changes in components and toxicological properties of PM2.5 during the nationwide 2019-Coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown restrictions in Milan, Italy. Time-integrated PM2.5 filters were collected at a residential site in Milan metropolitan area from April 11th to June 3rd at 2020, encompassing full-lockdown (FL), the followed partial-lockdown (PL2), and full-relaxation (FR) periods of COVID-19 restrictions. The collected filters were analyzed for elemental and organic carbon (EC/OC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), individual organic species (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and levoglucosan), and metals. According to online data, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and benzene (C6H6) levels significantly decreased during the entire COVID-19 period compared to the same time span in 2019, mainly due to the government-backed shutdowns and curtailed road traffic. Similarly, with a few exceptions, surrogates of tailpipe emissions (e.g., traffic-associated PAHs) as well as re-suspended road dust (e.g., Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, and Ti) were relatively lower during FL and PL2 periods in comparison with year 2019, whereas an increasing trend in mass concentration of mentioned species was observed from FL to PL2 and FR phases due to the gradual lifting of lockdown restrictions. In contrast, comparable concentrations of ambient PM2.5 and black carbon (BC) between lockdown period and the same time span in 2019 were attributed to the interplay between decreased road traffic and elevated domestic biomass burning as a result of adopted stay-home strategies. Finally, the curtailed road traffic during FL and PL2 periods led to ~25% drop in the PM2.5 oxidative potential (measured via 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) and dithiothreitol (DTT) assays) with respect to the FR period as well as the same time span in 2019.

Recent studies indicate the local production of cortisol in oral mucosa, which can impact the tissue generation of glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) and SGK-1. Furthermore, GILZ and SGK-1 play pathogenic roles in a variety of cancers, but their status in potentially malignant (e.g., epithelial dysplasia) or malignant oral lesions remains unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that expression profiles of GILZ and SGK-1, along with the phosphorylated (active) form of SGK-1 (pSGK-1), are different in epithelial dysplasia than squamous cell carcinoma. Accordingly, archived paraffin-embedded biopsy samples were subjected to immunohistochemistry to establish tissue localization and the profile of proteins of interest, while hematoxylin-eosin stained tissues were used for histopathological assessment. Based on histopathological examinations, tissue specimens were categorized as displaying mild-moderate or severe epithelial dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma; benign keratosis specimens served as controls. All the tissue specimens showed staining for SGK-1 and pSGK-1; however, while SGK-1 staining was primarily cytoplasmic, pSGK-1 was mainly confined to the cell membrane. On the other hand, all the tissue specimens displayed primarily nuclear staining for GILZ. A semi-quantitative analysis of immunohistochemistry staining indicates increased GILZ expression in epithelial dysplasia but reversal in squamous cell carcinoma to a level seen for benign keratosis. On the other hand, the SGK-1 and pSGK-1 expressions decreased for squamous cell carcinoma specimens compared with benign keratosis or dysplastic specimens. Collectively, in this cross-sectional study, immunostaining patterns for proteins of interest do not seemingly differentiate epithelial dysplasia from squamous cell carcinoma. However, subcellular localization and expression profiles for GILZ, SGK-1, and pSGK-1 are suggestive of differential functional roles in dysplastic or malignant oral lesions compared with benign keratosis.","output":"Expression Profiles of GILZ and SGK-1 in Potentially Malignant and Malignant Human Oral Lesions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: : To determine whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is detectable in the aqueous of asymptomatic individuals presenting for ophthalmic surgery.

Main Outcomes and Measures, A small sample of aqueous humor (approximately 0.2cc) was acquired at the beginning of anterior segment surgery in all participants. Aqueous humor was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Demographic information was acquired from participants for secondary analyses. RESULTS: : A total of 70 samples were acquired. Of these, 39 were excluded due to insufficient material or inconclusive results. Out of 31 samples that were successfully analyzed, 6 (19.4%) demonstrated detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA. None of the six individuals (0%) with detectable viral RNA in aqueous humor reported symptoms during the year, compared to 2 of 25 individuals (8%) with negative samples (p=1).

High-affinity antibodies are need for diagnosis and treatment of CHIKV infections. As a potential diagnostic and therapeutic agent, the multivalent VHH antibodies is a promising tookit in nanomedicine. Here, we developed potent multivalent VHH antibodies from an alpaca na?ve phage display library targeting the E2 glycoprotein of the CHIKV virus. RESULTS: In the present study, we generated 20 VHH antibodies using a na?ve phage display library for binders to the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein. Of these, multivalent VHH antibodies Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 had specific high-affinity binding to E2 protein within the nanomolar range. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was between 2.59C20.7 nM, which was 100-fold stronger than the monovalent antibodies affinity. Moreover, epitope mapping showed that Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 recognized different linear epitopes located on the E2 glycoprotein domain C and A, respectively. A facile protocol of sandwich ELISA was established using BiNb-2E8 as a capture antibody and HRP-conjugated BiNb-3C5 as a detection antibody. A good linear correlation was achieved between the OD(450) value and the E2 protein concentration in the 5C1000 ng/mL range (r = 0.9864, P < 0.0001), indicating its potential for quantitative detection of the E2 protein. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to monovalent antibodies, multivalent VHH antibodies Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 showed high affinity and are potential candidates for diagnostic applications to better detect CHIKV virions in sera.

METHODS: A subset of patients visiting their GP in the period of 2000C2003 with an ARTI (cases) and age-matched controls (visiting for other complaints) were included in a case-control study. They were asked to complete a questionnaire about potential risk factors. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratio's (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to estimate the independent effect of potential risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 493 matched pairs of case and control subjects were enrolled. Exposure to persons with respiratory complaints, both inside and outside the household, was found to be an independent risk factor for visiting a GP with an ARTI (respectively OR(adj )= 1.9 and OR(adj )= 3.7). Participants exposed to dampness or mould at home (OR(adj)=0.5) were significantly less likely to visit their GP. In accordance with the general risk of consultations for ARTI, participants with a laboratory-confirmed ARTI who were exposed to persons with respiratory complaints outside the household were also significantly more likely to visit their GP (OR(adj)=2.5). CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that heterogeneity in the general population as well as in pathogens causing ARTI makes it complicated to detect associations between potential risk factors and respiratory infections.

Primary prevention remains the mainstay for mitigating the risks associated with COVID-19 in patients with DM. A significant step in primary prevention is timely vaccination. Routine vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, and hepatitis B is recommended in patients with DM with good efficacy and reasonable safety profile. With clinical data supporting a robust neutralizing antibody response in COVID-19 patients with DM, vaccination in individuals with DM is justified. In fact, as the burden of the disease is borne by people with DM, COVID-19 vaccination should be prioritized in individuals with DM.

Our HIV clinic adopted telemedicine practices, in line with the HHS Interim Guidance for COVID-19 and Persons With HIV. Several HIV clinics reported lower viral suppression rates during the pandemic. We aim to describe the implementation process as well as year one outcomes of telemedicine at our clinic. METHODS: In March 2020, we created telemedicine protocols; we also designed and continuously updated algorithms for determining patient eligibility for telemedicine based on recent viral loads and last clinic visit. We monitored outcomes through electronic medical record chart reviews between May 1, 2020, and April 30, 2021. We collected patient demographics, and federal poverty level (FPL) information. We collected baseline and post-intervention rates of viral load suppression (VLS, defined as HIV RNA < 200 copies per mL), medical visit frequency (MVF, defined as percentage of patients who had one visit in each 6 months of the preceding 24 months with at least 60 days between visits) and lost to care (LOC, no follow up within 12 months period). RESULTS: We conducted a total of 2298 ambulatory medical visits; 1642 were in person and 656 (29%) were telemedicine visits. Out of those, 2177 were follow up visits (649, 30% telemedicine). There was no difference of telemedicine utilization based on race (28% in African Americans vs. 32% in Whites); ethnicity (30% in Hispanic vs. 30% in Hon-Hispanic); gender (24% in females vs. 30% in males); or FPL (28% in FPL < 200% vs. 31% in FPL >200%). By the end of April 2021, overall clinic VLS rate was 94%, MVF was 48%, and there were 40 patients LOC compared to 92%, 49%, and 43 patients in April 2020, respectively. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine was a safe alternative to routine in-person HIV care during the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed similar rates of utilization across demographic and FPL status.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of EUSLB, PCLB, and TJLB. METHODS Search strategies were developed in accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Major outcomes included the following: adequacy of biopsy specimens (i.e., complete portal triads [CPT], total specimen length [TSL] in mm, and length of longest piece [LLP]) in mm), and rate of adverse events. Only studies comparing all biopsy approaches (i.e., EUSLB, PCLB, and TJLB) were included. RESULTS Five studies (EUSLB [n=301]; PCLB [n=176]; and TJLB [n=179]) were included. Biopsy cumulative adequacy rates for EUSLB, PCLB, and TJLB were 93.51%, 98.27%, and 97.61%, respectively. Based on the subgroup analysis limited to EUS biopsy needles in current clinical practice, there was no difference in biopsy adequacy or adverse events for EUSLB compared to PCLB and TJLB (all p>0.050). A comparison of EUSLB and PCLB revealed no difference between specimens regarding both CPT (p=0.079) and LLP (p=0.085); however, a longer TSL (p<0.001) was observed. Compared to TJLB, EUSLB showed no difference in LLP (p=0.351), fewer CPT (p=0.042), and longer TSL (p=0.005). CONCLUSION EUSLB appears to be a safe, minimally invasive procedure that is comparable to PCLB and TJLB regarding biopsy specimens obtained and rate of adverse events associated with each method.","output":"Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided, Percutaneous, and Transjugular Liver Biopsy: A Comparative Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mandatory and voluntary mask policies may have yet unknown social and behavioral consequences related to the effectiveness of the measure, stigmatization, and perceived fairness.

When an emergency event occurs, it makes sense to take into account more than one decision makers opinions and psychological behaviors. The existing research tends to ignore these multidimensional aspects. To fill this literature gap, we propose a multi-attribute model. METHODS: The model is based on cumulative prospect theory (CPT), considering multiple experts psychological factors. By not assuming full rationality, we extend existing models to allow multiple experts risk preferences to be incorporated into the decision-making process in the case of an emergency. Then, traditional CPT is extended by allowing for multiple attributes. In addition, rather than using crisp data, interval values are adopted to tackle the usual uncertainties in reality. RESULTS: The multi-attribute CPT based model proposed can deal with the selection of potential emergency alternatives. The model incorporates interval values to allow more uncertainty and the comparative studies show that the optimal solution changes under different scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Our illustrative example and comparative study show that considering multiple experts and multiple attributes is more reasonable, especially in complicated situations under an emergency. In addition, decision-makers risk preferences highly affect the selection outcomes, highlighting their importance in the medical decision-making process. Our proposed model can be applied to similar fields with appropriate modifications.","output":"A cumulative prospect theory-based method for group medical emergency decision-making with interval uncertainty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has rapidly spread and still poses a serious threat to healthcare systems worldwide.

METHODS: All patients attending Hot clinic from September 2020 to December 2020 were included in retrospective study. RESULTS: Total number of 373 patients have attended Hot clinic, sixty percent were females. Emergency department referred 43.3% of patients who were reviewed and referred by emergency and /or surgical doctors. Ward discharged patients were second highest in numbers, comprising 21.7% and were mostly post-surgical patients. GP referrals were 19.3% also 6% were referred by consultants and similar percentage was re booked in Hot clinic. Forty one percent of the patients presented with abdominal pain, the most common being right upper quadrant followed by iliac fossae pain. Post produre review accounted for 24.6% of patients. Abscess were 16.3% whereas uncomplicated hernia, bleeding per rectum presented less. Majority of patients was discharged on their first visit. The percentage of patients rebooked into Hot clinic was 9.6% with 6.7% referred to consultants outpatient clinic after requesting investigations. Only 3.4% were admitted for surgical care and 1.6% was brought back next day for day case procedure. CONCLUSION: In light of the increased demand on ECC services, Hot clinic has emerged as a strong support during Covid 19 Pandemic. It has been utilized not only for urgent surgical referrals but also to facilitate early discharge to avoid Covid exposure.

Methods we carried out a rapid systematic review on models led by primary and secondary care across seven countries (US, Australia, Canada, The Netherlands, Ireland, China, UK). The main outcomes included in the review were: impact of remote home monitoring on virtual length of stay, escalation, emergency department attendance/reattendance, admission/readmission and mortality. The search was updated on February 2021. We used the PRISMA statement and the review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD: 42020202888). Findings the review included 27 articles. The aim of the models was to maintain patients safe in the appropriate setting. Most models were led by secondary care and confirmation of COVID-19 was not required (in most cases). Monitoring was carried via online platforms, paper-based systems with telephone calls or (less frequently) through wearable sensors. Models based on phone calls were considered more inclusive. Patient/career training was identified as a determining factor of success. We could not reach substantive conclusions regarding patient safety and the identification of early deterioration due to lack of standardized reporting and missing data. Economic analysis was not reported for most of the models and did not go beyond reporting resources used and the amount spent per patient monitored. Interpretation future research should focus on staff and patient experiences of care and inequalities in patients access to care. Attention needs to be paid to the cost-effectiveness of the models and their sustainability, evaluation of their impact on patient outcomes by using comparators, and the use of risk-stratification tools.","output":"Remote home monitoring (virtual wards) for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients: a rapid systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare is an essential service at any time more so in the crisis like Covid. With increase in number of cases and mortality from Covid, the primary focus is shifted to the management of the Covid crisis and other health emergencies thus affecting normal health services and routine treatment of other diseases like cancer. METHODS: This article reviews the published literature and guidelines on Covid and cancer and discusses them to optimize the care of cancer patients during Covid pandemic to improve treatment outcomes. RESULTS: The results of the review of published literature show a twofold increase in probability of getting CoV2 infection by the cancer patients and a four-fold increase in chance of death. On the other hand, if left untreated a 20% increase in cancer death is expected. Data further show that none of the medicines like remdesivir, hydroxy chloroquin, dexamethasone, or azithromycin improves survival and response to Covid in cancer patients. Surgical results too show similar outcome before and after the pandemic though most of these report on highly selected patients populations. CONCLUSIONS: The Covid 2019 pandemic places cancer patients in a very difficult situation wherein if they seek treatment, they are exposing themselves to a risk of developing CoV2 infection and if they do not, the probability of dying without treatment increases. Hence, for them it is a choice between the devil and deep sea, and it is for the healthcare providers to triage patients and treat who cannot wait even though the data from the carefully selected cohort of patients show no increase in mortality or morbidity from treatment during Covid.","output":"Caring for cancer patients in the Covid pandemic: choosing between the devil and deep sea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analytical calculations along with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation of a Boeing 737-600 cabin with a single infector (a passenger) has been performed using a passive scalar gas with particle sizes similar to the sizes of influenza virus laden particles which are assumed to be comparable to the sizes of the Coronavirus laden particles CFD results of the virus transport and concentration were used in conjunction with the Wells-Riley (WR) quanta estimation from two well-documented cases of influenza infection on airplanes (with the assumption that the infections were primarily from the airborne route), to estimate the infectious rate The risk of infection is estimated by the quanta of viruses inhaled assuming 0 3 CFM of passive scalar gas corresponds to 1267 viruses/minute released Results indicate that with a 3-hour flight, the risk of infection is nearly 50% for those sitting in the vicinity of the infector which is equal to 2-3 infections for 131 passengers A comparison to a documented COVID-19 case shows that 4 symptomatic passengers could infect 2 others if the COVID-19 virus infectiousness lays mid-range of the influenza infectious doses The use of masks could dramatically reduce the risk of airborne infection When the infector wears a mask the virus concentration is reduced for all other passengers and the mask is more effective at catching the virus droplets before they dry out in the cabin air A significant reduction in virus transport and the infectious rate was observed with the N95 mask for a 3-hour flight With 2 9-ft social distancing (vacant middle seat) resulting in 2/3 cabin passenger capacity, the ventilation rate per person is increased by 45% and the risk of infection was dropped by more than 48% ? 2021 SAE International All rights reserved","output":"A Risk Assessment of an Airborne Disease inside the Cabin of a Passenger Airplane"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a unique theoretical methodology because of the global high priority rating to search for the repurposed drugs that outfit clinical suitability to SARS-CoV-2.

Second, we use a Bayesian neural network to make a robust model by estimating the data uncertainty.

In light of recent concerns, the aim of this research was to explore contemporary influences on dentists' health and wellbeing in England, drawing on their lived experience. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of dentists working in England, taking into account age, gender, career stage, work sector, geographical area, position and route of entry to registration. A topic guide, informed by the literature, was used to guide the discourse. Dentists were approached via gatekeepers, supported by snowball sampling. Interviews were recorded and transcribed for analysis. Framework analysis was used, taking an interpretative phenomenological approach to develop theory. Results Twenty dentists, from a range of backgrounds, participated in this research. While health and wellbeing was reported to be more positive among dentists in their later career, those in their early career and/or with high NHS work commitments shared concerns about their physical, psychological and emotional health. Influences ranged from macro-level issues relating to professional regulation and health systems, through meso-level, notably their workplace and job specification, to micro-level issues relating to their professional careers, relationships and personal life. Dentists highlighted ethical concerns and feeling driven to deliver, together with being demoralised by a survival culture, all leading to perceived lack of control and reduced professional fulfilment. In contrast, being able to deliver quality care, innovate and effect change, as well as being valued for their delivery, were perceived to positively contribute to general health and wellbeing. Conclusion Dentists have a vital role in providing care for patients, so there are serious public health implications if urgent action is not taken to improve and sustain their health and wellbeing. This study confirms that dentists are affected by multiple contemporary influences, and although greater support is needed for individuals, organisational, system and policy changes may be required to fully address the challenges they face.

However, significant differences in hospital conditions, as well as skepticism of doctors about machine learning algorithms, limit their introduction into clinical practice. Our goal was to test and apply the principle of patient-like-mine decision support in rapidly changing conditions of a pandemic. METHODS: In the developed system we implemented a fuzzy search that allows a doctor to compare their medical case with similar cases recorded in their medical center since the beginning of the pandemic. Various distance metrics were tried for obtaining clinically relevant search results. With the use of R programming language, we designed the first version of the system in approximately a week. A set of features for the comparison of the cases was selected with the use of random forest algorithm implemented in Caret. Shiny package was chosen for the design of GUI. RESULTS: The deployed tool allowed doctors to quickly estimate the current conditions of their patients by means of studying the most similar previous cases stored in the local health information system. The extensive testing of the system during the first wave of COVID-19 showed that this approach helps not only to draw a conclusion about the optimal treatment tactics and to train medical staff in real-time but also to optimize patients individual testing plans.

Current perceptions of small health care businesses toward remote care, particularly perceptions of whether RVC adoption will synergistically improve business sustainability, would highlight the pros and cons of rapidly adopting RVC technology among policy makers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the perceptions of small health care businesses regarding the impact of RVC on their business sustainability during COVID-19, gauge their perceptions of their current levels of adoption of and satisfaction with RVC models and analyze how well that aligns with their perceptions of the current business scenario (SCBS), and determine whether these perceptions influence their view of their midterm sustainability (SUST). METHODS: We randomly sampled small clinics, physician offices, and pharmacies across Colorado and sought assistance from a consulting firm to collect survey data in July 2020. Focal estimated study effects were compared across the three groups of small businesses to draw several insights. RESULTS: In total, 270 respondents, including 82 clinics, 99 small physician offices, and 89 pharmacies, across Colorado were included. SRVC and SCBS had direct, significant, and positive effects on SUST. However, we investigated the effect of the interaction between SRVC and SCBS to determine whether RVC adoption aligns with their perceptions of the current business scenario and whether this interaction impacts their perception of business sustainability. Effects differed among the three groups. The interaction term SRVCSCBS was significant and positive for clinics (P=.02), significant and negative for physician offices (P=.05), and not significant for pharmacies (P=.76). These variations indicate that while clinics positively perceived RVC alignment with the current business scenario, the opposite held true for small physician offices. CONCLUSIONS: As COVID-19 continues to spread worldwide and RVC adoption progresses rapidly, it is critical to understand the impact of RVC on small health care businesses and their perceptions of long-term survival. Small physician practices cannot harness RVC developments and, in contrast with clinics, consider it incompatible with business survival during and after COVID-19. If small health care firms cannot compete with RVC (or synergistically integrate RVC platforms into their current business practices) and eventually become nonoperational, the resulting damage to traditional health care services may be severe, particularly for critical care delivery and other important services that RVC cannot effectively replace. Our results have implications for public policy decisions such as incentive-aligned models, policy-initiated incentives, and payer-based strategies for improved alignment between RVC and existing models.","output":"Impact of Remote and Virtual Care Models on the Sustainability of Small Health Care Businesses: Perceptual Analysis of Small Clinics, Physician Offices, and Pharmacies in Colorado"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of COVID-19 and measures in response to it on human lives, including healthcare, was enormous.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) taking care of these patients need personal protective equipments (PPEs) standardized for full protection from droplets and aerosols carrying viral load to variable distances. There has been a surge of manufacturers supplying these protective gears in India and regulatory agencies have issued technical specifications pertaining to PPEs focusing solely on synthetic blood penetration tests (SBPTs) and keeping the upper limit of non-woven fabric to 95 g/m(2) (GSM). These PPE specifications are silent on air permeability (AP) and water/moisture vapor transmission rate (WVTR/MVTR) of the fabric. As a result, most of the PPE kits, despite having appropriate SBPT certifications from regulatory agencies, have extremely poor permeability and breathability. The acceptability of PPEs by HCWs can be vastly improved when the end-users are proactively invited to participate in comfort testing of PPEs before getting issuance of certification for marketing. Field testing or end-user trials in which HCWs don the PPE and assess it for comfort while performing different types of clinical work, e.g., in intensive care units (ICUs), operation theaters, cath labs, etc., also takes into account a hitherto often ignored human-comfort-factor that not only enhances the understanding of HCWs about the need for the PPEs but can also motivate them to use it without worrying about discomfort. We hereby propose that comfort fit testing (COmfort and Material Fit is an Obviously Required Test) should be a part of the mandatory testing and certification process for PPE, so that the industry invests wisely in manufacturing PPE kits that are not only certified for fabric but are also tested for comfort factors.

At a time of limited capacity, it is important to match available EEG resources to children who are most likely to benefit. In this study we evaluated a prospective triage tool for estimating the likelihood of epileptiform abnormality in children's first out-patient EEG. METHODS: We prospectively triaged 1865 out-patient referrals to the largest Paediatric EEG laboratory in Ireland. Based on a structured algorithm, we dichotomized first EEG referrals into priority and non-priority groups and assigned one of 5 sub-levels based on anticipated EEG yield. EEGs were reported by a single Consultant in Clinical Neurophysiology. RESULTS: Triage designated 757 (41 %) EEG referrals as non-priority. Priority exceeded non-priority referrals for all age groups except children between 18 months and 3.5 years. EEGs showed a two-fold higher incidence of interictal epileptiform abnormalities for priority referrals (36 % vs 18 %, p < 0.001). Rates of interictal epileptiform abnormality correlated with the 5 sub-levels of triage (p < 0.01). Epileptiform yield was highest (39 %) for children over 5 years vs 17 % for those under 5 years (p < 0.00001); these rates increased to 49 % and 20 % respectively for priority referrals. CONCLUSION: Structured pre-test triage of EEG referrals can identify children who have the greatest likelihood of epileptiform abnormality. In a mixed population of Paediatric referrals, the epileptiform yield of first time EEG is 49 % for children over 5 years who are referred with an appropriate EEG indication. This is subject to much variability with epileptiform yields as low as 13 % in younger children with non-priority referrals. The use of a structured triage algorithm can help to optimise utility of EEG in situations of limited laboratory capacity.","output":"Measuring the effects of pre-test probability on out-patient first EEG investigation in children - A guide to evidence-based EEG triage in a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fast pandemics of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to a devastating influence on global public health. In order to treat the disease, medical imaging emerges as a useful tool for diagnosis. However, the computed tomography (CT) diagnosis of COVID-19 requires experts' extensive clinical experience. Therefore, it is essential to achieve rapid and accurate segmentation and detection of COVID-19. This paper proposes a simple yet efficient and general-purpose network, called Sequential Region Generation Network (SRGNet), to jointly detect and segment the lesion areas of COVID-19. SRGNet can make full use of the supervised segmentation information and then outputs multi-scale segmentation predictions. Through this, high-quality lesion-areas suggestions can be generated on the predicted segmentation maps, reducing the diagnosis cost. Simultaneously, the detection results conversely refine the segmentation map by a post-processing procedure, which significantly improves the segmentation accuracy. The superiorities of our SRGNet over the state-of-the-art methods are validated through extensive experiments on the built COVID-19 database.","output":"Joint Segmentation and Detection of COVID-19 via a Sequential Region Generation Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human brain functions at the center of a network of systems aimed at providing a structural and immunological layer of protection. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) maintains a physiological homeostasis that is of paramount importance to proper neurological activity.

CSF movement through the central nervous system has been extensively explored. Across numerous animal species, the involvement of various drainage pathways in CSF, including arachnoid granulations, cranial nerves, perivascular pathways, and meningeal lymphatics, has been studied. Among these, there is a proposed CSF clearance route spanning the olfactory nerve and exiting the brain at the cribriform plate and entering lymphatics. While this pathway has been demonstrated in multiple animal species, evidence of a similar CSF egress mechanism involving the nasal cavity in humans remains poorly consolidated. This review will synthesize contemporary evidence surrounding CSF clearance at the nose-brain interface, examining across species this anatomical pathway, and its possible significance to human neurodegenerative disease. Our discussion of a bidirectional nasal pathway includes examination of the immune surveillance in the olfactory region protecting the brain.

Blood loss, operating time, pancreatic texture and main pancreatic duct diameter as well as body mass index were also analysed. RESULTS Retrorenal fat thickness (P = 0.0004), duct diameter (P = 0.0008), subcutaneous fat area (P = 0.023) and total fat area (P = 0.014) were found to be significant predictors of grade C pancreatic fistula. CONCLUSION Although retrorenal fat tissue thickness may seem robust, it is a simple measure that can be used to predict the most severe grade of pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy.","output":"Retrorenal fat predicts grade C pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Logistic models have been widely used for modelling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

In the first approach, all the data was used to fit the models as per the heuristic model fitting method. In the second approach, only the first half of the data was used for calibrating the models, while the other half was left for validating the models. Analysis of the obtained calibration and validation results have indicated that parameters of the two models cannot be identified with high certainty from COVID-19 data. Further, the models shown to have structural problems as they could not predict reasonably the validation data. Therefore, they should not be used for long-term predictions of COVID-19.

Presepsin(PSP) is a soluble CD14 subtype has recently been proposed as a novel biomarker in sepsis patients. The aim of the current study was to detect the relation of presepsin to the outcome of COVID-19 as well as its relation to other inflammatory biomarkers. Methods Multicenter, retrospective observational study was conducted in Saudi Arabia and Misr International Hospital, Egypt from January 2021 to May 2021. Hospitalized patients who had positive throat swab of SARS-COV2 and radiological evidence of viral pneumonia (moderate and severe forms) were included in the study. Demographics and clinical features, as well as laboratory parameters including serum ferritin, CRP, D-dimer, presepsin of enrolled patients were retrospectively collected. Pneumonia severity index (PSI) was used to evaluate the severity of pneumonia. Results 202 hospitalized patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and had positive results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; were enrolled to our study. Out of 202 hospitalized patients 67 patients (33.17%) required ICU admission. One hundred seventy-six (87.1%) patients survived and were discharged, 26 (12.9%) patients didn't survive. Presepsin level was found to be significantly elevated in non-survivor versus survivor group, median (IQR),978.5(755.8-1400) vs 516.5(343.3-720), p<0.001 as well in ICU versus non-ICU patients, median (IQR), 800(631-1200) and 446(320-626), respectively (P value<0.001). Elevated levels were also found to be associated with increase length of hospital stay. Levels above 775 pg/ml were found to be associated with in-hospital mortality specificity 80%, sensitivity 73%.

The course consisted of didactic radiology and contouring lectures, small group anatomy sessions using cadaveric prosections, and realtime contouring using commercial software. Acknowledging the importance of increasing access to the Bootcamp, we launched an online version of the ARC Bootcamp in November 2019. We evaluated the online (ONL) course's impact on participants' knowledge acquisition, contouring skills, and self-confidence by comparing it to the face-to-face (F2F) course. Materials and Methods: The F2F Bootcamp was adapted into an ONL version using the Teachable platform (teachable.com). The ONL course was structured in a linear progression of locked modules to offer similar content to the F2F comparator. Participants from the 2019 F2F and the 2019-2020 ONL Bootcamp provided consent for the study and completed pre-and post-intervention evaluations, which assessed anatomy/radiology knowledge, contouring skills, anatomy/radiology knowledge and contouring self-confidence, and course satisfaction. Results: Fifty-seven (F2F: n=30;ONL: n=27) participants completed both evaluations. The ONL course had a substantially wider geographic participation, with participants from 19 countries (versus four countries in the F2F course) completing the preevaluation. F2F had primarily RO resident participation (80%) compared to ONL (41%). In the ONL course, most were from a different field (52%), including medical physics residents or medical students. Compared to baseline self-assessments, both cohorts demonstrated similar self-confidence improvements with their anatomy/radiology knowledge, contouring skills, and in interpreting radiology p<0.001). In the anatomy/radiology knowledge testing, the ONL group showed improvement (mean improvement  SD: 4.6  6.3 on a 40-point scale;p<0.001) but the F2F group did not (1.6  5.6;p=0.159). The F2F group demonstrated improvement with the contouring assessment (mean  SD: 0.10  0.17 on a 1-point Dice scale;p=0.004), whereas only a trend was found for the ONL group (0.07  0.16;p=0.076). Both cohorts perceived the course as a positive learning experience (F2F: 4.8  0.4 on a 5-point scale;ONL: 4.5  0.6) and stated it will improve their professional practice (F2F: 4.6  0.5 on a 5-point scale;ONL: 4.2  0.8). Both groups would recommend the course to others (F2F: 4.8  0.4 on a 5-point scale;ONL: 4.4  0.6). Conclusions: The ONL ARC Bootcamp achieved similar results as the F2F version, with improved self-confidence, knowledge scores, and high satisfaction levels among participants. The ONL course is more accessible to diverse geographic regions and disciplines, allows for ongoing education during the COVID-19 pandemic, and can be used as a framework to develop other online educational interventions in radiation oncology.","output":"Is Remote Learning as Effective as In-person Learning for Contouring Education? a Comparison of Faceto-face versus Online Delivery of the Anatomy and Radiology Contouring Bootcamp"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The uncertainty that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought demonstrates that income redistribution and traditional debt relief mechanisms are insufficient to meet public spending needs, mitigate external debt, and comply with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aim to reduce multilateral debt to sustainable levels.

To audit whether the standards of Mobile and Remote access work are met. To audit whether the standards of Consent to Examination and Treatment are met. To also evaluate whether the remote consultation due to the COVID-19 pandemic is being explicitly documented or not. To suggest to the policy makers the need to establish some standards of practice concerning remote consultation and consent in the COVID-19 pandemic Method Inclusion criteria C sample of service users who had remote consultation in April, May, and mid-June 2020 by doctors of MHSOP community mental health team at Bassetlaw Hospital. Data collection: Retrospective. Data source(s) used: Patient/Client medical/care records Anticipated benefits of this audit: Due to the nature of current COVID-19 pandemic situation, it is essential to minimise contacts with vulnerable groups to prevent transmission of infection. It is anticipated that the number of remote consultations will grow in the forthcoming months. This audit creates an opportunity to develop a new policy and improve the quality of remote consultations documentation. Result Documentation for remote consultation was done in 81% of case notes whereas documentation of consent obtained was present in 57% of patients electronic notes. 90% of entries had documentation of addressed concerns. Around 50-70% of patients documents showed good record keeping on domains of ability to maintain effective communication, mental state examination, risk assessment and ability to understand medication plus side effects. About 40% of documentation met standards for good record keeping on management plan, concerns raised, chance given to ask about management plan. Conclusion Most of the standards of good consultations are being met despite the change in the type of Consultation due to COVID-19. However, there are identified areas for improvement which could be focused on. For example, documentation can be clearer when consent is gained for remote consultation. It should not be presumed that, as patients are booked in a certain type of clinic, they have been properly consented beforehand. Key Success: Almost in all domains 40% have met the standards Key Concerns: There are areas where a lot of evidence is partially documented. The above results can be explained as a consequence of a sudden change in the normal working pattern in a community-based setting, having minimal protocols and procedures on standards of working in the situation of COVID19 remote consultation. Following this audit, we aim to increase the amount of information recorded during remote consultation. The plan is to develop a template that would cover the requirements for a remote consultation recommended by national guidelines The proposal of a letter template following a remote consultation will be disseminated to the MHSOP CMHT teams for any suggestions/approval.","output":"Audit on structure of assessment for remote consultation during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article applies the model developed in Charles Rosenberg's seminal article \\"What is an Epidemic?\\" to typhus outbreaks in eighteenth-century London That framework remains valuable for understanding contagious disease in early modernity by helping to highlight the structure of responses to epidemics So-called \\"Jail Fever\\" outbreaks are especially instructive, in part because the most notorious of these epidemics were small affairs when compared to the larger pandemics that Rosenberg explored Considering that they accounted for relatively few deaths, historians must answer why they caused such a stir Whereas the raw body count often drives development of narratives about epidemics, eighteenth-century typhus epidemics often hinged more on who died and where than how many Typhus ravaged poor and working class communities throughout the period However, even significant spikes in mortality occurring in poor neighborhoods often failed to trigger proclamations of epidemics Some deaths mattered more than others in this regard, suggesting that qualitative criteria may have played a greater role than quantitative criteria when it came to identifying which events registered as epidemics in the eighteenth century","output":"On Courtroom Dramas and Plot Twists: Typhus in Eighteenth-Century London"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a severe infection such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the level of almost all analytes can change, presenting a correlation with disease severity and survival; however, a biomarker cannot be translated into clinical practice for treatment guidance until it is proven to have a significant impact.

On the contrary, the few studies on women with hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type 1, and epilepsy suggest an equivalent chance of a live birth compared to other women undergoing ART. A possible explanation behind these differences could reside in the disease-specific dysregulation of the innate or adaptive immune system.

The Italian ColoRectal Anastomotic Leakage (iCral) study group collecting 43 Italian surgical centers experienced in colorectal surgery from multiple regions performed a quick survey to make a snapshot of the current situation. METHODS: A 25-items questionnaire was sent to the 43 principal investigators of the iCral study group, with questions regarding qualitative and quantitative aspects of the surgical activity before and after the COVID19 outbreak. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the centers were involved in the treatment of COVID19 cases. Intensive care units (ICU) beds were partially or totally reallocated for the treatment of COVID19 cases in 72% of the hospitals. Elective colorectal surgery for malignancy was stopped or delayed in nearly 30% of the centers, with less than 20% of them still scheduling elective colorectal resections for frail and comorbid patients needing postoperative ICU care. A significant reduction of the number of colorectal resections during the time span from January to March 2020 was recorded, with significant delay in treatment in more than 50% of the centers. DISCUSSION: Our survey confirms that COVID19 outbreak is severely affecting the activity of colorectal surgery centers participating to iCral study group.

The new vaccination strategy adopted in Italy in 2021 represented a new perspective for policymakers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the effects of the national immunisation strategy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy on the national healthcare system. METHODS: An epidemiological scenario analysis was developed in order to simulate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Italian national healthcare system in 2021. Hospitalisations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and death rates were modelled based on 2020 data. Costs were estimated using hospital admissions from the Policlinico of Tor Vergata Hospital in Rome. Two scenarios were tested, one with vaccination and the second without. RESULTS: The roll-out of vaccinations to protect against COVID-19 was estimated to prevent 52,115 deaths in 2021, 45.2% less than what was expected in the absence of immunisation. Based on the assumptions underlying the two epidemiological scenarios, our model predicted an overall reduction of 2.4 million hospital admissions and 259,000 ICU admissions (74.9% and 71.3% less, respectively, than the world without vaccinations between June and December 2021). Overall, in Italy, the model estimated over 3.0 billion costs of hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in 2020. In 2021, vaccines prevented around 36% of the overall costs.

METHODS: A cost calculator was developed to estimate the clinical benefits and costs of adding lenzilumab to SOC in newly hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 28 days. The LIVE-AIR trial results informed the clinical inputs: failure to achieve survival without ventilation (SWOV), mortality, time to recovery, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use. Base case costs included drug acquisition and administration for lenzilumab and remdesivir and hospital resource costs based on the level of care required. Clinical and economic benefits per weekly cohort of newly hospitalized patients were also estimated. RESULTS: In all populations examined, specified clinical outcomes were improved with lenzilumab plus SOC over SOC treatment alone. In a base case population aged <85 years with C-reactive protein (CRP) <150 mg/L, with or without remdesivir, adding lenzilumab to SOC was estimated to result in per-patient cost savings of 1162. In a weekly cohort of 4754 newly hospitalized patients, addition of lenzilumab to SOC could result in 599 IMV uses avoided, 352 additional lives saved, and over 5.5 million in cost savings. Scenario results for per-patient cost savings included: 1) aged <85 years, CRP <150 mg/L, and receiving remdesivir (3127); 2) Black patients with CRP <150 mg/L (9977); and 3) Black patients from the full population (2369). Conversely, in the full mITT population, results estimated additional cost of 4005 per patient.

However, few have assessed whether these risks have changed between each wave of the pandemic, particularly with the introduction of new treatment options. We analyzed the differences in risk factors associated with mortality in each individual surge of the pandemic. METHODS: A single center retrospective chart review of COVID-19 positive patients (n=310) treated at the University of Louisville Hospital was performed from March 2020. Surge periods were divided March 1st - May 31st (wave 1) and June 1st - August 31st (wave 2) to identify risk factors for outcomes between periods. A spearman correlation analysis was performed, and odds ratios were calculated using the Fisher-exact test (p  0.05). Partial Least Squares and Random Forest classification models were trained using mortality as the primary outcome and validated with 100 resampling iterations of 5-fold cross validation. RESULTS: This analysis included 124 patients for wave 1 and 152 patients in wave 2. During the first wave, significant risk factors that predicted mortality included patients treated with convalescent plasma or hydroxychloroquine, a prior history of hyperlipidemia, or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Significant odds ratios for mortality included the same variables in addition to the presence of altered mental status, on admission, a history of hypertension, and treatment with azithromycin for COVID-19. In the second wave of infections, initial blood pressure and sex were the most predictive variables for mortality. Significant odds ratios were a prior history of neoplastic disease in the previous year and, again, the presence of altered mental status. CONCLUSION: Comparison between these two periods show a possible epidemiological transition from adults less than 65 years with multiple comorbidities to patients greater than 65 years, nursing home residents, and with immunocompromised states. Predictive factors for mortality in the first wave appear to be related to the use of experimental therapies and comorbidities, while clinical symptoms were more pertinent during the second wave. These results show that predicting overall mortality may have changed over the course of the pandemic. This may be due to the availability of novel treatment options and a better understanding of the approach to supportive care. As hospitals continue to be overwhelmed by the rising incidence and mortality related to COVID-19, identifying patients at a higher risk of mortality may improve overall healthcare cost and utilization by appropriately triaging therapy.","output":"A comparison of risk factors that predict mortality in COVID-19 patients across two surge periods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study aims to develop a holistic and dynamic model that governs the various relationships among the critical factors of crisis management from a stakeholder perspective in the context of Chinas COVID-19 epidemic outbreak Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 731 textual sources, and the text mining technique identified the themes of a holistic crisis management model Then, content analysis was applied to reveal in-depth insights into the themes Findings: From a stakeholder perspective, the model comprises six elements: political environment, economic environment, technology, social environment, health and science and international relationships, which relate significantly to four procedural actions: prevention, response, recovery and adaptation The overlapping stages and situational dynamic mechanisms of the process are another two new major findings of this study;learning and preparing are threaded throughout the whole dynamic process Practical implications: Hospitality stakeholders are advised to collaborate under the guidance of the dynamic crisis management model and adopt high-technology tools for the industrys recovery management Developing a new business model and marketing strategy is a useful approach to face similar crisis management challenges in the future Originality/value: This paper fills an existing research gap by presenting a health-related crisis management model that can be used to evaluate the dynamic process of collaborations among stakeholders in coping with external challenges forced upon the hospitality industry ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"A dynamic model of crisis management from a stakeholder perspective: the case of COVID-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Patients with structural heart disease (SHD) are at increased risk of adverse outcomes from the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) due to advanced age and comorbidity.

They often need help from family members and friends to provide comprehensive care. When death occurs, funerals and other death-related rituals bring family and communities together to honor the life and mourn the death of a loved one and provide needed support to family and caregivers. These collective rituals are often deeply rooted in culturally-bound values and can facilitate grief and help make sense about loss. Rituals act as bridge-building activities that allow people to organize and appraise emotions, information, and actions after a loss. With the emergence of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the recommended restrictions to reduce infection and transmission, family members and caregivers are often faced with weighing options for honored rituals to help them grieve. Grieving during the pandemic has become disorganized. The purpose of this article is to provide case managers and other clinical staff with recommendations on guiding caregivers/families through safety precautions when a loved one dies either because of a life-limiting illness or from COVID-19 during the pandemic using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The authors also present information about complicated grief and ways to support coping with death and suggest safe alternatives to traditional death-related rituals and funerals in a COVID-19 era.

Positive beliefs may be realistic (constructive belief that efforts help to prevent infection and spread of the virus) or rose-colored glasses (defensive belief that coronavirus problem is exaggerated aimed to cope with anxiety) with different consequences for behavior and mental health.ObjectivesObjectives: The aim was to develop the scales of defensive and constructive optimism towards COVID-19 pandemic (DCO-Covid) and analyze their psychometric properties, factor structure using CFA, internal consistency and validity.MethodsThe sample comprised 1403 university students (68% women, M=20.59, SD=3.66) from large cities of Russia. Online survey conducted from 10/4/2020 till 25/4/2020. Test battery included the scales of constructive and defensive optimism (each of 3 items) and measure of dispositional optimism (LOT-R, Scheier et al., 1994). Part of the sample (N=306) completed anxiety in a pandemic questionnaire (Tkhostov, Rasskazova, 2020).ResultsCFA indicated a good fit for the two-factor model (2=27.11, df=8, p<.001, CFI =.985, TLI=.971, RMSEA = .041, p[RMSEA.05] = .78) with negative correlations between factors (C.28). Cronbachs alpha for defensive optimism and constructive optimism were =.75 and =.70 respectively. As expected constructive and defensive optimism correlated with dispositional optimism (r=.24;p < .001 and r=C.06;p<.05 respectively) and anxiety (fear of infection, r=.08;n.s and r= C.23;p < .001).ConclusionsThe results show that DCO-C is a reliable measure of defensive and constructive optimism towards COVID-19 pandemic. The construct validity of these scales is confirmed by CFA and obtained correlations.","output":"New measure of defensive and constructive optimism towards COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has forced the education stakeholders to adopt online education as a substitute for face to face education despite the varied perceptions about effectiveness of online courses. The goal of this commentary is to leverage collaborations between universities to complement online learning offered by the parent university (university where student is registered for a degree) with the face to face learning offered by the collaborative university (university with low spatial proximity to the students home where he or she enrolls as exchange student). This helps the student to enhance the value of education in a blended mode (i.e., a mix of online and face to face learning) thereby reducing the psychological distance from online education. The collaboration has several implementation issues, but they could be overcome through active government support at an international level and the establishment of common academic frameworks to assist greater understanding between universities globally, improved flexibility of decision-making at university level and joint recognition of online learning. Long-term collaborations as a new-normal practice will be beneficial to transform the educational world into truly virtual single entities.

The distally located VP8* domain of the rotavirus spike protein VP4(5) mediates such interactions. The existing paradigm is that sialidase-sensitive animal rotavirus strains bind to glycans with terminal sialic acid (Sia), whereas sialidase-insensitive human rotavirus (HR) strains bind to glycans with internal Sia such as GM1(3). Although the involvement of Sia in the animal strains is firmly supported by crystallographic studies(1,3,6,7), it is not yet known how VP8* of HRs interacts with Sia and whether their cell attachment necessarily involves sialoglycans. We found that VP8* of a HR strain specifically recognizes A-type histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) using a glycan array screen comprised of 511 glycans, and that virus infectivity in HT-29 cells is abrogated by anti-Atype antibodies as well as significantly enhanced in CHO cells genetically modified to express the A-type HBGA, providing a novel paradigm for initial cell attachment of HR. HBGAs are genetically determined glycoconjugates present in mucosal secretions, epithelial and on red blood cells(8), and are recognized as susceptibility and cell attachment factors for gastric pathogens like H. pylori(9) and noroviruses(10). Our crystallographic studies show that the A-type HBGA binds to the HR VP8* at the same location as the Sia in the VP8* of animal rotavirus, and suggest how subtle changes within the same structural framework allow for such receptor switching. These results raise the possibility that host susceptibility to specific HR strains and pathogenesis are influenced by genetically controlled expression of different HBGAs among the worlds population.","output":"Cell attachment protein VP8* of a human rotavirus specifically interacts with A-type histo-blood group antigen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Expression of the microRNA miR\\\\223 is deregulated during influenza or hepatitis B infection and in inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, leukaemia and lymphoma.

Using data from the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) surveys, we associated baseline epigenetic (DNA methylation) age acceleration with incident COPD and lung function. Models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, height, weight, and baseline lung disease as appropriate. Associations were replicated in the Normative Aging Study. Of 770 KORA participants, 131 developed incident COPD over 7 years. Baseline accelerated epigenetic aging was significantly associated with incident COPD. The change in age acceleration (follow-up - baseline) was more strongly associated with COPD than baseline aging alone. The association between the change in age acceleration between baseline and follow-up and incident COPD replicated in the Normative Aging Study. Associations with spirometric lung function parameters were weaker than those with COPD, but a meta-analysis of both cohorts provide suggestive evidence of associations.

The objective of the current study was to analyze research publications on religious mass gatherings of Muslims using bibliometric tools. METHODS: Keywords related to religious mass gatherings of Muslims were used in Scopus database. The duration of the study was from January 01, 1980 to December 31, 2020. Examples of keywords used include hajj, Umrah, mass gatherings/Mecca or Makkah, mass gatherings/Karbala, pilgrim/Makkah or Mecca, and others. Bibliometric indicators and mapping were presented. RESULTS: In total, 509 documents were retrieved. The average number of citations per article was 16.7 per document. Analysis of the retrieved documents indicated that (1) more than 90% of the retrieved documents were about the mass gatherings in Mecca/Makkah; (2) two-thirds of the retrieved documents were research articles; (3) a take-off phase in the number of publications was observed after 2008; (4) the retrieved documents were disseminated in a wide range of journals but specifically the ones in the fields of infectious diseases, public health, and travel medicine; (5) the retrieved documents were mainly published by scholars from Saudi Arabia with collaborative research ties with scholars in the US, France, the UK, and Australia; (6) Saudi Arabia contributed to more than half of the retrieved documents; and (7) four research themes were found: knowledge, attitude, and practices of pilgrims to Mecca/Makkah, vaccination, etiology of hospital admission among pilgrims, and epidemiology of various types of infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Research on mass gatherings, specifically the Hajj, is emerging. Researchers from the Saudi Arabia dominated the field. Research collaboration between scholars in Saudi Arabia and scholars in low- and middle-income countries is needed and must be encouraged since these countries have weaker health systems to screen, monitor, and control the spread of infectious diseases because of the Hajj season.","output":"Health-related research publications on religious mass gatherings of Muslims: a bibliometric analysis (1980C2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background As stressed by COVID-19 pandemic, urbanicity might represent a risk factor for chronic non-communicable diseases or generally impacting on healthy lifestyle, among them physical activity. Methods In light of this, we performed a systematic review aimed to explore the association between urban greenspaces and two important health indicators for both mental and physical health. In particular, our aims were to analyze the association between publicly accessible urban greenspaces exposure, and mental health outcomes (MH) and objectively-measured physical activity (PA). The review was conducted from 2000/01/01 to 2020/09/30 searching in two electronic databases: PubMed/Medline and Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE). Only articles in English were included. Results Out of 356, a total of 34 studies were included in our review, of which 19 assessed MH outcomes, the remaining dealt with PA. Only a few included studies found a non-effect or a negative effect on MH outcomes, whereas, all the others demonstrated a positive effect of urban greenspace and both MH and PA. However, our results stressed not only the importance of green space presence, but also the importance of maintenance, renovation, closeness to residential areas, the presence of interactive activities, and perceived security aspects. Conclusions To conclude, even some methodological limitations of the included studies, results are concordant in demonstrating that urban greenspaces show potentially beneficial effects on mental health and physical activity. Our results are significant for public health experts and policymakers involved in urban planning, community health promotion, and improvement of health and social equity.

Adverse cardiac effects associated with respiratory infections, more specifically Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza infections, are the consequence of inflammatory processes and thrombotic events. For both influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations, large multicenter randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate their efficacy in preventing cardiovascular events, especially in HF patients. No study to date has evaluated the protective effect of the COVID-19 vaccine in patients with HF. Different guidelines recommend annual influenza vaccination for patients with established cardiovascular disease and also recommend pneumococcal vaccination in patients with HF. The Heart Failure group of the French Society of Cardiology recently strongly recommended vaccination against COVID-19 in HF patients. Nevertheless, the implementation of vaccination recommendations against respiratory infections in HF patients remains suboptimal. This suggests that a national health policy is needed to improve vaccination coverage, involving not only the general practitioner, but also other health providers, such as cardiologists, nurses, and pharmacists. This review first summarizes the pathophysiology of the interrelationships between inflammation, infection, and HF. Then, we describe the current clinical knowledge concerning the protective effect of vaccines against respiratory diseases (influenza, pneumococcal infection, and COVID-19) in patients with HF and finally we propose how vaccination coverage could be improved in these patients.","output":"Vaccination for Respiratory Infections in Patients with Heart Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare and slowly progressing neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions in the nervous system and multiple visceral organs.

In our study, we reported two adult-onset NIID patients from a family and described their clinical, imaging, and pathological features. The first patient was a 61-year-old man who only presented with non-specific headache and dizziness; however, Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted images (DWI) sequence showed high-intensity signal involving a small regional portion of corticomedullary junction in the frontal and parietal lobe. The older sister of former, a 64-year-old female, who developed sudden onset of weakness of the right limb was admitted to our neurology department. Compared with the first patient, similar DWI high-intensity signal but more extensive area in the corticomedullary junction was found in her brain MRI examination, also prominent leukoencephalopathy in T2-weighted image.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by a rapid onset of generalized inflammation, is the leading cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19. We thus aimed to explore the effect of risk factors on the severity of the disease, focusing on immune-inflammatory parameters, which represent the immune status of patients. Methods: A comprehensive systematic search for relevant studies published up to April 2020 was performed by using the PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) databases. After extracting all available data of immune-inflammatory indicators, we statistically analyzed the risk factors of severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients with a meta-analysis. Results: A total of 4,911 patients from 29 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. The results demonstrated that severe patients tend to present with increased white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reaction protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and a decreased number of total lymphocyte and lymphocyte subtypes, such as CD4+ T lymphocyte and CD8+ T lymphocyte, compared to the non-severe patients. In addition, the WBC count&gt;10  109/L, lymphocyte count&lt;1  109/L, PCT&gt;0.5 ng/mL, and CRP&gt;10 mg/L were risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19 (WBC count&gt;10  109/L: OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.96-4.35; lymphocyte count&lt;1  109/L: OR = 4.97, 95% CI: 3.53-6.99; PCT&gt;0.5 ng/mL: OR = 6.33, 95% CI: 3.97-10.10; CRP&gt;10 mg/L: OR = 3.51, 95% CI: 2.38-5.16). Furthermore, we found that NLR, as a novel marker of systemic inflammatory response, can also help predict clinical severity in patients with COVID-19 (OR = 2.50, 95% CI: 2.04-3.06). Conclusions: Immune-inflammatory parameters, such as WBC, lymphocyte, PCT, CRP, and NLR, could imply the progression of COVID-19. NLR has taken both the levels of neutrophil and lymphocyte into account, indicating a more complete, accurate, and reliable inspection efficiency; surveillance of NLR may help clinicians identify high-risk COVID-19 patients at an early stage.","output":"Immune-inflammatory parameters in COVID-19 cases: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ischemic stroke following cardiac surgery is one of the devastating complications that surgeons may encounter, and may lead to serious disabilities for the patient.

The ability of tracheal palpation was the single criteria to perform PCT. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review. METHODS A retrospective study analyzing adult PCTs performed by otolaryngologists at 2011-2012 were reviewed. All PCTs were performed using the Ciaglia blue-rhino-tracheostomy kit and Shiley's tracheostomy cannulas. Most procedures were performed with the same anesthesiologist. RESULTS A total of 60 PCTs were identified with subject ages 18-91. None were converted to open tracheostomy. No bronchoscopic guidance was used. PCT was performed for the following CI: two bleeding disorder, four goiters, four cervical rigidity (surgical, traumatical and constitutional), five emergent tracheostomies, one head and neck cancer and nine short necks. Complications recorded were one wound bleeding and one pneumomediastinum both controlled locally. Pertinent anatomy revealed that the intubation tube was withdrawn to the level of 14 cm and 16 cm from incisor level in women and men respectively. CONCLUSIONS PCT is a safe procedure.

The different combinations of elements in game mechanics would result in eliciting different consumer attitudes toward gamification and brand. Despite one combination that attained a high positive consumer attitude toward gamification in OTT, that same combination was not effective in creating a high positive attitude toward the OTT provider brand. The findings demonstrate the need for OTT providers to be clear of their gamification objectives before selecting the combination of game mechanics.Research limitations/implicationsThis study adds to the body of knowledge on consumer attitude toward gamification, especially in the OTT market where there is still literature is limited.Practical implicationsOTT providers should determine their objectives for using gamification and design the game mechanics according to the optimal combination of elements C components, controls and courses.Originality/valueAccording to the authors knowledge, this is the first paper to examine consumer attitude toward gamification and OTT provider based on game mechanics.

This viral-load protective effect has been waning with time post the second vaccine and later restored with a booster shot. It is currently unclear though for how long this regained effectiveness lasts. Analyzing Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR tests of over 22,000 infections during a Delta-variant-dominant period in Israel, we found that this viral-load reduction effectiveness significantly declines within months post the booster dose. Adjusting for age, sex and calendric date, Ct values of RdRp gene initially increased by 2.7 [CI: 2.3-3.0] relative to unvaccinated in the first month post the booster dose, yet then decayed to a difference of 1.3 [CI: 0.7-1.9] in the second month and became small and insignificant in the third to fourth months. The rate and magnitude of this post-booster decline in viral-load reduction effectiveness mirror those observed post the second vaccine.

With entire nations in lockdown, burgeoning economies of countries like India plunged into a downward spiral. The conventional instruments of estimating the short-term economic impact of a pandemic is limited, and as a result, it is challenging to implement timely monetary policies to mitigate the financial impact of such unforeseen events. This study investigates the promise of using nighttime images of lights on Earth, also known as nightlight (NTL), captured by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrumentation onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite mission to measure the economic cost of the pandemic in India. First, a novel data processing framework was developed for a recently released radiance dataset, VNP46A1, part of NASAs Black Marble suite of NTL products. Second, the elasticity of nightlight to Indias National Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was estimated using panel regression followed by machine learning to predict the Year-over-Year (YoY) change in GDP during Fiscal Year (FY) 2020Q1 IARI, 2020). Electricity consumption, known to closely track economic output and precipitation were included as additional features to improve model performance. A strong relationship between both electricity usage and nightlight to GDP was observed. The model predicted a YoY contraction of 24% in FY2020Q1, almost identical to the official GDP decline of 23.9% later announced by the Indian Government. Based on the findings, the study concludes that nightlight along with electricity usage can be invaluable proxies for estimating the cost of short-term supply-demand shocks such as COVID-19, and should be explored further.","output":"Using satellite images of nighttime lights to predict the economic impact of COVID-19 in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neuropathies of digital nerves are an infrequent phenomenon and their causes are most often mechanical.

A structured questionnaire was completed at both visits assessing demographic parameters, family situation, travel history, occupational coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure, and personal protective equipment handling. At the first visit, 6 of 599 participants (1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The seroprevalence increased to 1.5% (8/553) at the second visit and did not differ depending on the working environment. Unprotected SARS-CoV-2 exposure (p = 0.003), positively tested family members (p = 0.04), and travel history (p = 0.09) were more frequently reported by positively tested HCWs.

As nanoparticles could effectively and dynamically control the brittle secondary phases, it opens a new route to design and manufacture high-Zn and high-Mg aluminum alloys. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of nanomanufacturing of Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu alloy system with the help from TiC nanoparticles for potential ultrahigh-strength light-weight alloys.

Microstructure and thermodynamic studies reveal that the reasons for the peak hardness difference of Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu alloy and Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu/1.5 vol.% TiC nanocomposites are due to the free energy difference by solution treatment temperature and the strain energy sustained by the residual secondary phases.

Tracheomalacia is a rare, but potentially severe complication of mechanical ventilation, which can significantly complicate the weaning process. Aim of this study was to describe the strategies of airway management in mechanically ventilated patients with respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2, the incidence of severe tracheomalacia, and investigate the factors associated with its occurrence. Methods: . Retrospective, single-center study performed in an Italian teaching hospital. All adult patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) between February 24 and June 30, 2020, treated with invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure caused by SARS-CoV-2 were included. Clinical data were collected on the day of ICU admission, while information regarding airway management was collected daily. Results: . A total of 151 patients were included in the study. On admission, ARDS severity was mild in 21%, moderate in 62%, and severe in 17% of the cases, with an overall mortality of 39.7%. A tracheostomy was performed in 73 (48.3%) patients: open surgical technique in 54 patients (74%) and percutaneous Ciaglia technique in 19 patients (26%). Patients in whom a tracheostomy was performed had, compared to the other patients, a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and longer ICU and hospital length of stay. Tracheomalacia was diagnosed in 8 (5%) patients. The factors associated with tracheomalacia were female sex, obesity, and tracheostomy. Conclusions: . In our population, approximately 50% of patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 were tracheostomized. Tracheostomized patients had a longer ICU and hospital length of stay. Five percent of our population was diagnosed with tracheomalacia. This percentage is 10 times higher than what is reported in available literature and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.","output":"Tracheostomy Practice in Mechanically Ventilated Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: a Single-center Retrospective Study With Focus on Tracheomalacia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of corticosteroids in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A multicentre observational study was performed from 22 February through 30 June 2020. We included consecutive adult patients with severe COVID-19, defined as respiratory rate &#8805;30 breath per minute, oxygen saturation &#8804;93% on ambient air or arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen &#8804;300 mm Hg. We excluded patients being treated with other immunomodulant drugs, receiving low-dose corticosteroids and receiving corticosteroids 72 hours after admission. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality from hospital admission. The main exposure variable was corticosteroid therapy at a dose of &#8805;0.5 mg/kg of prednisone equivalents. It was introduced as binomial covariate in a logistic regression model for the primary endpoint and inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. RESULTS: Of 1717 patients with COVID-19 evaluated, 513 were included in the study, and of these, 170 (33%) were treated with corticosteroids. During hospitalization, 166 patients (34%) met the criteria of the primary outcome (60/170, 35% in the corticosteroid group and 106/343, 31% in the noncorticosteroid group). At multivariable analysis corticosteroid treatment was not associated with lower 30-day mortality rate (adjusted odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-1.74; p 0.33). After inverse probability of treatment weighting, corticosteroids were not associated with lower 30-day mortality (average treatment effect, 0.05; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.09; p 0.12). However, subgroup analysis revealed that in patients with PO2/FiO2 < 200 mm Hg at admission (135 patients, 52 (38%) treated with corticosteroids), corticosteroid treatment was associated with a lower risk of 30-day mortality (23/52, 44% vs. 45/83, 54%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.04-0.90; p 0.036).

First, it is to investigate the relationship between social network sites (SNSs) usage and youth's school absenteeism. Second, it is to identify causal relationship between SNSs usage and absenteeism. Third, it is to explore whether SNSs usage causally affects youth's studyCwork choice after leaving high school. In addition to SNSs usage in general, abnormal SNSs usage is further discussed. Design/methodology/approach: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) data are utilised. Lagged variable analysis is used to alleviate reverse causality. Instrumental variable approach and the Lewbel method are used to identify causality. Random effects panel data approach (without and with IVs) is additionally applied to increase efficiency and account for individual-specific effects. Random effects approach allowing for within and between effects is applied, enabling us to control for fixed effects. The primary instrument is a dummy indicating whether a youth more often communicates with close friend electronically or face-to-face. Findings: Using SNSs leads to significantly higher probability of a teenager being late for school, skipping class and having trouble not following school rules. The effect is more consistent regarding abnormal SNSs usage, compared to SNSs usage in general. Additionally, SNSs usage decreases the probability of a youth studying after 18 years old, even after controlling for absenteeism. Practical implications: The findings in this paper highlight the importance of preventing youth (e.g. via enabling children-safe mode or setting up maximum daily access time) from overusing SNSs. Social implications: With the transition to hybrid (mixing remote and face-to-face) learning during and after COVID-19, online interactions are becoming inevitable in students' learning. The findings in this paper indicate that usage, especially abnormal usage, of SNSs increases the probability of absenteeism call for attention from stakeholders including teachers, parents and youth themselves.

The publication of the results of the International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA) has underlined the importance of anatomic characterization of coronary heart disease by visualizing coronary plaques. Aided by machine learning/artificial intelligence, algorithms have been established for reproducible automated quantitative coronary plaque volumetry. These advances have led to questioning the significance of measuring myocardial ischemia, as it results secondarily from coronary plaque formation. Furthermore, the understanding of the pathophysiology of coronary heart disease has changed: the volume of (noncalcified) coronary plaque formation, its localization and dynamics as characteristics of vulnerability, appear to be more important than the focus on a large atheroma or expansive (outward) remodeling of individual plaques. In the guidelines coronary CTA has been promoted to the first-line diagnostic measure in both chronic and acute coronary syndromes without ST-elevation, with an equal strength of recommendation compared with classical imaging ischemia tests.

Medical schools shape PIF by reinforcing professional norms defined by a historical physician phenotype. Increasingly, medical students who are underrepresented in medicine must confront the apparent contradictions between personal identities and the often-subjective definitions of professionalism endorsed by faculty, patients, and peers. The lack of a framework for negotiating these conflicts can create barriers to achieving full academic and professional potential. METHODS: We designed a 2-hour professionalism module during the first-year medical student orientation at one medical school. Participating students listened to a physician discuss a defining career moment that required reconciliation of personal and professional identities. Afterwards, students broke into small groups and discussed vignettes illustrating personal identities challenged by professionalism norms. Students then anonymously wrote a reflection about one aspect of their identity they intended to protect during their PIF process. An overwhelming majority of students posted their anonymous reflections on a wall for other students, staff, and faculty to view. RESULTS: We analyzed the written reflective responses to the module. Several broad-ranging themes, including Mission, Identity, and Relationships, were identified. Both participant and facilitator evaluations were analyzed to determine the module's success. DISCUSSION: This module provides a framework for faculty and administrators to create other curricular and pericurricular experiences that positively shape PIF. The session format utilized may generate greater interest in proactively supporting medical students as they navigate formation of their professional identities.","output":"What Will You Protect?

Articles in languages other than English, abstract only articles and non-scientific commentaries were excluded. The Primary outcome was evaluation of pain related symptoms and best strategies for their management. Our review revealed that a multidisciplinary approach starting from non-pharmacological techniques like drinking plenty of water, removing triggers like inadequate sleep, specific foods and psychotherapy including distraction, comfort and cognitive behavioural strategies should be used. Pharmacological approaches like acetaminophen, NSAIDS, spasmolytics etc. can be used if non-pharmacological therapy is inadequate. As per the current strength of evidence, acetaminophen and ibuprofen can be safely administered for pain management in children with COVID-19.

While these seasonal trends are established in influenza and human coronaviruses, the mechanisms driving this seasonality remain poorly understood. Relative humidity impacts the evaporation rate and equilibrium size of airborne particles, which in turn may impact particle removal rates and virion viability. However, the relative importance of these two processes is not known. Here we use the Quadrature-based model of Respiratory Aerosol and Droplets to explore whether the seasonal variation in enveloped viruses is driven by differences in particle removal rates or by differences in virion inactivation rates. Through a large ensemble of simulations, we found that dry indoor conditions typical of winter lead to slower virion inactivation than humid indoor conditions typical of summer; in poorly ventilated spaces, this reduction in inactivation rates increases the airborne concentration of active virions, but this effect was important to virion exposure only when the susceptible person was farther than 2 m downwind of the infectious person. On the other hand, the impact of relative humidity on particle settling velocity did not significantly affect the removal or travel distance of virus-laden particles, suggesting that relative humidity is more likely to affect seasonal transmission via inactivation rates than via particle removal.","output":"Sensitivity of airborne transmission of enveloped viruses to seasonal variation in indoor relative humidity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) leads to dismal outcomes.

METHODS: The study involved a single-center retrospective cohort in Thailand, analyzing clinical risk factors and CMV-mediated immune responses, correlated with transplant outcomes in AML patients. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients with AML in complete remission (CR) undergoing HLA-matched myeloablative allo-SCT between 2011 and February 2021 were enrolled. The relapse rate was 27.1% with the median time of 7 months after transplantation. The 3-year relapse-free-survival (RFS) and overall-survival (OS) were 72.2% and 80.8%, respectively. The disease status (>CR1) and absence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) were independently significant adverse prognostic factors of RFS and OS. Ninety-two percent of recipient-donor pairs were both CMV seropositive. The CMV reactivation occurred in 54.1% of the patients. The clinically significant CMV infection rate was 49.4%. No CMV syndrome/disease or CMV-related mortality occurred. One-year cumulative incidence of relapse among CMV-reactivation and non-reactivation groups were 14.3% and 25.6%, respectively, without a statistically significant difference. Transplantation-related mortality was 11.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The transplantation beyond CR1 and absence of cGVHD are powerful prognostic factors associated with inferior RFS and OS.

METHOD: A cross-sectional online survey of volunteers conducted at the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 during lockdown (1 May to 27 June 2020). RESULTS: A total of 385 caregivers (Portuguese, n = 185; UK, n = 200), predominantly mothers (n = 341, 88.6%), completed the survey.

This team was named the X-ray response team (XRT). KEY FINDINGS: Over a 7-month period the team attended 54 calls, the majority of which were in the patient's private residence (86%), the overall average age of the patients attended was 80 years. A patient survey found 100% of respondents rated the service as very good with 100% also feeling that they were treated with respect and dignity. The team reduced avoidable conveyance by 50% as 27 of the 54 patients were discharged on scene and kept at home. CONCLUSION: Proof of concept was achieved. The XRT improved patient care and experience as patients were assessed and diagnosed in their home environment which also minimised the risk of contracting hospital acquired infections.

METHODS: This study was conducted at a single-center tertiary care center with a robust POCUS education program. Fifty POCUS exams were performed by a single internal medicine physician using a typical POCUS ultrasound system (SonoSite EDGE with a P21, 1-5mHz phased-array transducer) following each patients echocardiogram. The POCUS examiner, blinded to the echocardiogram, measured mitral inflow E and A via pulsed wave Doppler, and e of the septal mitral annulus via pulsed wave tissue Doppler. Bland-Altman plots were created to analyze the agreement between the quantitative measurements obtained by echocardiogram and POCUS. RESULTS: The mean difference between echocardiogram and POCUS for E/A, E/e and e were 0.11 (1.29 vs. 1.18), 2.02 (12.55 vs. 10.54), and -0.95 (8.08 vs. 9.03) cm/s respectively, with the 95% limits of agreement -0.07 - 0.31, 0.59 - 3.44, and -1.89 - -0.01 cm/s respectively. Given the mean and standard values of E/A, E/e and e, the magnitude of disagreement between the each set of measurements was considered clinically insignificant. Notably, patient BMI, presence of COPD, technical difficulty classification of echocardiogram, nor the magnitude of the measurements for E, A, or e significantly impacted agreement. Median time between echocardiogram and POCUS was 80 min (range 28-350). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that POCUS can be used in hospitalized patients to reliably measure key Doppler indices used in the diagnosis of HFpEF. We propose a POCUS assessment algorithm for the rapid evaluation of diastolic dysfunction adapted from the American Society of Echocardiography algorithm. Limitations of bedside assessment of diastolic dysfunction are also described. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: As HFpEF overtakes heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) as the most predominant form of heart failure, the ability to accurately diagnosis diastolic dysfunction and elevated left atrial pressure at the bedside with POCUS becomes just as important as estimating systolic cardiac function. Further, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is newly appreciated utility for the development of a practical bedside assessment of diastolic dysfunction which could help to minimize personnel exposure and preserve resources in similar circumstances.

The social context of social adjustment of the people becomes germane in understanding the social cost of COVID-19 on behavioural shifts in the society. A cross-sectional online survey through the use of semi-structured questionnaire was adopted to collect data from respondents. The study utilized non-probability convenience sampling procedure to sample 184 respondents from the general public who reside in any of the sixteen local government areas (LGA) of Ekiti State. The data gathered were analysed using descriptive statistics. 85% of the respondents showed conscious awareness of COVID-19 related preventive measures which range from government-enforced preventive measures to self-improvised preventive measures. A significant number (+38.7%) of respondents experienced a shift in routine lifestyles that interferes with closed and knitted group interactions. Besides, findings revealed that Ekiti State residents identified both positive and negative social cost as rewards of adhering to COVID-19 preventive measures. The study concludes that the preventive measures of COVID-19 enforced on residents became a norm for the survival of the people, and also the embedded disparity of social inequalities in the society is a predictor of low social adjustment to the emerging trend of virtual technologies in the society.

The possibility of vaccine interference after simultaneous combined vaccination with Arkansas (Ark) and Massachusetts (Mass)-type vaccines was evaluated in an effort to explain the high prevalence of Ark-type infectious bronchitis virus in vaccinated chickens. Chickens ocularly vaccinated with combinations of Ark and Mass showed predominance of Mass vaccine virus before 9 days post-vaccination (DPV) in tears. Even when Mass and Ark vaccines were inoculated into separate eyes, Mass vaccine virus was able to outcompete Ark vaccine virus. Although Mass vaccine virus apparently had a replication advantage over Ark vaccine in ocular tissues, Ark vaccine virus appeared to have an advantage in spreading to and/or replicating in the trachea. When chickens vaccinated with Ark or Mass vaccine were housed together, Mass vaccine virus was able to spread to Ark-vaccinated chickens, but the Ark vaccine was not detected in Mass-vaccinated chickens. Only Mass vaccine was detected in tears of sentinel birds introduced into groups receiving both vaccines. Furthermore, Ark vaccine virus RNA was not detectable until 10 DPV in most tear samples from chickens vaccinated with both Ark and Mass vaccines at varying Ark vaccine doses, while high concentrations of Mass virus RNA were detectable at 3-7 DPV. In contrast, Ark vaccine virus replicated effectively early after vaccination in chickens vaccinated with Ark vaccine alone. The different replication dynamics of Ark and Mass viruses in chickens vaccinated with combined vaccines did not result in reduced protection against Ark challenge at 21 DPV.

Herein, we identified a novel coronavirus, provisionally designated Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1), in the rectal swab samples of Rousettus leschenaulti bats by using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Although the virus is similar to Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9) in genome characteristics, it is sufficiently distinct to be classified as a new species according to the criteria defined by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). More striking was that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 contained a unique gene integrated into the 3-end of the genome that has no homologs in any known coronavirus, but which sequence and phylogeny analyses indicated most likely originated from the p10 gene of a bat orthoreovirus. Subgenomic mRNA and cellular-level observations demonstrated that the p10 gene is functional and induces the formation of cell syncytia.

Case data from 989 cats and clinical samples from additional 113 cats were obtained to determine the cause of the outbreaks and epidemiological factors involved. Most cats with FPL were shelter-housed, 9 to 10 weeks old at diagnosis, unvaccinated, had not completed a primary vaccination series or had received vaccinations noncompliant with current guidelines. Analysis of parvoviral VP2 sequence data confirmed that all FPL cases were caused by FPV and not CPV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that each of these outbreaks was caused by a distinct FPV, with two virus lineages present in eastern Australia and virus movement between different geographical locations. Viruses from the UAE outbreak formed a lineage of unknown origin.

Due to their simple fabrication process and high-quality crystallinity after self-assembly, they can be applied in various fields including micro-/nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and precision sensors, to name a few. In contrast to their simple fabrication, inspection is intrinsically difficult due to buried structures. Today, ultrasonic atomic force microscopy and interferometry are some prevalent non-destructive 3-D imaging methods that are used to inspect the underlying ESG structures. However, these non-destructive characterization methods suffer from low throughput due to slow measurement speed and limited measurable thickness. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a new methodology to construct a principal-component-analysis based database that correlates surface images with empirically determined sub-surface structures. Then, from this database, the morphology of buried sub-surface structure is determined only using surface topography. Since the acquisition rate of a single nanoscale surface micrograph is up to a few orders faster than a thorough 3-D sub-surface analysis, the proposed methodology benefits from improved throughput compared to current inspection methods. Also, an empirical destructive test essentially resolves the measurable thickness limitation. We also demonstrate the practicality of the proposed methodology by applying it to GON devices to selectively detect and quantitatively analyze surface defects. Compared to state-of-the-art deep learning-based defect detection schemes, our method is much effortlessly finetunable for specific applications.

To assess the molecular mechanisms behind the induced apoptosis we studied the effects of hantavirus infection on cellular signaling pathways which promote cell survival. We previously also observed that the Tula virus-induced cell death process is augmented by external TNF-. Since TNF- is involved in the pathogenesis of hantavirus-caused hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) we investigated its effects on HFRS-causing hantavirus-infected cells. RESULTS: We studied both apathogenic (Tula and Topografov) and pathogenic (Puumala and Seoul) hantaviruses for their ability to regulate cellular signaling pathways and observed a direct virus-mediated down-regulation of external signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) survival pathway activity, which was dramatically enhanced by TNF-. The fold of ERK1/2 inhibition correlated with viral replication efficiencies, which varied drastically between the hantaviruses studied. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that in the presence of a cytokine TNF-, which is increased in HFRS patients, hantaviruses are capable of inactivating proteins that promote cell survival (ERK1/2). These results imply that hantavirus-infected epithelial cell barrier functions might be compromised in diseased individuals and could at least partially explain the mechanisms of renal dysfunction and the resulting proteinuria seen in HFRS patients.","output":"Hantaviruses and TNF-alpha act synergistically to induce ERK1/2 inactivation in Vero E6 cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate gene expression and regulate many physiological and pathological conditions.

We used the miRNA microarray assay, miR-346-3p mimic transfection, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, bone resorption assay, qRT-PCR, and western blot. Our results showed that the expression of miR-346-3p was significantly upregulated during osteoclast differentiation. Further, by transfecting cells with miR-346-3p mimic, we observed an increased number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells, increased pit area caused by bone resorption, and enhanced expression of osteoclast-specific genes and proteins. Conversely, miR-346-3p inhibition attenuated the osteoclast differentiation and function. Software-mediated prediction and validation using luciferase reporter assay showed that TRAF3, a negative regulator of osteoclast differentiation, was inhibited by miR-346-3p overexpression. Our results showed that miR-346-3p directly targeted TRAF3 mRNA via binding to its 3'-UTR and inhibited the expression of TRAF3 protein.

We examined changes in access to care by calculating distance to the nearest pediatric inpatient services by census block group. We analyzed hospital characteristics associated with pediatric inpatient unit closure in a survival model. RESULTS Pediatric inpatient units decreased by 19.1% (34 units per year; 95% confidence interval [CI] 31 to 37), and pediatric inpatient unit beds decreased by 11.8% (407 beds per year; 95% CI 347 to 468). PICU beds increased by 16.0% (66.9 beds per year; 95% CI 53 to 81), primarily at children's hospitals.

AIM: To identify studies on the relationship between the intake of PPIs and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the main objective of evaluating the outcomes related to severity and mortality. METHODS: A literature review was performed in November 2020. The MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases were searched for all relevant articles published in English on this topic. The search terms were identified by means of controlled vocabularies, such as the National Library of Medicines MESH (Medical Subject Headings) and keywords.

Of the 263 self-identified Indigenous people who participated, 246 participants had complete outcome data, including 99 (40%) who reported symptoms of depression and 110 (45%) who reported symptoms of anxiety. Compared to Indigenous participants with a strong sense of community belonging, those with weak community belonging had 2.42 (95% CI: 1.12C5.24)-times greater odds of reporting symptoms of anxiety, and 4.40 (95% CI: 1.95C9.89)-times greater odds of reporting symptoms of depression. While spirituality was not associated with anxiety or depression in the adjusted models, 76% of Indigenous participants agreed that spirituality was important to them pre-pandemic, and 56% agreed that it had become more important since the pandemic began. Community belonging was associated with positive mental health outcomes.

Recently, several lines of evidence pointed to the fact that oncogenic activation of Myc family proteins is concomitant with reprogramming of tumor cells to cope with an enhanced need for metabolites during cell growth. These adaptions are driven by the ability of Myc proteins to act as transcriptional amplifiers in a tissue-of-origin specific manner. Here, we describe the effects of N-Myc overexpression on metabolic reprogramming in neuroblastoma cells. Ectopic expression of N-Myc induced a glycolytic switch that was concomitant with enhanced sensitivity towards 2-deoxyglucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis. Moreover, global metabolic profiling revealed extensive alterations in the cellular metabolome resulting from overexpression of N-Myc. Limited supply with either of the two main carbon sources, glucose or glutamine, resulted in distinct shifts in steady-state metabolite levels and significant changes in glutathione metabolism. Interestingly, interference with glutamine-glutamate conversion preferentially blocked proliferation of N-Myc overexpressing cells, when glutamine levels were reduced. Thus, our study uncovered N-Myc induction and nutrient levels as important metabolic master switches in neuroblastoma cells and identified critical nodes that restrict tumor cell proliferation.","output":"N-Myc-induced metabolic rewiring creates novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in neuroblastoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kidney diseases are highly prevalent and treatment is costly. Immune cells play important roles in kidney diseases; however, it has been challenging to investigate the contribution of each cell type in kidney pathophysiology. Recently, the development of single-cell sequencing technology has allowed the extensive study of immune cells in blood, secondary lymphoid tissues, kidney biopsy and urine samples, helping researchers generate a comprehensive immune cell atlas for various kidney diseases. Here, we discuss several recent studies using scRNA-seq technology to explore the immune-related kidney diseases, including lupus nephritis, diabetic kidney disease, IgA nephropathy, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated glomerulonephritis. Application of scRNA-seq successfully defined the transcriptome profiles of resident and infiltrating immune cells, as well as the intracellular communication networks between immune and adjacent cells. In addition, the discovery of similar immune cells in blood and urine suggests the possibility of examining kidney immunity without biopsy. In conclusion, these immune cell atlases will increase our understanding of kidney immunology and contribute to novel therapeutics for patients with kidney diseases.","output":"The Advances of Single-Cell RNA-Seq in Kidney Immunology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The influence of social and family factors on adolescent mental health has been widely valued.

However, little is known about the particular efficacy regarding bone metastasis (BM). METHODS We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive subgroup of 42 patients with BM of GEP NETs treated with PRRT ((177)Lu-octreotate, 4 intended cycles at 3 monthly intervals [10-14 wk]; mean activity per cycle, 8.1 GBq). Availability of restaging and outcome data was required for patient inclusion. Baseline characteristics, including age, tumor origin, performance score, Ki-67 index, tumor load, tumor uptake, plasma chromogranin A, and neuron-specific enolase, were analyzed regarding impact on tumor regression (modified M.D. Anderson criteria) and time to progression. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test at a significance level of P less than 0.05, and Cox proportional hazards model for uni- and multivariate analyses. RESULTS Median follow-up was 32 mo. The observed response of BMs consisted of complete remission in 2 (4.8%), partial remission in 14 (33.3%), minor response in 5 (11.9%), stable disease in 16 (38.1%), and progressive disease in 5 (11.9%) patients. Median progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) were 35 mo (26-44, 95% confidence interval) and 51 mo (37-65, 95% confidence interval), respectively. Patients with responding BMs (complete remission, partial remission, or minor response) exhibited a trend toward better OS (median OS not reached after 53 mo) when compared to nonresponding patients (39 mo, P = 0.076). Only Ki-67 index (>10%) and chromogranin A level (>600 ng/mL) contributed to regression analysis. CONCLUSION BM of GEP NETs is effectively controlled by PRRT, with long progression-free survival and OS. Poor patient condition and multifocality of BMs do not clearly affect treatment efficacy, possibly encouraging the use of PRRT in advanced bone metastatic disease. Larger studies are needed to assess predictors of treatment outcome in these patients.","output":"Response and long-term control of bone metastases after peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with (177)Lu-octreotate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Determining how hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can be infected by viruses is necessary to understand and predict how the immune system will drive the host response.

Here, we propose a novel coordinate system of the human cortex based on an advanced model of its connectivity. Our approach is inspired by seminal, but so far largely neglected models of corticoCcortical wiring established by postmortem anatomical studies and capitalises on cutting-edge in vivo neuroimaging and machine learning. The new model expands the currently prevailing diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography approach by incorporation of additional features of cortical microstructure and corticoCcortical proximity. Studying several datasets and different parcellation schemes, we could show that our coordinate system robustly recapitulates established sensory-limbic and anteriorCposterior dimensions of brain organisation. A series of validation experiments showed that the new wiring space reflects cortical microcircuit features (including pyramidal neuron depth and glial expression) and allowed for competitive simulations of functional connectivity and dynamics based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and human intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) coherence. Our results advance our understanding of how cell-specific neurobiological gradients produce a hierarchical cortical wiring scheme that is concordant with increasing functional sophistication of human brain organisation.

Creating an inline PEEP valve by converting a standard bag-valve-mask PEEP valve is possible with the addition of a 3D printed collar. METHODS: This was a feasibility study assessing the performance and safety of a method for converting a standard PEEP valve into an inline PEEP valve. A collar was designed and printed that covers the exhaust ports of the valve and returns exhaled gases to the ventilator. RESULTS: The collar piece was simple to print and easily assembled with the standard PEEP valve. In bench testing it successfully created differential pressures in 2 simulated expiratory limbs without leaking to the atmosphere at pressures greater than 60 cm of H2O.

Search terms included: (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt OR TIPS) AND (gastric varices OR fundal varices OR gastroesophageal varices OR gastroesophageal varices) AND (hemorrhage OR rebleeding OR rebleeding OR survival). Inclusion criteria spanned: English language studies, publication in peer reviewed journals, sample size  10, reported clinical outcome data, exclusive treatment of GVs (no esophageal varices), exclusive use of stent-grafts for TIPS, no chemical obliteration of GVs. Outcomes included GV rebleeding rate, overall rebleeding rate, GV occlusion rate, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) incidence, and adverse event (AE) rate. RESULTS Literature search yielded 936 articles. Of these, 5 (0.5%) retrospective observational cohort studies met inclusion criteria, spanning 209 patients (quinquagenarian men with viral or alcoholic liver disease) with GVs treated using TIPS with adjunctive coil embolization (47%). Clinical follow-up time ranged from 4.3 to 30.6 months.

Consequences of inactivity, including a higher mortality rate and poorer general health and fitness, have been reported. This systematic review aimed to provide practical recommendations for maintaining active lifestyles during pandemics. In May 2020, two electronic databases (PubMed; Web of Science) were used to search for relevant studies. A total of 1206 records were screened by two researchers. Thirty-one relevant studies were included in this systematic review, in which the methodological quality was assessed. With regard to six studies, which explicitly dealt with physical activity during COVID-19, the evidence level is classified by three articles to level II, and in the other three to level VI. Regarding the physical activity recommendations in these papers, three of them were classified to a medium, and the same number to a weak evidence base. Of the 25 papers which refer to other pandemics and/or isolation situations, one was classified to evidence level I, four were ranged to level II, three to level III, one to level V, and the others to level VI. This systematic review revealed that reduced physical activity levels are of serious concern during home confinement in pandemic times. The recommendations provided by many international organizations to maintain active lifestyles during these times mainly target the general population, with less consideration for vulnerable populations (e.g., older adults, people with health issues). Therefore, personalized and supervised physical activity programs are urgently needed, with the option to group-play physical activity programs (e.g., exergames).

METHODS: We used an interrupted time-series design to compare monthly tuberculosis notifications in Zambia before the pandemic (January 2019 to February 2020), after implementation of national pandemic mitigation measures (April 2020 to June 2020) and after response measures to improve tuberculosis detection (August 2020 to September 2021). The tuberculosis response included enhanced data surveillance, facility-based active case-finding and activities to generate demand for services. We used nationally aggregated, facility-level tuberculosis notification data for the analysis. FINDINGS: Pre-pandemic tuberculosis case notifications rose steadily from 2890 in January 2019 to 3337 in February 2020. After the start of the pandemic and mitigation measures, there was a ?22% (95% confidence interval, CI: ?24 to ?19) immediate decline in notifications in April 2020. Larger immediate declines in notifications were seen among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive compared with HIV-negative individuals (?36%; 95% CI: ?38 to ?35; versus ?12%; 95% CI: ?17 to ?6). Following roll-out of tuberculosis response measures in July 2020, notifications immediately increased by 45% (95% CI: 38 to 51) nationally and across all subgroups and provinces. The trend in notifications remained stable through September 2021, with similar numbers to the predicted number had the pandemic not occurred.

In a large metropolitan of Thailands capital city Bangkok, most respiratory infections are rarely confirmed by molecular diagnostics. We therefore examined the frequency of RSV, hMPV, and influenza virus in 8,842 patients who presented influenza-like illness and sought medical care at a large hospital in Bangkok between 2016 and 2017. Using a multiplex real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 30.5% (2,699/8,842) of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples tested positive for one or more of these viruses. Influenza virus comprised 17.3% (1,528/8,842), of which the majority were influenza A/H3N2. Such infection was most prevalent among adults and the elderly. RSV was identified in 11.4% (1,011/8,842) and were mostly ON1 and BA9 genotypes. Of the hMPV-positive samples (3.6%, 318/8,842), genotypes A2, B1, and B2 were detected. A small number of individuals experienced co-infections (1.8%, 155/8,842), most commonly between RSV and influenza A/H3N2. RSV and hMPV co-infections were also found, but mainly in young children. Viral respiratory tract infection peaked locally in the rainy season (June to September).

It was previously hypothesized that polyethylene glycol (PEG) may be responsible for anaphylactic reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Objective: To report the workflow established at our institution, types, and frequency of adverse reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in patients presenting for allergy evaluation. Methods: A COVID-19 vaccines adverse reactions registry was established. We used PEG prick skin testing, followed by PEG challenges in selected cases, to ensure PEG tolerance and encourage completion of COVID-19 vaccination series. Results: A total of 113 patients were included. Most vaccine reactions (86.7%) occurred in women. Anaphylaxis occurred only in women, all of which had a history of allergic disease and two-thirds had asthma. Anaphylaxis rate was 40.6 cases per million. None of the anaphylactic cases developed hypotension, required intubation or hospital admission. Systemic allergic symptoms, not fulfilling anaphylaxis criteria were significantly more common in Pfizer-BioNTech than Moderna vaccinated patients (p=0.02). We observed a higher incidence of dermatologic non-urticarial reactions in men (p=0.004). Among first dose reactors, 86.7% received and tolerated second dose. We observed a high rate of false positive intradermal skin tests and frequent subjective symptoms with oral PEG challenge. Conclusion: Intradermal PEG testing has limited utility in evaluating anaphylaxis to mRNA vaccines. Most severe postvaccination allergic symptoms are not caused by hypersensitivity to PEG. The majority of people with reaction to the initial mRNA vaccine can be safely revaccinated.

Among these is p53, a key gatekeeper for cell division and survival that also regulates innate immune responses. This review summarizes the strategies used by different viruses and discusses the mechanisms deployed by SARS-CoV to target p53 activities. RECENT FINDINGS: We propose a typology for the strategies used by different viruses to address p53 functions: hit and run (e.g. IAV, ZIKV), hide and seek (e.g. HIV1), kidnap and exploit (e.g. EBV, HSV1), dominate and suppress (e.g. HR HPV). We discuss the mechanisms by which SARS nsp3 protein targets p53 for degradation and we speculate on the significance for Covid-19 pathogenesis and risk of cancer. SUMMARY: p53 may operate as an intracellular antiviral defense mechanism. To circumvent it, SARS viruses adopt a kidnap and exploit strategy also shared by several viruses with transforming potential. This raises the question of whether SARS infections may make cells permissive to oncogenic DNA damage.","output":"Viral strategies for circumventing p53: the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUD: COVID-19 coagulopathy linked to increased D-dimer levels has been associated with high mortality (Fei Z et al. in Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study. Lancet (London, England) 395(10229):1054C62, 2020). While D-dimer is accepted as a disseminated intravascular coagulation marker, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) also detects fibrinolysis (Wright FL et al. in Fibrinolysis shutdown correlates to thromboembolic events in severe COVID-19 infection.

Available from https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32422349/ [cited 14 Jun 2020]; Schmitt FCF et al. in Acute fibrinolysis shutdown occurs early in septic shock and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality: results of an observational pilot study. Ann Intensive Care 9(1):19, 2019). We describe the ROTEM profile in severely ill COVID-19 patients and compare it with the standard laboratory coagulation test. METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU were prospectively enrolled after Ethics Committee approval (HCB/2020/0371). All patients received venous thromboembolism prophylaxis; those on therapeutic anticoagulation were excluded. The standard laboratory coagulation test and ROTEM were performed simultaneously at 24C48 h after ICU admission. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) scores were calculated at sample collection. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included with median SOFA-score of 4 (2C6), DIC-score of 1 (0C3) and SIC-score of 1.8 (0.9). Median fibrinogen, D-dimer levels and platelet count were 6.2 (4.8C7.6 g/L), 1000 (600C4200 ng/ml) and 236 (136C364 10(9)/L), respectively. Clot firmness was above the normal range in the EXTEM and FIBTEM tests while clot lysis was decreased. There was no significant correlation between ROTEM or D-dimer parameters and the SOFA score. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients, the ROTEM pattern was characterized by a hypercoagulable state with decreased fibrinolytic capacity despite a paradoxical increase in D-dimer levels. We suggest that, in COVID-19 patients, the lungs could be the main source of D-dimer, while a systemic hypofibrinolytic state coexists.

This reduces the burden on potentially overwhelmed hospitals. The Royal Melbourne Hospital (RMH) Home Monitoring Programme (HMP) is a model of care for COVID-19 patients which chiefly tracks pulse oximetry and body temperature readings. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the HMP from a patient perspective. DESIGN, SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Of 46 COVID-19 patients who used the HMP through RMH during April to August 2020, 16 were invited to participate in this qualitative evaluation study; all accepted, including 6 healthcare workers. Attempts were made to recruit a gender-balanced sample across a range of COVID-19 severities and comorbidities. Participants completed a brief semistructured phone interview discussing their experience of using the HMP. OUTCOME MEASURES AND ANALYSIS: A thematic analysis of interview data was conducted. Feasibility was defined as the HMPs reported ease of use. Acceptability was considered holistically by reviewing themes in the interview data. RESULTS: The HMP allowed clinical deterioration to be recognised as it occurred enabling prompt intervention. All participants reported a positive opinion of the HMP, stating it was highly acceptable and easy to use. Almost all participants said they found using it reassuring. Patients frequently mentioned the importance of the monitoring clinicians as an information conduit. The most suggested improvement was to monitor a broader set of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The HMP is highly feasible and acceptable to patients. This model of care could potentially be implemented on a mass-scale to reduce the burden of COVID-19 on hospitals. A key benefit of the HMP is the ability to reassure patients they will receive suitable intervention should they deteriorate while isolating outside of hospital settings.","output":"Remote COVID-19 patient monitoring system: a qualitative evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forests are key components of European multifunctional landscapes and supply numerous forest ecosystem services (FES) fundamental to human well-being. The sustainable provision of FES has the potential to provide responses to major societal challenges, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, or rural development. To identify suitable strategies for the future sustenance of FES, we performed a solution scanning exercise with a group of transdisciplinary forest and FES experts from different European regions. We identified and prioritized fifteen major challenges hindering the balanced provision of multiple FES and identified a series of potential solutions to tackle each of them. The most prominent challenges referred to the increased frequency and impacts of extreme weather events and the normative mindset regarding forest management. The respective solutions pointed to the promotion of forest resilience via climate-smart forestry and mainstreaming FES-oriented management through a threefold strategy focusing on education, awareness raising, and networking. In a subsequent survey, most solutions were assessed as highly effective, transferable, monitorable, and with potential for being economically efficient. The implementation of the solutions could have synergistic effects when applying the notion of leverage points. Seven emerging pathways towards the sustainable supply of FES have been identified. These pathways build on each other and are organized based on their potential for transformation: (1) shifting forest management paradigms towards pluralistic ecosystem valuation; (2) using integrated landscape approaches; (3) increasing forest resilience; (4) coordinating actions between forest-related actors; (5) increasing participation in forest planning and management; (6) continuous, open, and transparent knowledge integration; and (7) using incentive-based instruments to support regulating and cultural FES. These pathways can contribute to the implementation of the new EU Forestry Strategy to support the balanced supply of multiple FES.

This study aimed to investigate the incidence, computed tomography (CT) characteristics, and diagnostic value of the VE pattern in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHOD: The CT data of 106 patients with COVID-19 from January 19 to February 29, 2020, and 52 patients with influenza virus pneumonia (IVP) from January 2018 to February 2020 were retrospectively collected. The incidences of the VE pattern between the two groups were compared. The CT manifestations of COVID-19 were analyzed with a particular focus on the VE patterns specific CT signs, dynamic changes, and relationships with lesion size and disease severity. RESULTS: Peripheral and multilobar ground-glass opacities (GGOs) or mixed GGOs with various sizes and morphologies were typical features of COVID-19 on initial CT. The VE pattern was more common in COVID-19 (88/106, 83.02%) than in IVP (10/52, 19.23%) on initial CT (P < 0.001). Three special VE-pattern-specific CT signs, including central vascular sign, ginkgo leaf sign, and comb sign, were identified. Four types of dynamic changes in the VE pattern were observed on initial and follow-up CT, which were closely associated with the evolution of lesions and the time interval from the onset of symptoms to initial CT scan. The VE pattern in COVID-19 was more commonly seen in larger lesions and patients with severeCcritical type (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The VE pattern is a valuable CT sign for differentiating COVID-19 from IVP, which correlates with more extensive or serious disease. A good understanding of the CT characteristics of the VE pattern may contribute to the early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 and prediction of the evolution of lesions.","output":"CT Features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with an Emphasis on the Vascular Enlargement Pattern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N) is involved in encapsidation and packaging of viral RNA.

However, there is no computerized tool to automatically delineate COVID-19 infection regions in chest CT scans for quantitative assessment in advanced applications such as severity prediction. The aim of this study is to develop a deep learning (DL) based method for automatic segmentation and quantification of infection regions as well as the entire lungs from chest CT scans. METHODS: The DL-based segmentation method employs the \\"VB-Net\\" neural network to segment COVID-19 infection regions in CT scans. The developed DL-based segmentation system is trained by CT scans from 249 COVID-19 patients, and further validated by CT scans from other 300 COVID-19 patients. To accelerate the manual delineation of CT scans for training, a human-involved-model-iterations (HIMI) strategy is also adopted to assist radiologists to refine automatic annotation of each training case. To evaluate the performance of the DL-based segmentation system, three metrics, i.e., Dice similarity coefficient, the differences of volume, and percentage of infection (POI), are calculated between automatic and manual segmentations on the validation set. Then, a clinical study on severity prediction is reported based on the quantitative infection assessment. RESULTS: The proposed DL-based segmentation system yielded Dice similarity coefficients of 91.6%10.0% between automatic and manual segmentations, and a mean POI estimation error of 0.3% for the whole lung on the validation dataset. Moreover, compared with the cases with fully manual delineation that often takes hours, the proposed HIMI training strategy can dramatically reduce the delineation time to 4 minutes after 3 iterations of model updating. Besides, the best accuracy of severity prediction was 73.4%1.3% when the mass of infection (MOI) of multiple lung lobes and bronchopulmonary segments were used as features for severity prediction, indicating the potential clinical application of our quantification technique on severity prediction.

The study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020221827). Data sources included studies appearing between January 1, 2020 and March 20, 2021, identified by searches of PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. Studies included at least 20 subjects who simultaneously provided nasal and nasopharyngeal specimens for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, and for which confusion matrices could be constructed. Authors individually assessed studies for inclusion and compared assessments. Each author independently extracted all data elements; differences were reconciled by review of initial data sources. Extracted data included specimen site, patient characteristics, collection site, and confusion matrices comparing results for nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs. Assessed against a composite reference standard, anterior nares swabs are less sensitive (82% - 88%) than nasopharyngeal swabs (98%). For populations with 10% specimen positivity, the negative predictive values of all swab types were greater than 98%. Mid-turbinate and anterior nares swabs seem to perform similarly. The lower sensitivity associated with nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is justified by the ability to screen more patients and reduced personal protective equipment requirements.

Transport-related mortality will increase as a result of inadequate transport infrastructure, air pollution and sedentary lifestyles. Health Impact Assessments (HIAs) have proven to be a successful tool to predict and mitigate negative health impact of urban transport planning policies, programmes or projects. Yet, there is a gap of evidence on transport and health in African countries. The aim of this study is assessing the health impacts of transport scenarios in Port Louis (city of 119,018 inhabitants in Mauritius) using a full chain participatory HIA model. METHODS: We estimated health and economic impacts associated to transport scenarios with qualitative data and quantitative comparative risk assessment methods. The health impact modeling was based on differences between the baseline and three transport scenarios (worse, good, ideal), estimating the averted deaths per year and economic outcomes by assessing health determinants of air pollution (AP), traffic deaths and physical activity (PA). Data on air pollution and traffic fatalities were obtained from public data sources. Data used to construct scenarios, establish baseline travel mode shares and physical activity were collected through (a) open-ended individual interviews (IDIs) with 14 stakeholders (b) closed-ended survey questions to 600 citizens and (c) 2 focus group discussions (FGDs) with the same 14 stakeholders from (a). RESULTS: In Port Louis, the worse-case transport scenario (doubling in car trips and a reduction in walking, motorcycle, and public transport), resulted in a total increment of 3.28 premature deaths per year. The good-case scenario (reducing car trips by half and increasing walking, motorcycle, and public transport trips) resulted in a total increment of 0.79 premature deaths per year. The ideal-case scenario (reduction in car and motorcycle trips and an increase in walking and public transport trips) resulted in a total reduction of 13.72 premature deaths per year. We estimated USD 23 millions of economic benefits related to mortality if the ideal-case was achieved. CONCLUSION: Participatory HIA shows that implementing transport policies aiming for less than an ideal situation may not be adequate or sufficient to avoid negative transport-related mortality in Mauritius. Urban transport planning is an opportunity to encourage physical activity in rapidly urbanizing settings of Africa. Transport policies should aim to restrict all forms of private motorized vehicles and promote active and public transport to support public health.

METHODS Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups according to a random number table: control group, model group, high-, medium- and low-dose BXD groups (9.2, 4.6 and 1.8 g/(kgd), respectively), and domperidone group (10 mg/(kgd)), 10 rats per group. DGP model was established initially by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ), and was confirmed by recording gastric emptying, intestinal transport velocity and gastric myoelectric activity of rats after 2 months. Each group was treated with a corresponding drug for 4 weeks. The mRNA and protein expressions of phospholipase C (PLC), inositol triphosphate (IP3), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) dependent protein kinase G (PKG) were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively, while nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP expressions were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

This study aims to determine the effectiveness of a novel telemonitoring system (OPTIMUM) in improving the glycaemic control of patients with T2DM compared with standard of care alone. METHODS: This mixed-method study comprises an initial randomised controlled trial involving 330 Asian adults with T2DM, aged 26C65 years old with an HbA1c of 7.5C10%, with 115 in the intervention and control arms each. Those in the intervention arm will use standardised Bluetooth-enabled devices to transmit their capillary glucose, blood pressure and weight measurements to the OPTIMUM system. Primary care physicians and nurses will remotely supervise them according to an embedded management algorithm for 6 months, including tele-education via weekly videos over 8 weeks and asynchronous tele-consultation if abnormal or absent parameters are detected. Patients in both arms will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months post-recruitment. The primary outcome will be their HbA1c difference between both arms at baseline and 6 months. Blood pressure and weight control; quality of life, medication adherence, confidence in self-management, diabetic literacy and related distress and healthcare utilisation using validated questionnaires; and incident retinal, renal, cardiac and cerebrovascular complications will be compared between the two arms as secondary outcomes at stipulated time-points.

Given the lack of validated treatments, there is an urgent need for a high-quality management of COVID-19. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are one tool that healthcare providers may use to enhance patient care. As such, it is necessary that they have access to high-quality evidence-based CPGs upon which they may base decisions regarding the management and use of therapeutic interventions (TI) for COVID-19. The purpose of the proposed study is to assess the quality of CPGs that make management or TI recommendations for COVID-19 using the AGREE II instrument. METHODS: The proposed systematic review will identify CPGs for TI use and/or the management of COVID-19. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases, as well as the Guidelines International Network, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, and the World Health Organization websites, will be searched from December 2019 onwards. The primary outcome of this study is the assessed quality of the CPGs. The quality of eligible CPGs will be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. Descriptive statistics will be used to quantify the quality of the CPGs. The secondary outcomes of this study are the types of management and/or TI recommendations made. Inconsistent and duplicate TI and/or management recommendations made between CPGs will be compared across guidelines. To summarize and explain the findings related to the included CPGs, a narrative synthesis will also be provided. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will be of utmost importance to enhancing clinical decision-making among healthcare providers caring for patients with COVID-19. Moreover, the results of this study will be relevant to guideline developers in the creation of CPGs or improvement of existing ones, researchers who want to identify gaps in knowledge, and policy-makers looking to encourage and endorse the adoption of CPGs into clinical practice. The results of this review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences.

In addition, a pathogenicity study of a selected ARV strain isolated from a field case of viral tenosynovitis in commercial broiler chickens was performed. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis of a 1088-bp fragment of the ARV S1 gene, the investigated sequences were differentiated into five distinct genotypic clusters (GCs), namely GC1, GC2, GC3, GC4, and GC6. Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) and commercial broiler chickens were challenged with the GC1 genetic type MK247011, at 14 days of age via the interdigital toe web. No significant effects in body weight gain and feed conversion were detected in both chicken types. The  interdigital web thickness was most severe at 4 days postchallenge (DPC) in both the SPF and broiler subgroups. The inflammation in SPF birds was slightly more severe compared with broilers. Neither mortality nor clinical signs occurred in the infected groups for the duration of the experiment, despite the presence of significant microscopic lesions in challenged birds. Microscopic changes of tenosynovitis became evident at 3 DPC, with the highest incidence and severity detected at 14 and 21 DPC, respectively. Seroconversion against ARV occurred 3 wk postchallenge, and the microscopic lesions detected in tendon and heart sections were highly compatible with those described in the field. Increased severity of tenosynovitis and epicarditis lesions were noted in the ARV-challenged groups compared with the control groups. Although SPF and broiler chickens showed comparable responses to the challenge with an ARV genetic variant, detected lesions were subclinical, denoting the limitations of our challenge approach. The age selected in this experiment possibly influenced the course of the infection. Data from this study highlight the genotypic diversity of isolates in California, and the outcome of the pathogenicity study can be used as a basis to improve protocols for pathogenicity studies to characterize ARV variants causing clinical disease in the field.","output":"Partial Molecular Characterization and Pathogenicity Study of an Avian Reovirus Causing Tenosynovitis in Commercial Broilers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Consumers prefer to choose restaurants that value hygiene and safety;therefore, appropriate epidemic prevention measures could restore 30% of lost customers and enhance a restaurants reputation during infectious disease outbreaks.

Little evidence is available to guide the weaning process and optimal timing of tracheostomy tube removal. The purpose of the study was to investigate the value of endoscopic assessment in the tracheostomy decannulation decision. RESULTS: The study included 154 tracheostomized adult patients. Bedside assessment was done for 112 patients, and the other 42 patients were deceased. The results of bedside assessment lead to successful decannulation in 18 patients (16%), while 94 patients (84%) were unfit for decannulation. The most common cause of unfitness was aspiration and poor swallowing in 41% of patients. The endoscopic assessment was done for 59 patients out of 94 patients that were unfit for decannulation; thirteen patients of them were fit for decannulation (22%). The final status of the patients before discharge was decannulated in 31 cases and 81 patients were discharged with a tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated the importance of endoscopic assessment in the decannulation decision of tracheostomized patients. A large proportion of patients who are unfit for decannulation by bedside assessment could be fit after endoscopic assessment.

Scholars predict that the pandemic will continue into the coming winter and will become a seasonal epidemic in the following year. Therefore, the identification of effective control measures becomes extremely important. Although many reports have been published since the COVID-19 outbreak, no studies have identified the relative effectiveness of a combination of control measures implemented in Wuhan and other areas in China. To this end, a retrospective analysis by the collection and modeling of an unprecedented number of epidemiology records in China of the early stage of the outbreaks can be valuable.In this study, we developed a new dynamic model to describe the spread of COVID-19 and to quantify the effectiveness of control measures. The transmission rate, daily close contacts, and the average time from onset to isolation were identified as crucial factors in viral spreading. Moreover, the capacity of a local health-care system is identified as a threshold to control an outbreak in its early stage. We took these factors as controlling parameters in our model. The parameters are estimated based on epidemiological reports from national and local Center for Disease Control (CDCs).A retrospective simulation showed the effectiveness of combinations of 4 major control measures implemented in Wuhan: hospital isolation, social distancing, self-protection by wearing masks, and extensive medical testing. Further analysis indicated critical intervention conditions and times required to control an outbreak in the early stage. Our simulations showed that South Korea has kept the spread of COVID-19 at a low level through extensive medical testing. Furthermore, a predictive simulation for Italy indicated that Italy would contain the outbreak in late May under strict social distancing.In our general analysis, no single measure could contain a COVID-19 outbreak once a health-care system is overloaded. Extensive medical testing could keep viral spreading at a low level. Wearing masks functions as favorably as social distancing but with much lower socioeconomic costs.","output":"A dynamic model of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak to analyze the effectiveness of control measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective This narrative, non-systematic review provides an update on the genetic aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its interactions with the human genome within the context of COVID-19 Although the main focus is on the etiology of this new disease, the genetics of SARS-CoV-2 impacts prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and the development of therapies Data source A literature search was conducted on MEDLINE, BioRxiv, and SciELO, as well as a manual search on the internet (mainly in 2019 and 2020) using the keywords COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, genetics, molecular, mutation, vaccine, Brazil, Brasil, and combinations of these terms The keywords Brazil and Brasil were used to find publications that were specific to the Brazilian populations molecular epidemiology data Articles most relevant to the scope were selected non-systematically Data synthesis A number of publications illustrate an expanding knowledge on the genetics and genomics of SARS-CoV-2 and its implications for understanding COVID-19 Conclusions Knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence permits an in-depth investigation of the role its proteins play in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, which in turn will be enormously valuable for understanding the evolutionary, clinical, and epidemiological aspects of this disease and focusing on prevention and treatment","output":"Genetics of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy (LRPC) without additional abdominal incisions.

The presence of resistance (tetL, tetM, tetS, ermB and msrC) and virulence (ace, esp, agg, cylA and gelE) genes were determined by PCR. A total of 79 enterococci were identified, and Entecococcus faecalis (44.3%) and E. casseliflavus (36.7%) were the most prevalent species isolated. Sixty-five strains (82.3%) were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobials tested, whereas 27 (34.2%) strains were multiresistant. The overall percentages of antimicrobial resistant isolates were: 58.2% to rifampicin, 40.5% to fluoroquinolones, 36.7% to erythromycin and 30.4% to tetracycline. The tetL and tetM genes were found in 57.7% of the tetracycline-resistant strains; and msrC in 31.01% of erythromycin-resistant strains.

Our model further shows that worries about the individual, social, and economic consequences of the crisis, strongly boost stress. The infection rate in the canton (i.e. state) of residence also contributes to stress. Positive thinking and perceived social, organizational, and governmental support mitigate worries and stress.

VSVG-SARS maintains the bullet-like shape of the native VSV, with the heterogeneous S protein incorporated into its surface instead of G protein. The results of safety trials revealed that VSVG-SARS is safe and effective in mice at a dose of 110(6) TCID(50). More importantly, only a single-dose immunization of 210(7) TCID(50) can provide high-level neutralizing antibodies and robust T cell responses to non-human primate animal models.

The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from patients' feces on human cell line raised concerns of possible transmission through human feces including exposure to aerosols generated by toilet flushing and through the indoor drainage system. Currently, routes of transmission, other than the close contact droplet transmission, are still not well understood. A quantitative microbial risk assessment was conducted to estimate the health risks associated with two aerosol exposure scenarios: 1) toilet flushing, and 2) faulty connection of a floor drain with the building's main sewer pipe. SARS-CoV-2 data were collected from the emerging literature. The infectivity of the virus in feces was estimated based on a range of assumption between viral genome equivalence and infectious unit. The human exposure dose was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation of viral concentrations in aerosols under each scenario and human breathing rates. The probability of COVID-19 illness was generated using the dose-response model for SARS-CoV-1, a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, that was responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003.

We evaluated lung and kidney perfusion abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 by dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) and investigated the role of perfusion abnormalities on disease severity as a sign of microvascular obstruction. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with COVID-19 who underwent pulmonary DECT angiography and were suspected of having pulmonary thromboembolism were included. Pulmonary and kidney images were reviewed. Patient characteristics and laboratory findings were compared between those with and without lung perfusion deficits (PDs). RESULTS: DECT images showed PDs in eight patients (25.8%), which were not overlapping with areas of ground-glass opacity or consolidation. Among these patients, two had pulmonary thromboembolism confirmed by CT angiography. Patients with PDs had a longer hospital stay (p = 0.14), higher intensive care unit admission rates (p = 0.02), and more severe disease (p = 0.01).

Nevertheless, since the infected people cough-jets produce plumes of droplets and aerosols that can travel for several meters in the atmosphere, the possible influence of wind circulation and atmospheric turbulence on the infectious plume's fate cannot be ignored. This paper applied cluster analysis for identifying the near surface wind circulation patterns and associated temperature and humidity distributions in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA), then their influence on the spread of the COVID-19 disease during the 2020 pandemic was discussed. Meteorology data and daily numbers of confirmed COVID-19 infections were obtained from public sources. An intense infection activity occurred from October to December 2020, and notable spreading of the disease toward the southwest and south MCMA was observed. In the same period, temperature and humidity conditions that could favor the virus stability and replication were detected in the same sectors, besides 60% of the wind observations revealed considerable northerly components. These findings suggested the existence of correlations between both phenomena. For assessing the possible relationship, the Pearson coefficients between the daily confirmed infections and the temperature and inward flux were estimated, and values from -0.32 to -0.55 and 0.62 to 0.70 were obtained. Correlation was negligible for relative humidity.

Commercial transport, and especially last mile delivery is expected to grow because of the rise of e-commerce. In this frame, electric light commercial vehicles (eLCVs) can be a promising low-emission solution. Literature holistically analysing the potential of eLCVs as well as related support policies is sparse. This paper attempts to close this research gap. To this aim, the total cost of ownership (TCO) comparisons for eLCVs and benchmark vehicles are performed and support measures that target the improvement of the eLCV TCO are analysed. Various eLCV deployment scenarios until 2030 are explored and their impact on carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and other pollutant emissions as well as pollutant concentrations are calculated. It is found that while in several European Union (EU) countries eLCVs are already cost competitive, because of fiscal support, some remaining market barriers need to be overcome to pave the way to mass market deployment of eLCVs. High penetration of eLCVs alone can lead to a reduction of total transport CO(2) emissions by more than 3% by 2030.

Several works show that the pancreas, both in its exocrine and endocrine function, can be affected by this viral infection, although this organ has been poorly analyzed in this current epidemic context. This mini-review aims to provide a summary of available studies on exocrine pancreas involvement during COVID-19 infection. A search through MEDLINE/PubMed was conducted on the topic in hand. With regard to exocrine function, some studies highlight the presence of an associated hyperenzymemia (hyperamylasemia, hyperlipasemia), while others describe isolated and rare cases of acute pancreatitis. More attention should be paid to pancreatic impairment in subjects with COVID-19, as this may prove to be one of the elements aggravating its clinical course. Indeed, acute pancreatitis, especially when presenting in severe forms with hyperstimulation of the pro-inflammatory response, may represent a crucial factor in the progression of COVID-19, entailing both an increase in hospitalization days and in mortality rate.","output":"Involvement of the exocrine pancreas during COVID-19 infection and possible pathogenetic hypothesis: a concise review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of the organization of the motor representation areas in children and adolescents is not well-known. This cross-sectional study aimed to provide an understanding for the development of the functional motor areas of the upper extremity muscles by studying healthy right-handed children (6-9 years, n=10), preadolescents (10-12 years, n=13), adolescents (15-17 years, n=12), and adults (22-34 years, n=12). The optimal representation site and resting motor threshold (rMT) for the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) were assessed in both hemispheres using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). Motor mapping was performed at 110% of the rMT while recording the EMG of six upper limb muscles in the hand and forearm. The association between the motor map and manual dexterity (box and block test, BBT) was examined. The mapping was well-tolerated and feasible in all but the youngest participant whose rMT exceeded the maximum stimulator output. The centers-of-gravity (CoG) for individual muscles were scattered to the greatest extent in the group of preadolescents and centered and became more focused with age. In preadolescents, the CoGs in the left hemisphere were located more laterally, and they shifted medially with age. The proportion of hand compared to arm representation increased with age (=0.001); in the right hemisphere, this was associated with greater fine motor ability. Similarly, there was less overlap between hand and forearm muscles representations in children compared to adults (p<0.001). There was a posterior-anterior shift in the APB hotspot coordinate with age, and the APB coordinate in the left hemisphere exhibited a lateral to medial shift with age from adolescence to adulthood (p=0.006). Our results contribute to the elucidation of the developmental course in the organization of the motor cortex and its associations with fine motor skills. It was shown that nTMS motor mapping in relaxed muscles is feasible in developmental studies in children older than seven years of age.","output":"Primary hand motor representation areas in healthy children, preadolescents, adolescents, and adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Managing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requires paramedics to perform multiple aerosol generating medical procedures in an uncontrolled setting.

In addition to a role in cancer, NRP-1 is a reported entry point for several viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The furin cleavage product of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein takes advantage of the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) binding site on NRP-1 which accommodates a polybasic stretch ending in a C-terminal arginine. This site has long been a focus of drug discovery efforts for cancer therapeutics. We recently showed that interruption of the VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling pathway ameliorates neuropathic pain and hypothesize that interference of this pathway by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein interferes with pain signaling. Here, we report confirmed hits from a small molecule and natural product screen of nearly 0.5 million compounds targeting the VEGF-A binding site on NRP-1. We identified nine chemical series with lead- or drug-like physicochemical properties. Using ELISA, we demonstrate that six compounds disrupt VEGF-A-NRP-1 binding more effectively than EG00229, a known NRP-1 inhibitor. Secondary validation in cells revealed that all tested compounds inhibited VEGF-A triggered VEGFR2 phosphorylation. Further, two compounds displayed robust inhibition of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus protein that utilizes the SARS-CoV-2 Spike for entry and fusion. These compounds represent a first step in a renewed effort to develop small molecule inhibitors of the VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling for the treatment of neuropathic pain and cancer with the added potential of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 virus entry.","output":"Novel Compounds Targeting Neuropilin Receptor 1 with Potential To Interfere with SARS-CoV-2 Virus Entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines against COVID-19 are under development. As a scarce resource, the health authorities have to decide how to prioritise the vaccine in the target population. The aim of this paper is to explore the cost-effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine and to analyse how the vaccine price, and the cost of administrating it, influence its cost-effectiveness. We consider an epidemiological model developed by Statens Serum Institut (SSI) to determine the possible effects of a vaccine in terms of the number of life-years gained and hospital cost saved. The model allows us to differentiate between two populations groups, those above and below 60 years of age, respectively. We used the model to consider four scenarios: 1) vaccination of 1.5 million persons 60 years of age or older, none below that age, 2) vaccination of 1.5 million persons below the age of 60 years, none above that age, 3) vaccination of 900.000 persons below 60 years of age and 1.5 million person 60 years of age or older, and 4) 2.4 million persons below the age of 60 years. The time horizon of the analysis is six months, and the perspective is that of the Danish healthcare sector. The results show that inclusion of the elderly population 60 years of age or older is more cost-effective than a vaccination strategy targeted a population which is younger than 60 years old only. Furthermore, the results show that an extension of the target group from the elderly population only, to also include the younger population comes with an increasing cost per life-year gained. These findings are independent of the specification of the cost of hospitalization for treating COVID-19 infections and the costs of the vaccine. However, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio depends on the price of the vaccine, hereunder also the administration costs, and the discount rate used for the estimation of life-years gained from a vaccine.","output":"The Cost-Effectiveness of a COVID-19 Vaccine in a Danish Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pregnant women have been ubiquitously exposed to pyrethroid pesticides. Previous studies, mainly based on third trimester measurements of maternal urinary pyrethroid metabolites, have reported inconsistent findings in the effects of prenatal pyrethroid exposure on children's neurodevelopmental outcomes. The purpose of this study was to clarify if pyrethroid exposure during the entire three trimesters of pregnancy may be associated with deleterious effects on infant neurodevelopmental status, particularly at a high dosage of exposure. We measured maternal urinary concentrations of pyrethroid metabolites in all trimesters of pregnancy and assessed children's neurodevelopment at one year of age using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III). Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate the effects of metabolites (3-PBA, 4 F-3-PBA, cis-DBCA) in each trimester on BSID-III composite scores. Logistic regression analyses were applied to predict developmental delay vs non-delayed status (cut-off composite score of below 80 for developmental delay) based on the maternal levels of pyrethroid metabolites. In the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy, the detection rates of pyrethroid metabolites were 94.7%, 90.7%, and 89.0%; the 50th percentiles of exposure level were 0.24 g/g, 0.24 g/g and 0.21 g/g for 3-PBA, 0.14 g/g, 0.17 g/g and 0.15 g/g for 4 F-3PBA, 0.21 g/g, 0.25 g/g and 0.19 g/g for cis-DBCA respectively. In the second trimester, 3-PBA was inversely associated with Cognition and Language scores [? = -3.34 (95% CI = -6.11, -0.57) and ? = -2.90 (95% CI = -5.20, -0.61), respectively], and significantly increased the risk of Cognition and Language developmental delay [OR= 1.64 (95% CI = 1.03, 2.62) and OR = 1.52 (95% CI = 1.06, 2.19), respectively]; cis-DBCA was inversely associated with Adaptive Behavior scores [? = -0.73 (95% CI = -1.27, -0.19)], and significantly increased the risk of Adaptive Behavior developmental delay [OR= 1.11 (95% CI = 1.02, 1.21)]. When the maternal levels of pyrethroid metabolites were stratified into the regression models according to the 90th percentile of exposure, in the first trimester, Cognition and Motor scores were inversely associated with higher cis-DBCA [? = -7.19 (95% CI = -12.97, -1.41) and ? = -8.20 (95% CI = -13.35, -3.05), respectively], Language scores were inversely associated with higher 3-PBA [? = -6.01 (95% CI = -10.96, -1.06)]; in the second trimester, Cognition scores were inversely associated with higher cis-DBCA [? = -6.64 (95% CI = -12.51, -0.76)], Language scores were inversely associated with higher 3-PBA [? = -5.17 (95% CI = -10.07, -0.27)] and cis-DBCA [? = -5.40 (95% CI = -10.28, -0.52)].

To study the experience of using focused transthoracic echocardiography in patients with COVID-19 in prone position (fEchoPr) in intensive care units (ICU). Materials and methods. The retrospective observational study included 53 patients (period from 15 April to 31 December 2020). Inclusion criteria: confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, availability of fEchoPr data, outcome certainty (discharge/death). We analyzed electronic medical records. The fEchoPr was performed in patients in the prone position with a bolster under the left side of the chest and left arm raised ('swimmer's position'). We assessed the systolic function of the right ventricle (RV) (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)), RV size, RV/LV ratio, systolic function of the left ventricle (LV) (left ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral. (LVOT VTI)), and pulmonary hypertension (PH) (tricuspid regurgitation peak gradient (PGTR). Depending on the results, the patients were divided into 2 groups: informative (+fEchoPr) and non-informative (-fEchoPr) examinations. Results. There was no statistically significant difference in the groups (+fEcho n = 35 vs -fEcho n = 18) by age (65.6  15.3 vs 60.2  15.8, p >0.05), by gender (male: 23 (65.7%) vs 14 (77.8%), p >0.05), by body mass index (31.3  5.3 kg/m2 vs 29.5  5.4 kg/m2, p >0.05), by mechanical ventilation support (24 (68.6%) vs 17 (94.4%), p = 0.074), by NEWS scale indicators (6.9  3.7 vs 8.5  3.5 points), by mortality (82.8% vs 94.4%, p >0.05). Correlation analysis revealed a moderate inverse relationship between being on mechanical ventilation and the informative value of the study (Spearman's r = ?0.30 at p = 0.033). In the +fEchoPr group, the correct measurement of TAPSE and RV/LV was carried out in 100%: a decrease in RV systolic function was recorded in 5 patients (14%), expansion of the RV in 13 patients (37%). Signs of PH were detected in 11 patients (31%), PGTR could not be measured in 10 patients (28%). LV systolic dysfunction was detected in 7 patients (20%). No pathology was detected in 16 patients (46%). One patient was diagnosed with infective endocarditis of native mitral valve, which was later confirmed by autopsy. Conclusion.

Patients were included if they had a TTE performed during the hospitalization after a known positive diagnosis for COVID-19. Demographic and clinical data were obtained using chart abstraction from the electronic medical record. Results Of 749 patients, 72 (9.6%) had a TTE following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The most common clinical indications for TTE were concern for a major acute cardiovascular event (45.8%) and hemodynamic instability (29.2%). While most patients had preserved biventricular function, 34.7% were found to have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)  50% and 13.9% had at least moderately reduced right ventricular function. Four patients had wall motion abnormalities suggestive of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Using Spearman rank correlation there was an inverse relationship between high sensitivity Troponin T and LVEF (rho = -0.34, p=0.006). Among 20 patients with prior echocardiograms, only two (10%) patients had a new reduction in LVEF of more than 10%.

Results: All patients suffered from severe ARDS, 30.8% died. Interleukin (IL)-6 was massively elevated at every time-point. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was concomitantly upregulated with IL-6. The cellular response was characterized by lymphocytopenia with low counts of CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) and na?ve T helper cells. CD8+ T and NK cells recovered after 8 to 14 days.

Using this information, we attempted to assess the viability of SVPs as a solution for health professions education during and after the pandemic. The main research tool was a questionnaire on students' perceptions of their participation in the SVP. As a complementary qualitative method, we used semi-structured interviews with the volunteers. Our respondents (n = 158) perceived conditions and safety generally positively: most reported having personal protective equipment (89.24%), technical support (88.61%), and induction training (79.11%). Only 38.61% said they had access to psychological support. In our view, benefits (e.g., an opportunity to make new contacts or receiving positive reactions from patients and staff) seemed to outweigh costs. 65.82% of the respondents agreed that they learnt new interesting things. A majority noticed the development of their soft skills (social 86.08%; organisational 78.48%; stress management 68.99%), while 40.51% - the development of their medical skills. The interviews pointed to additional benefits for students such as gaining insight of the healthcare system, and costs such as distress caused by some patient interactions.

Previous work on respiratory viral infections demonstrated that airway inflammation results in the release of volatile organic compounds as well as nitric oxide. The detection of these gases from patients exhaled breath offers a novel potential diagnostic target for COVID-19 that would offer real-time screening of patients for COVID-19 infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We present here a breath tester utilizing a catalytically active material, which allows for the temporal manifestation of the gaseous biomarkers interactions with the sensor, thus giving a distinct breath print of the disease. A total of 46 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients on mechanical ventilation participated in the study, 23 with active COVID-19 respiratory infection and 23 non-COVID-19 controls. Exhaled breath bags were collected on ICU days 1, 3, 7, and 10 or until liberation from mechanical ventilation. The breathalyzer detected high exhaled nitric oxide (NO) concentration with a distinctive pattern for patients with active COVID-19 pneumonia. The COVID-19 breath print has the pattern of the small Greek letter omega (). The breath print identified patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with 88% accuracy upon their admission to the ICU. Furthermore, the sensitivity index of the breath print (which scales with the concentration of the key biomarker ammonia) appears to correlate with duration of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The implication of this breath tester technology for the rapid screening for COVID-19 and potentially detection of other infectious diseases in the future.","output":"Exhaled nitric oxide detection for diagnosis of COVID-19 in critically ill patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elemente und Quantifizierung: Ein Nucleins?ure\\\\Assay, der auf einer Elementmarkierungsstrategie mit magnetischen Mikropartikeln (MMPs) beruht, erm?glicht die Quantifizierung mehrfacher DNA\\\\Ziele.

Objective: To provide new insights into the natural history of outpatients with native AS based on a large regionwide population study with inclusion by all cardiologists regardless of their mode of practice. Design, Setting, and Participants: Between May 2016 and December 2017, consecutive outpatients with mild (peak aortic velocity, 2.5-2.9 m/s), moderate (peak aortic velocity, 3-3.9 m/s), and severe (peak aortic velocity, 4 m/s) native AS graded by echocardiography were included by 117 cardiologists from the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region in France. Analysis took place between August and November 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Natural history, need for AVR, and survival of patients with AS were followed up. Indications for AVR were based on current guideline recommendations. Results: Among 2703 patients (mean [SD] age, 76.0 [10.8] years; 1260 [46.6%] women), 233 (8.6%) were recruited in a university public hospital, 757 (28%) in nonuniversity public hospitals, and 1713 (63.4%) by cardiologists working in private practice. A total of 1154 patients (42.7%) had mild, 1122 (41.5%) had moderate, and 427 (15.8%) had severe AS. During a median (interquartile range) of 2.1 (1.4-2.7) years, 634 patients underwent AVR and 448 died prior to AVR. Most deaths were cardiovascular (200 [44.7%]), mainly associated with congestive heart failure (101 [22.6%]) or sudden death (60 [13.4%]). Deaths were noncardiovascular in 186 patients (41.5%) and from unknown causes in 62 patients (13.8%). Compared with patients with mild AS, there was increased cardiovascular mortality in those with moderate (hazard ratio, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.07-2.02]) and severe (hazard ratio, 3.66 [95% CI, 2.52-5.31]) AS. The differences remained significant when adjusted for baseline characteristics or in time-dependent analyses considering AS progression. In asymptomatic patients, moderate and mild AS were associated with similar cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.44-2.21]). Conclusions and Relevance: While patients in this study with moderate AS had a slightly higher risk of cardiovascular death than patients with mild AS, this risk was much lower than that observed in patients with severe AS. Moreover, in asymptomatic patients, moderate and mild AS were associated with similar cardiovascular mortality.","output":"Association of Mortality With Aortic Stenosis Severity in Outpatients: Results From the VALVENOR Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Undernutrition (UN) may negatively impact clinical outcomes for hospitalized patients. The relationship between UN status at pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission and clinical outcomes is still not well-reported. This systematic meta-analysis review evaluated the impact of UN at admission to PICU on clinical outcomes, including mortality incidence, length of stay (LOS), and the need for and length of time on mechanical ventilation (MV). METHODS: A search was conducted using relevant and multi-medical databases from inception until January 2022. We considered studies that examined the link between UN at PICU admission and clinical outcomes in patients aged 18 years or younger. Pooled risk difference estimates for the PICU outcomes were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULT: There were a total of 10,638 patients included in 17 observational studies; 8,044 (75.61%) and 2,594 (24.38%) patients, respectively, were normal-nourished (NN) and undernourished (UN). In comparison to NN patients, UN patients had a slightly higher risk of mortality (RD = 0.02, P = 0.05), MV usage (RD = 0.05, P = 0.02), and PICU LOS (RD = 0.07, P = 0.007). While the duration of MV was significantly longer in UN than in NN (RD = 0.13, P < 0.0001). Sensitivity analysis of UN classification cohorts with a z-score < -2 or in the 5%, patetints age up to 18 years, and mixed diagnose for PICU admission demonstrated a 6-fold increase in the probability of PICU LOS in UN patients compared to NN patients (RD = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.12). UN patients have a higher risk of MV usage RD = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.00, 0.14) in studies involving cohorts with a mixed primary diagnosis for PICU admission. CONCLUSION: In PICU, UN is linked to mortality incidence, longer PICU stay, MV usage, and duration on MV. The primary diagnosis for PICU admission may also influence clinical outcomes. Determining the prevalence of UN in hospitalized patients, as well as the subgroups of patients diagnosed at the time of admission, requires more research. This may help explain the relationship between nutritional status and clinical outcomes in PICU patients.","output":"Is Undernutrition Associated With Deterioration of Outcomes in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU): Systematic and Meta-Analysis Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and the associated lockdown measures, the number of children treated in this childrens hospital for eating disorders and in particular anorexia nervosa has significantly increased.

This Article reviews these facilities, explains what they are for, and examines the statutory rules that govern them. It distinguishes between seven liquidity facilities designed to backstop deposit substitutes issued by shadow banks and seven credit facilities designed to invest directly in the real economy. Ten of these facilities C three of the liquidity facilities and all seven of the credit facilities C are contemplated by the CARES Act, which appropriates money for the Treasury Secretary to invest in them. But all ten are inconsistent with at least one of the following three provisions of existing law, none of which the CARES Act explicitly amends: (1) section 13(3)(B)(i) of the Federal Reserve Act, which requires the Fed to ensure that 13(3) lending is for the purpose of providing liquidity to the financial system;(2) section 13(3)(A), which requires the Fed to obtain evidence that participants are unable to secure adequate credit accommodations from other banks;and (3) section 10(a) of the Gold Reserve Act, codified at 31 U.S.C.  5302, which limits the Treasury Secretary to using the Exchange Stabilization Fund to deal in securities consistent with a stable system of exchange rates. Of the four liquidity facilities not contemplated by the CARES Act, two are inconsistent with any reasonable interpretation of section 14(2)(b) of the Federal Reserve Act, which authorizes the Fed to buy and sell government debt only in the open market, and one is inconsistent with a similar requirement in section 14(1) regarding foreign currency. (Although these facilities are permitted by sections 13(13) and 13(3) respectively.) Hence thirteen of the Feds fourteen facilities as currently constituted are in tension with either the Federal Reserve Act, the Gold Reserve Act, or both. Three conclusions follow. First, most of the Feds current, critical lending activities are an exception to the baseline statutory framework, permissible only in conjunction with the CARES Act. Second, Congresss failure to amend that framework is obscuring the fact that it is asking the Fed to take on substantial new responsibilities C ones for which it was not designed and which it may struggle to discharge. Third, Congress should update our money and banking laws to clarify the rules governing Fed lending, reduce the need for monetary backstops, and improve the governments ability to respond quickly and effectively to fiscal emergencies in the future.","output":"Unappropriated Dollars: The Fed's Ad Hoc Lending Facilities and the Rules That Govern Them"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

Gallium 68 can be made available either from onsite cyclotron production or in the form of ready-to-use (68)Ge/(68)Ga generators. Wherein setting up and running of cyclotron amounts to huge investment and dedicated team, the (68)Ge/(68)Ga generator has proved to be a better option and viable project. Moreover, due to long half-life of (68)Ge, i.e. 271 days, it enables the usage of generator for several months. The preparation of gallium-labeled peptides is much simpler in comparison to 18F radiochemistry, but the radiation exposure has always been an area of concern owing to high-energy annihilation photon of 511 keV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we share our experience of self-installation of (68)Ge/(68)Ga generator during lockdown and the various steps involved in installation of fully automated peptide-labeling system in customized mini hot cell module, synthesis steps, and quality control steps of gallium-based radiopharmaceutical. RESULTS: The installation was successfully completed with online assistance during the pandemic situation. The average elution yield met company specification (>80%), and (68)Ga-labeled peptides were prepared with high radiochemical purity (>95%). The overall exposure in single batch of production and quality control never exceeded 3 Sv as shielding was well-taken care of with customized mini hot cell.

In this quantitative study, the data of 563 college graduates from different schools were collected by using the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12, Vocational Selection Anxiety Questionnaire of University Graduate, and Career Planning Scale. The final effective sample size was 550 (the overall recovery rate was 97.7%). The results of correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between IU and employment anxiety, while there was a significant negative correlation between career planning and IU, as well as the relationship between career planning and employment anxiety. The results of hierarchical regression analysis showed that IU significantly positively predicted the employment anxiety of graduates, and career planning moderated the relationship between IU and employment anxiety. These findings suggested that maintaining a sense of career planning can help college graduates get through smoothly in the face of uncertainty of COVID-19.","output":"The Relationship Between Intolerance of Uncertainty and Employment Anxiety of Graduates During COVID-19: The Moderating Role of Career Planning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The host immune response determines the clinical course of a viral infection, for example in case of COVID-19 infection. The effectiveness of vaccination also depends on the induced immune response. Currently there is no method to measure the cellular immune response in blood samples. The functional activity of cells of innate and adaptive immune system is determined by coordinated activity of signaling pathways, especially the JAK-STAT pathways. Using a previously described approach we developed mRNA-based tests to measure activity of these signaling pathways, and show that they can be used to measure in a quantitative manner the cellular innate and adaptive immune response to a viral infection or vaccine in whole blood, PBMC, and specific immune cell type samples. Pathway activity level and range in healthy individuals was established, enabling interpretation of a pathway activity score on a patient sample without the need for a reference sample. Evidence is presented that the pathway activity analysis may also be useful for in vitro vaccine development and assessment of vaccine immunogenicity. Other envisioned applications lie in development of immunomodulatory drugs and drug response prediction and monitoring. Tests are expected to be of value in the COVID-19 crisis. In addition to the described Affymetrix microarray-based pathway tests for measuring host immune response, qPCR-based versions are in development; the latter can in principle be performed within three hours in routine hospital labs.","output":"Quantitative measurement of activity of JAK-STAT signaling pathways in blood samples and immune cells to predict innate and adaptive cellular immune response to viral infection and accelerate vaccine development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There is concern about medium to long-term adverse outcomes following acute COVID-19, but little relevant evidence exists. We aimed to investigate whether risks of hospital admission and death, overall and by specific cause, are raised following discharge from a COVID-19 hospitalisation. Methods and Findings: Working on behalf of NHS-England, we used linked primary care and hospital data in OpenSAFELY to compare risks of hospital admission and death, overall and by specific cause, between people discharged from COVID-19 hospitalisation (February-December 2020), and (i) demographically-matched controls from the 2019 general population; (ii) people discharged from influenza hospitalisation in 2017-19. We used Cox regression adjusted for personal and clinical characteristics. 24,673 post-discharge COVID-19 patients, 123,362 general population controls, and 16,058 influenza controls were followed for []315 days. Overall risk of hospitalisation or death (30968 events) was higher in the COVID-19 group than general population controls (adjusted-HR 2.23, 2.14-2.31) but similar to the influenza group (adjusted-HR 0.94, 0.91-0.98). All-cause mortality (7439 events) was highest in the COVID-19 group (adjusted-HR 4.97, 4.58-5.40 vs general population controls and 1.73, 1.60-1.87 vs influenza controls). Risks for cause-specific outcomes were higher in COVID-19 survivors than general population controls, and largely comparable between COVID-19 and influenza patients. However, COVID-19 patients were more likely than influenza patients to be readmitted/die due to their initial infection/other lower respiratory tract infection (adjusted-HR 1.37, 1.22-1.54), and to experience mental health or cognitive-related admission/death (adjusted-HR 1.36, 1.01-2.83); in particular, COVID-19 survivors with pre-existing dementia had higher risk of dementia death. One limitation of our study is that reasons for hospitalisation/death may have been misclassified in some cases due to inconsistent use of codes. Conclusions: People discharged from a COVID-19 hospital admission had markedly higher risks for rehospitalisation and death than the general population, suggesting a substantial extra burden on healthcare. Most risks were similar to those observed after influenza hospitalisations; but COVID-19 patients had higher risks of all-cause mortality, readmissions/death due to the initial infection, and dementia death, highlighting the importance of post-discharge monitoring.","output":"Overall and cause-specific hospitalisation and death after COVID-19 hospitalisation in England: cohort study in OpenSAFELY using linked primary care, secondary care and death registration data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rural areas of the United States have been disproportionately impacted by the opioid epidemic, exacerbated by COVID-19-related economic upheavals. While polysubstance use is an important determinant of overdose risk, variability in polysubstance use as a result of numerous factors (e.g., access, preference) has yet to be described, particularly among rural persons with opioid use disorder (PWOUD). Survey data on past-month use of prescription and illicit opioids and 12 non-opioid psychoactive drug classes were analyzed from a national sample of rural (n = 3872) and urban (n = 8153) residents entering treatment for OUD from 2012 to 2019. Trend analyses for opioid and stimulant use were compared between rural and urban PWOUD. Latent class analyses assessed substance use trends through identified typologies of rural/urban PWOUD, which then underwent comparative analyses. By 2019, prescription opioid use remained greater in rural versus urban PWOUD, and methamphetamine use showed greater growth in rural, compared to urban areas. Latent class analyses identified variability in polysubstance use, with five identical subgroups in rural/urban PWOD: high polysubstance, polyprescription, prescription opioid-focused, prescription opioid-focused with polysubstance use, and illicit opioid-focused. Polyprescription was highest in rural areas, with illicit opioid-focused use highest in urban areas. Demographic characteristics, co-morbid conditions and healthcare coverage were all associated with between-group differences. There is significant variability in polysubstance use that may identify specific prevention and treatment needs for subpopulations of OUD patients: interventions focused on reducing opioid prescriptions, early engagement with mental health resources, wider distribution of naloxone, and screening/treatment plans that take into account the use of multiple substances.","output":"Polysubstance use trends and variability among individuals with opioid use disorder in rural versus urban settings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current literature has focused on testing saliva in symptomatic patients, and little information is available regarding saliva performance in asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Management of patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is challenging due to the scarce scientific information and treatment guidelines. In this work, we present our Institutional experience with our first 100 patients with oncological malignancies and COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of the first 100 patients hospitalised at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas (Lima, Peru) who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR during the period 30 March to 20 June. Clinicopathological variables of the oncological disease as well as risk factors, management and outcomes to COVID-19 were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean age was 43.5 years old (standard deviations: 24.8) where 57% were male patients. In total, 44%, 37% and 19% were adult patients bearing solid tumours, adults with haematologic malignancies and paediatric patients, respectively. Hypertension was the most frequent comorbidity (23%) followed by chronic lung disease (10%). COVID-19-associated symptoms included cough (65%), fever (57%) and dyspnoea (56%). Twelve percent of patients were asymptomatic. Nosocomial infections were more frequent in paediatric patients (84.2%) than in adult patients (16.0%). Patients with uncontrolled oncological disease were most frequent (72%). Anaemia was present in 67% of patients, 68% had lymphopenia, 62% had ferritin value > 500 mcg/L, 85% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 83% D-dimer > 500 ng/mL and 80% C-Reactive Protein > 8 mg/L. The most common complication was acute respiratory failure (42%). Overall fatality rate was 39% where the main cause of mortality was acute respiratory distress syndrome (64.1%). CONCLUSION: Paediatric patients had better outcomes than adult populations, and a high number of asymptomatic carriers and nosocomial infection, early diagnosis are recommended. Considering oncological treatments 30 days before COVID-19 diagnosis, our data did not reveal an increased mortality.","output":"Characteristics of COVID-19 in cancer patients: a cross-sectional study in Peru"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The optimal virulence of a pathogen is determined by a trade-off between maximizing the rate of transmission and maximizing the duration of infectivity. Treatment measures such as curative therapy and case isolation exert selective pressure by reducing the duration of infectivity, reducing the value of duration-increasing strategies to the pathogen and favoring pathogen strategies that maximize the rate of transmission. We extend the trade-off models of previous authors, and represents the reproduction number of the pathogen as a function of the transmissibility, host contact rate, disease-induced mortality, recovery rate, and treatment rate, each of which may be influenced by the virulence. We find that when virulence is subject to a transmissibility-mortality trade-off, treatment can lead to an increase in optimal virulence, but that in other scenarios (such as the activity-recovery trade-off) treatment decreases the optimal virulence. Paradoxically, when levels of treatment rise with pathogen virulence, increasing control efforts may raise predicted levels of optimal virulence. Thus we show that conflict can arise between the epidemiological benefits of treatment and the evolutionary risks of heightened virulence.","output":"The effect of treatment on pathogen virulence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The field of biodosimetry has seen a paradigm shift towards an increased use of molecular phenotyping technologies including omics and miRNA, in addition to conventional cytogenetic techniques.

Apart from relieving anaemia symptoms, the application of ESA can prevent the necessity of the red blood cells transfusion in patients with CIA and thus avoid transfusion-related complications. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the absence of the necessity of hospitalization to transfuse blood products presents an additional value. The aim of the study is to assess the results of the application of darbepoetin alfa in the treatment of anaemia in pts undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for EBC. Methods: A retrospective assessmentwas carried out of the results of darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp?) treatment of 98 pts receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for EBC in the National Institute of Oncology in Poland in whom therapy was initiated in the period from 02 January 2019 to 16 February 2020. The drug was given to symptomatic anaemia patients, with a haemoglobin (Hb) level of 8C11 g/dL. In addition, it was also applied in chemotherapy-undergoing patients, with asymptomatic anaemia, with a haemoglobin concentration of <8 g/dL. The treatment was continued until a stable Hb level was reached ensuring the security of further oncological treatment without the necessity of RBC transfusion or termination of chemotherapy. Results: The results of darbepoetin alfa treatment were assessed in a group of 98 subsequent pts, in the course of neadjuvant chemotherapy for EBC. The pts received the following chemotherapy regimens: AC/PCL (35%), AC/PCL + carboplatin (9%), TCH (33%), TCH-P (8%), other (15%). At the moment of the initiation of ESA administration, 18% pts were aged 65 or more (max 76) while 82% below 65 yrs. of age (min 28). In the majority (90) of pts the number of Aranesp? doses administered did not exceed 3, only 8 received 4 doses. The estimated effectiveness in the <65 vs 65 years of age groups was 84.8% vs 79.8%, respectively. The estimated effectiveness values in the following BMI-dependent groups, namely: underweight + normal weight (BMI: 16C24.99), overweight (BMI 25C29.99) and obesity (BMI 30C43.1), were 86.3%, 76.6% and 72.0%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Darbepoetin alfa proved effective in the treatment of anaemia in chemotherapy-treated pts for EBC.

Key social indicators suggest that violence, abuse and exploitation of children in the Pacific Island nations challenge their most vulnerable and marginalised children (Save the Children, 2019). To make the Pacific safe for every child, a number of nations are developing legal and regulatory frameworks for childrens protection, with child and family welfare systems that address behaviour, attitudes and policies related to child protection concerns. This article examines key grey literature drawn from UN, NGO and government documents, to offer an overview of what legal and welfare systems are in place in the Pacific Island nations in regard to child protection needs.

CCoV antigen was found in epithelial cells of small intestinal villi in all puppies and the colon in 2 of the 10 puppies where colon specimens were available. No evidence of systemic CCoV infection was found. Comparative sequence analyses of viral RNA extracted from intestinal tissues revealed CCoV-II genotype in 9 out of 11 puppies. Of the nine CCoV-IIs, five were subtyped as group IIa and one as IIb, while three CCoVs could not be subtyped. One of the CCoV-IIa variants was isolated in cell culture. Infection with CCoV alone was found in five puppies, of which two also had small intestinal intussusception. Concurrent infections with either parvovirus (n = 1), attaching-effacing Escherichia coli (n = 4), or protozoan parasites (n = 3) were found in the other six puppies. CCoV is an important differential diagnosis in outbreaks of severe enterocolitis among puppies between 4 days and 21 weeks of age that are housed at high population density.

We performed a cross-sectional study of data obtained from the WoW consultation survey and a manifest content analysis of anonymised email correspondence of 140 women consulting with the WoW helpdesk from France. FINDINGS: We found that women encounter macro-level, individual-level and provider-level constraints while trying to access abortion in France. The preferences and needs over secrecy (n=356, 46.2%), privacy (n=295, 38.3%) and comfort (n=269, 34.9%) are among the most frequent reasons for women from France to choose telemedicine abortion through WoW.

However, 40% of the mutations are variants of unknown significance (VUS), with the challenge being to objectively predict whether a VUS is pathogenic and supports the tumor or whether it is benign. To objectively decode VUS, we mapped cancer sequence data and evolutionary trace (ET) scores onto crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy structures with variant impacts quantitated by evolutionary action (EA) measures. As tumors depend on helicases and nucleases to deal with transcription/replication stress, we targeted helicaseCnucleaseCRPA complexes: (1) XPB-XPD (within TFIIH), XPF-ERCC1, XPG, and RPA for transcription and nucleotide excision repair pathways and (2) BLM, EXO5, and RPA plus DNA2 for stalled replication fork restart. As validation, EA scoring predicts severe effects for most disease mutations, but disease mutants with low ET scores not only are likely destabilizing but also disrupt sophisticated allosteric mechanisms. For sites of disease mutations and VUS predicted to be severe, we found strong co-localization to ordered regions. Rare discrepancies highlighted the different survival requirements between disease and tumor mutations, as well as the value of examining proteins within complexes. In a genome-wide analysis of 33 cancer types, we found correlation between the number of mutations in each tumor and which pathways or functional processes in which the mutations occur, revealing different mutagenic routes to tumorigenesis. We also found upregulation of ancient genes including BLM, which supports a non-random and concerted cancer process: reversion to a unicellular, proliferation-uncontrolled, status by breaking multicellular constraints on cell division. Together, these genes and global analyses challenge the binary driver and passenger mutation paradigm, support a gradient impact as revealed by EA scoring from moderate to severe at a single gene level, and indicate reduced regulation as well as activity.

In this work, we compared mathematical models recently published in scholarly journals and designed online dashboards that present actual information about COVID-19. METHODS: All CNICs were downloaded from GitHub.

The Kano diagram was applied to display the association and the difference in model R(2) on a dashboard. RESULTS: We observed that the correlation coefficient was 0.48 (t = 9.87, n = 265) between QE and IRT models based on R(2) when modeling CNICs in a short run (dated from January 1 to February 16, 2021).

METHODS A hospital-based retrospective case-control study was conducted on 194 type 2 diabetic patients undergoing cataract surgery in Rajavithi Hospital from January 2007 to December 2015. Fifteen patients with PCE were included as the case group and 179 patients without PCE were included as the control group. Potential factors associated with PCE among both groups including demographics, pre-operative characteristics, surgical settings and complications, were statistically analyzed using Chi-square testing and a logistic regression model. RESULTS Within the case group, 53% were females and the median age was 68y. Univariate analysis of pre-operative characteristics, surgical settings and complications revealed that recent pre-operative fasting plasma glucose, insulin therapy, presence of diabetic retinopathy, and severe non-proliferative or proliferative diabetic retinopathy were significantly associated with PCE. In a multivariate analysis adjusting for blood glucose level, insulin treatment was the only significant factor associated with an increased risk of PCE (OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.0-15.0, P=0.04) compared to patients without insulin treatment. The most common causative organisms were gram-positive bacteria (89%). Staphylococcus species represented the most common group (67%).

Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyze longitudinally the psychopathological consequences of the pandemic in pregnant women, and to explore differences with non-pregnant women. The participants in this study were 102 pregnant women, and a control group of 102 non-pregnant women (most of them reported having university studies and little financial impact from the pandemic). They completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, in three different times (2, 14, and 47 days after the start of the lockdown). In a time range of 50 days of quarantine, all women showed a gradual increase in psychopathological indicators and a decrease in positive affect. Pregnant women showed a more pronounced increase in depression, anxiety and negative affect than the non-pregnant women did. In addition, pregnant women showed a more pronounced decrease in positive affect.

Early identification of malignant eyelid tumors is crucial to avoiding substantial morbidity and mortality. However, differentiating malignant eyelid tumors from benign ones can be challenging for primary care physicians and even some ophthalmologists. Here, based on 1,417 photographic images from 851 patients across three hospitals, we developed an artificial intelligence system using a faster region-based convolutional neural network and deep learning classification networks to automatically locate eyelid tumors and then distinguish between malignant and benign eyelid tumors. The system performed well in both internal and external test sets (AUCs ranged from 0.899 to 0.955). The performance of the system is comparable to that of a senior ophthalmologist, indicating that this system has the potential to be used at the screening stage for promoting the early detection and treatment of malignant eyelid tumors.","output":"Artificial intelligence to detect malignant eyelid tumors from photographic images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Tools to detect SARS-Coronavirus-2 variants of concern and track the ongoing evolution of the virus are necessary to support ongoing public health efforts and the design and evaluation of novel COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines. Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been adopted as the gold standard method for discriminating SARS-CoV-2 lineages, alternative methods may be required when processing samples with low viral loads or low RNA quality. Methods: An allele-specific probe polymerase chain reaction (ASP-PCR) targeting lineage-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was developed and used to screen 1,082 samples from two clinical trials in the United Kingdom and Brazil. Probit regression models were developed to compare ASP-PCR performance against 1,771 NGS results for the same cohorts. Results: Individual SNPs were shown to readily identify specific variants of concern. ASP-PCR was shown to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 lineages with a higher likelihood than NGS over a wide range of viral loads. Comparative advantage for ASP-PCR over NGS was most pronounced in samples with Ct values between 26-30 and in samples that showed evidence of degradation. Results for samples screened by ASP-PCR and NGS showed 99% concordant results. Discussion: ASP-PCR is well-suited to augment but not replace NGS. The method can differentiate SARS-COV-2 lineages with high accuracy and would be best deployed to screen samples with lower viral loads or that may suffer from degradation.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 604 consecutive patients who underwent IAT for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke in two tertiary centers (2008-2013/2010-2013). Sixty patients selected by MRI or CT perfusion presenting within <24 h of onset with modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) grade 3 or 2c reperfusion were included. Significant infarct growth (SIG) was defined as infarct expansion >11.6 mL. RESULTS Mean age was 67.013.7 years, 56% were men. Mean National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 16.26.1, time from onset to puncture was 6.83.1 h, and procedure length was 1.30.6 h. MRI was used for baseline core analysis in 43% of patients. Mean baseline infarct volume was 17.119.1 mL, absolute infarct growth was 30.674.5 mL, and final infarct volume was 47.777.7 mL. Overall, 35% of patients had SIG. Three of 21 patients (14%) treated with stent-retrievers had SIG compared with 14 of 39 (36%) with first-generation devices.

Here we aimed to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2, in children and adolescents aged 3-17 years old. Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1/2 clinical trial of CoronaVac in healthy children and adolescents aged 3-17 years old in Zanhuang (Hebei, China). Vaccine (in 0 5ml aluminum hydroxide adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant only) was given by intramuscular injection in two doses (day 0 and day 28). We conducted phase 1 trial in 71 participants with an age de-escalation in tree groups and dose-escalation in two blocks (1.5ug or 3ug per injection). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (3:1) using block randomisation to receive CoronaVac or placebo. In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) using block randomisation to receive either CoronaVac at 1.5ug or 3ug per dose, or placebo. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after each injection in all participants who received at least one dose. The primary immunogenicity endpoint was seroconversion rate at 28 days after the second injection and its GMT as the secondary endpoint. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04551547).Findings: Between October 31 and December 2, 2020, 72 participants were enrolled in phase 1, and between December 12 and December 30, 2020, 480 participants were enrolled in phase 2. 500 participants received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo (n=71 for phase 1 and n=479 for phase 2;safety population). In the combined safety profile of phase 1 and phase 2, any adverse reactions within 28 days after injection occurred in 56 (26%) of 219 participants in the 15ug group, 63 (29%) of 217 in the 3ug group and 27 (24%) of 114 in the placebo group, without significant difference. Most adverse reactions were mild and moderate in severity and injection site pain (73[13%]) of 550 participants was the most frequently reported event. As of March 12, 2021, only one serious adverse event has been reported, which was considered unrelated to vaccination. In phase 1, seroconversion after the second dose was observed in 27 of 27 participants (1000% [95%CI 873-1000]) in the 15ug groups and 26 of 26 participants (1000% [868-1000]) in the 3ug group, with the geometric mean titers of 550 (95%CI 389-779) and 1174 (878-1570). In phase 2, seroconversion was seen in 180 of 186 participants (968% [931-988]) in the 15ug group and 180 of 180 participants (1000% [980-1000]) in the 3ug group, with the geometric mean titers of 864 (739-1010) and 1422 (1247-1621).

Through a large-scale experiment, we studied three specification types: learning objectives, insights, and assessments. Participants, guided by one of these specifications, rated their preferences for a set of visualization designs. Then, we evaluated the set of visualization designs to assess which specification led participants to prefer the most effective visualizations.

DoD sought external analytic support through the RAND Arroyo Center. In response to the questions posed by OMB request, this study finds the following: (1) Current DoD biosurveillance supports three strategic missions. Based mostly on existing statute, the highest-priority mission is force health protection, followed by biological weapons defense and global health security. (2) Guidance issued by the White House on June 27, 2013, specified priorities for planning fiscal year 2015 budgets; it includes an explicit global health security priority, which strengthens the case for this as a key DoD biosurveillance strategic mission. (3) DoD biosurveillance also supports four desired outcomes: early warning and early detection, situational awareness, better decision making at all levels, and forecast of impacts. (4) Programs and measures that address priority missions-force health protection in particular-and desired outcomes should be prioritized over those that do not do so. (5) More near-real-time analysis and better internal and external integration could enhance the performance and value of the biosurveillance enterprise. (6) Improvements are needed in key enablers, including explicit doctrine/policy, efficient organization and governance, and increased staffing and improved facilities for the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC). (7) AFHSC has requested additional funding to fully implement its current responsibilities under the 2012 Memorandum of Understanding between the Assistant Secretaries of Defense for Health Affairs and for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs. Additional responsibilities for coordinating the entire DoD biosurveillance enterprise would need concomitant resourcing. (8) There is not a single, unified funding system for the DoD biosurveillance enterprise; the multiple current funding systems would likely benefit from an organizing mechanism with the authority to manage and control funds to meet enterprise goals. Interim guidance issued by the Deputy Secretary of Defense on June 13, 2013, is significant because it is the first policy to explicitly address biosurveillance; it adopts the definition from the National Strategy for Biosurveillance, calls for development of a DoD Directive for biosurveillance, and specifies tasks for DoD's implementation of the Strategy.","output":"Toward Integrated DoD Biosurveillance: Assessment and Opportunities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel SARS-CoV-2 human coronavirus in Wuhan, China, has triggered a worldwide respiratory disease outbreak (COVID-19).

Examination of these studies showed they lacked validity due to a low sensitivity to detect HAO, and because they pre-date both advanced healthcare systems and the emergence of recent nosocomial pathogen challenges. The accepted inference: that as there are so few HAOs the focus of surveillance programmes should be on endemic and not epidemic infections (outbreaks), is therefore called into question. Current estimates of HAI burden are derived from Point Prevalence Surveys (PPS) which are neither designed to nor are capable of detecting HAOs. We considered the extensive Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT) work to prevent and prepare for perennial and novel HAOs and suggest that at present this endeavour is largely unseen, underestimated and undervalued.

The assessment of anteroposterior soft tissue relationships is by using skeletal points and cranial reference planes. The anteroposterior relationships are, however, clinically affected by soft tissue structures. In this pilot study, we aim to assess the anteroposterior relationships based on soft tissue landmarks. Materials and methods: Lateral cephalograms were collected from 100 patients and evaluated on Facad software. The subject consisted of a mean age of 20  7 years. Fifty-four cephalograms selected were used to perform the analysis. A new angle FSA was measured based on soft tissue landmarks. A new plane used for this analysis is the SA plane. Using this angle, we classified the cephalograms as class I, II, and III. Results: There is a statistically significant value to differentiate the profile of patients using the FSA angle. Thus, this new angle is created to determine the anteroposterior soft tissue relationship using soft tissue landmarks on a cephalometric analysis and from our data, the value was 81  7.57 for class 1 patients that is consistent with the previous studies which evaluate sagittal skeletal relationships. Conclusion: There are various difficulties and errors in the previous analysis that is used to determine the anteroposterior jaw relations. Skeletal landmarks have been used previously and most of these points are not stable points. Thus, this new analysis that will be using soft tissue landmarks can be used to differentiate in the various profiles of patients with different malocclusions.

DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). DATA SOURCES: The bibliographical databases PubMed, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane, Scopus, ISI WoS and PeDRO were searched, with studies from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2020 eligible for inclusion. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included RCTs, reported in English or Spanish, with at least an intervention group performing workplace exercises among office workers with musculoskeletal disorders. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. A narrative synthesis was carried out with a tabular method specifying the study characteristics following the SWiM (Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis) guideline for synthesis without meta-analysis. The revised Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB-2) tool was used to analyse the risk of bias of the included studies. RESULTS: Seven studies with a total of 967 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Due to heterogeneity in different workplace exercise interventions, outcome measures and statistical analyses, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis and a narrative synthesis was performed. The interventions were classified into three categories: multiple body regions, neck and shoulder, and lower back. The seven studies concluded that workplace exercise interventions were effective in reducing musculoskeletal disorders and pain compared with other types of interventions or with control groups with no interventions. The RoB-2 tool found a high risk of bias in six of the seven studies. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the RCTs on workplace exercise interventions suggest that interventions were effective in treating musculoskeletal disorders among office workers. However, due to the high risk of bias of the included studies, no firm conclusions could be drawn and more high-quality studies are needed.

Subsequently, the impact of such distress and job performance on the employees' life satisfaction is analyzed during the lockdown period. Methodology: Data was collected from 433 working professionals of private and public organizations in the Delhi and NCR region of India during India's third and fourth phase of lockdown via a survey, which was distributed online. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was applied first to establish the validity of this study's model (measurement model validity) and subsequently test the hypothesized relationships in the model (structural model). Results: The COVID-19 induced stressors, i.e., role overload, lifestyle choices, and occupational discomfort, were significant predictors of distress during the lockdown. It has been found that role overload and change in lifestyle choice did not significantly affect job performance. Family distraction, occupational discomfort, and distress were significant in impacting job performance, with distress being the most significant one.

Simultaneous intracolonic and intraabdominal CO(2) insufflation may result in significant physiologic changes, but in-depth physiologic effects have not been studied to date. This study aimed to evaluate the physiologic changes and the overall safety of simultaneous CO(2) laparoscopy and colonoscopy. METHODS A prospective pilot study was performed with 26 subjects (17 men and 9 women) undergoing laparoscopic surgical treatment for colorectal conditions adjunctively managed with CO(2) intraoperative colonoscopy. Surgery proceeded with CO(2) insufflation to a maximum pressure of 12 mmHg by laparoscopy and with a maximum CO(2) flow of 5 l/min via colonoscopy. Serial intra- and postoperative arterial blood gases, end-tidal CO(2), and minute ventilation were recorded during predetermined periods: during initial laparoscopy, during simultaneous colonoscopy and laparoscopy, during laparoscopy after colonoscopy, and after desufflation. RESULTS No significant morbidity resulted from simultaneous CO(2) insufflation. Three patients had a CO(2) partial pressure (PaCO(2)) greater than 50, and one patient with a body mass index (BMI) higher than 42 kg/m(2) had a PaCO(2) greater than 50 for more than 30 min and was compensated by increasing minute ventilation. The mean pH was 7.36 in the recovery room. Postoperatively, no patient had a pH lower than 7.3, prolonged intubation, or reintubation. CONCLUSION Simultaneous CO(2) colonoscopy and laparoscopy lead only to transient alterations in respiratory parameters that can be compensated.

This study demonstrated for the first time that the mammalian reovirus strains Masked Palm Civet/China/2004 (MPC/04) and Bat/China/2003 (B/03) can induce transient activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway early in infection in vitro. When UV-treated, both viruses activated PI3K/Akt signaling, indicating that the virus/receptor interaction was sufficient to activate PI3K/Akt. Reovirus virions can use both clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, but only chlorpromazine, a specific inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, or siRNA targeting clathrin suppressed Akt phosphorylation. We also identified the upstream molecules of the PI3K pathway. Virus infection induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) but not Gab1, and blockage of FAK phosphorylation suppressed Akt phosphorylation. Blockage of PI3K/Akt activation increased virus RNA synthesis and viral yield. We also found that reovirus infection activated the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) in an interferon-independent manner and up-regulated IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) via the PI3K/Akt/EMSY pathway. Suppression of PI3K/Akt activation impaired the induction of ISRE and down-regulated the expression of ISGs. Overexpression of ISG15 and Viperin inhibited virus replication, and knockdown of either enhanced virus replication.

Incomplete observation of infections and imperfect diagnosis reduce the observed sizes of transmission chains relative to their true sizes.

However, each study assumed that, if observed, each infection was correctly diagnosed. Here, I leveraged principles from branching process theory to examine how misdiagnosis could contribute to bias in estimates of transmission and burden for emerging infectious diseases. Using the zoonotic Plasmodium knowlesi malaria as a case study, I found that, even when assuming complete observation of infections, the number of misdiagnosed cases within a transmission chain for every correctly diagnosed case could range from 0 (0 - 4) when R0 was 0.1 to 86 (0 - 837) when R0 was 0.9. Data on transmission chain sizes obtained using an imperfect diagnostic could consistently lead to underestimates of R0, the basic reproduction number, and simulations revealed that such data on up to 1,000 observed transmission chains was not powered to detect changes in transmission.

In this article, we introduced a lightweight and field-portable biosensor employing a plasmonic chip based on nanohole arrays integrated to a lensfree-imaging framework for label-free detection of viruses in field-settings. The platform utilizes a CMOS (complementary metalCoxideCsemiconductor) camera with high quantum efficiency in the spectral window of interest to monitor diffraction field patterns of nanohole arrays under the uniform illumination of an LED (light-emitting diode) source which is spectrally tuned to the plasmonic mode supported by the nanohole arrays. As an example for the applicability of our biosensor for virus detection, we could successfully demonstrate the label-free detection of H1N1 viruses, e.g., swine flu, with medically relevant concentrations. We also developed a low-cost and easy-to-use sample preparation kit to prepare the surface of the plasmonic chip for analyte binding, e.g., virus-antibody binding. In order to reveal a complete biosensor technology, we also developed a user friendly Python? C based graphical user interface (GUI) that allows direct access to biosensor hardware, taking and processing diffraction field images, and provides virus information to the end-user. Employing highly sensitive nanohole arrays and lensfree-imaging framework, our platform could yield an LOD as low as 10(3) TCID(50)/mL. Providing accurate and rapid sensing information in a handheld platform, weighing only 70 g and 12 cm tall, without the need for bulky and expensive instrumentation, our biosensor could be a very strong candidate for diagnostic applications in resource-poor settings. As our detection scheme is based on the use of antibodies, it could quickly adapt to the detection of different viral diseases, e.g., COVID-19 or influenza, by simply coating the plasmonic chip surface with an antibody possessing affinity to the virus type of interest. Possessing this ability, our biosensor could be swiftly deployed to the field in need for rapid diagnosis, which may be an important asset to prevent the spread of diseases before turning into a pandemic by isolating patients from the population.","output":"Handheld plasmonic biosensor for virus detection in field-settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Available COVID-19 mortality indices are limited to acute inpatient data. Using nationwide medical administrative data available prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection from the US Veterans Health Administration (VA), we developed the VA COVID-19 (VACO) 30-day mortality index and validated the index in two independent, prospective samples. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We reviewed SARS-CoV-2 testing results within the VA between February 8 and August 18, 2020. The sample was split into a development cohort (test positive between March 2 and April 15, 2020), an early validation cohort (test positive between April 16 and May 18, 2020), and a late validation cohort (test positive between May 19 and July 19, 2020). Our logistic regression model in the development cohort considered demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), and pre-existing medical conditions and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) derived from ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Weights were fixed to create the VACO Index that was then validated by comparing area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) in the early and late validation cohorts and among important validation cohort subgroups defined by sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region. We also evaluated calibration curves and the range of predictions generated within age categories. 13,323 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median age: 63 years; 91% male; 42% non-Hispanic Black). We observed 480/3,681 (13%) deaths in development, 253/2,151 (12%) deaths in the early validation cohort, and 403/7,491 (5%) deaths in the late validation cohort. Age, multimorbidity described with CCI, and a history of myocardial infarction or peripheral vascular disease were independently associated with mortalityCno other individual comorbid diagnosis provided additional information. The VACO Index discriminated mortality in development (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.77C0.81), and in early (AUC = 0.81 95% CI: 0.78C0.83) and late (AUC = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78C0.86) validation. The VACO Index allows personalized estimates of 30-day mortality after COVID-19 infection. For example, among those aged 60C64 years, overall mortality was estimated at 9% (95% CI: 6C11%). The Index further discriminated risk in this age stratum from 4% (95% CI: 3C7%) to 21% (95% CI: 12C31%), depending on sex and comorbid disease. CONCLUSION: Prior to infection, demographics and comorbid conditions can discriminate COVID-19 mortality risk overall and within age strata. The VACO Index reproducibly identified individuals at substantial risk of COVID-19 mortality who might consider continuing social distancing, despite relaxed state and local guidelines.","output":"Development and validation of a 30-day mortality index based on pre-existing medical administrative data from 13,323 COVID-19 patients: The Veterans Health Administration COVID-19 (VACO) Index"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to reveal the differences between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections and non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infections in pediatric patients.

Ideally, these virus stocks should be genetically and functionally similar to the original clinical isolate, retaining wild-type properties to be reliably used in animal model studies. It is well-established that SARS-CoV-2 isolates serially passaged on Vero cell lines accumulate mutations and deletions in the furin cleavage site; however, these can be eliminated when passaged on Calu-3 lung epithelial cell lines, as presented in this study. As numerous stocks of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are being grown in cell cultures with the intent for use in animal models, it is essential that propagation methods generate virus stocks that are pathogenic in vivo. Here, we found that the propagation of a B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 stock on Calu-3 cells eliminated viruses that previously accumulated mutations in the furin cleavage site. Notably, there were alternative variants that accumulated at the same nucleotide positions in virus populations grown on Calu-3 cells at multiple independent facilities. When a Calu-3-derived B.1.351 virus stock was used to infect hamsters, the virus remained pathogenic and the Calu-3-specific variants persisted in the population. These results suggest that Calu-3-derived virus stocks are pathogenic but care should still be taken to evaluate virus stocks for newly arising mutations during propagation.","output":"Propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 Cells to Eliminate Mutations in the Furin Cleavage Site of Spike"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Existing methods to infer the relative roles of age groups in epidemic transmission can normally only accommodate a few age classes, and/or require data that are highly specific for the disease being studied. Here, symbolic transfer entropy (STE), a measure developed to identify asymmetric transfer of information between stochastic processes, is presented as a way to reveal asymmetric transmission patterns between age groups in an epidemic. STE provides a ranking of which age groups may dominate transmission, rather than a reconstruction of the explicit between-age-group transmission matrix. Using simulations, we establish that STE can identify which age groups dominate transmission even when there are differences in reporting rates between age groups and even if the data are noisy. Then, the pairwise STE is calculated between time series of influenza-like illness for 12 age groups in 884 US cities during the autumn of 2009. Elevated STE from 5 to 19 year-olds indicates that school-aged children were likely the most important transmitters of infection during the autumn wave of the 2009 pandemic in the USA.

Developing rapid and sensitive diagnostic tools is key for successful patient management and curbing disease spread. Currently available diagnostics are very specific and sensitive but time-consuming and require expensive laboratory settings and well-trained personnel; thus, they are not available in resource-limited areas, for the purposes of large-scale screenings and in case of outbreaks and epidemics. Developing new, rapid, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic assays is urgently needed. This review focuses on CRISPR-based technologies and their perspectives to become platforms for point-of-care nucleic acid detection methods and as deployable diagnostic platforms that could help to identify and curb outbreaks and emerging epidemics. We describe the mechanisms and function of different classes and types of CRISPR-Cas systems, including pros and cons for developing molecular diagnostic tests and applications of each type to detect a wide range of infectious agents. Many Cas proteins (Cas3, Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, Cas14 etc.) have been leveraged to create highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic tools combined with technologies of signal amplification and fluorescent, potentiometric, colorimetric, lateral flow assay detection and other. In particular, the most advanced platforms -- SHERLOCK/v2, DETECTR, CARMEN or CRISPR-Chip -- enable detection of attomolar amounts of pathogenic nucleic acids with specificity comparable to that of PCR but with minimal technical settings. Further developing CRISPR-based diagnostic tools promises to dramatically transform molecular diagnostics, making them easily affordable and accessible virtually anywhere in the world. The burden of socially significant diseases, frequent outbreaks, recent epidemics (MERS, SARS and the ongoing COVID-19) and outbreaks of zoonotic viruses (African Swine Fever Virus etc.) urgently need the developing and distribution of express-diagnostic tools.

However, there is still disagreement as to the likelihood and frequency of such vertical transmission. OBJECTIVE: Summarize and analyze the published evidence on forms of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission (either intrauterine or intrapartum). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We carried out a review of literature published in English and Spanish from January 1, 2020 through October 30, 2020. Search engines included PubMed/MEDLINE, SciELO, LILACS, Cochrane, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and medRxiv. There were no restrictions concerning type of study. The review included 48 original research articles, 11 review articles, a meta-analysis, 2 pre-published articles, 15 systematic reviews, and 10 editorials or comments. DEVELOPMENT: Medical thinking on congenital or intrapartum maternal-fetal/neonatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has evolved from preliminary evidence that was divided as to whether these forms of vertical transmission were even possible to current evidence support ing both forms of transmission and hypothesizing as to the mechanisms that guide them. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in maternal, placental, fetal or neonatal tissues has been demonstrated by RT-PCR, specific immunoglobulin detection tests, immunostaining and in-situ hybridization. It is estimated that infections acquired either congenitally or intrapartum occur in 1.8%-8.0% of newborns born to women who test positive for COVID-19 at the end of their pregnancies. This review found 53 neonates who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first 48 hours of life by either RT-PCR or specific IgM tests. According to criteria outlined in this review, the timing of infection corresponded to congenital or intrapartum transmission in 39.6% (21/53) of COVID-19-positive newborns, to postpartum transmission in 15.1% (8/53) and remains unspecified in 45.3% (24/53). CONCLUSIONS: Congenital and intrapartum SARS-CoV-2 infection in the fetus/newborn is possible, but rare.

This paper presents a population health surveillance theory framed upon an explicit conceptual system relative to health surveillance performed in human and animal populations. METHODS: The population health surveillance theory reflects the authors' system of thinking and was based on a creative process. RESULTS: Population health surveillance includes two broad components: one relating to the human organization (which includes expertise and the administrative program), and one relating to the system per se (which includes elements of design and method) and which can be viewed as a process. The population health surveillance process is made of five sequential interrelated steps: 1) a trigger or need, 2) problem formulation, 3) surveillance planning, 4) surveillance implementation, and 5) information communication and audit.

Results The return-visit of 98.6% patients was delayed significantly with an increase over 8.98  4.76 weeks (P < 0.001). In general, 32.3% patients suffered from various OEs while waiting for their first return-visit and bracket/band debonding was the most frequently reported category.

The hamster model of visceral leishmaniasis is of particular interest because it recapitulates clinical and immunopathological features of human disease, including cachexia, massive splenomegaly, pancytopenia, immunosuppression, and ultimately death. In the microarray a differentially expressed transcript was identified as having at least a 2-fold change in expression between uninfected and infected groups and a False Discovery Rate of <5%. Following a relatively silent early phase of infection (at 7 and 14 days post-infection only 8 and 24 genes, respectively, were differentially expressed), there was dramatic upregulation of inflammatory and immune-related genes in the spleen (708 differentially expressed genes were evident at 28 days post-infection). The differentially expressed transcripts included genes involved in inflammation, immunity, and immune cell trafficking. Of particular interest there was concomitant upregulation of the IFN- and interleukin (IL)-4 signaling pathways, with increased expression of a battery of IFN-- and IL-4-responsive genes. The latter included genes characteristic of alternatively activated macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptional profiling was accomplished in the Syrian golden hamster, for which a fully annotated genome is not available. In the hamster model of visceral leishmaniasis, a robust and functional IFN- response did not restrain parasite load and progression of disease. This supports the accumulating evidence that macrophages are ineffectively activated to kill the parasite. The concomitant expression of IL-4/IL-13 and their downstream target genes, some of which were characteristic of alternative macrophage activation, are likely to contribute to this. Further dissection of mechanisms that lead to polarization of macrophages toward a permissive state is needed to fully understand the pathogenesis of visceral leishmaniasis.

The study investigated whether there were differences between the areas regarding the levels of difficulty and anxiety felt by the general public during the first wave of COVID-19 in April and May 2020. We conducted an online questionnaire in Fukuoka and Kumamoto Prefecture in southern Japan via a private research company and collected a total of 913 valid responses from individuals whose conditions of employment were affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Although urban areas experienced higher case rates compared to rural areas, ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed no significant differences between urban and rural respondents concerning the level of difficulty in routine life. The daily-life contents which made them feel difficult during the first wave also did not differ largely between the contrasting areas. Urban respondents appeared to have experienced a higher level of difficulty in finding an alternative job, but how respondents found one, if successful, did not differ between urban and rural areas. The area of residence played a role in explaining the level of anxiety toward being infected, especially when the anxiety-related questions involved relationships with neighbors. Rural respondents showed a significantly higher level of anxiety toward causing neighbors trouble and being criticized if infected. Respondents who were better embedded in their communities generally felt more anxious about being infected, regardless of whether they lived in urban or rural areas.

It is important to assess the safety and efficacy of LAMA add-on as an alternative to the prolonged use of higher doses of ICS, which are known to cause undesirable side effects in some people. OBJECTIVES To compare the effects of adding a LAMA to any dose of ICS versus increasing the dose of ICS, for uncontrolled asthma in adults. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR) from its inception in 1995 to April 2015, imposing no restriction on language of publication. We also handsearched trial registries, reference lists of primary studies and existing reviews, as well as manufacturers' websites. SELECTION CRITERIA We looked for parallel or cross-over randomised controlled trials lasting at least 12 weeks, in which adults whose asthma was not well controlled on ICS alone were randomised to treatment with LAMA add-on to ICS or with an increased dose of ICS. Trials were excluded if patients were taking long-acting beta2-agonists during the study period. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened the searches and extracted data from studies meeting all the inclusion criteria. We used Covidence to manage duplicate screening, data extraction and risk of bias judgements, and to form a consensus where discrepancies arose. We used standard methods expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.The pre-specified primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids (OCS), effects on quality of life and serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS One cross-over randomised controlled trial met the inclusion criteria. The trial was performed in 210 patients with moderate to severe asthma and compared the use of the LAMA tiotropium bromide with double dose beclomethasone (an ICS) using a cross-over design and 14-week treatment periods.Compared with people taking a double dose of ICS, fewer people taking a LAMA add-on had an exacerbation requiring treatment with OCS (odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.43) or an exacerbation resulting in emergency department admission (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.77), but the confidence intervals for both outcomes did not exclude the possibility that double dose ICS was more effective. Serious adverse events and exacerbations requiring hospitalisation occurred in similarly low numbers of people taking each treatment, but confidence intervals were too wide to suggest that the two treatment options were equivalent.Asthma-related quality of life was similar in both treatment groups (mean difference (MD) in change from baseline 0.10, 95% CI - 0.07 to 0.27). Those taking LAMA add-on scored slightly better on a scale measuring asthma control than those increasing their ICS dose (MD in change from baseline - 0.18, 95% CI - 0.34 to - 0.02), although the difference was clinically small. Evidence was deemed low quality for both quality of life and asthma control.There was moderate-quality evidence that participants' trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 100 mL better when taking LAMA add-on than with increased ICS dose (MD in change from baseline 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Only one randomised trial was found, comparing tiotropium add-on to increased dose beclomethasone. Differences between the treatments were too small or imprecise to understand whether adding a LAMA to ICS is safer or more effective than increasing the dose of ICS, and there is a possibility of carry-over effects due to the study's cross-over design. LAMA add-on may lead to more improvement in lung function (FEV1) than an increased dose of ICS.The results of this review, alongside pending results from related reviews assessing the use of LAMA against other treatments, will help to define the role of these drugs in asthma management, and this review should be updated as results from future trials emerge. Studies assessing the role of LAMA add-on should be longer and include a double-ICS treatment arm so that the results can be interpreted in the context of the guideline-recommended treatment options that are available to physicians.","output":"Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) added to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) versus higher dose ICS for adults with asthma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To investigate telemedicine adoption, emergency room avoidance, and related characteristics of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with and without exacerbations since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

In the case of monitoring rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a robust method of capturing reliable Disease Activity Score (DAS-28) information remotely could reduce patient visits to hospitals and free up clinic space. Information would ideally be captured from a home setting by a patient. However, self-reporting of DAS-28 has limited reliability especially at moderate or high levels of disease activity. A mechanism for remotely ascertaining DAS-28 which is both accurate and precise would improve remote management for people living with RA. Methods We undertook a study to assess patient attitudes regarding a novel remote RA monitoring platform, which uses images and video captured movements to estimate DAS-28. The study involved a semi-structured 30-minutes video interview. Participants were adults with RA living in the UK. The interviews focused on these key areas: i) an overview of their history with the condition, ii) familiarity with DAS-28, iii) relationship with the clinical team, iv) relationship with technology and telemedicine, v) feedback on the RA monitoring platform. Results Eleven subjects participated in the study. They reported a median disease duration of 11 years (range: 4 to 35), and all had experienced flares, with 10/11 familiar with the DAS-28 prior to the study interview. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, most patients only had contact with clinicians or healthcare facilities over the phone, with only one patient having visited a hospital for a reason not directly related to RA, and one patient having no contact at all. Overall, patients expressed enthusiasm towards the RA monitoring platform and were confident that they would be able to use it at home. Access over the Internet was not perceived as a barrier, and the advantages of tracking disease progression regularly, sharing data with the consultant and saving time travelling to appointments far outweighed the disadvantages. Participants generally reported that they would most benefit from a blended interaction with the clinical team, combining face-to-face appointments with use of the platform at home rather than seeing the platform as a complete alternative to face-to-face assessment. Conclusion This study provides the first insight into the perception and acceptance of the RA monitoring platform in a small sample of RA patients. Results are positive, and support further evaluation of the platform. Evidence to understand how technology can improve the quality of telemedicine for people with RA is urgently needed as the pandemic continues. Disclosure F. Donadoni: None. L. Gionfrida: None. B.

To identify possible indirect actions of androgens via the AR in neurons to regulate muscle, we generated neuron-ARKO mice in which the dominant DNA binding-dependent actions of the AR are deleted in neurons of the cortex, forebrain, hypothalamus, and olfactory bulb. Serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels were elevated twofold in neuron-ARKO males compared with wild-type littermates due to disruption of negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Despite this increase in serum testosterone levels, which was expected to increase muscle mass, the mass of the mixed-fiber gastrocnemius (Gast) and the fast-twitch fiber extensor digitorum longus hind-limb muscles was decreased by 10% in neuron-ARKOs at 12 weeks of age, whereas muscle strength and fatigue of the Gast were unaffected. The mass of the soleus muscle, however, which consists of a high proportion of slow-twitch fibers, was unaffected in neuron-ARKOs, demonstrating a stimulatory action of androgens via the AR in neurons to increase the mass of fast-twitch hind-limb muscles. Furthermore, neuron-ARKOs displayed reductions in voluntary and involuntary physical activity by up to 60%. These data provide evidence for a role of androgens via the AR in neurons to positively regulate fast-twitch hind-limb muscle mass and physical activity in male mice.","output":"Androgen Action via the Androgen Receptor in Neurons Within the Brain Positively Regulates Muscle Mass in Male Mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evolving COVID-19 pandemic is placing unprecedented pressures on health systems.

We carried out a retrospective study of cases registered in the national arbovirus surveillance system between 2007 and 2017. The indicator for assessing quality was incompleteness. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between dengue during pregnancy and sociodemographic, epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory variables. The incompleteness of the data in the notification form for dengue cases in women of childbearing age and pregnant women indicates a significant loss of information. Dengue was shown to be positively associated with Social Determinants of Health in both groups, with more severe effects among pregnant women.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: The emergency expansion of an ICU from eight general beds to 30 coronavirus disease 2019 beds. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to the ICU of Luigi Sacco Hospital (Milan, Italy) for greater than or equal to 48 hours between February 21, 2020, and April 30, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The frequency of bloodstream infections per 1,000 days of ICU stay was calculated in 89 coronavirus disease 2019 patients, and the cumulative probability of bloodstream infection was estimated using death and ICU discharge as competing events. Sixty patients (67.4%) experienced at least one of the 93 recorded episodes of bloodstream infection, a frequency of 87 per 1,000 days of ICU stay (95% CI, 67-112).The patients who experienced a bloodstream infection had a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score upon ICU admission (9.5; interquartile range, 8-12 vs 8, interquartile range, 5-10; p = 0.042), a longer median ICU stay (15 d; interquartile range, 11-23 vs 8, interquartile range, 5-12; p < 0.001), and more frequently required invasive mechanical ventilation (98.3% vs 82.8%; p = 0.013) than those who did not. The median time from ICU admission to the first bloodstream infection episode was 10 days. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 74 episodes (79.6%), with Enterococcus species being the most prevalent (53 episodes, 55.8%). Thirty-two isolates (27.3%) showed multidrug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease 2019 seemed to increase the frequency of bloodstream infections (particularly Enterococcus-related bloodstream infection) after ICU admission. This may have been due to enteric involvement in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 and/or limitations in controlling the patient-to-patient transmission of infectious agents in extremely challenging circumstances.","output":"Unexpectedly High Frequency of Enterococcal Bloodstream Infections in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients Admitted to an Italian ICU: An Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Experiencing migration in childhood affects social, educational, and psychological aspects of child development.

However, policies enacted to prevent or prepare for future epidemics remain unclear. This paper reviews policies that are shaping responses to the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Uganda. An integrative systematic review approach using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) was adopted. Databases including organizational websites, bibliographical databases, and newsletters were searched for records on policies addressing response to COVID-19. Quality appraisal was conducted using the von Wrights logic of events framework and the AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation) checklist. A descriptive qualitative narrative approach was used for data analysis. Fifteen papers are included in this review. Ugandas preparedness to COVID-19 was initiated before the first case was identified on 21 March 2020. Most documents included in our final analysis were soft policy (nonstatutory) documents (n=10). MoH implemented four public orders: notification of COVID-19;prohibition of entry into Uganda;control of COVID-19;prevention of COVID-19;requirements and conditions of entry into Uganda. In addition, the office of the president implemented three directives as of 08 May 2020;the initial directive included preparatory instructions to the public and ministries before the first case of COVID-19 was registered. Subsequently, three other presidential directives were established;two of these instituted lockdown measures while one instituted the first phase of releasing some lockdown measures. Soft policies identified in this review included guidelines (n=4);press releases (n=4) and mitigation measures. Three out of the four guidelines were clinical practice guidelines, these include quarantine of individuals in the context of containment of COVID-19, COVID-19 preparedness and response plan-laboratory manual, and national guidelines for management of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Uganda has experience built from response to previous epidemics. Uganda has robust policies in place to respond to COVID-19.

This alarmed and, in some cases, enraged many poorly funded Chinese scientists, who perceived them as formidable competitors. Some depicted foreign gene-hunters as greedy pilferers of the vast Chinese genetic gold mine, comparing it to the plundering of national treasures from China by invaders in the past, and called upon the government and their fellow countrymen to rise up and protect Chinas genetic gold mine.

To investigate the immune characteristics of early SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and possible key prognostic factors for early identification of critical COVID-19, a retrospective study including 121 children with COVID-19 was conducted. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subset counts, T cell-derived cytokine concentrations, inflammatory factor concentrations, and routine blood counts were analyzed statistically at the initial presentation. RESULTS: The T lymphocyte subset and natural killer cell counts decreased with increasing disease severity. Group III (critical cases) had a higher Th/Tc ratio than groups I and II (common and severe cases); group I had a higher B cell count than groups II and III. IL-6, IL-10, IFN-?3, SAA, and procalcitonin levels increased with increasing disease severity. Hemoglobin concentration, and RBC and eosinophil counts decreased with increasing disease severity. Groups II and III had significantly lower lymphocyte counts than group I. T, Th, Tc, IL-6, IL-10, RBC, and hemoglobin had relatively high contribution and area under the curve values. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased T, Th, Tc, RBC, hemoglobin and increased IL-6 and IL-10 in early SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are valuable indices for early diagnosis of severe disease. The significantly reduced Th and Tc cells and significantly increased IL-6, IL-10, ferritin, procalcitonin, and SAA at this stage in children with critical COVID-19 may be closely associated with the systemic cytokine storm caused by immune dysregulation.","output":"Early immune responses and prognostic factors in children with COVID-19: a single-center retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of July 2021, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to more than 200 million infections and more than 4.2 million deaths globally. Complications of severe COVID-19 include acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, and coagulation dysfunction. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify proteins and genetic factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and outcome. We comprehensively reviewed recent findings of host-SARS-CoV-2 interactome analyses. To identify genetic variants associated with COVID-19, we focused on the findings from genome and transcriptome wide association studies (GWAS and TWAS) and bioinformatics analysis. We described established human proteins including ACE2, TMPRSS2, 40S ribosomal subunit, ApoA1, TOM70, HLA-A, and PALS1 interacting with SARS-CoV-2 based on cryoCelectron microscopy results. Furthermore, we described approximately 1,000 human proteins showing evidence of interaction with SARS-CoV-2 and highlighted host cellular processes such as innate immune pathways affected by infection. We summarized the evidence on more than 20 identified candidate genes in COVID-19 severity. Predicted deleterious and disruptive genetic variants with possible effects on COVID-19 infectivity have been also summarized.

Considering each area in turn, we identify contributory factors alongside practical recommendations to mitigate these risks. Acknowledgement of this subject is timely as medical schools develop their curricula to reflect evolving service and patient priorities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: In this paper, we present our argument regarding the efficiency and applicability of existing deep learning models for COVID-19 diagnosis. We provide results from two popular models - COVID-Net and CoroNet evaluated on three publicly available datasets and an additional institutional dataset collected from EMORY Hospital between January and May 2020, containing patients tested for COVID-19 infection using RT-PCR. Results: There is a large false positive rate (FPR) for COVID-Net on both ChexPert (55.3%) and MIMIC-CXR (23.4%) dataset. On the EMORY Dataset, COVID-Net has 61.4% sensitivity, 0.54 F1-score and 0.49 precision value. The FPR of the CoroNet model is significantly lower across all the datasets as compared to COVID-Net - EMORY(9.1%), ChexPert (1.3%), ChestX-ray14 (0.02%), MIMIC-CXR (0.06%). Conclusion: The models reported good to excellent performance on their internal datasets, however we observed from our testing that their performance dramatically worsened on external data. This is likely from several causes including overfitting models due to lack of appropriate control patients and ground truth labels. The fourth institutional dataset was labeled using RT-PCR, which could be positive without radiographic findings and vice versa. Therefore, a fusion model of both clinical and radiographic data may have better performance and generalization.","output":"Was there COVID-19 back in 2012?

In a second experiment, sensitivity of PRRSV to IFN-alpha was confirmed in vivo.

The paper reviews compounds of plant origin that have previously proven effective in counteracting some coronaviruses but also some of their major effects - direct action on virus replicative apparatus (viral entry or replication, action on the viral enzymatic system), collateral action of natural compounds on the immune system and also the contribution of herbal medicine as vaccine adjuvants are tackled.","output":"Herbal medicine, a reliable support in COVID therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of novel coronavirus-related pneumonia COVID-19, that was identified in December 2019, has expanded rapidly, with cases now confirmed in more than 211 countries or areas. This constant transmission of a novel coronavirus and its ability to spread from human to human have prompted scientists to develop new approaches for treatment of COVID-19. A recent study has shown that remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the replication and infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCov) in vitro. In the United States, one case of COVID-19 was successfully treated with compassionate use of remdesivir in January of 2020. In addition, a clinically proven protease inhibitor, camostat mesylate, has been demonstrated to inhibit Calu-3 infection with SARS-CoV-2 and prevent SARS-2-spike protein (S protein)-mediated entry into primary human lung cells. Here, we systemically discuss the pharmacological therapeutics targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), proteinase and S protein for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review should shed light on the fundamental rationale behind inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 enzymes RdRp as new therapeutic approaches for management of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we will discuss the viability and challenges in targeting RdRp and proteinase, and application of natural product quinoline and its analog chloroquine for treatment of coronavirus infection. Finally, determining the structural-functional relationships of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 will provide new insights into inhibition of interactions between S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enable us to develop novel therapeutic approaches for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Pharmacological Therapeutics Targeting RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase, Proteinase and Spike Protein: From Mechanistic Studies to Clinical Trials for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The #COVID19 pandemic crisis requires the collaboration of all healthcare providers Every contribution is welcome to gain time during the phase of \\"system state\\" superposition https://bit ly/3m4SBxY","output":"Primary care and the COVID-19 pandemic: Schr?dinger's cat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 1 million deaths in the first 6 months of the pandemic and huge economic and social upheaval internationally.

There is an unmet need for therapeutic agents that can reduce viral replication, preferably independent of the accumulation of viral mutations. Zinc ions have an apparent activity as modulators of intracellular viral RNA replication and thus, appear attractive in reducing viral RNA load and infectivity. However, the intracellular concentration of zinc is usually too low for achieving an optimal inhibitory effect. Various herbal polyphenols serve as excellent zinc ionophores with known antiviral properties. Here, we combined zinc picolinate with a collection of flavonoids, representing commonly used polyphenols. Copper was added to avoid ionic imbalance during treatment and to improve efficacy. Each component separately, as well as their combinations, did not interfere with the viability of cultured A549, H1299, or Vero cells in vitro as determined by MTT assay. The safe combinations were further evaluated to determine antiviral activity. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to evaluate antiviral activity of the combinations. They revealed a remarkable (50C95%) decrease, in genome replication levels of a diverse group of respiratory RNA viruses, including the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43; a betacoronavirus that causes the common cold), influenza A virus (IAV, strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV).

Moreover, whether the presence of comorbidities is associated with an increased rate of COVID-19 remains unknown. Methods: COVID-19 Community Research Partnership (CCRP) is a prospective cohort designed to collect information about the community's coronavirus exposures, symptoms, and prevalence (NCT04342884). Serological substudy is a prospective case series evaluating development of IgM or IgG in randomly selected 5000 participants from the CCRP cohort. Serological test kits are shipped to the volunteers monthly. Prevalence of comorbidities was estimated using electronic health records.

Our aim is to provide guidance for urologists to help prioritize urologic cancer surgeries. MATERIAL AND METHODS We reviewed published literature on bladder cancer, upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), penile cancer, testis cancer, prostate cancer, renal cancer, and adrenal cancer. RESULTS For muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), delays should be less than roughly 10 weeks and neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered. For non-MIBC, patients should be counseled appropriately based on risk and intravesical therapies can continue. UTUC should also be treated with minimal delays for high risk patients, especially with ureteral tumors. Surgery for T1 renal cancers when indicated can be delayed until adequate resources are available. Patients with T2 renal cancer should be considered for early surgery if there are unfavorable pre-operative characteristics. Higher stage renal tumors should be considered for early surgery. Early multi-disciplinary approach is recommended for metastatic renal cancers. High risk prostate cancer may need preferential treatment and consideration of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. Penile cancer can have worse sexual or oncologic outcome with prolonged surgical delay. Likewise, adrenal cancer is aggressive and needs early surgical treatment. Testicular cancer should be treated in a timely manner with surgery or chemotherapy, as indicated.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risks associated with COVID-19 in pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes compared with not-infected, concomitant pregnant individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study that took place from March to October 2020, involving 43 institutions in 18 countries, 2 unmatched, consecutive, not-infected women were concomitantly enrolled immediately after each infected woman was identified, at any stage of pregnancy or delivery, and at the same level of care to minimize bias. Women and neonates were followed up until hospital discharge. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 in pregnancy determined by laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 and/or radiological pulmonary findings or 2 or more predefined COVID-19 symptoms. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were indices of (maternal and severe neonatal/perinatal) morbidity and mortality; the individual components of these indices were secondary outcomes. Models for these outcomes were adjusted for country, month entering study, maternal age, and history of morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 706 pregnant women with COVID-19 diagnosis and 1424 pregnant women without COVID-19 diagnosis were enrolled, all with broadly similar demographic characteristics (mean [SD] age, 30.2 [6.1] years). Overweight early in pregnancy occurred in 323 women (48.6%) with COVID-19 diagnosis and 554 women (40.2%) without. Women with COVID-19 diagnosis were at higher risk for preeclampsia/eclampsia (relative risk [RR], 1.76; 95% CI, 1.27-2.43), severe infections (RR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.63-7.01), intensive care unit admission (RR, 5.04; 95% CI, 3.13-8.10), maternal mortality (RR, 22.3; 95% CI, 2.88-172), preterm birth (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.30-1.94), medically indicated preterm birth (RR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.56-2.51), severe neonatal morbidity index (RR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.69-4.18), and severe perinatal morbidity and mortality index (RR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.66-2.75). Fever and shortness of breath for any duration was associated with increased risk of severe maternal complications (RR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.92-3.40) and neonatal complications (RR, 4.97; 95% CI, 2.11-11.69). Asymptomatic women with COVID-19 diagnosis remained at higher risk only for maternal morbidity (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00-1.54) and preeclampsia (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.01-2.63). Among women who tested positive (98.1% by real-time polymerase chain reaction), 54 (13%) of their neonates tested positive. Cesarean delivery (RR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.18-3.91) but not breastfeeding (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.66-1.85) was associated with increased risk for neonatal test positivity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multinational cohort study, COVID-19 in pregnancy was associated with consistent and substantial increases in severe maternal morbidity and mortality and neonatal complications when pregnant women with and without COVID-19 diagnosis were compared.

We present this case of a myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary atherosclerosis in an otherwise healthy 48-year-old patient. CASE SUMMARY: A 48-year-old female, presenting with chest pain radiating to her left shoulder with no cardiovascular risk factors other than genetic predisposition, was screened for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and tested positive. Although computed tomography angiography excluded obstructive coronary heart disease, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary arteries of the inferior wall. The patient was treated with dual anti-platelet therapy, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and a statin, and assigned to a cardiac rehabilitation program. CONCLUSION: We report a serious thrombo-embolic event during an oligosymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthy, young patient. While these two diseases may have occurred simultaneously, by chance, it is possible that the pro-thrombotic effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection facilitated the infarction.

The molecules SN00293542 and SN00382835 revealed the highest docking score of ?14.57 and ?12.42 kcal/mol, respectively, when compared with the co-crystal ligands of PDB-6Y2F (O6K) and 6W63 (X77) of the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). To further validate the interactions of top scored molecules SN00293542 and SN00382835, molecular dynamics study of 100 ns was carried out. This indicated that the protein-ligand complex was stable throughout the simulation period, and minimal backbone fluctuations have ensued in the system. Post-MM-GBSA analysis of molecular dynamics data showed free binding energy-71.7004 +/? 7.98, ?56.81+/? 7.54 kcal/mol, respectively. The computational study identified several ligands that may act as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). The top-ranked molecules SN00293542, and SN00382835 occupied the active site of the target, the main protease like that of the co-crystal ligand. These molecules may emerge as a promising ligands against SARS-CoV-2 and thus needs further detailed investigations. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The aim of this study was to compare acute-phase (24-h) and medium-term (3 months) inflammation after quadrant scaling (Q-SRP) versus FM-SRP. MATERIAL & METHODS Thirty-eight periodontitis-affected subjects were randomly allocated to FM-SRP or Q-SRP after a baseline visit. Periodontal and anthropometric parameters were collected at baseline and 3 months. Serum samples were drawn at baseline, 1, 7, and 90 days after treatment. High-sensitivity assays of inflammation and endothelial assays were performed. RESULTS FM-SRP produced a greater acute-phase response after 24 h [threefold increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), twofold increase in interleukin (IL-6), and a slight increase in tumour necrosis factor]. No differences in systemic biomarkers were noted between groups at any later follow-ups. Both periodontal treatments produced a comparable improvement in clinical periodontal parameters with no between-group differences. Treatment time was positively associated with the relative 24-h increase in CRP (R = 0.5, p < 0.001) and IL-6 (R = 0.5, p = 0.002), while the number of deeper (>6 mm) pockets predicted only the relative increase in IL-6 (R = 0.4, p < 0.05).

We report here the preclinical development of yeast-produced receptor-binding domain (RBD)-based recombinant protein SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We found that monomeric RBD of SARS-CoV-2 could be efficiently produced as a secreted protein from transformed Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) yeast. Yeast-derived RBD-monomer possessed functional conformation and was able to elicit protective level of neutralizing antibodies in mice. We further designed and expressed a genetically linked dimeric RBD protein in yeast. The engineered dimeric RBD was more potent than the monomeric RBD in inducing long-lasting neutralizing antibodies. Mice immunized with either monomeric RBD or dimeric RBD were effectively protected from live SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge even at 18 weeks after the last vaccine dose. Importantly, we found that the antisera raised against the RBD of a single SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain could effectively neutralize the two predominant circulating variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, implying broad-spectrum protective potential of the RBD-based vaccines. Our data demonstrate that yeast-derived RBD-based recombinant SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are feasible and efficacious, opening up a new avenue for rapid and cost-effective production of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to achieve global immunization.","output":"Yeast-produced RBD-based recombinant protein vaccines elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies and durable protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The next move was to work independently for 5 years undertaking evaluation projects, mainly for social services, before joining the early childhood initial teacher education team at the College of Education The policy expectations around early childhood education are higher because of the first Early Childhood Education (ECE) Strategic Plan (Ministry of Education, 2002) presented nearly 20 years earlier by a previous Labour-led coalition government that set out quite explicit goals across a 10-year time frame Despite these expectations, the government did not set dates for achieving each identified goal and instead used the terms short, medium and long term within the Draft Early Learning Strategy The COVID-19 crisis created the opportunity to do away with the Budget Responsibility Rules that the government had set for itself, by referring to the Rainy Day opt-out clause in order to weather the global storm (Robertson, 2020, p 3)","output":"Kia ora from Aotearoa New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Human behavioral traits are known to be significantly heritable.

METHODS: A rapid online survey comprising 22 items was administered during the rapid outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan. Questions were focused on the prevention, transmission, clinical features, and control of COVID-19. In addition, the attitudes and practices of the participants were explored. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and regression analysis were carried out during data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1257 respondents participated in this study. Most of the respondents had good knowledge (good = 64.8%, average = 30.5%, poor = 4.7%) of COVID-19. Gender, marital status, education, and residence were observed to have a significant association with the knowledge score. A vast majority of the survey respondents (77.0%) believed that COVID-19 would be controlled successfully in Pakistan. The practices of wearing a mask (85.8%) and handwashing (88.1%) were common among the participants.

Medicines optimisation is a person-centred approach to safe and effective medicines use, to ensure people obtain the best possible outcomes from their medicines. The purpose of this exercise was to co-produce a prioritised research agenda for medicines optimisation using a multi-stakeholder (patient, researcher, public and health professionals) approach. METHODS: A three-stage, multiple method process was used including: generation of preliminary research questions (Stage 1) using a modified Nominal Group Technique; electronic consultation and ranking with a wider multi-stakeholder group (Stage 2); a face-to-face, one-day consensus meeting involving representatives from all stakeholder groups (Stage 3). RESULTS: In total, 92 research questions were identified during Stages 1 and 2 and ranked in order of priority during stage 3. Questions were categorised into four areas: Patient Concerns [e.g. is there a shared decision (with patients) about using each medicine?], Polypharmacy [e.g. how to design health services to cope with the challenge of multiple medicines use?], Non-Medical Prescribing [e.g. how can the contribution of non-medical prescribers be optimised in primary care?], and Deprescribing [e.g. what support is needed by prescribers to deprescribe?]. A significant number of the 92 questions were generated by Patient and Public Involvement representatives, which demonstrates the importance of including this stakeholder group when identifying research priorities. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of research questions was generated reflecting concerns which affect patients, practitioners, the health service, as well the ethical and philosophical aspects of the prescribing and deprescribing of medicines.

LASSO GLMM reduces overfitting and selects predictor variables in modelling. The aim of this study is to evaluate the model's performance for predicting COVID-19 patients with certain congenital diseases that require ICU based on the results of blood tests laboratory and patients vital signs. This study used binary response variables 1 if the patient was admitted to the ICU and 0 if the patient was not admitted to the ICU. The fixed effect predictor variables are the results of blood tests laboratory and patients vital signs. The random effect predictor variable is patients' congenital disease. The result showed that the average of accuracy and AUC from LASSO GLMM is more than the average of accuracy and AUC from LASSO GLM by using 5% level of significance. Respiratory rate and Lactate show a significance effect to predict the ICU needs of COVID-19 patients. The random effects of patients' congenital disease have a significance effect at 5% level of significance. It means that the ICU needs for COVID-19 patients varies among patients with congenital disease. We can conclude that GLMM LASSO with the random effect of a patient's congenital diseases has better modelling performance to predict the ICU needs of COVID-19 patients based on the results of blood tests laboratory and patients vital signs.

Since September 2017, mainland China has begun to vaccinate poultry with H5 + H7 avian influenza vaccine. We investigated the avian influenza virus infections in different types of live poultry markets and samples before and after genotype H5 + H7 vaccination in Nanchang, and analyzed the changes of the HA subtypes of AIVs. METHODS: From 2016 to 2019, we monitored different live poultry markets and collected specimens, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology to detect the nucleic acid of type A avian influenza virus in the samples. The H5, H7 and H9 subtypes of influenza viruses were further classified for the positive results. The (2) test was used to compare the differences in the separation rates of different avian influenza subtypes. RESULTS: We analyzed 5,196 samples collected before and after vaccination and found that the infection rate of AIV in wholesale market (21.73%) was lower than that in retail market (24.74%) (P < 0.05). Among all the samples, the positive rate of sewage samples (33.90%) was the highest (P < 0.001). After vaccination, the positive rate of H5 and H7 subtypes decreased, and the positive rate of H9 subtype and untypable HA type increased significantly (P < 0.001). The positive rates of H9 subtype in different types of LPMs and different types of samples increased significantly (P < 0.01), and the positive rates of untypable HA type increased significantly in all environmental samples (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Since vaccination, the positive rates of H5 and H7 subtypes have decreased, but the positive rates of H9 subtypes have increased to varying degrees in different testing locations and all samples.

The long-term effect of mobility showed to have a consistent lag correlation with the weekly number of new COVID-19 positive cases. In our statistical analysis, we also investigated key non-transportation variables. For instance, the mandatory use of masks in public transit resulted in observing a 10% decrease in the number of infected people. In addition, the results confirmed that super-spreading events had significant increases in the number of positive cases. We have also assessed the impact of major events and holidays throughout the study period and analyzed the impacts of mobility patterns in those situations. Our analysis shows that holidays without inter-city travel bans have been associated with a 27% increase in the number of weekly positive cases. As such, while holidays decrease transit usage, it can overall negatively affect spread control if proper control measures are not put in place.

The present study thus assessed the views of experienced surrogates regarding the possible use of PPPs as a means to help make treatment decisions for decisionally-incapacitated patients. This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews to determine the views of experienced surrogates [n = 26] who were identified from two academic medical centers and two community hospitals. The primary outcomes were respondents' overall level of support for the idea of using PPPs and the themes related to their views on how a PPP should be used, if at all, in practice. Overall, 21 participants supported the idea of using PPPs. The remaining five indicated that they would not use a PPP because they made decisions based on the patient's best interests, not based on substituted judgment. Major themes which emerged were that surrogates, not the patient's preferences, should determine how treatment decisions are made, and concern that PPPs might be used to deny expensive care or be biased against minority groups. Surrogates, like patients, strongly support the idea of using PPPs to help make treatment decisions for decisionally-incapacitated patients. These findings provide support for developing a PPP and assessing it in practice. At the same time, patients and surrogates disagree over whose preferences should determine how treatment decisions are made, including whether to use a PPP.

In our neuroscience institution, the challenge was to continue to manage usual neurological emergencies as well as the influx of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We report the experience of an ethical consulting unit to support care clinical decisions during the first wave of the pandemic (March 16 to April 30, 2020). Three objective evaluation criteria were defined: 2 of these criteria, patient's factors and general disease severity (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II), were common to all patients, and the third was the specific severity of the disease (neurological for brain injury, respiratory for COVID-19). Given our scarce resources, we used a high probability of a 3-month modified Rankin Scale 3 as the criterion for further resuscitation and management. RESULTS: A total of 295 patients were admitted during the first pandemic wave; 111 with COVID-19 and 184 with neurological emergencies. The ethical unit's expertise was sought for 75 clinical situations in 56 patients (35 COVID-19 and 21 neurological). Decisions were as follows: 11% no limitation on care, 5% expectant care with reassessment (maximum therapy to assess possible progress pending decision), 67% partial limitation (no intensification of care or no transfer to ICU), and 17% limitation of curative care. At no time did a lack of availability of ICU beds require the ethical unit to advise against admission to the ICU.

The entry of 3PPs into supply chains, not only changes the cash flow, but also decreases consumer price sensitivity and stimulates demand by facilitating credit consumptions. Moreover, information sharing becomes more feasible with the help of 3PPs. To study the impacts of 3PP entry, we build game-theoretic models in a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer and a 3PP, and derive the equilibrium in both the non-information sharing and information sharing cases. We show that the 3PP should make a reasonable commission rate which can lure the retailer to introduce the 3PP as well as maintain the 3PPs profitability. The 3PP entry allows the retailer to set a higher price without decreasing the demand. However, to seize all of the benefit of the 3PP entry, the first mover manufacturer increases the wholesale price to a large extent. As a result, the 3PP entry causes a win-lose situation for the manufacturer and the retailer. The supply chain can be better off from the 3PP entry if it can significantly decrease consumer price sensitivity or its fixed investment cost is low. Furthermore, we find that information sharing benefits the manufacturer and the 3PP but harms the retailer. While information sharing always decreases the expected profit for the supply chain without the 3PP, it may increase that for the supply chain with the 3PP. To improve the supply chain profitability, we suggest to provide incentives for retailer information sharing if the 3PP can significantly decrease consumer price sensitivity (i.e., the proportion of the 3PP users is higher, the grace period of credit consumption is lower, or the cash opportunity cost is lower).","output":"Mobile payment, third-party payment platform entry and information sharing in supply chains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The goal of the Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) meetings is to advance the development of stroke therapies. At STAIR VIII, consensus recommendations were developed for clinical trial strategies to demonstrate the benefit of endovascular reperfusion therapies for acute ischemic stroke. SUMMARY OF REVIEW Prospects for success with forthcoming endovascular trials are robust, because new neurothrombectomy devices have superior reperfusion efficacy compared with earlier-generation interventions. Specific recommendations are provided for trial designs in 3 populations: (1) patients undergoing intravenous fibrinolysis, (2) early patients ineligible for or having failed intravenous fibrinolysis, and (3) wake-up and other late-presenting patients. Among intravenous fibrinolysis-eligible patients, key principles are that CT or MRI confirmation of target arterial occlusions should precede randomization; endovascular intervention should be pursued with the greatest rapidity possible; and combined intravenous and neurothrombectomy therapy is more promising than neurothrombectomy alone. Among patients ineligible for or having failed intravenous fibrinolysis, scientific equipoise was affirmed and the need to randomize all eligible patients emphasized. Vessel imaging to confirm occlusion is mandatory, and infarct core and penumbral imaging is desirable in later time windows. Additional STAIR VIII recommendations include approaches to test multiple devices in a single trial, utility weighting of disability end points, and adaptive designs to delineate time and tissue injury thresholds at which benefits from intervention no longer accrue. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular research priorities in acute ischemic stroke are to perform trials testing new, highly effective neuro thrombectomy devices rapidly deployed in patients confirmed to have target vessel occlusions.","output":"Stroke treatment academic industry roundtable: research priorities in the assessment of neurothrombectomy devices."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the surge of newly diagnosed and severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the death toll is mounting, this study is aimed to explore the prognostic factors of severe COVID-19.

Once thought to be primarily driven by T cells, B cells are emerging as central players in MS immunopathogenesis. Interest in multiple B cell phenotypes in MS expanded following the efficacy of B cell-depleting agents targeting CD20 in relapsing-remitting MS and inflammatory primary progressive MS patients. Interestingly, these therapies primarily target non-antibody secreting cells. Emerging studies seek to explore B cell functions beyond antibody-mediated roles, including cytokine production, antigen presentation, and ectopic follicle-like aggregate formation. Importantly, memory B cells (Bmem) are rising as a key B cell phenotype to investigate in MS due to their antigen-experience, increased lifespan, and rapid response to stimulation. Bmem display diverse effector functions including cytokine production, antigen presentation, and serving as antigen-experienced precursors to antibody-secreting cells. In this review, we explore the cellular and molecular processes involved in Bmem development, Bmem phenotypes, and effector functions. We then examine how these concepts may be applied to the potential role(s) of Bmem in MS pathogenesis. We investigate Bmem both within the periphery and inside the CNS compartment, focusing on Bmem phenotypes and proposed functions in MS and its animal models. Finally, we review how current immunomodulatory therapies, including B cell-directed therapies and other immunomodulatory therapies, modify Bmem and how this knowledge may be harnessed to direct therapeutic strategies in MS.","output":"Memory B Cells in Multiple Sclerosis: Emerging Players in Disease Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence supports the use of remdesivir and tocilizumab for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of remdesivir and tocilizumab for the treatment of severe COVID-19 in a community hospital setting. METHODS: We used a de-identified dataset of hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19 according to the National Institutes of Health definition (SpO2 < 94% on room air, a PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mm Hg, respiratory frequency > 30/min, or lung infiltrates > 50%) admitted to our community hospital located in Evanston Illinois, between March 1, 2020, and March 1, 2021. We performed a Cox proportional hazards regression model to examine the relationship between the use of remdesivir and tocilizumab and inpatient mortality. To minimize confounders, we adjusted for age, qSOFA score, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, and steroids, forcing these variables into the model. We implemented a sensitivity analysis calculating the E-value (with the lower confidence limit) for the obtained point estimates to assess the potential effect of unmeasured confounding. Figure 1. KaplanCMeier survival curves for in-hospital death among patients treated with and without steroids [Image: see text] The hazard ratio was derived from a bivariable Cox regression model. The survival curves were compared with a log-rank test, where a two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Figure 2. KaplanCMeier survival curves for in-hospital death among patients treated with and without remdesivir [Image: see text] The hazard ratio was derived from a bivariable Cox regression model. The survival curves were compared with a log-rank test, where a two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 549 patients were included. The median age was 69 years (interquartile range, 59 C 80 years), 333 (59.6%) were male, 231 were White (41.3%), and 235 (42%) were admitted from long-term care facilities. 394 (70.5%) received steroids, 192 (34.3%) received remdesivir, and 49 (8.8%) received tocilizumab. By the cutoff date for data analysis, 389 (69.6%) patients survived, and 170 (30.4%) had died. The bivariable Cox regression models showed decreased hazard of in-hospital death associated with the administration of steroids (Figure 1), remdesivir (Figure 2), and tocilizumab (Figure 3). This association persisted in the multivariable Cox regression controlling for other predictors (Figure 4). The E value for the multivariable Cox regression point estimates and the lower confidence intervals are shown in Table 1. Figure 3.

Forest plot on effect estimates and confidence intervals for treatments [Image: see text] The hazard ratios were derived from a multivariable Cox regression model adjusting for age as a continuous variable, qSOFA score, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation. Table 1. Sensitivity analysis of unmeasured confounding using E-values [Image: see text] CI, confidence interval. Point estimate from multivariable Cox regression model. The E value is defined as the minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome, conditional on the measured covariates, to explain away a specific exposure-outcome association fully: i.e., a confounder not included in the multivariable Cox regression model associated with remdesivir or tocilizumab use and in-hospital death in patients with severe COVID-19 by a hazard ratio of 1.64-fold or 1.54-fold each, respectively, could explain away the lower confidence limit, but weaker confounding could not. CONCLUSION: For patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to our community hospital, the use of steroids, remdesivir, and tocilizumab were significantly associated with a slower progression to in-hospital death while controlling for other predictors included in the models.

Our aim was to identify influenceable contributors to medication non-adherence and suggest interventions that could increase adherence. Patients with SLE from two Swedish tertiary referral centres (n = 205) participated in a survey assessing self-reported adherence to medications. Responses were used to select patients for qualitative interviews (n = 15). Verbatim interview transcripts were analysed by two researchers using content analysis methodology. The median age of the interviewees was 32 years, 87% were women, and their median SLE duration was nine years. Reasons for non-adherence were complex and multifaceted; we categorised them thematically into (i) patient-related (e.g., unintentional non-adherence due to forgetfulness or intentional non-adherence due to disbelief in medications); (ii) healthcare-related (e.g., untrustworthy relationship with the treating physician, authority fear, and poor information about the prescribed medications or the disease); (iii) medication-related (e.g., fear of side-effects); and (iv) disease-related reasons (e.g., lacking acceptance of a chronic illness or perceived disease quiescence). Interventions identified that healthcare could implement to improve patient adherence to medications included (i) increased communication between healthcare professionals and patients; (ii) patient education; (iii) accessible healthcare, preferably with the same personnel; (iv) well-coordinated transition from paediatric to adult care; (v) regularity in addressing adherence to medications; (vi) psychological support; and (vii) involvement of family members or people who are close to the patient.","output":"How Can We Enhance Adherence to Medications in Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus?

Methods: A retrospective analysis of data obtained from the national health fund (NHF) of Poland on adult patients on HPN. Results: The prevalence of adult patients on HPN in Poland in 2020 was 53.26 per million citizens with a 2.99-fold increase and a growing trend observed from 2010. Significant decrease in the percentage of patients between 18C34, 45C54 and an increase in patients between 65C74 and patients over 75 years old was observed. Trend analysis showed an increase in new patients between 65C74 and a decrease between 35C54. Malnutrition (34.28%), postprocedural disorders of the GI tract (19.61%), intestinal malabsorption/other intestinal diseases (20.41%) and GI obstruction due to cancer (17.36% as primary and 23.16% as secondary diagnosis) were mostly reported as the primary indications for HPN. Cancer patients were mostly gastric, ovarian and colon cancer (34.74%, 17.83% and 12.3%). HPN and total health cost reimbursement increase was 2.6 and 2.57fold respectively. Costs of HPN and total health care costs in 2020 per patient were  10,015 and  16,038, respectively. Overall death risk rate during the first year of nutrition was 0.59 with a significant increase in the observation period p-trend < 0.004. A significant increase in the death rate was observed in patients above 75 years old (estimate 1.629, p-trend < 0.030). Cancer, infection, malnutrition and GI symptoms were the most common indications for hospitalizations of HPN patients. The rate of patients with a maximal length of HPN of 5 months in 2010 was 54.9% and was growing up to 78.1% in 2020. Conclusions: The prevalence of HPN in Poland is growing.

Proposed challenges in FHH collection include lack of patient preparation, lack of FHH standardization, and time requirement (especially during the COVID-19 pandemic with intentional minimization of office time). Prior to implementation of a web-based application for FHH collection, we aimed to review the quality of collected FHH in a gynecologic oncology clinic and to determine if any patient factors affect FHH collection. This was a single institution retrospective study of FHH collection for new patient appointments at a gynecologic oncology outpatient practice between 4/2019-7/2019. FHH was collected verbally during the patient face-to-face interview. FHH was evaluated for the following, previously published, quality measures on a point system: 1) Three generations, 2) Relative gender, 3) Relative lineage (maternal vs paternal), 4) Pertinent negatives (absence of hereditary cancers), 5) Age of relatives' cancer diagnosis, and for deceased relatives, 6) Age of death and 7) Cause of death. Among the 200 evaluable patients, 185 (92.5%) had FHH documented in the medical record. The median age was 52 years (range 23-93). Eighty-nine (44.5%) included three generations, 154 (77%) relatives' gender, 109 (54.5%) relatives' lineage, and 77 (38.5%) pertinent negatives (Figure 1). Among 147 patients reporting a history of cancer in their family, 23 (15.6%) included age of relatives' cancer diagnosis. Among 75 patients listing deceased relatives, 13 (17.3%) included age of death and 48 (64%) cause of death. Age and personal cancer diagnosis were not associated with quality of FHH. Patients with family history of cancer scored higher in quality of FHH than those without family history (median=3.0 [IQR 3.0;4.0] vs. 1.0 [0.0;2.0], P <0.001) and were more likely to have inclusion of three generations (57.1% vs. 9.4%, P <0.001). Forty-three patients (21.5%) had previously undergone genetic testing and these patients had higher FHH scores than those without prior genetic testing (3.0 [3.0;4.0] vs. 3.0 [1.0;4.0], P=0.01) and were more likely to include age of relatives' cancer diagnosis (27.0% vs. 11.0%, P =0.04), age of relatives' death (35.7% vs. 13.1%, P=0.04), and cause of relatives' death (92.3% vs. 58.1%, P=0.02). Overall, patients with higher quality FHH had increased likelihood of being referred to genetic assessment (4.0 [3.0;4.75] vs. 3.0 [1.0;4.0], P=0.002). [Display omitted] Our data are consistent with the literature suggesting that standard collection of family history may not adequately capture all measures of a high quality oncologic FHH. Patients without prior genetic testing and no family history of cancer had the lowest scores for FHH quality and might benefit from a web-based FHH collection tool, allowing them to contact relatives for more information prior to an office visit and permitting better patient preparation and efficiency. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, tools that minimize inoffice time are increasingly important. A prospective evaluation of a web-based FHH collection tool to address these issues is ongoing.

SARS-CoV & MERS-CoV are painstaking, extremely pathogenic. Also, very evidently, both have been communicated from bats to palm-civets & dromedary camels and further transferred ultimately to humans. No country has been deprived of this viral genomic contamination wherever populaces reside and are interconnected. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of this viral genome. The analysis aids the study of the outbreak of this Virus towards the other parts of the continent and the world. The parameters such as population mobility, natural history, epidemiological characteristics, and the transmission mechanism towards viral spread when considered into crowd dynamism result in improved estimation. This article studies the impact of time on the amount of susceptible, exposed, the infected person taking into account asymptomatic and symptomatic ones; recovered i.e., removed from this model and the virus particles existing in the open surfaces. The transition from stable phase to attractor phase happens after 13 days i.e.; it takes nearly a fortnight for the spread to randomize among people. Further, the pandemic transmission remains in the attractor phase for a very long time if no control measures are taken up. The attractor-source phase continues up to 385 days i.e., more than a year, and perhaps stabilizes on 386(th) day as per the Lyapunov exponent's analysis. The time series helps to know the period of the Virus's survival in the open sources i.e. markets, open spaces and various other carriers of the Virus if not quarantined or sanitized.

It has been observed that for exposed and asymptomatically infected (y-z), as exposed ones (y) change from 0 to 100 the value of asymptomatically infected (z) increased upto around 58, at exposed ones (y) =100, asymptomatically infected (z) has two values as 58 and 10 i.e. follows bifurcation and as exposed ones (y) changes values upto 180, the value of asymptomatically infected (z) decreases to 25 so for exposed ones (y) from 100 to 180, asymptomatically infected (z) varies from 58 to 25 to 10 follows bifurcation. Also, phase structures of exposed-symptomatically infected (y-u), exposed-removed (y-v), exposed-virus in the reservoir (y-w), asymptomatically infected-removed (z-v), symptomatically infected-removed (u-v) specifically depict bifurcations in various forms at different points. In case of asymptomatically infected-virus in the reservoir (z-w), at asymptomatically infected (z)= 10, the value of viruses in the reservoir (w) = 50, then as asymptomatically infected (z) increases to upto around 60. At this point, removed ones (v) increase from 50 to 70 and asymptomatically infected (z) decrease to 20 i.e., crosses the same value twice, which shows its limiting is known as limit cycle behavior and both the values tend to decrease towards zero.

Research has shown that mobility limitations are an important risk factor for the emergence and maintenance of feelings of loneliness. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of loneliness among community-dwelling older people with reduced mobility and its underlying dynamics. METHODS: This study employed a qualitative, descriptive design, inspired by a grounded theory approach. Participants were purposively recruited in collaboration with home health care providers. The main inclusion criteria were as follows: aged 75 years or older, being mobile impaired, experiencing feelings of loneliness, and living at home and being cognitively able to be interviewed. Data analysis of 15 semi-structured, in-depth interviews was conducted based on the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven (QUAGOL). RESULTS: Loneliness was expressed through all the stories, but it appeared as an elusive, intangible phenomenon. Both indicating the presence of loneliness and describing what this phenomenon means were difficult to express for most participants. Loneliness was experienced as an inherent part of the ageing process characterised by losses, limitations and meaninglessness. Participants described how they have experienced losing grip on the world in which they live and feel isolated in a literally and figuratively shrinking world. Loneliness is described as the feeling that one is unable to address the situation that results in deep sadness and the feeling of no longer being of value to their environment. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that loneliness among community-dwelling older persons with reduced mobility is embedded in experiences of loss related to ageing, among which reduced mobility plays a significant role. The results suggest the existence of a more profound experience of loneliness than might appear at first glance. How to recognise experiences of loneliness and how to support a meaningful existence for community-dwelling older persons should be given priority in health care. The findings of this study can increase professional caregivers sensitivity to implicit signals of loneliness. Further research is necessary to refine the outcomes and to further explore the role of reduced mobility in the experience of loneliness.

The proposed two-tier approach depends on decentralized self-collection of saliva samples, pooling, 1st-tier testing with the mentioned highly sensitive screening test and subsequent 2nd-tier testing of individual samples from positive pools with the in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test. The screening test was able to detect 5 copies of the viral genome in 10 l of isolated RNA with 50% probability and 18.8 copies with 95% probability and reached Ct values that were highly linearly RNA concentration-dependent. In the side-by-side comparison (testing artificial pooled samples), the screening test attained slightly better results than the commercially available IVD-certified RT-qPCR diagnostic test (100% specificity and 89.8% sensitivity vs. 100% and 73.5%, respectively). Testing of 1475 individual clinical samples pooled in 374 pools of 4 revealed 0.8% false positive pools and no false negative pools.

However, there is no universal consensus or guideline on when and how IQC should be analyzed on point-of-care testing (POCT) devices. The aim of this study was to develop a scoring system to determine how often IQC should be analyzed in primary healthcare on the various POCT devices. METHODS Based on a systematic literature review and a thorough process involving the whole Noklus, a nationwide POC organization, a scoring system for when to analyze IQC was developed. Four factors were considered to significantly impact IQC frequency: The importance of the analyte in diagnosing and monitoring patients, type of POCT device, user-friendliness, and number of patient samples. For each POCT device, the first three factors were given a score, and the sum of the scores determined the general recommended IQC frequency. The number of patient samples determined whether and how to adjust these frequencies in each individual general practice. RESULTS The scoring system was applied to 17 analytes and 134 different POCT devices (153 analyte-device combinations). Most of the devices analyzing high-risk analytes (71 out of 74) obtained daily or weekly IQC frequency. For example, all blood-cell counters and all glucose meters should undergo IQC daily and weekly, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This study presents a consensus-based scoring system for differentiated and device-specific recommendations for IQC frequency on POCT devices in primary healthcare.

We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 viral persistence and assessed factors associated with viral persistence and cycle threshold (CT) values as a surrogate of viral load for IC. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2-positive IC at a large quaternary pediatric hospital from March 2020-2021. Immunocompromised status was defined as primary or secondary/acquired immunodeficiencies due to comorbidities or immunosuppressive treatment. The primary outcome was time to first-of-two consecutively negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests  24 hours apart. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of sequential patient samples was conducted using the Centers for Disease Control 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (CDC assay). Chi-square, Fisher exact, and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare demographic and clinical characteristics. Kaplan-Meier curve median event times and log-rank tests were used to compare outcomes. Subjects without 2 consecutive negative tests censored at the last test. Analyses were conducted using SAS v 9.4. RESULTS: Ninety-one children met inclusion criteria, and 67 children had more than 1 test (Figure 1). Median age was 15.5 years (IQR 8-18 yrs), 64% were male, 58% of children were white, and 43% were Latinx. Most (67%) were tested in outpatient settings, and 58% of children were asymptomatic. The median time to two negative tests was 42 days (IQR 25.0,55.0), with no difference in duration of positivity with specific diagnoses, degree of lymphopenia, or symptomatic vs asymptomatic illness. Five of 7 (71%) children with samples available for repeat testing had initial C(T) values < 30, indicating a moderate to high viral load, and of these, 4 (57%) had repeat testing 21 to 30 days later with C(T) values < 30 (Figure 2), suggesting persistence of moderate to high viral loads.

In this work, we propose a classification framework based on sparse coding in order to identify the pneumonia patterns associated with different pathologies. Specifically, each chest X-ray (CXR) image is partitioned into different tiles. The most relevant features extracted from PCA are then used to build the dictionary within the sparse coding procedure. Once images are transformed and reconstructed from the elements of the dictionary, classification is performed from the reconstruction errors of individual patches associated with each image. Performance is evaluated in a real scenario where simultaneously differentiation between four different pathologies: control vs bacterial pneumonia vs viral pneumonia vs COVID-19. The accuracy when identifying the presence of pneumonia is 93.85%, whereas 88.11% is obtained in the 4-class classification context. The excellent results and the pioneering use of sparse coding in this scenario evidence the applicability of this approach as an aid for clinicians in a real-world environment.","output":"Tiled sparse coding in eigenspaces for the COVID-19 diagnosis in chest X-ray images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has caused global disruptions infection. In the absence of a cure, the disease is still a cause for concern, so numerous research groups are focusing on identifying and developing new therapies to combat it. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current epidemic, does not have specific antiviral drugs. Still, some antiviral drugs that target specific steps in their life cycle may prove effective in their treatment. It is advantageous to develop models based on the physicochemical properties of currently available antivirals. Therefore, this study determined QSPR models using reverse degree-based topological indices after analyzing the molecular structures of certain antiviral drugs. Firstly, we computed several reverse degree-based topological indices for these drugs, followed by a QSPR between the obtained reverse degree-based topological indices and various properties of these drugs. The study indicates that topological indices under investigation are directly associated with the physicochemical properties of the studied antiviral drugs. ? 2022 by the authors.","output":"Computation of Reverse Degrees of Some Antiviral Drugs Targeting COVID 19 with QSPR Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Examine use of office resources by primary care patients who were initially evaluated through telehealth, telephone, or in-person encounters. METHODS: Retrospective electronic health record review on patients seen in March 2020 for evaluation of potential COVID-19 symptoms, to assess the total number of interactions with physicians and office staff. RESULTS: Of 202 patients, 89 (44%) had initial telehealth, 55 (27%) telephone, and 52 (26%) in-person encounters. Patients initially evaluated through telehealth, telephone, and in-person encounters had a mean of 6.1 (S.D. = 3.7), 5.2 (S.D. = 3.6), and 4.5 (S.D. = 3.0) total interactions with the office, respectively (P = .03), and 9%, 12.7%, and 19.2%, respectively, had a subsequent in-person or emergency department visit (P = .22).

In December 2019, the coronavirus spread rapidly around the world, thought to be originated from Wuhan in China and is responsible for a large number of deaths. Earlier detection of the COVID-19 through accurate diagnosis, particularly for the cases with no obvious symptoms, may decrease the patient's death rate. Chest X-ray images are primarily used for the diagnosis of this disease. This research has proposed a machine vision approach to detect COVID-19 from the chest X-ray images. The features extracted by the histogram-oriented gradient (HOG) and convolutional neural network (CNN) from X-ray images were fused to develop the classification model through training by CNN (VGGNet). Modified anisotropic diffusion filtering (MADF) technique was employed for better edge preservation and reduced noise from the images. A watershed segmentation algorithm was used in order to mark the significant fracture region in the input X-ray images. The testing stage considered generalized data for performance evaluation of the model. Cross-validation analysis revealed that a 5-fold strategy could successfully impair the overfitting problem. This proposed feature fusion using the deep learning technique assured a satisfactory performance in terms of identifying COVID-19 compared to the immediate, relevant works with a testing accuracy of 99.49%, specificity of 95.7% and sensitivity of 93.65%. When compared to other classification techniques, such as ANN, KNN, and SVM, the CNN technique used in this study showed better classification performance.

However, manually detecting a huge amount of CT scans adds great pressure and causes additional workloads for physicians and radiologists, especially for those in areas where there is a severe COVID-19 pandemic. Driven by the desire of alleviating a medical worker's burden, here, we propose a hierarchical method in COVID-19 detection via CT scans in order to obtain a much faster detection result and one that is less labor-intensive. In this study, we present an automatic COVID-19 detection method, which consists of a hierarchical model made-up of two stages: a segmentation stage followed by a classification stage. In the segmentation stage, a U-Net is used to segment the lung portion from chest CT slices in order to eliminate the interference of irrelevant tissues such as the heart and bones. In the classification stage, ResNet-18 is applied to classify previously segmented CT slices (from the previous stage) and predict the existence of COVID-19. Experimental results show that our proposed hierarchical detection method obtains satisfying performances in separating COVID-19 CT scans from common pneumonia CT scans at the scan level, indicating that the method has great potential in assisting physicians and radiologists in rapid COVID-19 detection and significantly reducing their workload. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Hierarchical Automatic COVID-19 Detection via CT Scan Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some clusters of children with a multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (MIS-C) have been reported.

This is especially so in resource-limited settings where access to molecular diagnostic techniques such as Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is not optimal. We report chest CT findings in 28 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Ghana. Objective To document common chest CT scan findings amongst patients with COVID-19 infection in Ghana. Method Chest CT scans of twenty-eight COVID-19 patients (n=28) were retrieved and reviewed independently by 2 experienced radiologists and their findings documented. Two 64 and one 32 slice spiral CT scanners were used at three centres. Results Chest CT Images from 16 males(57.1.7%) and 12 females(42.9%) patients aged between 36 and 65 years with mean age of 55.9 years (SD-8.4years) were evaluated. Of these, 21 (75.0%) of them were COVID-19 patients who were undiagnosed at the time of imaging while 7(25.0%) were known confirmed COVID-19 patients. On the chest CT scans (n=28), 17(66.7%) patients showed predominantly ground glass opacities while 12(42.9%) had evidence of consolidation predominantly. In 26(92.9%) of the patients, the opacities were bilateral and peripheral in distribution. None of these patients had pleural effusion. Conclusion COVID-19 patients tend to manifest typical imaging features on chest CT scan . The most common chest imaging finding was bilateral, peripheral and predominantly basal ground glass opacities. Importantly, these findings were frequently obtained before PCR diagnosis.

METHODS At the University Medical Center Groningen, 79 consecutive patients with disseminated NSTGCT were treated with cisplatin combination chemotherapy between 2005 and 2007. Laparoscopic RRRTM was performed for patients with RRTM located less than 5 cm ventrally or laterally from the aorta or the vena cava. The 29 patients who fulfilled the criteria had a median age of 25 years (range, 16-59 years). The stages of disease before chemotherapy treatment according to the Royal Marsden classification were 2A (n = 6, 21%), 2B (n = 14, 48%), 2C (n = 3, 10%), and 4 with a lymph node status of N2 (n = 6, 21%). RESULTS The median duration of laparoscopy was 198 min (range, 122-325 min). The median diameter of the RRTM was 21 mm (range, 11-47 mm). Laparoscopic resection was successful for 25 patients (86%). Conversion was necessary for three patients (10%): two due to bleeding and one because of obesity. One nonplanned hand-assisted procedure (3%) also had to be performed. Histologic examination of the specimens showed fibrosis or necrosis in 12 patients (41%), mature teratoma in 16 patients (55%), and viable tumor in 1 patient (3%). The median hospital stay was 1 day (range, 1-6 days). During a median follow-up period of 47 months (29-70 months), one patient experienced an early relapse (1 month after the end of treatment) (4%). CONCLUSION For properly selected patients, laparoscopic resection of RRTM is an improvement in the combined treatment of disseminated NSTGCT and associated with a short hospital stay, minimal morbidity, rapid recovery, and a neat cosmetic result. Long-term data to prove oncologic efficacy are awaited.","output":"Laparoscopic resection of a residual retroperitoneal tumor mass of nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/36.md","filePath":"drive/36.md"}'),R={name:"drive/36.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[w(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
