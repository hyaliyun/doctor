We conducted a cross-sectional design study through a questionnaire survey with 443 respondents aged between 12 and 81 years. The questionnaire was concerned with previous health problem occurrences associated with thermal discomfort experiences, indoor environments, economic conditions, and basic anthropometric factors. Logistic regression with the odds ratio (OR) was applied to evaluate the tendency of different respondent groups to suffer from certain health problems, when compared to reference groups. Furthermore, structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to incorporate certain factors (economic conditions, thermal discomfort experiences, and perceived indoor environments) into a single model to understand their direct and indirect effects on health conditions. The results indicate that economic conditions are the most significantly associated with health problems. Furthermore, we found that the low-income group was the most vulnerable to health problems, including coughing, puking, diarrhoea, odynophagia, headaches, fatigue, rheumatism, fidgeting, skin rashes, muscle cramps, and insomnia (OR: 1.94C6.04, p <0.05). Additionally, the SEM suggested that the respondents economic conditions and thermal discomfort experiences had significant direct effects on their health problems with standardized estimates of -0.29 and 0.55, respectively. Additionally, perceived indoor environment quality, which is possible to cause thermal discomfort experience, indirectly affect health problems. These findings contribute an insightful and intuitive knowledge base which can aid health assessments associated with demographic and physical environments in developing sustainable and healthy environment strategies for the future.","output":"Relation between occupants health problems, demographic and indoor environment subjective evaluations: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey study in Java Island, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Twenty-seven strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from dead or diseased chickens at different chicken farms in South China during 2004C2008, of which the S1 gene was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene sequences of the isolated 27 strains together with 29 strains published in Genbank revealed that all IBV strains except for one isolated and one published were clustered into six distinct genotypes I-VI. 26 isolated strains belong to genotypes I, II, and III, forming a big phylogenetic branch without new predominant strains, whereas all five vaccine strains belong to genotype V that is evolutionarily distant from genotypes I, II, and III. The study of the protease cleavage motif within the S1 protein found 12 different cleavage motifs, of which 3 motifs are shared by both isolated and published strains, 2 motifs unique to isolated strains, and 7 motifs unique to published strains, further bolstering the notion of no new predominant strains. Alignment analysis of the S1 amino acid sequences indicated that the amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions are polymorphic and diverse, showing no sign of predominant genetic changes among the isolated strains. Taken together, there was no predominant new strain circulating in South China during 2004C2008. Nonetheless, circulating IBV strains have been continuously evolving with genetic compositions distant from vaccine strains; this explains why there have been constant but infrequent outbreaks in commercial flocks in South China during 2004C2008. Furthermore, in order to safe guard against the sudden emergence of new predominant strains, continuing surveillance of IBV strains circulating in the field is of extreme importance.","output":"Isolation and genetic analysis revealed no predominant new strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus circulating in South China during 2004C2008"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efforts to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have spurred the need for reliable, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic methods which can easily be applied to large numbers of people.

Methods: This study was conducted within the prospective Utrecht cohort for Multiple BREast cancer intervention studies and Long-term evaluation (UMBRELLA). Shortly after the implementation of COVID-19 measures, extra questionnaires were sent to 1595 cohort participants, including standard UMBRELLA quality of life (EORTC) questionnaires. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were compared to the most recent PROs collected within UMBRELLA before COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 on PROs was evaluated using mixed models analysis. Results: In total, 1051 patients (66%) completed the questionnaires. One third (n = 327, 31%) reported a higher threshold to contact their general practitioner due to COVID-19. A significant deterioration in emotional functioning was observed (82.6 to 77.9, p < 0.001) and 505 (48%, 95% CI 45-51) patients reported moderate to severe loneliness. Small significant improvements were observed in QoL, physical-, social- and role functioning scores. In the subgroup of 51 patients under active treatment, there was a strong deterioration in social functioning (69.8 to 5.0, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Due to COVID-19, patients (being) treated for breast cancer are less likely to contact physicians, and experience a deterioration in emotional functioning.

Statistical analyzes showed that women who were at the beginning of treatment obtained higher scores on the anxiety [F(2,237) = 4.76, p = 0.009] and on the difficulties scale [F(2,237) = 3.53, p = 0.031], compared to participants who resorted to repeated fertilization procedures. It is important to emphasize that there is a significant positive correlation between the perception of infertility difficulties and coping, and also between difficulties and state anxiety. Regarding the relationship between state anxiety and coping, there were significant positive associations between maladaptive coping strategies and state anxiety, while adaptive strategies were negatively associated with state anxiety. In addition, regarding coping strategies, venting and self-blame occurred predominantly in women who know that the cause of infertility is female-related. These findings draws attention to the fact that infertile women live this experience at very high levels of anxiety, using quite a few adaptive coping mechanisms.

In order to detect and track the suspected COVID-19 infected people and consequently limit the pandemic spread, this paper entails a framework integrating the machine learning (ML), cloud, fog, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to propose a novel smart COVID-19 disease monitoring and prognosis system. The proposal leverages the IoT devices that collect streaming data from both medical (e.g., X-ray machine, lung ultrasound machine, etc.) and non-medical (e.g., bracelet, smartwatch, etc.) devices. Moreover, the proposed hybrid fog-cloud framework provides two kinds of federated ML as a service (federated MLaaS); (i) the distributed batch MLaaS that is implemented on the cloud environment for a long-term decision-making, and (ii) the distributed stream MLaaS, which is installed into a hybrid fog-cloud environment for a short-term decision-making. The stream MLaaS uses a shared federated prediction model stored into the cloud, whereas the real-time symptom data processing and COVID-19 prediction are done into the fog. The federated ML models are determined after evaluating a set of both batch and stream ML algorithms from the Pythons libraries. The evaluation considers both the quantitative (i.e., performance in terms of accuracy, precision, root mean squared error, and F1 score) and qualitative (i.e., quality of service in terms of server latency, response time, and network latency) metrics to assess these algorithms.

Since adaptation and lifestyle changes are important, quality of life (QOL) of students during medical school could be impaired. Personality traits and emotional intelligence (EI) facets may be both linked to medical students QOL. To our knowledge, no studies have been done on the concurrent and prospective relationship between QOL-related personality traits and EI in Lebanese medical students. This study aimed to investigate the role of EI as a mediator between personality traits and QOL among a sample of Lebanese medical students. METHODS: This research is a descriptive cross-sectional survey study involving 293 Lebanese medical students recruited from all 7 Faculties of Medicine in Lebanon (JuneCDecember 2019). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed using SPSS AMOS v.24 to examine the structural relationship between each personality trait taken as independent variables, QOL as the dependent variable, and emotional intelligence as the mediator, among university students. The relative Chi-square ((2)/df), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) statistic, Tucker Lewis Index (TFI) and the comparative fit index (CFI) were used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the model. RESULTS: Higher conscientiousness was significantly associated with more EI (Beta = 0.38; p < 0.001) and lower QOL (Beta = ? 0.14; p = 0.025). The indirect relationships between conscientiousness, EI and QOL showed that EI mediated the association between conscientiousness and QOL (Beta = 0.17; 95% CI ? 0.73 to ? 0.004; p = 0.037). The fit indices of this model were adequate for (2)/df, RMSEA and CFI but not TLI. Higher openness to experience was significantly associated with more EI (Beta = 0.48; p < 0.001) and lower QOL (Beta = ? 0.38; p < 0.001). The indirect relationships between openness to experience, EI and QOL showed that EI mediated the association between openness to experience and QOL (Beta = 0.30; 95% CI ? 1.11 to ? 0.03; p = 0.04). The fit indices were adequate for (2)/df and CFI but not RMSEA and TLI. EI did not mediate the association between the other three personality traits (extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism) and QOL. CONCLUSION: This current research has shed considerable light on the nexus of associations between EI, personality traits and well-being, nonetheless, led to the creation of more puzzling questions.

RESULTS: We have developed a novel computational framework X-CNV ( www.unimd.org/XCNV ), to predict the pathogenicity of CNVs by integrating more than 30 informative features such as allele frequency (AF), CNV length, CNV type, and some deleterious scores. Notably, over 14 million CNVs across various ethnic groups, covering nearly 93% of the human genome, were unified to calculate the AF. X-CNV, which yielded area under curve (AUC) values of 0.96 and 0.94 in training and validation sets, was demonstrated to outperform other available tools in terms of CNV pathogenicity prediction. A meta-voting prediction (MVP) score was developed to quantitively measure the pathogenic effect, which is based on the probabilistic value generated from the XGBoost algorithm. The proposed MVP score demonstrated a high discriminative power in determining pathogenetic CNVs for inherited traits/diseases in different ethnic groups.

Eleven adult patients admitted for elective abdominal surgery with preoperative plasma samples served as controls. All patients were included after informed consent was obtained. 27 cytokines were quantified in plasma. The expression of inflammatory mediators was then related to routine inflammatory markers, SAPS3, SOFA score, organ failure and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A general increase in cytokine expression was observed in all Covid-19 patients. A strong correlation between respiratory failure and IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10 expression was observed. Acute kidney injury development correlated well with increased levels of IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17a, IP-10 and MCP-1. Generally, the cohort demonstrated weaker correlations between cytokine expression and 30-day mortality out of which IL-8 showed the strongest signal in terms of mortality.

We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in patients with cancer. METHODS: For this prospective observational study, we recruited patients with cancer and healthy controls (mostly health-care workers) from three London hospitals between Dec 8, 2020, and Feb 18, 2021. Participants who were vaccinated between Dec 8 and Dec 29, 2020, received two 30 g doses of BNT162b2 administered intramuscularly 21 days apart; patients vaccinated after this date received only one 30 g dose with a planned follow-up boost at 12 weeks. Blood samples were taken before vaccination and at 3 weeks and 5 weeks after the first vaccination. Where possible, serial nasopharyngeal real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) swab tests were done every 10 days or in cases of symptomatic COVID-19. The coprimary endpoints were seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in patients with cancer following the first vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine and the effect of vaccine boosting after 21 days on seroconversion. All participants with available data were included in the safety and immunogenicity analyses. Ongoing follow-up is underway for further blood sampling after the delayed (12-week) vaccine boost. This study is registered with the NHS Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales (REC ID 20/HRA/2031). FINDINGS: 151 patients with cancer (95 patients with solid cancer and 56 patients with haematological cancer) and 54 healthy controls were enrolled. For this interim data analysis of the safety and immunogenicity of vaccinated patients with cancer, samples and data obtained up to March 19, 2021, were analysed. After exclusion of 17 patients who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (detected by either antibody seroconversion or a positive rRT-PCR COVID-19 swab test) from the immunogenicity analysis, the proportion of positive anti-S IgG titres at approximately 21 days following a single vaccine inoculum across the three cohorts were 32 (94%; 95% CI 81-98) of 34 healthy controls; 21 (38%; 26-51) of 56 patients with solid cancer, and eight (18%; 10-32) of 44 patients with haematological cancer. 16 healthy controls, 25 patients with solid cancer, and six patients with haematological cancer received a second dose on day 21. Of the patients with available blood samples 2 weeks following a 21-day vaccine boost, and excluding 17 participants with evidence of previous natural SARS-CoV-2 exposure, 18 (95%; 95% CI 75-99) of 19 patients with solid cancer, 12 (100%; 76-100) of 12 healthy controls, and three (60%; 23-88) of five patients with haematological cancers were seropositive, compared with ten (30%; 17-47) of 33, 18 (86%; 65-95) of 21, and four (11%; 4-25) of 36, respectively, who did not receive a boost. The vaccine was well tolerated; no toxicities were reported in 75 (54%) of 140 patients with cancer following the first dose of BNT162b2, and in 22 (71%) of 31 patients with cancer following the second dose. Similarly, no toxicities were reported in 15 (38%) of 40 healthy controls after the first dose and in five (31%) of 16 after the second dose. Injection-site pain within 7 days following the first dose was the most commonly reported local reaction (23 [35%] of 65 patients with cancer; 12 [48%] of 25 healthy controls). No vaccine-related deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: In patients with cancer, one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine yields poor efficacy. Immunogenicity increased significantly in patients with solid cancer within 2 weeks of a vaccine boost at day 21 after the first dose. These data support prioritisation of patients with cancer for an early (day 21) second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine.

Epidemiological studies have suggested that environmental exposure to MeHg is linked to the development of diabetes mellitus (DM). The exact molecular mechanism of MeHg-induced pancreatic ?-cell cytotoxicity is still unclear. Here, we found that MeHg (1-4 M) significantly decreased insulin secretion and cell viability in pancreatic ?-cell-derived RIN-m5F cells. A concomitant elevation of mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic events was observed, including decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased proapoptotic (Bax, Bak, p53)/antiapoptotic (Bcl-2) mRNA ratio, cytochrome c release, annexin V-Cy3 binding, caspase-3 activity, and caspase-3/-7/-9 activation. Exposure of RIN-m5F cells to MeHg (2 M) also induced protein expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related signaling molecules, including C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), X-box binding protein (XBP-1), and caspase-12. Pretreatment with 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA; an ER stress inhibitor) and specific siRNAs for CHOP and XBP-1 significantly inhibited their expression and caspase-3/-12 activation in MeHg-exposed RIN-mF cells. MeHg could also evoke c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC; 1mM) or 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (trolox; 100 M) markedly prevented MeH-induced ROS generation and decreased cell viability in RIN-m5F cells. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with SP600125 (JNK inhibitor; 10 M) or NAC (1 mM) or transfection with JNK-specific siRNA obviously attenuated the MeHg-induced JNK phosphorylation, CHOP and XBP-1 protein expression, apoptotic events, and insulin secretion dysfunction. NAC significantly inhibited MeHg-activated JNK signaling, but SP600125 could not effectively reduce MeHg-induced ROS generation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the induction of ROS-activated JNK signaling is a crucial mechanism underlying MeHg-induced mitochondria- and ER stress-dependent apoptosis, ultimately leading to ?-cell death.","output":"Methylmercury Induces Mitochondria- and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Dependent Pancreatic ?-Cell Apoptosis via an Oxidative Stress-Mediated JNK Signaling Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the clinical characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the whole disease process, and provide reference for etiological diagnosis and treatment. METHODS The clinical data of patients with COVID-19 admitted in the Infectious Diseases Branch of the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China from January 22nd, 2020 to March 8th, 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. According to whether there were gastrointestinal symptoms (poor appetite, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea), all patients were divided into gastrointestinal symptom group and asymptomatic group. The characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as poor appetite, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were counted and analyzed, and the correlation between gastrointestinal symptoms and gender, age, basic diseases, disease severity, laboratory examination and drug treatment were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 80 COVID-19 patients were involved, 43 cases (53.8%) presented with poor appetite, 17 cases (21.3%) had nausea and vomiting, and 33 cases (41.3%) had diarrhea. Among them, 5 cases, 1 case and 4 cases respectively preformed poor appetite, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea before admission, while the others experienced gastrointestinal symptoms within 48 hours after admission. Duration of poor appetite, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea (days) of all patients were 5.32.1, 2.21.0 and 1.40.9, respectively. The patients with poor appetite were older than those without symptoms (years old: 48.217.6 vs. 39.315.1), albumin (Alb) level and the lymphocytes ratio were lower than those in asymptomatic group [Alb (g/L): 39.8 (35.7, 45.1) vs. 46.1 (42.6, 49.4), lymphocytes ratio: 0.19 (0.09, 0.28) vs. 0.28 (0.17, 0.35)], while the neutrophil ratio, the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were higher than those in asymptomatic group [the neutrophil ratio: 0.74 (0.61, 0.85) vs. 0.64 (0.52, 0.76), CRP (mg/L): 21.4 (3.9, 52.9) vs. 5.6 (2.4, 14.0), D-dimer (mg/L): 0.2 (0.2, 0.5) vs. 0.2 (0.1, 0.3), LDH (mols-1L-1): 4.49 (3.59, 5.19) vs. 3.12 (2.77, 4.90)]; at the same time, more traditional Chinese medicine was used in the patients with gastrointestinal symptoms [65.1% (28/43) vs. 40.5% (15/37), all P < 0.05]. In addition, 14 cases of 18 patients with cardiovascular diseases presented with poor appetite, 7 patients had nausea and vomiting symptoms. All of the 3 patients with chronic kidney disease presented with poor appetite, nausea and vomiting, and 2 of them had diarrhea.

Parallels with systemic inflammatory disorders such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) have implicated the complement pathway in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and particularly the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a released from cleavage of C3 and C5, respectively. C5a is a potent cell signalling protein that activates a cytokine storm-a hyper-inflammatory phenomenon-within hours of infection and the innate immune response. However, excess C5a can result in a pro-inflammatory environment orchestrated through a plethora of mechanisms that propagate lung injury, lymphocyte exhaustion, and an immune paresis. Furthermore, disruption of the homeostatic interactions between complement and extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways contributes to a net pro-coagulant state in the microvasculature of critical organs. Fatal COVID-19 has been associated with a systemic inflammatory response accompanied by a pro-coagulant state and organ damage, particularly microvascular thrombi in the lungs and kidneys. Pathologic studies report strong evidence of complement activation. C5 blockade reduces inflammatory cytokines and their manifestations in animal studies, and has shown benefits in patients with aHUS, prompting investigation of this approach in the treatment of COVID-19.

Moreover, elimination of all PARP14 expression by gene targeting led to altered recall antibody responses and attenuation of ovalbumin-specific allergic lung inflammation with no apparent health issues for mice lacking this protein. However, an unanswered question is whether or not inhibition of the catalytic function has any biological consequence since PARP14 has multiple functional domains apart from the portion that catalyzes ADP-ribosylation. As reported separately, iterative structural analyses and medicinal chemistry fostered the generation of a compound, RBN2759, that is highly selective in its inhibition of PARP14 with negligible impact on other members of the PARP gene family. We show here that administration of this compound to mice previously sensitized to the allergen Alternaria alternata achieved biochemically active levels and altered physiological responses to the antigen. These results show for the first time that in vivo administration of a specific inhibitor of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity encoded by PARP14 is sufficient to alter biological responses. Specifically, the orally absorbable pharmaceutical compound decreased allergen-induced mucus, blunted the induced increases in circulating IgE, and prevented suppression of IgG2a. We conclude that the catalytic activity can contribute to pathogenesis in allergic processes and propose that other biological endpoints that depend on ADP-ribosylation by PARP14 can be targeted using selective inhibition.","output":"Selective pharmaceutical inhibition of PARP14 mitigates allergen-induced IgE and mucus overproduction in a mouse model of pulmonary allergic response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several cities, but only two U.S states, have passed a law banning the sales of flavored tobacco products.

In conclusion, blocking or manipulating the SARS-CoV2-ACE2 binding interface perhaps offers the best tactic against the virus that should be treated as a fundamental subject of future research.","output":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and SARS-CoV-2: Potential therapeutic targeting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Licensed premises face particular challenges to operating safely within COVID-19 restrictions Following a U K national lockdown from March 20, 2020, we studied business practices and behaviors in licensed premises to inform COVID-19 policies To our knowledge, no previous study worldwide has examined these issues Method: Before premises reopened in Scotland, we conducted in-depth telephone interviews (MayCJune 2020) with participants from hospitality trade associations, licensed premises, or in related roles (n = 18) Interviews focused on anticipated business practices and challenges relevant to minimizing COVID-19 transmission Following reopening (JulyCAugust 2020), we conducted observations of relevant practices and behaviors in 29 bars purposively sampled for diversity, using a structured schedule Interviews and observation reports were analyzedthematically Results: Interviewees generally sought clarity, flexibility, and balance in government guidance on reopening, and they cited commercial and practical challenges to doing so safely Alcohol consumption was perceived as an additional but potentially manageable challenge Most observed premises had made physical and operational modifications;however, practices were variable Observed incidents of concern included close physical interaction between customers and with staff, frequently featuring alcohol intoxication and rarely effectively stopped by staff Conclusions: Despite the efforts of bar operators and guidance from government, potentially significant risks of COVID-19 transmission persisted in a substantial minority of observed bars, especially when customers were intoxicated","output":"Managing COVID-19 Transmission Risks in Bars: An Interview and Observation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time, raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released. Our work can also be used to analyse the disease dynamics after a vaccine is certified for use and information regarding its immune response becomes available.","output":"Impact of reproduction number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity: a mathematical model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Echinococcosis is one of the 17 neglected tropical diseases recognized by the World Health Organization and causes a huge global disease burden. The Tibet Autonomous Region (Tibet) of China is the most epidemic area of echinococcosis worldwide. Echinococcosis poses an enormous threat to local public health and economic development. Identifying vulnerable populations and analyzing people's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) with respect to echinococcosis is necessary to prevent and control echinococcosis. Based on reported cases and questionnaire responses, we first used a k-prototypes clustering algorithm to identify vulnerable populations according to human demographics (including gender, age, education level, and occupation). We then used a KAP analysis to evaluate the Tibetan people's understanding of echinococcosis. The results identified three types of vulnerable population. Vulnerable population I comprised illiterate middle-aged and older women engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. Vulnerable population II comprised illiterate middle-aged male herdsmen. Vulnerable population III comprised young male farmers with a low education level. The KAP analysis indicated that the pass rate for all participants was 72.6%, 6.4%, 95.0%, and 75.8% for KAP, K, A, and P, respectively. The pass rates were significantly different among different age and gender groups. Based on these results, it is necessary to improve public health education and professional training, and to implement effective control and management measures targeting typical hosts of echinococcosis.

As its transmissibility and high pathogenicity seriously threaten people's lives, the accurate and fast detection of the COVID-19 infection is crucial. Although many recent studies have shown that deep learning based solutions can help detect COVID-19 based on chest CT scans, there lacks a consistent and systematic comparison and evaluation on these techniques. In this paper, we first build a clean and segmented CT dataset called Clean-CC-CCII by fixing the errors and removing some noises in a large CT scan dataset CC-CCII with three classes: novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), common pneumonia (CP), and normal controls (Normal). After cleaning, our dataset consists of a total of 340,190 slices of 3,993 scans from 2,698 patients. Then we benchmark and compare the performance of a series of state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results show that 3D CNNs outperform 2D CNNs in general. With extensive effort of hyperparameter tuning, we find that the 3D CNN model DenseNet3D121 achieves the highest accuracy of 88.63% (F1-score is 88.14% and AUC is 0.940), and another 3D CNN model ResNet3D34 achieves the best AUC of 0.959 (accuracy is 87.83% and F1-score is 86.04%). We further demonstrate that the mixup data augmentation technique can largely improve the model performance. At last, we design an automated deep learning methodology to generate a lightweight deep learning model MNas3DNet41 that achieves an accuracy of 87.14%, F1-score of 87.25%, and AUC of 0.957, which are on par with the best models made by AI experts.

They are at risk to develop severe and/or prolonged forms of Covid-19. The efficacy of vaccination against COVID in lymphoma/CLL patients also raises specific concerns: Antibody response to mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was shown to be negatively affected by CLL stage and its treatments, especially in case of previous administration of anti-CD20 antibodies (Herishanu et al). Therefore, the addition of a third dose of vaccine in immunosuppressed patients is currently recommended in France. Methods: To analyse the determinants of the antibody response after anti-SARS-Cov2 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna), we conducted a retrospective monocentric study among adults with a past or current lymphoma/CLL who underwent serology 2 weeks or more after 2 or 3 previous injections. The decision of a third dose was at the discretion of each physician. Data were extracted from the patients' medical charts on their demographics, lymphoma history and detailed treatments, vaccinations and biological parameters (immunoglobulin (Ig) G dosage, lymphocytic, B-cell and T-cell counts) and serology (Elecsys ? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S). Statistical tests were two-tailed and p-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Multivariable analysis was conducted using independent variables having univariate significance below 0.1. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the ethics committee of our institution. Results: Ninety-one patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) (n=48), CLL (32) or Hodgkin's lymphoma (11) were enrolled. With a median interval since last dose of 47 days (range 15-125), 48 patients (53%) had a negative serology (Table). Gender and age were not associated with antibody response. The proportion of seronegativity was 57% among patients with B-cell NHL, and 41% among those with CLL. Among the biological variables reflecting immune deficiency, lymphocytopenia (<1.5G/L), low B-cell counts (<0.2G/L) and IgG levels (<6g/L) were significantly associated with a higher risk of seronegativity with odds-ratios (OR, [95% confidence interval]) of 5.1 [1.8-15.3], p<7x10 -4 , 15.0 [3.0-147.9], p<7x10 -5, and 15.3 [3.7-93.0], p<9x10 ? 6 respectively). Patients under watch and wait attitude and those who did not have a lymphoma/CLL treatment since at least 12 months before vaccination had a much lower risk of negative serology (OR: 0.08 [<0.01 ; 0.4], p< 2.10 -4). Among lymphoma/CLL therapies, chemotherapy overall or targeted therapy with BTK inhibitors or Venetoclax were not significantly associated with a lower risk of negative serology. In contrast, the administration of anti-CD20 therapy during the year before first dose of vaccine was associated with a higher risk of negative serology (OR: 4.5 [1.7; 12.1], p<8.10 -4). Of note, this treatment was also significantly associated with both lymphocytopenia and low B-cell counts. There was no association between the number of vaccine doses and the risk of negative serology, 59% of the patients who received 3 doses remained seronegative.A multivariable analysis associating IgG level and treatment history showed that negative serology is significantly associated with a low level of IgG (OR: 25.74 [5.58; 201.14], p < 10 -3) and anti-CD20 treatment (OR: 28.70 [4.14, 382.60], p = 3x10 -3). Conclusion: Overall, previous anti-CD20 therapy and low IgG levels are the main independent factors associated with a lack of serological response after anti-SARS-Cov2 mRNA vaccine. Administration of a third vaccine does not overcome their pejorative impact. This should contribute to the elaboration of guidelines for the management of lymphoma/CLL patients during the Covid-19 era. In particular, in all non-critical clinical situation, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination should be proposed before the onset of lymphoma/CLL therapy. Meanwhile, individuals with CLL/lymphoma should receive the Covid-19 vaccine, be informed that they are unlikely to be protected and continue social distancing and adhere to other proven mitigation strategies. Systematic vaccination of their proxies and hospital workers should also benefit directly to patients.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the self-reported symptoms among adults (older than 18 years) who underwent COVID-19 testing at an ambulatory assessment center in Canada and at a hospital in Israel between March 16, 2020, and August 19, 2020. The primary outcome was the prevalence of self-reported chemosensory dysfunction (anosmia/hypomsia and dysgeusia/ageusia). Subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate the prevalence of chemosensory deficits among the outpatients. RESULTS: We identified a total of 350 COVID-19-positive patients (138 Canadians and 212 Israelis). The overall prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction was 47.1%. There was a higher proportion of chemosensory deficits among Canadians compared to Israelis (66.7% vs 34.4%, P < .01). A subgroup analysis for outpatients (never hospitalized) still identified a higher prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction among Canadians compared to Israelis (68.2% vs 36.1%, P < 0.01). A majority of patients recovered their sense of smell after 4 weeks of symptom onset. CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of chemosensory deficit in COVID-19 was found to be similar to previously published reports, the prevalence can vary significantly across different geographical regions. Therefore, it is important to obtain regionally specific data so that the symptom of anosmia/dysgeusia can be used as a guide for screening for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.","output":"Comparative Study of Chemosensory Dysfunction in COVID-19 in 2 Geographically Distinct Regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stroke is a catastrophic medical disease with roughly 795,000 cases per year in the US.

On the contrary, we found that our two measures of disruption, student satisfaction with learning and student engagement, improved when the flipped classes were moved fully online. This we attribute to the focus on student learning using computer-based materials that is part of flipped learning. While there are classes unsuitable for flipping, the pandemic has demonstrated that all classes can be taught online.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the quality of in-hospital and postacute care among young adults with AMI differs between the US and Canada and whether female sex and adverse SDOH are associated with a low quality of care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort analysis used data from 2 large cohorts of young adults (aged 55 years) receiving in-hospital and outpatient care for AMI at 127 centers in the US and Canada. Data were collected from August 21, 2008, to April 30, 2013, and analyzed from July 12, 2019, to March 10, 2021. EXPOSURES: Sex, SDOH, and health care system. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Opportunity-based quality-of-care score (QCS), determined by dividing the total number of quality indicators of care received by the total number for which the patient was eligible, with low quality of care defined as the lowest tertile of the QCS. RESULTS: A total of 4048 adults with AMI (2345 women [57.9%]; median age, 49 [interquartile range, 44-52] years; 3004 [74.2%] in the US) were included in the analysis. Of 3416 patients with in-hospital QCS available, 1061 (31.1%) received a low QCS, including more women compared with men (725 of 2007 [36.1%] vs 336 of 1409 [23.8%]; P < .001) and more patients treated in the US vs Canada (962 of 2646 [36.4%] vs 99 of 770 [12.9%]; P < .001). Conversely, low quality of post-AMI care (748 of 2938 [25.5%]) was similarly observed for both sexes, with a higher prevalence in the US (678 of 2346 [28.9%] vs 70 of 592 [11.8%]). In adjusted analyses, female sex was not associated with low QCS for in-hospital (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% CI, 0.87-1.28) and post-AMI (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.88-1.30) care. Conversely, being treated in the US was associated with low in-hospital (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 2.16-3.99) and post-AMI (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.97-3.63) QCS, regardless of sex. Of all SDOH, only employment was associated with higher quality of in-hospital care (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59-0.88). Finally, only in the US, low quality of in-hospital care was associated with a higher 1-year cardiac readmissions rate (234 of 962 [24.3%]).

Amongst others, these measures include the temporary restriction of the operation of leisure facilities as well as contact and travel restrictions. These government regulations and recommendations have provoked mixed reactions, with some parts of the population not complying accordingly. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study is to explore reasons for the noncompliance with protective measures on the basis of social media posts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three social networks (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube comments) were systematically investigated for the period 2 March to 18 April 2020 with regard to attitudes and beliefs about social distancing and other protective measures by means of qualitative document and content analysis. A total of 119 postings were included in the analysis and interpreted. RESULTS: Six main categories and four subcategories were identified in terms of the rejection of protective measures: misinformation of social media (trivialization and doubts about the effectiveness of protective measures), mistrust of the established public media, knowledge deficits and uncertainty, restriction of basic rights, the role of authorities (population control and poor trust in the Robert Koch Institute), and economic consequences of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Misinformation in social media and knowledge deficits may contribute to underestimating the pandemic. In addition, economic pressures may contribute to rejecting protective measures.

At the same time, food security is a deep concern, with increasing incidence of natural disasters and health concerns related to diet-related disease and dietary quality plaguing the nation and its food system. This article aims to examine the validity of the FIES for use in The Bahamas, the prevalence of moderate and severe food insecurity, and the sociodemographic factors that contribute to increased food insecurity. METHODS: The FIES survey was administered by randomized and weighted landline telephone survey in Nassau in The Bahamas to 1000 participants in June and July 2017. The Rasch modelling procedure was applied to examine tool validity and prevalence of food insecurity. Equating procedures calibrated this study's results to the global FIES reference scale and computed internationally comparable prevalence rates of both moderate and severe food insecurity. A regression analysis assessed the relationship between household variables and food security. RESULTS: The FIES met benchmarks for fit statistics for all eight items and the overall Rasch reliability is 0.7. As of 2017, Bahamians' prevalence of moderate and severe food insecurity was 21%, and the prevalence of severe food insecurity was 10%. Statistically significant variables that contribute to food insecurity included education, age, gender, and presence of diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease. Results also indicated that Bahamians experience food insecurity differently than populations across the globe, likely due in large part to the workings of an isolated food system heavily dependent on foreign imports. Responses showed that by the time a Bahamian worries they will not have enough food to eat, they have already restricted their meals to a few kinds of foods and begun to limit their intake of vegetables and fruits. CONCLUSION: This study, which is among the first to comprehensively measure food security in The Bahamas, provides a baseline for further research and evaluation of practices aimed at mitigating food insecurity in small island developing states. Further, this study provides a benchmark for future research, which may seek to understand the impacts of Hurricane Dorian and COVID-19, disasters further isolating the remote island nation.

Accordingly, the behavioral, social, and communication sciences have been important contributors to cancer prevention and control research, with methodological advances and implementation science helping to produce optimally effective interventions. To sustain these contributions, it is vital to adapt to the contemporary context. Efforts must consider ancillary effects of the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic, profound changes in the information environment and public understanding of and trust in science, renewed attention to structural racism and social determinants of health, and the rapidly increasing population of cancer survivors. Within this context, it is essential to accelerate reductions in tobacco use across all population subgroups; consider new models of energy balance (diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior); increase awareness of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer, and identify better communication practices in the context of cancer-related decisions such as screening and genetic testing.

The Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service (HIRA) has run a Healthcare Utilization Monitoring System (HUMS) since 2008. The objective of this paper is to introduce HIRA's HUMS. METHODS: This study described the HUMS's system structure, capacity, functionalities, and output formats run by HIRA in the Republic of Korea. Regarding output formats, this study extracted diabetes related health insurance claims through the HUMS from August 1, 2014 to May 31, 2015. RESULTS: The HUMS has kept records of health insurance claim data for 4 years. It has a 14-terabyte hardware capacity and employs several easy-to-use programs for maintenance of the system, such as MSTR, SAS, etc. Regarding functionalities, users should input diseases codes, target periods, facility types, and types of attributes, such as the number of healthcare utilizations or healthcare costs. It also has a functionality to predict healthcare utilization and costs. When this study extracted diabetes related data, it was found that the trend of healthcare costs for the treatment of diabetes and the number of patients with diabetes were increasing. CONCLUSIONS: HIRA's HUMS works well to monitor healthcare utilization of patients at the national level. The HUMS has a high-capacity hardware infrastructure and several operational programs that allows easy access to summaries as well as details to identify contributing factors for abnormality, but it has a limitation in that there is often a time lag between the provision of healthcare to patients and the filing of health claims.","output":"Healthcare Utilization Monitoring System in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Filoviruses, including Ebola virus, are unusual in being filamentous animal viruses. Structural data on the arrangement, stoichiometry and organisation of the component molecules of filoviruses has until now been lacking, partially due to the need to work under level 4 biological containment. The present study provides unique insights into the structure of this deadly pathogen. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have investigated the structure of Ebola virus using a combination of cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, sub-tomogram averaging, and single particle image processing. Here we report the three-dimensional structure and architecture of Ebola virus and establish that multiple copies of the RNA genome can be packaged to produce polyploid virus particles, through an extreme degree of length polymorphism. We show that the helical Ebola virus inner nucleocapsid containing RNA and nucleoprotein is stabilized by an outer layer of VP24-VP35 bridges. Elucidation of the structure of the membrane-associated glycoprotein in its native state indicates that the putative receptor-binding site is occluded within the molecule, while a major neutralizing epitope is exposed on its surface proximal to the viral envelope. The matrix protein VP40 forms a regular lattice within the envelope, although its contacts with the nucleocapsid are irregular. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate a modular organization in Ebola virus that accommodates a well-ordered, symmetrical nucleocapsid within a flexible, tubular membrane envelope.","output":"The Organisation of Ebola Virus Reveals a Capacity for Extensive, Modular Polyploidy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"University administrators face decisions about how to safely return and maintain students, staff and faculty on campus throughout the 2020C21 school year. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) deterministic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 among university students, staff, and faculty. Our goals were to inform planning at our own university, Emory University, a medium-sized university with around 15,000 students and 15,000 faculty and staff, and to provide a flexible modeling framework to inform the planning efforts at similar academic institutions. Control strategies of isolation and quarantine are initiated by screening (regardless of symptoms) or testing (of symptomatic individuals). We explored a range of screening and testing frequencies and performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We found that among students, monthly and weekly screening can reduce cumulative incidence by 59% and 87%, respectively, while testing with a 2-, 4- and 7-day delay between onset of infectiousness and testing results in an 84%, 74% and 55% reduction in cumulative incidence. Smaller reductions were observed among staff and faculty. Community-introduction of SARS-CoV-2 onto campus may be controlled with testing, isolation, contract tracing and quarantine. Screening would need to be performed at least weekly to have substantial reductions beyond disease surveillance.

Pairwise comparison between severe versus mild disease, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) versus general ward admission and expired versus survivors were performed for 36 laboratory parameters. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the DerSimonian Laird method/random effects model and converted to the Odds ratio (OR). The decision tree algorithm was employed to identify the key risk factor(s) attributed to severe COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: Cohorts with elevated levels of white blood cells (WBCs) (OR = 1.75), neutrophil count (OR = 2.62), D-dimer (OR = 3.97), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (OR = 1.82), fibrinogen (OR = 3.14), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR = 1.60), procalcitonin (OR = 4.76), IL-6 (OR = 2.10), and IL-10 (OR = 4.93) had higher odds of progression to severe phenotype.

Renal toxicity is one of the main limiting factors in 177Lu-octreotate treatment. Further knowledge of the biodistribution and dosimetry of 177Lu-octreotate in individual patients is needed. The aim of this study was to estimate the absorbed dose to the kidneys and compare the results obtained with planar imaging and different dosimetric methods: (1) conjugate-view (CV) method using patient-specific kidney sizes, (2) PA method, based on posterior images only, (3) CV method with reduced number of time points (CVreduced data), and (4) CV method using standard kidney sizes (CVstandard size). METHODS Totally, 33 patients each received 3.4 to 8.2 GBq of 177Lu-octreotate up to five times, with infusion of lysine and arginine to block the renal uptake. Whole-body planar gamma camera images were acquired on days 0, 1, 2, and 7. The 177Lu concentration in the kidneys was determined by the CV method, and the absorbed dose was estimated with patient-specific organ sizes. Comparison to the CV method was made using posterior images only, together with the influence of the number of time points and with standard organ sizes. RESULTS Large interindividual variations were found in the time-activity curve pattern and in the absorbed dose to the kidneys using the CV method: 0.33 to 2.4 Gy/GBq (mean = 0.80 Gy/GBq, SD = 0.30). In the individual patient, the mean deviation of all subsequent kidney doses compared to that of the first administration was 1% (SD = 19%) and 5% (SD = 23%) for the right and left kidneys, respectively. Excluding data for day 7 resulted in large variations in the absorbed dose.

VITT resembles heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT) in that it is associated with platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4)4; however, patients with VITT develop thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis without exposure to heparin. Here we sought to determine the binding site on PF4 of antibodies from patients with VITT. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis5, we found that the binding of anti-PF4 antibodies from patients with VITT (n = 5) was restricted to eight surface amino acids on PF4, all of which were located within the heparin-binding site, and that the binding was inhibited by heparin. By contrast, antibodies from patients with HIT (n = 10) bound to amino acids that corresponded to two different sites on PF4. Biolayer interferometry experiments also revealed that VITT anti-PF4 antibodies had a stronger binding response to PF4 and PF4-heparin complexes than did HIT anti-PF4 antibodies, albeit with similar dissociation rates. Our data indicate that VITT antibodies can mimic the effect of heparin by binding to a similar site on PF4; this allows PF4 tetramers to cluster and form immune complexes, which in turn causes Fc?3 receptor IIa (Fc?3RIIa; also known as CD32a)-dependent platelet activation.

Methods Curcumin and its drug targets were identified using network analysis. First, the Swiss target prediction, GeneCards, and OMIM databases were mined for information relevant to the prediction of curcumin targets and SLE-ONFH-related targets. Second, the curcumin target gene, SLE-ONFH shared gene, and curcumin-SLE-ONFH target gene networks were created in Cytoscape software followed by collecting the candidate targets of each component by R software. Third, the targets and enriched pathways were examined by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Eventually, a gene-pathway network was constructed and visualized by Cytoscape software; key potential central targets were verified and checked by molecular docking and literature review. Results 201 potential targets of curcumin and 170 related targets involved in SLE-ONFH were subjected to network analysis, and the 36 intersection targets indicated the potential targets of curcumin for the treatment of SLE-ONFH.

METHODS We evaluated 18 winged phlebotomy devices of 6 device designs by Terumo, BD Vacutainer (2 designs), Greiner, Smith Medical, and Kendall (designated A-F, respectively). Scientific filters were positioned around the devices and weighed before and after venipuncture was performed. Visible blood on filters, exam gloves, and devices and measurable blood splatter were the primary units of analysis. RESULTS The percentages of devices and gloves with visible blood on them and filters with measurable blood splatter ranged from 0% to 20%.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of intramuscular 5-HTP injections on calcium homeostasis in the goat mammary glands. In the in vivo experiment, thirty multiparous Guanzhong dairy goats were randomly assigned to two groups, one group was injected with 5-HTP intramuscularly and the other group was injected with normal saline. From the first 10 days of the expected date for delivery, 5-HTP or saline was injected into goats through the shoulder muscle every morning before feeding, with a dose of 1 mg/kg per body weight. In the in vitro experiment, goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC) were treated with 100 M 5-HT for the evaluation of 5-HT in calcium transportation. The results demonstrated that 5-HTP treatment had no effect on the basic composition of colostrum (P > 0.05) but increased the serum 5-HT concentrations on d -5, -4, -3 and d 5 relative to parturition (P <0.05). The 5-HTP injection group had greater serum calcium concentration on d 4 and greater serum parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP) on d -5, -4, -1, 3, 4, and 5 compared to the saline injection group (P <0.05). It was further confirmed that 5-HT could increase intracellular calcium levels by increasing PTHrP and decreasing plasma-membrane Ca2+-ATPases1(PMCA1) in GMEC (P <0.05). In conclusion, 5-HTP treatment in multiparous goats during the transition period form pregnancy to lactation is a feasible way to protect goats form calcium metabolism disorder.","output":"Increasing serotonin concentrations alter calcium metabolism in periparturient dairy goats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With or without the global COVID-19 pandemic to promote and envision a meaningful and positive transformation of the planet in general, and tourism specifically, a wake-up call is long overdue The 300-years old industrial and modern paradigm of ruthless and selfish exploitation of natural resources has separated us from nature and ultimately ourselves to such an extent that the crises of our economic, political, environmental, social and healthcare systems do not come at any surprise Yet, in juxtaposition to (post)modern pessimistic views, the positive transmodern paradigm shift with its holistic perspectives and practices can be observed Led by the silent revolution of cultural creatives, new worlds are emerging, although still kept at the margins Transformative travel and tourism as an ever-growing trend, appears to be an important medium through which these cultural creatives reinvent themselves and the world they live in Inner transformation is reflected in the outer world New ways of being, knowing and doing in the world are emerging as conscious citizens, consumers, producers, travellers, entrepreneurs, and community leaders are calling and acting upon the necessary transformation towards the regenerative paradigm and regenerative economic systems Based on the natural cycles of renewal and regeneration, this circular approach is underpinned by regenerative land practices The vision of connecting regenerative agriculture and transformative tourism is offered to reset the global tourism system for good","output":"Transforming the (tourism) world for good and (re)generating the potential new normal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The natural transmission routes of the three feline haemotropic mycoplasmas C Mycoplasma haemofelis, Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum, and Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis (CMt) C are largely unknown. Since CMt has been detected in the saliva of infected cats using PCR, we hypothesised that direct transmission via social or aggressive contact may occur. The aim of this study was to evaluate this transmission route. CMt-positive saliva and blood samples were obtained from three prednisolone-treated specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats that were infected intraperitoneally with CMt. Five SPF cats were inoculated with CMt-positive saliva or blood subcutaneously to mimic cat bites, and five cats were inoculated orally with blood or oronasally with saliva to mimic social contact. Blood samples were monitored for CMt infection using quantitative real-time PCR and for seroconversion using a novel western blot assay. Neither oronasal nor subcutaneous inoculation with CMt-positive saliva led to CMt infection in the recipient cats, as determined by PCR, independent of prior prednisolone treatment. However, when blood containing the same CMt dose was given subcutaneously, 4 of the 5 cats became PCR-positive, while none of the 5 cats inoculated orally with up to 500 L of CMt-positive blood became PCR-positive. Subsequently, the latter cats were successfully subcutaneously infected with blood. All 13 CMt-exposed cats seroconverted.

Given that young people are disproportionately disadvantaged by mental illness and will face further challenges from COVID-19, it is crucial that the appropriate mental health care be delivered to them as early as possible. Integrating digital health solutions into mental health service delivery pathways has the potential to greatly increase efficiencies, allowing for the provision of 'right care, first time'. We propose an innovative digital health solution for demand management intended for use by primary youth mental health services, comprised of: 1) a youth mental health model of care (i.e. BMC Youth Model); and 2) a health information technology specifically designed to deliver this model of care (e.g. the InnoWell Platform), as well as an operational protocol of how this solution could be applied to primary youth mental health service delivery processes. By 'flipping' conventional service delivery models of majority in-clinic and minority online-delivered care to a model where online-delivered care is the default, this digital health solution offers a scalable way of delivering quality youth mental health care, both in response to public health crises (such as COVID-19) and ongoingly into the future.","output":"Flip the clinic: a digital health approach to youth mental health service delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To discuss the coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and to find new biomarkers to separate severe COVID-19 patients from mild ones.

Positive psychology constructs of grit and growth mindset may offer a solution to this challenge as both are associated with psychological resilience. A growth mindset describes the underlying beliefs people have about the malleability of intelligence, and grit refers to dedication to long-term goals. The present study explored whether such constructs could constitute protective factors against the academic stress associated with loneliness and perceived lack of control among international students (n = 170) during social isolation, induced by COVID-19 restrictions. The results of a hierarchical multiple regression model explained 36% of the variance in academic stress with a perceived lack of control (? = .53, p < .001) and growth mindset (? = -.22, p < .001) being significant direct predictors. Moderation analysis explained 17% of the variance and confirmed that a level of dispositional grit moderated the detrimental influence loneliness had on academic stress. Simple slopes analysis revealed a significant effect for moderate (? = .07, p = .01) and high (? = .16, p = .001) levels of grit. Our findings suggest that grit and growth mindset, as dynamic variables, could be taught to students as resilience-building prevention of academic stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, our results have shown that parents (37%) and friends (32%) were most frequently identified by students as supporters during the COVID-19 pandemic with minimal reported support from universities (2.5%).","output":"Buffering Academic Stress during the COVID-19 Pandemic Related Social Isolation: Grit and Growth Mindset as Protective Factors against the Impact of Loneliness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this review article we summarized the differential diagnosis of radiological signs of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 infection and emphasized learning points.","output":"Differential radiological semiotics of coronavirus infection and other etiology pneumonias"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The fear of insecurity and uncertainty caused by 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the separation and loss of certain important relationships, and the great changes in lifestyle have awakened strong emotional response, which may cause psychological problems to the general population.

This study aimed to identify what behaviors can effectively reduce negative emotions during the epidemic. METHODS: From February 1, to March 8 in 2020, we conducted a web-based survey and collected information on general demographic data. The probable depression, anxiety symptoms and coping behaviors was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized anxiety disorder-7 and the self-made Coping Behaviors Questionnaires. RESULT: Among 17249 responders, 7923 and 9326 completed the assessment of depression and anxiety respectively, and all responders finished the assessment of the coping behaviors questionnaires. Our survey population had a high prevalence rate of possible depression disorders and anxiety disorders were34.66% and 56.93%, respectively. Those who are old, female, low education, low income, and cohabiting were more likely to suffer depression and/or anxiety. Students are a high-risk group suffering from depression and/or anxiety. After adjusting for social-demographic factors (e.g. age, sex), depression and anxiety were positively associated with self-injury, doing housework, and having sex or masturbating and negatively associated with singing, drawing, or writing, dating friends online, singing, attending lectures, and doing yoga.

INTRODUCTION Systematic reviews on the psychometric properties of evidence-based practice measures guide researchers, clinical managers, and educators in selecting an appropriate measure for use. The lack of psychometric standards specific to evidence-based practice measures, in addition to recent findings suggesting the low methodological quality of psychometric systematic reviews, calls into question the quality and methods of systematic reviews examining evidence-based practice measures. INCLUSION CRITERIA We included systematic reviews that identified measures that assessed evidence-based practice as a whole or of constituent parts (eg, knowledge, attitudes, skills, behaviors), and described the psychometric evidence for any health care professional group irrespective of assessment context (education or clinical practice). METHODS We searched five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ERIC) on January 18, 2021. Two independent reviewers conducted screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal following the JBI approach. A narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS Ten systematic reviews, published between 2006 and 2020, were included and focused on the following groups: all health care professionals (n = 3), nurses (n = 2), occupational therapists (n = 2), physical therapists (n = 1), medical students (n = 1), and family medical residents (n = 1). The overall quality of the systematic reviews was low: none of the reviews assessed the quality of primary studies or adhered to methodological guidelines, and only one registered a protocol. Reporting of psychometric evidence and measurement characteristics differed. While all the systematic reviews discussed internal consistency, feasibility was only addressed by three. Many approaches were used to assess the adequacy of measures, and five systematic reviews referenced tools. Criteria for the adequacy of individual properties and measures varied, but mainly followed standards for patient-reported outcome measures or The Standards of Educational and Psychological Testing. Two hundred and four unique measures were identified across 10 reviews. One review explicitly recommended measures for occupational therapists, and four reviews identified adequate measures for all health care professionals (n = 3) and medical students (n = 1). The 27 measures deemed adequate by these five systematic reviews are described. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest a need to improve the overall methodological quality and reporting of systematic reviews on evidence-based practice measures to increase the trustworthiness of recommendations and allow comprehensive interpretation by end-users. Risk of bias is common to all the included systematic reviews as the quality of primary studies was not assessed. The diversity of tools and approaches used to evaluate the adequacy of evidence-based practice measures reflects tensions regarding the conceptualization of validity, suggesting a need to reflect on the most appropriate application of validity theory to evidence-based practice measures.

The developed theoretical model identifies the impacts of the perception of financial risk and financial anxiety on financial well-being.

A survey was carried out on 1,222 Brazilians with structural equation modeling and multi-group invariance tests. The results indicate that lower financial well-being is influenced by the level of financial anxiety and financial risk. Public servants perceive fewer losses in financial well-being, anxiety and risks than other professions. In the pandemic context, where the risks of unemployment and loss of income are increased, job stability works like an insurance, allowing public servants greater financial security and then minor losses of financial well-being. Evidence indicates that in countries where a large percentage of workers have temporary or informal jobs, the challenge of reducing the financial impacts of the pandemic will be great. Interventions to alleviating anxiety and public policies of income transfer and reduction of unemployment are instruments to reduce the loss of financial well-being.","output":"Loss of financial well-being in the COVID-19 pandemic: Does job stability make a difference?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The reported prevalence of Alport syndrome varies from one in 5000 to one in 53,000 individuals. This study estimated the frequencies of predicted pathogenic COL4A3-COL4A5 variants in sequencing databases of populations without known kidney disease. METHODS: Predicted pathogenic variants were identified using filtering steps based on the ACMG/AMP criteria, which considered collagen IV &#945;3-&#945;5 position 1 Gly to be critical domains. The population frequencies of predicted pathogenic COL4A3-COL4A5 variants were then determined per mean number of sequenced alleles. Population frequencies for compound heterozygous and digenic combinations were calculated from the results for heterozygous variants. RESULTS: COL4A3-COL4A5 variants resulting in position 1 Gly substitutions were confirmed to be associated with hematuria (for each, P<0.001). Predicted pathogenic COL4A5 variants were found in at least one in 2320 individuals. p.(Gly624Asp) represented nearly half (16 of 33, 48%) of the variants in Europeans. Most COL4A5 variants (54 of 59, 92%) had a biochemical feature that potentially mitigated the clinical effect. The predicted pathogenic heterozygous COL4A3 and COL4A4 variants affected one in 106 of the population, consistent with the finding of thin basement membrane nephropathy in normal donor kidney biopsy specimens. Predicted pathogenic compound heterozygous variants occurred in one in 88,866 individuals, and digenic variants in at least one in 44,793. CONCLUSIONS: The population frequencies for Alport syndrome are suggested by the frequencies of predicted pathogenic COL4A3-COL4A5 variants, but must be adjusted for the disease penetrance of individual variants and for the likelihood of already diagnosed disease and non-Gly substitutions.

We obtained a nasopharyngeal and two saliva specimens (collected by spitting or oral swabbing) from more than 2500 individuals. All samples were tested by RT-qPCR detecting RNA of SARS-CoV-2. We compared the test sensitivity on the two saliva collections with the nasopharyngeal specimen for all subjects and stratified by symptom status and viral load. Of the 2850 patients for which all three samples were available, 105 were positive on NP, whereas 32 and 23 were also positive on saliva spitting and saliva swabbing samples, respectively.

We investigated the attack-inducing effects of PACAP38 and vasoactive intestinal peptide in cluster headache, hypothesising that PACAP38, but not vasoactive intestinal peptide, would induce cluster-like attacks in episodic active phase and chronic cluster headache patients. METHODS: In a double-blind crossover study, 14 episodic cluster headache patients in active phase, 15 episodic cluster headache patients in remission phase and 15 chronic cluster headache patients were randomly allocated to receive intravenous infusion of PACAP38 (10 pmol/kg/min) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (8 pmol/kg/min) over 20 min on two study days separated by at least 7 days. We recorded headache intensity, incidence of cluster-like attacks, cranial autonomic symptoms and vital signs using a questionnaire (0-90 min). RESULTS: In episodic cluster headache active phase, PACAP38 induced cluster-like attacks in 6/14 patients and vasoactive intestinal peptide induced cluster-like attacks in 5/14 patients (p = 1.000).

Children and Young people (CYP) are less likely to have severe symptoms from acute COVID-19 infections, but they are more prone to possible several adverse mental health outcomes. Social isolation (eg, marital status, number of close friends and relatives, religious or other group affiliations) is known to be a major cause of stress and risk factor for cardiovascular disease including elevated Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart rates (HR).ObjectivesThis study aimed to analyse the effect of the UK pandemic national lockdown on the cardiovascular health (CVH) of CYP with ADHD regularly followed up in a North West England Community Child Health Clinic. We compared the BP and HR measurements for the CYP before and after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (CPL) to assess its effects on their CVH.MethodsThe CVH of 57 CYP with ADHD was prospectively studied during their clinic reviews, before and after the official commencement of the national UK lockdown on the 26th March 2020. Pre-Hypertension (PreHT)/Elevate BP (EBP) and Hypertension (HT) were defined using both the Great Britain reference charts (between 91st and 98th centile or above 98th centile for age) and the US-based recommendations (between 90th and 95th centile or above 95 percentile for gender, age and height) respectively. The centiles for HR measurements were derived from the published reference data from existing international studies of normal children. Student paired T-test was used for comparison of pre/post CPL BP/HR data.ResultsThe clinical characteristics of CYP seen before and after the CPL were similar in terms of average age, number of co-morbidities, use of medications and gender distribution.The HR, diastolic and systolic BP of all the CYP with ADHD significantly increased during the CPL (p<0.001). There was two- to four-fold increase in the number of the CYP with HT, PreHT/EBP measured after the CPL (figure 1). Diastolic BP elevation accounted for 89% to 100% of the abnormal BP measurements. This increase in measured BP and HR could not be attributed to any prescribed ADHD medications as the patients had been on the same medications and unchanged dosage for an average of more than 16 months, all within the lower range of normal doses.There was statistically significant correlation between the elevated systolic and diastolic BP, and the number of weeks from the inception of the CPL.All the CYP with elevated BP are being closely monitored in the clinic and at home. The elevated BP measurements have gradually resolved as the lockdown was eased and no long-term negative consequences have been observed.ConclusionsWe conclude that the CPL was associated with transient and reversible increase in the BP and HR of CYP with background diagnosis of ADHD and other co-morbid neurodevelopmental disorders.

Method A working group was formed to develop the Skills test, and in May 2019, the test was delivered face-to-face, implementing 5 cycles of 8 stations over 3 days. The same group adapted the test for online delivery, and in August 2020, 3 cycles of 8 stations were delivered. Feedback was collected, with adaptations made for a second Skills Test in December 2020. Result 96.4% of trainees rated their overall experience and the test organisation in the 2019 test as excellent or good (82.1% and 85.7 excellent, respectively). 93.5% of examiners rated their overall experience and the test organisation as excellent or good (45.1% excellent for both). In the August test, 95.8% of trainees rated their overall experience as excellent or good (58.3% excellent). 100% of trainees rated the test organisation and the online format as excellent or good (70.8% and 50% excellent, respectively). Although 100% of examiners rated the overall experience, the test organisation and online format as excellent or good, some felt the stations were not long enough to allow for technical issues. In the December test, higher proportions of trainees rated the overall experience (80%), organisation of the test (80%) and online format (70%) as excellent. Conclusion The virtual test is shown to be a viable and successful alternative to the face-to-face test in preparing trainees for their CASC, and trainees felt it was excellent preparation for the new online CASC format. It had some clear advantages, such as saving on consumables, reducing the financial costs of running the test, improving the test quality, and increasing the trainee uptake. It is more eco-friendly and reduces fuel emission, raising the question of how the test should be delivered after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Virtual clinical examinations: are they the new normal'?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, remote work styles have become the norm However, these work settings introduce new intricacies in worker behaviors The overlap between work and home can disrupt performance The lack of social interaction can affect motivation This elicits a need to implement novel methods to evaluate and enhance remote worker functioning The potential to unobtrusively and automatically assess such workers can be fulfilled by social media and ubiquitous technologies This paper situates recent research in the new context by extending our insights for increased remote interaction and online presence We present implications for proactive assessment of remote workers by understanding day-level activities, coordination, role awareness, and organizational culture Additionally, we discuss the ethics of privacy-preserving deployment, employer surveillance, and digital inequity This paper aims to inspire pervasive technologies for the new future of work ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Social media and ubiquitous technologies for remote worker wellbeing and productivity in a post-pandemic world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has created shortages of personal protective equipment. In resource-constrained situations, limited cycles of disinfection and extended use of gloves is recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conserve supplies. However, these guidelines are based on limited evidence. In this study, serial cycles of hand hygiene were performed on gloved hands using an ethanol-based hand rub (six and ten cycles), 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution (ten cycles), or soap and water (ten cycles) on latex and nitrile medical exam gloves from the United States and India. A modified water-leak test evaluated glove integrity after repeated applications of these disinfecting agents. When aggregated, dilute bleach demonstrated the lowest difference between treatment and control arms: -2.5 percentage points (95% CI: -5.3 to 0.3) for nitrile, 0.6 percentage points (95% CI: -2.6 to 3.8) for non-powdered latex. For U.S.-purchased gloves tested with six and ten applications of ethanol-based hand rub, the mean difference in failure risk between treatment and control gloves was within the prespecified non-inferiority margin of five percentage points or less, though some findings were inconclusive since outside the margin. The aggregated difference in failure risk between treatment and control was 3.5 percentage points (0.6 to 6.4) for soap and water, and 2.3 percentage points (-0.5 to 5.0) and 5.0 percentage points (1.8 to 8.2) for 10 and 6 applications of ethanol-based hand rub, respectively. Most leaks occurred in the interdigital webs (35%) and on the fingers (34%). This indicates that some combinations of glove types and disinfection methods may allow for extended use. Ten applications of dilute bleach solution had the least impact on glove integrity. However, the majority of glove and exposure combinations were inconclusive. Additional testing of specific glove and disinfectant combinations may inform future strategies to guide extended use during glove shortages. Additional considerations, not evaluated here, include duration of use, disinfectant chemical permeation, and the effects of hand temperature, movement, and manipulation of instruments on glove integrity.","output":"Evaluation of the effects of repeated disinfection on medical exam gloves: Part 1.

This is a work in which social and labor sciences recognize the principle role of emotions. However, the models and narratives of emotions that drive research, design, and deployment of service robots in humanCrobot interaction differ considerably from how emotions are framed in the sociology of labor and feminist studies of service work. In this paper, we explore these tensions through the concepts of affective and emotional labor, and outline key insights these concepts offer for the design and evaluation of professional service robots. Taken together, an emphasis on interactionist approaches to emotions and on the demands of affective labor, leads us to argue that service employees are under-represented in existing studies in humanCrobot interaction. To address this, we outline how participatory design and value-sensitive design approaches can be applied as complimentary methodological frameworks that include service employees as vital stakeholders.","output":"Service robots for affective labor: a sociology of labor perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope spike (S) glycoprotein is responsible for the fusion between the membranes of the virus and the target cell. In the case of the S2 domain of protein S, it has been found a highly hydrophobic and interfacial domain flanked by the heptad repeat 1 and 2 regions; significantly, different peptides pertaining to this domain have shown a significant leakage effect and an important plaque formation inhibition, which, similarly to HIV-1 gp41, support the role of this region in the fusion process. Therefore, we have carried out a study of the binding and interaction with model membranes of a peptide corresponding to segment 1073C1095 of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, peptide SARS(L) in the presence of different membrane model systems, as well as the structural changes taking place in both the lipid and the peptide induced by the binding of the peptide to the membrane. Our results show that SARS(L) strongly partitions into phospholipid membranes and organizes differently in lipid environments, displaying membrane activity modulated by the lipid composition of the membrane. These data would support its role in SARS-CoV mediated membrane fusion and suggest that the region where this peptide resides could be involved in the merging of the viral and target cell membranes.","output":"Interaction of a peptide corresponding to the loop domain of the S2 SARS-CoV virus protein with model membranes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Following the emergency caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, there is the need, among other measures, to modify urban mobility plans in order to reduce the use of collective public transport, reducing the crowding of people while also preventing traffic congestion through discouraging the use of private vehicles. From this perspective, retail companies operating within cities must also reorganize themselves, considering both the unpredictable requirements of environmental sustainability and the new mobility needs calling for the promotion of bicycles and electric scooters. In this context, we deal with the need to determine minimum cost routes in urban areas for delivering orders placed through e-channels. More precisely, we face a variant of the green vehicle routing problem of heterogeneous fleets, in which the objective function includes environmental impact cost components that differ by vehicle type. Moreover, as a novel issue, attention must be paid to avoid crossing and passing close to bicycle lanes;therefore, penalties are associated with the transit of vehicles near bicycle lanes. To address this problem, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model and a matheuristic associated with it. The proposed approach is then used to analyze different scenarios derived from the transportation network of the city of Milan, Italy. Milan is one of the smartest cities in Europe from the mobility point of view but also one of the most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, and the municipality is making a big investment to promote the use of bicycles.","output":"Grocery distribution plans in urban networks with street crossing penalties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many sports physicians are from primary care backgrounds around the world but not in Japan.

Ct values were (i) adjusted by centering each value around the institutional median Ct value from symptomatic children tested with that assay and (ii) converted to estimated VL (numbers of copies per milliliter) using internal or manufacturer data. Adjusted Ct values and estimated VL for asymptomatic versus symptomatic children (118 asymptomatic versus 197 symptomatic children aged 0 to 4 years, 79 asymptomatic versus 97 symptomatic children aged 5 to 9 years, 69 asymptomatic versus 75 symptomatic children aged 10 to 13 years, 73 asymptomatic versus 109 symptomatic children aged 14 to 17 years) were compared. The median adjusted Ct value for asymptomatic children was 10.3 cycles higher than for symptomatic children (P < 0.0001), and VL were 3 to 4 logs lower than for symptomatic children (P < 0.0001); differences were consistent (P < 0.0001) across all four age brackets.

Dogs are often housed in close quarters with others of unknown vaccine histories, and experience high levels of sustained stress. As a result, Canine Infection Respiratory Disease (CIRD) is often prevalent and difficult to control. The aims of this study were to (1) identify specific pathogens responsible for CIRD in a city shelter in West Texas, USA, and (2) determine whether intake vaccinations decrease proportion of dogs exhibiting signs of CIRD even during an outbreak. A laboratory analysis of conjunctival, pharyngeal, and nasal swabs (n = 15 dogs) and fecal samples (n = 6 kennels) showed prevalence of various CIRD pathogens (e.g., canine adenovirus-2, canine parainfluenza virus, canine distemper virus). All fifteen dogs tested positive for at least one pathogen, with the most prevalent pathogen being Canine Distemper Virus (CDV; n = 12). All of the kennels (n=6) tested positive for Canine Distemper Virus. Health data on dogs (n = 1,258) over the age of 6 weeks were assessed from May to August 2017. Beginning in July, both stray and owner-surrendered dogs were vaccinated with Nobivac(?) Canine 1-DAPPv 5 Way and Nobivac(?) Intra-Trac(?) 3 upon intake, which differed from the previous policy. For each day in the study, we calculated the proportion of dogs in each nasal discharge category, the proportion of dogs observed coughing, and the mean fecal score across all dogs. We conducted a linear regression between the proportion of the shelter vaccinated and the proportion of dogs coughing. At the beginning of the vaccination phase, ~25% of the dogs were coughing. However, as the proportion of the dogs vaccinated increased, the proportion of dogs coughing decreased. There was a significant decrease of 7% of the proportion of dogs coughing when vaccination was at least at 90% compared to when it was <90%. These data suggest that the shelter in this study was experiencing a CIRD outbreak, with CDV being primary pathogen, and that it is possible to substantially reduce illness by implementing a vaccination on intake protocol.

METHODS A Single-center observational prospective study on ICU invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was the clinical improvement at day 28. A Bayesian framework was employed and all analyses were adjusted for confounders. RESULTS Sixty-one consecutive invasively ventilated patients were included, nine (14?7%) received tocilizumab and 15 (24?6%) received anakinra.

Based on theme and sample analysis, it is shown that the main concerns of the enterprise cyber governance discourse in the covid-19 era contain data breaches, information security, products and services, customers' privacy and cyber espionage, and enterprises utilize a series of discursive strategies to (re)contextualize the linguistic realization. Combined with Halliday's sociosemiotic theory, certain discursive practices are further explained in the social semiotic system as a whole, including the tenor, field and mode under the context of covid-19 epidemic.

DS can be a useful and low-cost way of monitoring childrens health status. STUDY DESIGN: Fifty children were classified into clusters based in DS measured by pedometer: Sedentary Group (DS = 9338  902 steps) and Active Group (DS = 13,614  1003 steps). Plasma and lymphocytes were isolated and cultured to evaluate cytokine production. RESULTS: Sedentary group presented lower adiponectin (7573  232 pg/mL), higher leptin (16,250  1825 pg/mL) plasma concentration, and higher lymphocyte production of IL-17, IFN-gamma, TNF-, IL-2 in relation to active group, suggesting predominance of Th1 response. Otherwise, the active group presented higher lymphocyte supernatant concentration of IL-10 and higher regulatory T cell (Treg) percentage. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that lymphocytes of children performing higher DS have an anti-inflammatory profile, especially of Treg.

Such projects can help people relieve stress, even during the COVID-19 pandemic;improve their physical and mental health;and enhance their environmental awareness. However, due to poor traffic flow, a low space utilization rate, and inflexible management practices, visiting these environments has posed a risk of infection. As a result, most respondents indicated that the leisure benefits of green fields are limited and not helpful for improving their physical and mental health or having fun. Additionally, survey responses by people from different backgrounds (p < 0.01) varied. Therefore, we believe that by providing a safe living environment, strengthening disaster prevention skills and cooperation against epidemics, reducing accident risks, improving leisure safety and fluency, and planning diverse leisure activities, we can improve people's perception of environmental experiences, promote leisure participation, improve leisure satisfaction, and enhance well-being.","output":"A Study of the Impact of River Improvement and Greening on Public Reassurance and the Urban Well-Being Index during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The built environment plays a key role in promoting active mobility for healthy aging. Encouraging active mobility among older adults, however, can be especially challenging in more rural areas where distances tend to be longer and infrastructure is favoring car traffic. The association of older adults perception of attributes of the built environment with cycling and e-biking for transport was investigated. The potential moderating effects of age, sex, and mobility impairments were explored. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in towns and communities of <100,000 inhabitants, including 2,144 participants (mean age: 74; 53% men). Three different cycling outcomes (any cycling/e-biking, frequency (3 days/week) and amount (minutes/week)) were analyzed among all cyclists and e-bike users separately, resulting in six dependent variables. The impact of ten environmental attributes on these outcomes was analyzed in separate models. Overall, street connectivity, and the proximity and number of destinations were most important. Only street connectivity and traffic safety were related to minutes cycling or e-biking per week. Cycling amount was higher overall for e-biking but fewer environmental attributes showed an association compared to any cycling, regardless of bicycle type. Traffic safety was not associated with four out of the six cycling outcomes and was inversely associated with minutes cycling or e-biking. Density was not related to any of the variables investigated. Several interaction effects of sex, age, and mobility impairments were found. Further research is needed on environmental attributes influencing e-bike use, the most important types of destinations, and a more differentiated assessment of perceived traffic safety in older adults.","output":"The relationship between perceived built environment and cycling or e-biking for transport among older adultsCa cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the changes in concentrations of haloacetic acids (HAAs) and haloacetonitriles (HANs) as disinfection byproducts (DBPs) for different storage times (as long as 20 days) and temperatures (5 to 20C).

We studied the longitudinal association of working from home during the pandemic with physical activity and sedentary behavior. Methods: Longitudinal data from 17 questionnaire rounds of the Lifelines COVID-19 cohort (March 2020-February 2021) were used. In total, 33,325 workers were included. In every round, participants reported their current work situation: location, home, or hybrid (working on location & from home). Physical activity levels and sedentary behavior before and during the pandemic were asked. Logistic Generalized Estimating Equations were used for analysis. Approval was obtained by the ethics committee of the University Medical Center Groningen. Results: Home workers were less likely to meet the recommended 150 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity activity during the pandemic than location workers (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.90-0.96) and more likely to be less physically active than before the pandemic (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04-1.14). Furthermore, home and hybrid workers were more likely to be more sedentary on workdays during than before the pandemic (OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.39-1.64/1.36-1.68, respectively). Conclusions: Compared to location workers, home workers (and to a lesser extent hybrid workers) were more often physically inactive and sedentary during than before the pandemic.

METHODS AND MATERIALS The main inclusion criteria were: NSCC in remission, grade 2 cutaneous and subcutaneous neck RIF (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0), and no current treatment with statins or fibrates. Patients received pravastatin 40 mg/d for 12 months. The primary endpoint was reduction of RIF thickness by more than 30% at 12 months, as measured by cutaneous high-frequency ultrasonography. Secondary endpoints included RIF severity reduction, pravastatin tolerance, and quality of life. RESULTS Sixty patients with grade 2 (n = 37), grade 3 (n = 22), or grade 4 (n = 1) RIF were enrolled from February 2011 to April 2016. The mean interval between RIF diagnosis and pravastatin initiation was 17.1 months. Pravastatin was stopped before 11 months of treatment in 18 patients (because of grade 2 adverse events related to pravastatin in 8 patients [13%]). In the 40 patients in whom pravastatin efficacy was assessed by high-frequency ultrasonography at baseline and at 12 months of treatment, a reduction of RIF thickness 30% was observed in 15 of 42 patients (35.7%; 95% confidence interval, 21.6%-52.0%). At the 12-month clinical evaluation, RIF severity was decreased in 50% of patients (n = 21; 95% confidence interval, 34.2%-65.8%), and the patients' self-perception, mood state, and social functioning were significantly improved. Pravastatin was well tolerated, with a very low occurrence of grade 3 toxicities (myalgia, n = 1) and grade 2 toxicities (myalgia/arthralgia or esophagitis, n = 3). CONCLUSIONS This phase 2 prospective study supports the notion of radioinduced fibrosis reversibility. It showed that pravastatin (40 mg/d for 12 months) is an efficient antifibrotic agent in patients with grade 2 cutaneous and subcutaneous fibrosis after HNSCC radiation therapy.","output":"Pravastatin Reverses Established Radiation-Induced Cutaneous and Subcutaneous Fibrosis in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer: Results of the Biology-Driven Phase 2 Clinical Trial Pravacur."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNase2, also named the Eosinophil derived Neurotoxin (EDN), is one of the main proteins secreted by the eosinophil secondary granules. RNase2 is also expressed in other leukocyte cells and is the member of the human ribonuclease A family most abundant in macrophages. The protein is endowed with a high ribonucleolytic activity and participates in the host antiviral activity. Although RNase2 displays a broad antiviral activity, it is mostly associated to the targeting of single stranded RNA viruses. To explore RNase2 mechanism of action in antiviral host defence we knocked out RNase2 expression in the THP1 monocyte cell line and characterized the cell response to human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). We observed that RSV infection induced the RNase2 expression and protein secretion in THP1 macrophage-derived cells, whereas the knockout (KO) of RNase2 resulted in higher RSV burden and reduced cell viability. Next, by means of the cP-RNAseq methodology, which uniquely amplifies the RNA 23cyclic-phosphate-end products released by an endonuclease cleavage, we compared the ncRNA population in native and RNase2-KO cell lines. Among the ncRNAs accumulated in WT versus KO cells, we found mostly tRNA-derived fragments and secondly miRNAs. Analysis of the differential sequence coverage of tRNAs molecules in native and KO cells identified fragments derived from only few parental tRNAs, revealing a predominant cleavage at anticodon loops and secondarily at D-loops. Inspection of cleavage region identified U/C and A, at 5 and 3 sides of cleavage sites respectively (namely RNase B1 and B2 base binding subsites). Likewise, only few selected miRNAs were significantly more abundant in WT versus RNase2-KO cells, with cleavage sites located at the end of stem regions with predominance for pyrimidines at B1 but following an overall less defined nucleotide specificity. Complementarily, by screening of a tRF&tiRNA PCR array we identified an enriched population of tRNA-derived fragments associated to RNase2 expression and RSV infection. The present results confirm the contribution of the protein in macrophage response against virus infection and provide the first evidence of its cleavage selectivity against ncRNA population. A better understanding of the mechanism of action of RNase2 recognition of cellular RNA during the antiviral host defence should pave the basis for the design of novel antiviral drugs.","output":"Selective cleavage of ncRNA and antiviral activity by human RNase2/EDN in a macrophage infection model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a single-stranded RNA virus that has threatened the lives of humans all over the globe.

The time scale of spreading (i.e., serial interval) and magnitude of spreading (i.e., Rt or reproduction number) for COVID-19, were observed to be heterogenous by demographic characteristics, region and time period. In this study, we examined the COVID-19 transmission in the state of Georgia, United States. Methods During February 1-July 13, 2020, we identified 4080 transmission pairs using contact information from reports of COVID-19 cases from the Georgia Department of Public Health. We examined how various transmission characteristics were affected by disease symptoms, demographics (age, gender, and race), and time period (during shelter-in-place and after reopening). In addition, we estimated the time course of reproduction numbers during early February-mid-June for all 159 counties in the state of Georgia, using a total of 118,491 reported COVID-19 cases. Findings Over this period, the serial interval appeared to decrease from 5.97 days in February-April to 4.40 days in June-July. With regard to age, transmission was assortative and patterns of transmission changed over time. COVID-19 mainly spread from adults to all age groups; transmission among and between children and the elderly was found less frequently. Younger adults (20-50 years old) were involved in the majority of transmissions occurring during or after reopening subsequent to the shelter-in-place period. By mid-July, two waves of COVID-19 transmission were apparent, separated by the shelter-in-place period in the state of Georgia. Counties around major cities and along interstate highways had more intense transmission. Interpretation The transmission of COVID-19 in the state of Georgia had been heterogeneous by area and changed over time. The shelter-in-place was not long enough to sufficiently suppress COVID-19 transmission in densely populated urban areas connected by major transportation links. Studying local transmission patterns may help in predicting and guiding states in prevention and control of COVID-19 according to population and region.

The questionnaire consists of four questions to assess compliance and eighteen questions to explore factors that may be related to their compliance. This study used the Chi-square test to differentiate the level of compliance between two groups and binary logistic regression to analyze factors that may influence the compliance. Most participants in this study were female (84.8%), with a median age of 33 (23 - 57) years. More than 80 % of participants worked in the non-covid ward. Only one-fifth of participants had work experience of more than 15 years. The compliance with personal protective equipment was 67.3%. From univariate analysis, factors that influenced the compliance were difficulty using, removing, and disposing of personal protective equipment, lack of training and regular monitoring, unsure feeling about the effectiveness of personal protective equipment, discomfort in donning personal protective equipment. Co-workers never reminding themselves to use personal protective equipment also influenced compliance. From multivariate analysis, the difficulty in using, removing, and disposing of personal protective equipment (OR 2.83 (0.730 - 3.478), p=0.025) significantly influenced compliance with personal protective equipment use.","output":"Compliance with Personal Protective Equipment Use among Non-Medical Healthcare Professionals during Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the scientific community has explored determinants of Covid 19 disease severity. However, the majority of studies are based on in-hospital patients with high risk of collider- or selection bias.

The observation period lasted between March 1 to December 31, 2020. Hazard ratios (HR) for risk factors of Covid-19 disease severity were assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. In total, 3322 deaths, 11,508 hospitalizations and 1423 ICU-admissions related to Covid-19 occurred during the study period. Kidney failure, diabetes and obesity increased risk of mortality and so did heart failure and ischemic heart disease. However, atrial fibrillation and hypertension did not. Risk of hospitalization follow a similar pattern, whereas admission to intensive care differs; triage processes where clearly present as certain co-morbid conditions were associated with lower ICU admission. Observed differences in risk of mortality and hospitalization among patients with Covid 19 raise important questions about potentially protective comedication which will be further addressed using the real-time Covid-19 monitoring framework.

Chan School of Public Health and the Human Vaccines Project (HVP), focuses on studying immunity and the predictability of immuneresponsiveness to vaccines in aging populations. This paper describes the hypotheses and methodological approaches of this new collaborative initiative. Central to our thinking is the idea that predictors of age-related non-communicable diseases are the same as predictors for infectious diseases like COVID-19 and influenza. Fundamental to our approach is to differentiate between chronological, biological and immune age, and to use existing large-scale population cohorts. The latter provide well-typed phenotypic data on individuals health status over time, readouts of routine clinical biochemical biomarkers to determine biological age, and bio-banked plasma samples to deep phenotype humoral immune responses as biomarkers of immune age. The first phase of the program involves 1. the exploration of biological age, humoral biomarkers of immune age, and genetics in a large multigenerational cohort, and 2. the subsequent development of models of immunity in relation to health status in a second, prospective cohort of an aging population. In the second phase, vaccine responses and efficacy of licensed COVID-19 vaccines in the presence and absence of influenza-, pneumococcal- and pertussis vaccines routinely offered to elderly, will be studied in older aged participants of prospective population-based cohorts in different geographical locations who will be selected for representing distinct biological and immune ages.

An extended description of each of the network modules is therefore a critical step to understand the underlying processes contributing to a disease or a phenotype. Biological integration, topology study and conditions comparison (e.g. wild vs mutant) are the main methods to do so, but to date no tool combines them all into a single pipeline. RESULTS Here we present GWENA, a new R package that integrates gene co-expression network construction and whole characterization of the detected modules through gene set enrichment, phenotypic association, hub genes detection, topological metric computation, and differential co-expression. To demonstrate its performance, we applied GWENA on two skeletal muscle datasets from young and old patients of GTEx study. Remarkably, we prioritized a gene whose involvement was unknown in the muscle development and growth. Moreover, new insights on the variations in patterns of co-expression were identified. The known phenomena of connectivity loss associated with aging was found coupled to a global reorganization of the relationships leading to expression of known aging related functions. CONCLUSION GWENA is an R package available through Bioconductor ( https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GWENA.html ) that has been developed to perform extended analysis of gene co-expression networks. Thanks to biological and topological information as well as differential co-expression, the package helps to dissect the role of genes relationships in diseases conditions or targeted phenotypes. GWENA goes beyond existing packages that perform co-expression analysis by including new tools to fully characterize modules, such as differential co-expression, additional enrichment databases, and network visualization.","output":"GWENA: gene co-expression networks analysis and extended modules characterization in a single Bioconductor package."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By their nature, the impact of epidemics on mortality varies geographically, suggesting that the geographical impact of an epidemic implies a social impact. To examine the association between two measures of the social composition of a local area and age- and sex-standardised Covid-19 and other mortality in the period 1 March to 31 July 2020. The measures are how deprived an area is and what proportion of its population is non-white. Using spatial autoregressive regression we analyse geographical variation in age- and sex-standardised Covid-19 mortality among English local authorities between 1 March and 31 July 2020 in relation to measures of social composition, and we compare it with mortality from non-Covid sources in the same period, and with all-causes mortality in 2018. Areas with higher social deprivation have a higher Covid-19 mortality rate, but the association is much weaker than between social deprivation and mortality rates more generally. An area's proportion non-white has a strong positive association with Covid19 mortality, in contrast to a negative association with 2020 non-Covid and with 2018 mortality. Covid-19 mortality is related to the social composition of areas in different ways than current non-Covid mortality or past mortality.

The assay integrates Si-OH magnetic beads (MBs)-based fast RNA extraction and rapid isothermal amplification in a single tube, thus bypassing the RNA elution step and directly amplifying on-beads RNA molecules with the visualized results. This one-tube assay has a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 200 copies/mL for sample input volumes of up to 600 L, and can be performed in less than 1 hour from sample collection to result readout. This assay demonstrated an 100% concordance with the gold standard test RT-qPCR test by using 29 clinical specimens and showed high specificity.

Herein we describe the rapid implementation and sequential process improvement (PI) of a centralized telehospitalist service to coordinate and optimize management of large number of COVID-19 patients in a tertiary and quaternary care hospital very close to the New York City epicenter. Methods: Prospective multidisciplinary PI meetings were held weekly between March 23 and May 10, 2020, and consensus service modifications were implemented for the following week. Inpatient census data, telehospitalist intervention volumes, and service utilization statistics were collected. Results/Discussion: Between March 23 and May 10, 2020, a total of 745 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the general medical wards. The telehospitalist service performed 1,136 audiovisual (AV) patient assessments, 379 best practice interventions, cohorted 108 patients, and conducted 170 remote family conversations. During the consecutive PI cycles, a number of adaptations in AV setup, care standardization, patient logistics, communication, and consultative functions were made to load balance the bedside hospitalist teams. As the COVID-19 hospital census increased to peak levels, the most value was added through facilitation of communication and collaboration between the bedside clinical teams, the infection prevention and control teams, and patient logistics team.

Herein, we showed that the protease inhibitor aprotinin (but not the protease inhibitor SERPINA1/alpha-1 antitrypsin) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in therapeutically achievable concentrations. An analysis of proteomics and translatome data indicated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is associated with a downregulation of host cell protease inhibitors. Hence, aprotinin may compensate for downregulated host cell proteases during later virus replication cycles. Aprotinin displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in different cell types (Caco2, Calu-3, and primary bronchial epithelial cell airCliquid interface cultures) and against four virus isolates.

Comparing the safety profile of mRNA vaccinated individuals with otherwise vaccinated individuals would enable a more relevant assessment for the safety of mRNA vaccination.

Typically, this type of intervention is imposed when an epidemiological indicator in a given population exceeds a certain threshold. Then, the nonpharmaceutical intervention is lifted when the levels of the indicator used have decreased sufficiently. What is the best indicator to use? In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework to try to answer this question. More specifically, the proposed framework permits to assess and compare different event-triggered controls based on epidemiological indicators. Our methodology consists of considering some outcomes that are consequences of the nonpharmaceutical interventions that a decision maker aims to make as low as possible. The peak demand for intensive care units (ICU) and the total number of days in lockdown are examples of such outcomes. If an epidemiological indicator is used to trigger the interventions, there is naturally a trade-off between the outcomes that can be seen as a curve parameterized by the trigger threshold to be used. The computation of these curves for a group of indicators then allows the selection of the best indicator the curve of which dominates the curves of the other indicators. This methodology is illustrated using indicators in the context of COVID-19 using deterministic compartmental models in discrete-time, although the framework can be adapted for a larger class of models.","output":"Assessment of event-triggered policies of nonpharmaceutical interventions based on epidemiological indicators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The bidirectional association between the circadian system and innate-adaptive immune functions has been highlighted in many investigations Viruses are a submicroscopic infectious agent that activate the immune system after entering the human host cell A novel virus, socalled Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has recently emerged, is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Previous investigations show that the factors that are strongly controlled by circadian rhythms, such as clock genes and melatonin, modulate the immune response and may, therefore, influence the healing processes of COVID-19 Moreover, the mechanism of COVID-19 shows that some host cell factors, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme, exhibit daily rhythms In this review, we explore key findings that show a link between circadian rhythms and viral infection The results of these findings could be helpful for clinical and preclinical studies to discover a useful and highly effective treatment for eradicating the COVID-19 disease","output":"Review Paper: Paying attention to circadian rhythms in the treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leptospira is a global pathogen of emerging public health importance in both developing and industrialized nations and can infect almost all mammalian species, including humans.

As the immunogenicity of peptide epitopes is dependent on their binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, the prediction of binding affinity is a prerequisite to the reliable prediction of epitopes. The iterative self-consistent (ISC) partial-least-squares (PLS)-based additive method is a recently developed bioinformatic approach for predicting class II peptide-MHC binding affinity. The ISC-PLS method overcomes many of the conceptual difficulties inherent in the prediction of class II peptide-MHC affinity, such as the binding of a mixed population of peptide lengths due to the open-ended class II binding site. The method has applications in both the accurate prediction of class II epitopes and the manipulation of affinity for heteroclitic and competitor peptides. The method is applied here to six class II mouse alleles (I-Ab, I-Ad, I-Ak, I-As, I-Ed, and I-Ek) and included peptides up to 25 amino acids in length. A series of regression equations highlighting the quantitative contributions of individual amino acids at each peptide position was established. The initial model for each allele exhibited only moderate predictivity. Once the set of selected peptide subsequences had converged, the final models exhibited a satisfactory predictive power. Convergence was reached between the 4th and 17th iterations, and the leave-one-out cross-validation statistical terms--q2, SEP, and NC--ranged between 0.732 and 0.925, 0.418 and 0.816, and 1 and 6, respectively.

As part of the global effort to find safe and effective antiviral therapies for Covid-19, we assessed the in vitro activity of the FDA-approved -glucosidase inhibitor miglustat against SARS-CoV-2. Expression plasmids encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and human ACE2 glycoproteins (GP) were tested to evaluate N-glycan modifications induced by -glucosidase inhibition. Immunoprecipitation was used to assess binding between these two GP. Cell-to-cell fusion was assessed by immunofluorescence of cocultures of SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2-expressing cells. Miglustat effect on immune response was tested by measuring cytokine release from PBMC exposed to purified SARS-CoV-2 S. In our overexpression system, miglustat successfully and specifically modified N-glycans in both SARS-CoV-2 S and its main receptor ACE2. Binding between these two GP was not affected by glycan modifications. A surrogate marker for viral cytopathic effect, measured as receptor-dependent SARS-CoV-2 S-driven cell-to-cell fusion, was not disrupted by miglustat treatment. This observation was further confirmed in MOGS-null transfected cells. Miglustat produced no statistically significant effects on cytokine production following SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein stimulation of PBMC.

Target trial emulation emphasizes the need to carefully design a nonexperimental study in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, covariates, exposure definition, and outcome measurement-and the timing of those variables. We argue that policy evaluations using group-level longitudinal (\\"panel\\") data need to take a similar careful approach to study design that we refer to as policy trial emulation. This approach is especially important when intervention timing varies across jurisdictions; the main idea is to construct target trials separately for each treatment cohort (states that implement the policy at the same time) and then aggregate.

Based on NEWS score, we stratified patients as A: low B: medium, and C: high clinical severity and obtained pharmacotherapy data. Chest-CT-severity-score (CTSS) was used. We defined clinical cure as resolution of symptoms and biomarkers and virologic cure as a PCR above 35 cycles(Ct). Results: We recorded 21 COVID-19 pneumonia patients of whom 19 opted for treatment. Clinical symptoms and laboratory markers at presentation did not significantly correlate with severity. Lower initial viral load significantly correlated with lower levels of clinical and radiological severity (p=0.038). Virologic cure, Ct>35, by day 10, was only 33% in high severity significantly less than categories A and B. We observed 100% clinical cure at day 10 in Category-A, 67% in B, and 33% in C(p<0.05).

The working conditions in isolation could cause gaps or barriers in communication, fatigue and poor documentation of provided care. The available technology has several advantages including: a) facilitating appropriate paperless documentation and communication between all healthcare givers working in isolation rooms or large isolation areas; b) testing patients and staff at the bedside using smart point of care diagnostics (SPOCD) to confirm COVID-19 infection; c) allowing diagnostics and treatment at the bedside through point of care ultrasound (POCUS) and Thromboelastography (TEG); d) adapting the use of anaesthetic machines and the use of volatile anaesthetics. Implementing technologies for safeguarding healthcare providers as well as monitoring the limited pharmacological resources is paramount. Only by leveraging new technologies it will be possible to sustain and support healthcare systems during the expected long course of this pandemic.","output":"Technologies to optimize the care of severe COVID-19 patients for healthcare providers challenged by limited resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the primary means of identifying acute infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Accurate and fast test results may permit more efficient use of protective and isolation resources and allow rapid therapeutic interventions We evaluated the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert) test, a rapid, automated molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 Analytical sensitivity and specificity/interference were assessed with infectious SARS-CoV-2;other infectious coronavirus species, including SARS-CoV;and 85 nasopharyngeal swab specimens positive for other respiratory viruses, including endemic human coronaviruses (hCoVs) Clinical performance was assessed using 483 remnant upper- and lower-respiratory-tract specimens previously analyzed by standard-of-care (SOC) NAATs The limit of detection of the Xpert test was 0 01 PFU/ml Other hCoVs, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, were not detected by the Xpert test SARS-CoV, a closely related species in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, was detected by a broad-range target (E) but was distinguished from SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-specific N2 target) Compared to SOC NAATs, the positive agreement of the Xpert test was 219/220 (99 5%), and the negative agreement was 250/261 (95 8%) A third tie-breaker NAAT resolved all but three of the discordant results in favor the Xpert test The Xpert test provided sensitive and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of upper- and lower-respiratory-tract specimens The high sensitivity and short time to results of approximately 45 min may impact patient management","output":"Multicenter evaluation of the cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test.

The role of NDV V protein in virus-production kinetics was investigated using DF-1 cell-based production system. The presence of an anti-interferon (IFN)-alpha antibody resulted in enhanced NDV production kinetics in a dose-dependent manner by blocking binding of NDV-induced IFN to its receptor. To prepare DF-1 cell whose cellular IFN signaling is blocked efficiently, stable cell lines expressing either lentogenic or velogenic NDV V protein known as an IFN antagonist were established. The overexpression of NDV V protein enhanced NDV production kinetics and expedited the rate of NDV production, while it had no effect on Japanese encephalitis virus production. NDV V protein functions as an IFN antagonist by inhibiting the increase in type I IFNs by NDV infection. The IFN signals in cells expressing NDV V protein were weakened by decreased activation or expression of the dsRNA-activated enzymes. These IFN antagonist activities enhance rapid virus replication and spread in the early phase of viral infection and will be useful in improving the production of viral vaccine strains.","output":"Overexpression of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) V protein enhances NDV production kinetics in chicken embryo fibroblasts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 affected how healthcare workers interact with patients.

Inclusion criteria were full-text articles related to assessment of healthcare workers need for medical robotics during COVID-19 pandemics. Exclusion criteria included abstracts, duplicate articles, blogs, news articles, promotional brochures, and conference proceedings. A total of 13,692 articles were identified through the search engines (PubMed 179, Cochrane Library 1300, EBSCO 13, Google Scholar 12,200). Five full-text articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Determining robotic functions is important to healthcare workers who will be user of such medical technology. This review divided robotic functions into medical, operational, movement, and social functions. Healthcare workers demands for robotics were also influenced by the types of robots, such as examination robots, robot-based sample test and medicine production, surgery and rehabilitation robots, disinfection and cleaning robots, delivery and logistic robot, telemedicine, and telepresence robots. Medical robotics is required for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The highest demands for medical robotics functions include cardiac measurements and oxygen saturation monitoring (medical functions); examination record delivery, video and image play, and medical information delivery (operational functions); and the ability to recognize and avoid obstacles (movement functions).

MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by inhibiting target mRNA translation or by promoting mRNA degradation. We have identified that miRNA-203, silenced by epithelialCmesenchymal transition (EMT), is a tumor suppressor and can promote differentiation of breast cancer stem cells. In this study, we tested the ability of liposomal delivery of miR-203 to reverse aspects of breast cancer pathogenesis using breast cancer and EMT cell lines. We show that translationally relevant methods for increasing miR-203 abundance within a target tissue affects cellular properties associated with cancer progression. While stable miR-203 expression suppresses LASP1 and survivin, nanoliposomal delivery suppresses BMI1, indicating that suppression of distinct mRNA target profiles can lead to loss of cancer cell migration.","output":"Nanoliposomal Delivery of MicroRNA-203 Suppresses Migration of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer through Distinct Target Suppression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purpose: Until a vaccine is widely available, adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. While there is a general paucity of information on COVID-19 infection and its impact on cancer patients, immunocompromised individuals, such as cancer patients, are likely at greater risk for both COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. In addition, a cancer diagnosis can cause stress, anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and poor quality of life. While the recommendations for COVID-19 parallel the common recommendations for managing infection risk, the enhanced social isolation and limited social distancing can be even more difficult for patients resulting in increased risk for psychological distress and deteriorations in health outcomes. Depressive disorders frequently result in substantial functional impairment, as well as increased emotional, economic, and productivity costs. It is important to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic impacts psychological and psychosocial factors, as well as health behaviors of cancer patients and survivors, and how various contextual factors may play risk and protective roles. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to determine differences in stress, mental health and coping behaviors, and adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic among three groups of adults (in active cancer treatment, cancer survivors, and those without a history of cancer). This study focuses on determining how sociodemographic characteristics and cancer status influence COVID-19 mental health/coping mechanisms, as well as how mental health/coping mechanisms and cancer status may predict adherence to preventive COVID-19 behaviors. Methods: Panel survey firm Qualtrics was used to administer an online survey among 897 U.S. adults in May of 2020. Quota sampling was utilized to ensure a sample consisting of approximately one-third: cancer patients currently in treatment (32.0%, n = 287), cancer survivors not currently in treatment (33.6%, n=301), and respondents with no cancer history (34.4%, n = 309). Survey items assessed demographic variables, depression, coping, and adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Results and Discussion: Preliminary analyses show that cancer patients report higher levels of depressive symptoms than survivors and the control group. In addition, cancer patients in active treatment use both avoidance and approach-focused coping more frequently than both survivors and the control group. Regression analyses show that avoidance coping predicts lower adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors, while approach-focused coping predicts higher adherence.

International violence, abuse and mental health network (iVAMHN) members recognised the need to identify barriers and priorities to develop this field. METHODS Informed by collaborative discussion between iVAMHN members, we conducted a pilot study using an online survey to identify research, education and capacity building priorities for violence, abuse and mental health in LMICs. We analysed free-text responses using thematic analysis. RESULTS 35 senior (29%) and junior researchers (29%), non-government or voluntary sector staff (18%), health workers (11%), students (11%) and administrators (3%) completed the survey. Respondents worked in 24 LMICs, with 20% working in more than one country. Seventy-four percent of respondents worked in sub-Saharan Africa, 37% in Asia and smaller proportions in Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Respondents described training, human resource, funding and sensitivity-related barriers to researching violence, abuse and mental health in LMICs and recommended a range of actions to build capacity, streamline research pathways, increase efficiency and foster collaborations and co-production. CONCLUSION The intersection between violence, abuse and mental health in LMICs is a priority for individuals with a range of expertise across health, social care and the voluntary sector. There is interest in and support for building a strong network of parties engaged in research, service evaluation, training and education in this field.

Secondary impacts of social distancing and lockdown in many countries have put strains on people?s capacities to provide essential food and medicines for themselves and their families. In response, outside of centralised government and voluntary sector frameworks, local mutual aid groups have emerged around the world as a primary site of community resilience. Given mutual aid?s strong links to the anarchist political tradition, for example in its identification by Kropotkin as a factor in evolution, this article suggests that these new mutual aid groups can be understood best through the related concept of self-organisation. Tying anarchist approaches to mutual aid and self-organisation together, it is argued that cybernetics and Stafford Beer?s Viable System Model (VSM) offer useful tools in helping both academic analysis and on-the-ground practice assess and improve the effectiveness of mutual aid in and beyond the COVID-19 crisis. The article offers a qualitative thematic analysis of anarchist and related texts published during the pandemic that reflect on mutual aid practice. In doing so, it highlights some of the challenges and tensions such self-organised mutual aid practice might face and proposes a participatory research agenda drawing on Beer?s VSM.","output":"Anarchist technologies: Anarchism, cybernetics and mutual aid in community responses to the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Jumonji domain-containing protein-3 (JMJD3), a histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase, promotes endothelial regeneration, but its function in neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) of arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) has not been explored. In this study, we examined the contribution of endothelial JMJD3 to NIH of AVF and the mechanisms underlying JMJD3 expression during kidney failure. We found that the expression of endothelial JMJD3 was negatively associated with NIH of AVF in kidney failure patients. JMJD3 expression in endothelial cells (ECs) was also downregulated in the vasculature of chronic kidney disease (CKD) mice. Additionally, specific knockout of endothelial JMJD3 delayed EC regeneration, enhanced endothelial mesenchymal transition, impaired endothelial barrier function as determined by increased Evans blue staining and inflammatory cell infiltration, and accelerated neointima formation in the AVF created by venous end to arterial side anastomosis in CKD mice. Mechanistically, JMJD3 expression was downregulated via binding of TGF?1-mediated Hes family transcription factor Hes1 to its gene promoter. Knockdown of JMJD3 enhanced histone H3K27 methylation, thereby inhibiting transcriptional activity at promoters of EC markers and reducing migration and proliferation of ECs. Furthermore, knockdown of endothelial JMJD3 decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide production, leading to the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that decreased expression of endothelial JMJD3 impairs EC regeneration and function, and accelerates neointima formation in AVFs. We propose increasing the expression of endothelial JMJD3 could represent a new strategy for preventing endothelial dysfunction, attenuating NIH, and improving AVF patency in patients with kidney failure.","output":"Down-regulation of the endothelial histone demethylase JMJD3 is associated with neointimal hyperplasia of arteriovenous fistulas in kidney failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and well-being were assessed in a convenience sample of 600 UK adults, using a cross-sectional design.

The high demand has created a global bottleneck in testing capacity, which prompted us to modify available resources to extract viral RNA and perform reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect SARS-COV-2. OBJECTIVES: Report on the use of a DNA extraction kit, after modifications, to extract viral RNA that could then be detected using an FDA-approved SARS-COV-2 RT-qPCR assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initially, automated RNA extraction was performed using a modified DNA kit on samples from control subjects, a bacteriophage, and an RNA virus. We then verified the automated extraction using the modified kit to detect in-lab propagated SARSCOV-2 titrations using an FDA approved commercial kit (S, N, and ORF1b genes) and an in-house primer-probe based assay (E, RdRp2 and RdRp4 genes). RESULTS: Automated RNA extraction on serial dilutions SARS-COV-2 achieved successful one-step RT-qPCR detection down to 60 copies using the commercial kit assay and less than 30 copies using the in-house primer-probe assay. Moreover, RT-qPCR detection was successful after automated RNA extraction using this modified protocol on 12 patient samples of SARS-COV-2 collected by nasopharyngeal swabs and stored in viral transport media.

Fluoroquinolones are broad spectrum synthetic antimicrobial agents, being chemical derivatives of quinoline, the prodrome of chloroquine. Interestingly, fluoroquinolones may exert antiviral actions against vaccinia virus, papovavirus, CMV, VZV, HSV-1, HSV-2, HCV and HIV. A recent in silico study has shown that the fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by exhibiting stronger capacity for binding to its main protease than chloroquine and nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor antiretroviral drug. Remarkably, fluoroquinolones have shown multiple immunomodulatory actions leading to an attenuation of the inflammatory response through the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Noteworthy, respiratory fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, constitute fist line therapeutic agents for the management of severe community-acquired pneumonia. They are characterized by advantageous pharmacokinetic properties; higher concentrations in the lungs; and an excellent safety profile comparable to other antibiotics used to treat respiratory infections, such as macrolides and b-lactams.

There is some evidence though suggesting that the neural basis of Tourette syndrome is related to perception-action processing and binding between perception and action. However, binding processes have not been examined in the motor domain in these patients. If it is particularly perception-action binding but not binding processes within the motor system, this would further corroborate that Tourette syndrome it is not predominantly, or solely, a motor disorder. Here, we studied N = 22 Tourette patients and N = 24 healthy controls using an established action coding paradigm derived from the Theory of Event Coding framework and concomitant EEG-recording addressing binding between a planned but postponed, and an interleaved immediate reaction with different levels of overlap of action elements. Behavioral performance during interleaved action coding was normal in Tourette syndrome. Response locked lateralized readiness potentials reflecting processes related to motor execution were larger in Tourette syndrome, but only in simple conditions. However, pre-motor processes including response preparation and configuration reflected by stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potentials were normal. This was supported by a Bayesian data analysis providing evidence for the null hypothesis. The finding that processes integrating different action-related elements prior to motor execution are normal in Tourette syndrome suggests that Tourette it is not solely a motor disorder.

The incidences and characteristics of the injuries were investigated using both datasets; additionally, detailed information regarding the injury environments was investigated using the single-institutional data. The findings were similar across both datasets. The incidence of injuries increased during the study period; the head was most commonly injured, whereas the trunk or proximal extremities were rarely injured; low-energy head injuries accounted for >50% of the cases in children aged <5 years, although the incidences of lower-extremity injuries and fractures increased in older children. Single-institutional data demonstrated that the proportion of indoor playground and trampoline-related injuries increased rapidly during the study period, and outdoor injuries and seasonal variation (with peak incidences in May and June) were more prominent in older children. Based on similarities between both datasets, the detailed results regarding pediatric traumatic injuries obtained from the single-institutional data could be generalized nationally with adequate external validity. To prevent traumatic injuries, it may be more effective to wear protective equipment covering the head and distal extremities rather than the trunk or proximal extremities; simple clothing, such as caps, could prevent many injuries in preschoolers. Among older children, safety guidelines for outdoor sports/leisure activities are needed. The increase in pediatric traumatic injuries may be partially explained by the increased availability of indoor playgrounds and installation of trampolines.

Every state in the United States enacted policies to encourage distancing and some mandated staying home. Understanding how these policies interact with individuals' voluntary responses to the COVID-19 epidemic is a critical initial step in understanding the role of these nonpharmaceutical interventions in transmission dynamics and assessing policy impacts. We use variation in policy responses along with smart device data that measures the amount of time Americans stayed home to disentangle the extent that observed shifts in staying home behavior are induced by policy. We find evidence that stay-at-home orders and voluntary response to locally reported COVID-19 cases and deaths led to behavioral change. For the median county, which implemented a stay-at-home order with about two cases, we find that the response to stay-at-home orders increased time at home as if the county had experienced 29 additional local cases. However, the relative effect of stay-at-home orders was much greater in select counties. On the one hand, the mandate can be viewed as displacing a voluntary response to this rise in cases. On the other hand, policy accelerated the response, which likely helped reduce spread in the early phase of the pandemic.

Here, we first investigated the effects of HCQ on intestinal microecology in mice. MAIN METHODS: Fifteen female C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into two groups: HCQ group (n = 10) and control group (n = 5). Mice in the HCQ group were administered with HCQ at dose of 100 mg/kg by gavage daily for 14 days. The feces of mice were collected before and on the 7th and 14th days after HCQ challenge, and then analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.

The mRNA expression of tight junction proteins in colonic tissues were also studied by RT-PCR. KEY FINDINGS: HCQ challenge had no effects on the counts of white blood cells, the levels of serum cytokines, and the gene expression of tight junction proteins in colon. HCQ also did not increase the content of serum d-lactate in mice. Notably, HCQ significantly decreased the diversity of gut microbiota, increased the relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes whereas decreased that of Firmicutes.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures.

Our prime aim was to evaluate the feasibility of CPAP for infants with bronchiolitis in a general paediatric ward, and secondary to assess capillary PCO2 (cPCO2) levels before and during treatment. METHODS From May 1(st) 2008 to April 30(th) 2012, infants with bronchiolitis at Stavanger University Hospital were treated with CPAP in a general paediatric ward, but could be referred to an intensive care unit (ICU) when needed, according to in-house guidelines. Levels of cPCO2 were prospectively registered before the start of CPAP and at approximately 4, 12, 24 and 48 hours of treatment as long as CPAP was given. We had a continuous updating program for the nurses and physicians caring for the infants with CPAP. The study was population based. RESULTS 672 infants (3.4%) were hospitalized with bronchiolitis. CPAP was initiated in 53 infants (0.3%; 7.9% of infants with bronchiolitis), and was well tolerated in all but three infants. 46 infants were included in the study, the majority of these (n = 33) were treated in the general ward only. These infants had lower cPCO2 before treatment (8.0; 7.7, 8.6)(median; quartiles) than those treated at the ICU (n = 13) (9.3;8.5, 9.9) (p < 0.001). The level of cPCO2 was significantly reduced after 4 h in both groups; 1.1 kPa (paediatric ward) (p < 0.001) and 1.3 kPa (ICU) (p = 0.002). Two infants on the ICU did not respond to CPAP (increasing cPCO2 and severe apnoe) and were given mechanical ventilation, otherwise no side effects were observed in either group treated with CPAP. CONCLUSION Treatment with CPAP for infants with bronchiolitis may be feasible in a general paediatric ward, providing sufficient staffing and training, and the possibility of referral to an ICU when needed.","output":"Continuous positive airway pressure for bronchiolitis in a general paediatric ward; a feasibility study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via the original article","output":"Correction to: Mental health status among family members of health care workers in Ningbo, China, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence of confirmed novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease or infants under investigation among a cohort of U.S. neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).

Study Design Serial cross-sectional surveys of MEDNAX-affiliated NICUs from March 26 to April 3, April 8 to April 19, May 4 to May 22, and July 13 to August 2, 2020. The surveys included questions regarding COVID-19 patient burden and policies regarding infant separation, feeding practices, and universal maternal screening. Results Among 386 MEDNAX-affiliated NICUs, responses were received from 153 (42%), 160 (44%), 165 (45%), 148 (38%) across four rounds representing an active patient census of 3,465, 3,486, 3,452, and 3,442 NICU admitted patients on the day of survey completion. Confirmed COVID-19 disease in NICU admitted infants was rare, with the prevalence rising from 0.03 (1 patient) to 0.44% (15 patients) across the four survey rounds, while the prevalence of patients under investigation increased from 0.8 to 2.6%. Hospitals isolating infants from COVID-19-positive mothers fell from 46 to 20% between the second and fourth surveys, while centers permitting direct maternal breastfeeding increased 17 to 47% over the same period. Centers reporting universal severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening for all expectant mothers increased from 52 to 69%. Conclusion Among a large cohort of NICU infants, the prevalence of infants under investigation or with confirmed neonatal COVID-19 disease was low. Policies regarding universal maternal screening for SARS-CoV-2, infant isolation from positive mothers, and direct maternal breastfeeding for infants born to positive mothers are rapidly evolving. As universal maternal screening for SARS-CoV-2 becomes more common, the impact of these policies requires further investigation. Key Points: In this cohort, neonatal COVID-19 is rare.

Research Objectives This study sought to determine the prevalence, predictors, timing, and outcomes associated with having a documented DNR or DNI order for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods A retrospective multisite chart review of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was performed to determine characteristics, medical treatments received, and outcomes associated with having a documented DNR or DNI order. Patients were divided into two cohorts (early and late) by timing of hospitalization during the pandemic. Results Among 1,358 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 19% (n = 259) had a documented DNR or DNI order. In multivariate analysis, age (older) (p < .01, OR 1.13), race (White) (p = .01, OR 0.55), and hospitalization during the early half of the pandemic (p = .02, OR 1.8) were associated with having a DNR or DNI order. Palliative care consultation occurred more often in the early cohort (p < .01). Medical treatments, including ICU (p = .31) and level of ventilator support (p = .32) did not differ between cohorts. Hospital mortality was similar between the early and late cohorts (p = .27); however, among hospital decedents median hospital day from DNR or DNI order to death differed between cohorts (p < .01) (6 days from order to death in early vs 2 days in the late cohort). Conclusion More frequent use of DNR orders and orders written farther from death in decedents characterized the early pandemic phase. White patients were more likely to have DNR or DNI orders, consistent with prior research.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the prevalence of anxiety and its associated factors among WeChat users in mainland China during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From February 10 to February 24, 2020, a nationwide, web-based cross-sectional survey study was carried out using convenience sampling. Participants' levels of anxiety, positive psychological responses, and information-seeking behaviors were assessed. The survey was distributed among WeChat users via the WeChat smartphone platform. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the factors associated with anxiety. RESULTS: This study found that the prevalence of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item [GAD-7] scale score &#8805;7) among WeChat users in China was 17.96% (446/2483) during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that information-seeking behaviors such as cannot stop searching for information on COVID-19, being concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic, and spending more than 1 hour per day consuming information about the pandemic were found to be associated with increased levels of anxiety. Additionally, participants who chose social media and commercial media as the primary sources to obtain information about the COVID-19 pandemic were found more likely to report anxiety. Conversely, participants who were confident or rational about the COVID-19 pandemic were less likely to report anxiety.

With pandemic control being widely coordinated, the supply chain of FAPs was gradually optimized and improved. However, after the outbreak of COVID-19, achieving an effective supply of FAPs in future pandemics has become a key issue. The present work therefore aimed to construct a three-level supply chain based on the Stackelberg game model, consisting of suppliers, third-party logistics (TPL), and retailers, to guarantee the supply of FAPs. COVID-19 pandemic factors such as virus infection coefficients and pandemic prevention efforts were fully integrated into the model. RESULTS: Compared with the wholesale prices of FAPs, preservation efforts and pandemic prevention efforts have huge impacts on the retail prices of FAPs. When suppliers are in the leading position, the quality assurance effort level is positively correlated with the optimal profit. Compared with this situation, when FAP retailers are in the leading position, TPL providers show higher levels of pandemic prevention effort and FAP preservation effort. With an increase in consumer preference for pandemic prevention, the profits of supply-chain members when FAP retailers are in the leading position will gradually increase. CONCLUSION: This study reveals an effective supply mechanism for FAPs in metropolitan areas during the COVID-19 pandemic and describes the authors' experience of guaranteeing the quality and safety of FAPs for future pandemic cases. ? 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.","output":"Prevention schemes for future fresh agricultural products (FAPs) supply chain: mathematical model and experience of guaranteeing the supply of FAPs during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early diagnosis is critical and challenging for tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), which is a kind of tumor with high malignancy, poor prognosis, and a high incidence of invasion and metastasis.

METHODS: 289 hospitalized laboratory\\\\confirmed COVID\\\\19 patients were included in this study. Electronic medical records, including patient demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory tests results, and radiological materials were collected and analyzed. According to the severity and outcomes of the patients, they were divided into three groups: non\\\\survived (n=49), survived severe (n=78), and non\\\\severe (n=162) groups. Clinical, laboratory and radiological data were compared among these groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality and visualize the patients on a low\\\\dimensional space. Correlations between clinical, radiological and laboratory parameters were investigated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to determine the risk factors associated with mortality in severe patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and non\\\\survived cases during hospital stay were also collected. RESULTS: Of the 289 patients, the median age was 57 years (range, 22 \\\\ 88) and 155 (53.4%) patients were male. As of the final follow\\\\up date of this study, 240 (83.0%) patients were discharged from the hospital and 49 (17.0%) patients died.

According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, elder age, a higher number of affected lobes, elevated CRP levels on admission, increased prevalence of chest tightness/dyspnea and smoking history were independent risk factors for death of severe patients. A trajectory in PCA was observed from \\"non\\\\severe\\" towards \\"non\\\\survived\\" via \\"severe and survived\\" patients. Strong correlations between the age of patients, the affected lobe numbers and laboratory variables were identified.

Telehealth is a viable alternative to face-to-face service delivery. Telephone calls alone, however, may be insufficient. Here, we evaluated whether supplementary telehealth via video-conferencing platforms could bring additional benefits to care-recipient with NCD and their spousal caregivers at home. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty older adults NCD-and-caregiver dyads were recruited through an activity center. DESIGN, INTERVENTION: The impact of additional services delivered to both care-recipient and caregiver through video conference (na?=a?30) was compared with telehealth targeted at caregivers by telephone only (na?=a?30), over 4 weeks in a pretest-post-test design. Interviews and questionnaires were conducted at baseline and study's end. MEASUREMENTS, RESULTS: Supplementary telemedicine had averted the deterioration in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment evident in the telephone-only group (?p2a?=a?0.50). It also reversed the falling trend in quality of life observed in the telephone only group (QoL-AD, ?p2a?=a?0.23).

However, there are insufficient medical resources for their treatment in Japan due to two reasons. First, the numbers of headache specialists and clinics remain insufficient. Second, neurologists and neurosurgeons mainly treat headaches in Japan. However, they mainly work as general stroke neurologists, so they cannot focus on primary headache treatment. To solve these problems, we preliminarily developed a deep learning (DL)-based automated diagnosis model from patients Japanese unstructured sentences in the medical questionnaire using a DL framework. We hypothesized that the model would reduce the time and burden on both doctors and patients and improve their quality of life. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated our primary headache database and developed a diagnosis model using the DL framework (Prediction One, Sony Network Communications Inc., Japan). We used age, sex, date, and embedding layer made by the medical questionnaires natural language processing (NLP).

Several biological substrates have been associated with OSA such as nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV), endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), and circulating endothelial cells (CEC). Few studies have looked at the association of NOV with OSA while the EPC/CEC relationships with OSA are unclear. In this study, we hypothesize that (1) NOV is associated with the severity of OSA independent of BMI, identifying a protein that may play a role in the biogenesis of OSA complications, and (2) EPCs and CECs are also associated with the severity of OSA and are biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction in OSA. METHODS: 61 subjects underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG), clinical evaluation, and blood analysis for NOV, EPC, CEC, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and other potential biomarkers. RESULTS: NOV and EPCs were independently associated with the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) after adjusting for potential confounders including body mass index (BMI), age, and sex (NOV p = 0.032; EPC p = 0.001). EPC was also independently associated with AHI after adjusting for BMI, age, and sex (p = 0.017). IL-6 was independently associated with AHI, but not with ODI.

AIM: To explore childbearing experiences of COVID-19 positive mothers who gave birth in the months of March and April 2020 in a Northern Italy maternity hospital. METHODS: A qualitative interpretive phenomenological approach was undertaken. Audio-recorded semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 women. Thematic analysis was completed using NVivo software. Ethical approval was obtained from the research sites Ethics Committee prior to commencing the study. FINDINGS: The findings include four main themes: 1) coping with unmet expectations; 2) reacting and adapting to the new ordinary; 3) pandemic relationships; 4) sharing a traumatic experience with long-lasting emotional impact. DISCUSSION: The most traumatic elements of womens experiences were the sudden family separation, self-isolation, transfer to a referral centre, the partner not allowed to be present at birth and limited physical contact with the newborn. CONCLUSION: Key elements of good practice including provision of compassionate care, presence of birth companions and transfer to referral centers only for the most severe COVID-19 cases should be considered when drafting maternity care pathways guidelines in view of future pandemic waves.","output":"The experiences of childbearing women who tested positive to covid-19 during the pandemic in northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many conspiracy theories appeared along with the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the potential risk of transmitting diseases disqualifies the use of serum for clinical cell therapy in most countries. Hence, most clinical cell therapy programs have replaced human serum with human serum albumin, which can result in inferior quality of released cell products. Photochemical treatment of different blood products utilizing Intercept? technology has been shown to inactivate a broad variety of pathogens of RNA and DNA origin. The present study assesses the feasibility of using pathogen-inactivated, blood group-compatible serum for use in human pancreatic islet culture. Isolated human islets were cultured at 37C for 3-4 days in CMRL 1066 supplemented with 10% of either pathogen-inactivated or nontreated human serum. Islet quality assessment included glucose-stimulated insulin release (perifusion), ADP/ATP ratio, cytokine expression, and posttransplant function in diabetic nude mice. No differences were found between islets cultured in pathogen-inactivated or control serum regarding stimulated insulin release, intracellular insulin content, and ADP/ATP ratio. Whether media was supplemented with treated or nontreated serum, islet expression of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, or tissue factor was not affected. The final diabetes-reversal rate of mice receiving islets cultured in pathogen-inactivated or nontreated serum was 78% and 87%, respectively (NS). As reported here, pathogen-inactivated human serum does not affect viability or functional integrity of cultured human islets.

In this study, we combined a likelihood-based method using a Bayesian framework and compartmental model of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Nigeria to estimate the effective reproduction number (R(t)) and basic reproduction number (R(0)) C this also enables us to estimate the initial daily transmission rate ((0)). We further estimate the reported fraction of symptomatic cases. The models are applied to the NCDC data on COVID-19 symptomatic and death cases from 27 February 2020 and 7 May 2020. In this period, the effective reproduction number is estimated with a minimum value of 0.18 and a maximum value of 2.29. Most importantly, the R(t) is strictly greater than one from 13 April till 7 May 2020. The R(0) is estimated to be 2.42 with credible interval: (2.37C2.47). Comparing this with the R(t) shows that control measures are working but not effective enough to keep R(t) below 1. Also, the estimated fraction of reported symptomatic cases is between 10 and 50%.

However, because of its unknown ancestors and hosts, elucidating the genetic variations of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been difficult. Without needing to know ancestors, we identified an uneven distribution of local genome similarities among the viruses categorized by geographic regions, and it was strongly correlated with incidence and mortality. To ensure unbiased and origin-independent analyses, we used a pairwise comparison of local genome sequences of virus genomes by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). We found a strong statistical correlation between dominance of the SARS-CoV-2 in distributions of uneven similarities and the incidence and mortality of illness. Genomic annotation of the BLAST hits also showed that viruses from geographic regions with severe infections tended to have more dynamic genomic regions in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein (S protein). Dynamic domains in the S protein were also confirmed by a canyon region of mismatches coincident with RBM and RBD, without hits of alignments of 100% matching. Thus, our origin-independent analysis suggests that the dynamic and unstable SARS-CoV-2-RBD could be the main reason for diverse incidence and mortality of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Origin-independent analysis links SARS-CoV-2 local genomes with COVID-19 incidence and mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound impact on both the physical and mental well-being of the global population.

METHOD: Data pertaining to mental health referral and hospital admissions to adult mental health, child and adolescent mental health, intellectual disability and mental health services for older people were collated retrospectively from electronic records for both 8 weeks pre-lockdown and the first 8 weeks of lockdown in England. Serious incidents during this time frame were also analysed. RESULTS: Significantly (P < 0.05) reduced referrals to a diverse range of mental health services were observed during lockdown, including child and adolescent, adult, older people and intellectual disability services. Although admissions remained relatively stable before and during lockdown for several services, admissions to both acute adult and mental health services for older people were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced during lockdown. Numbers of serious incidents in the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods were similar, with 23 incidents pre-lockdown, compared with 20 incidents in lockdown.

Often, patients and organizations are unwilling to divulge personal medical data for fear of compromising their privacy because although the data may be encrypted, the encrypted values typically need to be first decrypted to perform any computation on the data. Unfortunately, such a barrier in easy sharing of data can severely hamper the ability to respond in a timely and effective manner to a crisis scenario, as evident in the case of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To overcome this critical obstacle, we propose in this paper a novel privacy-preserving encryption mechanism for storage and computation of sensitive healthcare data. Our scheme is based on the use of a secure fully homomorphic encryption scheme, so that the required computations can be performed directly on the encrypted data values without the need for any decryption. The ability to execute queries or computation directly on encrypted data, without the need for decryption, is not present in any existing public-health surveillance system. We propose a novel computational model and also develop an algorithm for contact tracing with COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. We have simulated our proposed approach using the ElGamal encryption algorithm to check the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results show that our proposed solution is effective in providing adequate security while supporting the computational needs for contact-tracing. Besides contact-tracing, our new data-encryption technique can have a much broader impact in the field of healthcare. By executing queries or computations directly on encrypted data, our innovative solution would make the sharing of data in healthcare-related research and industry significantly simpler and faster. The use of such a data encryption scheme to store and transmit sensitive healthcare data over a network can not only allay the fear of compromising sensitive information but also ensure HIPAA-compliance.","output":"Fully Homomorphic Encryption based Privacy-Preserving Data Acquisition and Computation for Contact Tracing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, all levels of government introduced various strategies to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to document how the experience of providing medical assistance in dying (MAiD) changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using semistructured interviews with key informants in Canada who provided or coordinated MAiD before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We interviewed participants from April to June 2020 by telephone or email. We collected and analyzed data in an iterative manner and reached theme saturation. Our team reached consensus on the major themes and subthemes. RESULTS: We interviewed 1 MAiD coordinator and 15 providers, including 14 physicians and 1 nurse practitioner. We identified 4 main themes. The most important theme was the perception that the pandemic increased the suffering of patients receiving MAiD by isolating them from loved ones and reducing available services. Providers were distressed by the difficulty of establishing rapport and closeness at the end of life, given the requirements for physical distancing and personal protective equipment. They were concerned about the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and found it difficult to enforce rules about distancing and the number of people present. Logistics and access to MAiD became more difficult because of the new restrictions, but there were many adaptations to solve these problems. INTERPRETATION: Providers and coordinators had many challenges in providing MAiD during the COVID-19 pandemic, including their perception that the suffering of their patients increased. Some changes in how MAiD is provided that have occurred during the pandemic, including more telemedicine assessments and virtual witnessing, are likely to remain after the pandemic and may improve service.","output":"How the experience of medical assistance in dying changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada: a qualitative study of providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aim to explore the impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions on gastroenterologists providing care to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in Canada.

The survey explored the impact of pandemic-related restrictions on gastroenterologists managing IBD patients and the impact on clinical decision-making, rates of consultation, investigations and endoscopies conducted before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: 59 gastroenterologists (59.3% male) participated in our study with 40.7% having completed additional training in IBD. Respondents mean age was 43.7 years with 30.5% practising independently for a duration of less than or equal to 5 years. The majority of respondents were from Ontario (43.1%), Quebec (31%) and British Columbia (13.8%) with 62.7% practising primarily at an academic centre. 93.2% of respondents reported that their practice was affected by the pandemic. 44.6% note a reduction in the number of total consultations completed. Only 60% were able to arrange endoscopies for patients in an active IBD flare at an appropriate time interval compared to their pre-COVID practice. During the pandemic, 87.3% reported a reduction in the total endoscopies performed, with 43.8% of those individuals noting a minimum reduction of 25% of previous volumes. The following barriers attributed to the decrease in endoscopies performed during the pandemic: institutional-imposed restriction on daily allowed endoscopies (97.9%), indication for endoscopy was non-urgent (68.8%) and patient-requested cancellation due to a fear of contracting COVID-19 (87.5%). 63.6% of respondents were able to arrange outpatient laboratory investigations in less than 1-week prior to the pandemic vs. 41.8% arranging similar tests in 1C2 weeks during the pandemic. 50.9% were able to arrange diagnostic investigations in 1C2 months before the pandemic vs. 65% arranging similar tests in 3-months or more during the pandemic. When advancing drug therapy in IBD patients before versus during the pandemic, respondents reported the following factors as playing a crucial role in clinical decision making: patient symptomatology (87% vs. 79.3%), laboratory investigations (94.8% vs. 96.6%), diagnostic imaging (89.7% vs. 81%) and endoscopy findings (89.7% vs 72.4%). CONCLUSION: We illustrate that Canadian gastroenterologists have been affected by the pandemic, with decreases in endoscopy performance related to access and patient preference and less decision-making guided by endoscopy.

AIMS: To report the results of the SARS-CoV-2 screening in a province in Southern Italy and to provide data on the COVID-19 epidemic and the burden of asymptomatic subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was set up in all healthcare facilities of the province (12 hospitals and 13 sanitary districts: primary, secondary and tertiary centres) with the aim to analyse the results of NS performed on all subjects suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, either because they presented symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were 'contacts' of positive subjects, they came from areas with high prevalence or they were healthcare workers. NS were performed and managed as indicated by international guidelines. The specimens were processed for SARS-CoV-2 detection by real-time PCR. RESULTS: A total of 20 325 NS were performed from 13 March to 9 May 2020. Of these, 638 (3.14%) were positive. 470 were asymptomatic, or 75.3% of persons who were positive. They were mostly among 'contacts' of symptomatic cases (428 of 470, 91%) and were in domiciliary isolation.

Method: This is a 3-month, multi-centre, prospective cohort study evaluating the novel ankle block day case forefoot surgery pathway. Patients had a minimum of three months clinical follow up with outcome scores. They were matched to a cohort undergoing similar surgery prior to the COVID pandemic. Results: The utilisation of an ankle block pathway resulted in an average reduction of inpatient stay by 2 days per patient. Over the study period conservative savings of 26,659 were calculated. Anecdotally we observed a reduction in morbidity (wound complications, SSI's) although not statistically significant. Conclusions: Our novel surgical pathway has enabled continued elective operating for procedures that previously required hospital admission during a period of severe restrictions within the NHS. We observed significant reductions in cost, surgical inpatient bed utilisation and total operative time with staff, resource, and time savings.

METHODS: We administered a cross-sectional survey in July 2015 to a national sample of 3564 consenting participants selected through multistaged cluster sampling. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-4. PTSD symptoms were measured by six items from the Impact of Events Scale-revised. Relationships among Ebola experience, perceived Ebola threat and mental health symptoms were examined through binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Prevalence of any anxiety-depression symptom was 48% (95% CI 46.8% to 50.0%), and of any PTSD symptom 76% (95% CI 75.0% to 77.8%). In addition, 6% (95% CI 5.4% to 7.0%) met the clinical cut-off for anxiety-depression, 27% (95% CI 25.8% to 28.8%) met levels of clinical concern for PTSD and 16% (95% CI 14.7% to 17.1%) met levels of probable PTSD diagnosis.

Knowing someone quarantined for Ebola was independently associated with anxiety-depression (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.3, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.9) and PTSD (AOR 2.095% CI 1.5 to 2.8) symptoms. Perceiving Ebola as a threat was independently associated with anxiety-depression (AOR 1.69 95% CI 1.44 to 1.98) and PTSD (AOR 1.86 95% CI 1.56 to 2.21) symptoms. CONCLUSION: Symptoms of PTSD and anxiety-depression were common after one year of Ebola response; psychosocial support may be needed for people with Ebola-related experiences.

There is limited information about the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women and obstetrics programs, particularly in rural regions. AIMS: Most published reports have been from large urban hospitals. This study sought to gain insight into how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting rural obstetrics programs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This qualitative study surveyed participants who worked in rural obstetrics programs in New Mexico using a free response questionnaire. RESULTS: The pandemic has changed the obstetrics experience in rural New Mexico by impacting the relationship between patients and providers and altering the family-centered model of birth. Difficulties unique to rural obstetrics included lack of transportation, limited hospital rooms and limited staff, including OB providers, nurses and housekeeping. Wellness has been impacted for providers, manifested in increased anxiety, stress and burnout. Patients reported increased anxiety, decreased family support, and potential disruptions in maternal-infant bonding. CONCLUSIONS: Rural hospitals and clinics in New Mexico and across the United States operate with challenges at baseline, with many clinics across the nation closing, leading to increasing shortages of healthcare services in rural areas. This study showed that COVID-19 has increased the challenges that rural obstetrics providers face, altering the way they practice and creating uncertainty for the future due to potentially permanent changes to their practice.

This study investigates the mechanism of COVID-19 transmission in different periods within and between cities in China to better understand the nature of the outbreak. We use Morans I, a measure of spatial autocorrelation, to examine the spatial dependency of COVID-19 and a dynamic spatial autoregressive model to explore the transmission mechanism. We find that the spatial dependency of COVID-19 decreased over time and that the transmission of the disease could be divided into three distinct stages: an eruption stage, a stabilization stage, and a declination stage. The infection rate between cities was close to one-third of the infection rate within cities at the eruption stage, while it reduced to zero at the declination stage. We also find that the infection rates within cities at the eruption stage and declination stage were similar. Chinas policies for controlling the spread of the epidemic, specifically with respect to limiting inter-city mobility and implementing intra-city travel restrictions (social isolation), were most effective in reducing the viral transmission of COVID-19. The findings from this study indicate that the elimination of inter-city mobility had the largest impact on controlling disease transmission.","output":"Spatiotemporal Dynamic of COVID-19 Diffusion in China: A Dynamic Spatial Autoregressive Model Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundCOVID\\\\19 had spread all over the world by the end of 2019 In Japan, the government declared a state of emergency in March 2020 Although no study has reported it in detail, patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can be vulnerable to COVID\\\\19, because they have poor respiratory excursion Telemedicine is a very effective way of reducing the risk of COVID\\\\19 infection, as well as reducing the physical, economic, and psychological burden on patients AimTo evaluate PD patients inclinations to use telemedicine during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, because the start of telemedicine in our hospital was being considered MethodsThe subjects were 103 PD patients who visited Fukuoka University Hospital between April 1 and May 8, 2020 These patients completed a 15\\\\item questionnaire survey about telemedicine ResultsA majority of the patients were aware of the availability of telemedicine (77%) and were inclined to use it (60%) Credit card users (P &lt; 001), smartphone users (P = 006), and those who lived in a region distant from the hospital (P = 006) were significantly inclined to use telemedicine ConclusionIn this study, there was an inclination to use telemedicine in a majority of patients with PD during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic We believe that the introduction of telemedicine has a multitude of advantages during the pandemic period and beyond","output":"Attitudes toward telemedicine of patients with Parkinsons disease during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the influence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on the cytokine production profiles of the peripheral blood monoculear cells (PBMC) and neutrophils in chronically na?ve HCV-infected patients.

Currently, there are many vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 available in the market but without full clinical data beside. Despite the existence of these vaccines, the numbers of outpatients are still increasing in many countries around the world, and the reliability of these vaccines still remains elusive.

In this context, improving the immune defense system to combats this pandemic is absolutely necessary. The purpose of this review is to establish the probable relation between trace elements supplementation and COVID-19. Main body: Several clinical studies confirmed that Cu, Se, and Zn insufficiencies alter the immune system and increase the vulnerability to viral infections. Based on antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of these micronutrients, it seems logical that dietary supplementations of these components might enhance human immune system and lower the graveness of COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: Based on available data, we hypothesize that the clinical use of some essential trace element supplementations such as copper, selenium, and zinc might be a preventive and promising option to enhance human immunity against the new pandemic COVID-19 and its new strains.

With such epidemic characteristics and potential economic impact, HFMD is a significant public health issue in Thailand. Generally, contagious/infectious diseases' transmission dynamics vary across geolocations due to different socioeconomic situations, demography, and lifestyles. Hence, a nationwide comprehensive model of the disease's epidemic dynamics can provide information to understand better and predict a potential outbreak of this disease and efficiently and effectively manage its impact. However, there is no nationwide and comprehensive (i.e., the inclusion of reinfections in the model) model of HFDM dynamics for Thailand. This paper has endeavoured to promote nationwide comprehensive modelling of HFMD's epidemic dynamics and comprehend the reinfection cases. We have formulated the SEIRS epidemiological model with dynamic vitals, including reinfections, to explore this disease's prevalence. We also introduced periodic seasonality to reproduce the seasonal effect. The pattern of spread of this disease is uneven across the provinces in Thailand, so we used K-means clustering algorithm to cluster those provinces into three groups (i.e., highly, moderately, and least affected levels). We also analysed health records collected from district hospitals, which suggest significant reinfection cases. For example, we found that 11% (approximately) of infectious patients return for repeat treatment within the study period. We also performed sensitivity analysis which indicates that the basic reproduction number (R 0) is sensitive to the rate of transmission (?) and the rate at which infected people recover (?3). By fitting the model with HFMD confirmed data for the provinces in each cluster, the basic reproduction number (R 0) was estimated to be 2.643, 1.91, and 3.246 which are greater than 1. Based on this high R 0, this study recommends that this disease will persist in the coming years under identical cultural and environmental conditions.","output":"Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease in Thailand: A Comprehensive Modelling of Epidemic Dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conversion of standard cameras to enable them to capture images in the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) spectral regions has applications ranging from purely artistic to science and research.

Acquisition of infection can occur from environmental reservoirs, person-to-person transmission and from the healthcare environment. Primary prevention of infections through infection prevention and control measures is an important strategy in cystic fibrosis care. Areas covered: Here we present a systematic review of the evidence base around infection prevention and control in cystic fibrosis. We found 36 studies and 7 guidelines that met our inclusion criteria. Strategies covered include cohort segregation, individual segregation, hand hygiene, facemasks, combination strategies, equipment strategies, and adherence. Quality of evidence overall was deemed low or very low. Most guideline recommendations have little or no evidence to support them. Expert opinion: Although low quality, there is an abundance of evidence suggesting segregation is beneficial in reducing pathogen spread. Undertaking high-quality studies may, therefore, be ethically challenging. Large-scale registry studies may provide a better strategy for answering questions on the efficacy of infection control policy. With the rise of antibiotic resistance, effective eradication of cystic fibrosis pathogens is becoming more difficult so primary prevention through infection control will become increasingly important over the coming years.","output":"Infection prevention and control in cystic fibrosis: a systematic review of interventions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE: While some guidelines recognize the need for ?-lactam therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), there is still a paucity of data regarding the prevalence of and barriers to performing ?-lactam TDM in the United States. We sought to estimate the prevalence of ?-lactam TDM, describe monitoring practices, and identify actual and perceived barriers to implementation among health systems in the US. METHODS: A multicenter, cross-sectional, 40-item electronic survey was distributed to all postgraduate year 2 (PGY2) infectious diseases (ID) pharmacy residency program directors (RPDs) listed in the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists pharmacy residency directory. The primary outcome was the percentage of institutions with established ?-lactam TDM. Secondary outcomes included assessing ?-lactam TDM methods and identifying potential barriers to implementation. RESULTS: The survey was distributed to 126 PGY2 ID RPDs, with a response rate of 31.7% (40 of 126). Only 7.7% of respondents (3 of 39) performed ?-lactam TDM. Patient populations, therapeutic targets, and frequency and timing of obtaining repeat ?-lactam concentration measurements varied among institutions. The greatest barrier to implementation was lack of access to testing with a rapid turnaround time. Institutions were unlikely to implement ?-lactam TDM within the next year but were significantly more inclined to do so within 5 years (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: -lactam TDM was infrequently performed at the surveyed US health systems. Lack of access to serum concentration testing with rapid turnaround and lack of US-specific guidelines appear to be considerable barriers to implementing ?-lactam TDM.

Importantly, although all four strains replicated equally well in porcine cell lines in vitro and in the upper respiratory tract in vivo, PRCV strains causing more severe lung pathology were also able to replicate in ex vivo tracheal organ cultures as well as in vivo in the trachea and lung. The time course of infection of PRCV 135, which caused the most severe pulmonary pathology, was investigated. Virus was shed from the upper respiratory tract until day 10 post infection, with infection of the respiratory mucosa, as well as olfactory and sustentacular cells, providing an excellent model to study upper respiratory tract disease in addition to the commonly known lower respiratory tract disease from PRCV. Infected animals made antibody and T cell responses that cross reacted with the four PRCV strains and Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus. The antibody response was reproduced in vitro in organ cultures.

Volumetric data were extracted using the VolBrain pipeline. Global cognitive function was evaluated using a screening battery consisting of tasks falling into five broad cognitive domains, and was compared between patients with normal versus extensive BBB leakage. RESULTS Patients with SLE had significantly higher levels of BBB leakage compared with controls (p=0.04). Extensive BBB leakage (affecting over >9% of brain volume) was identified only in patients with SLE (16/65; 24.6%), who also had smaller right and left cerebral grey matter volumes compared with controls (p=0.04). Extensive BBB leakage was associated with lower global cognitive scores (p=0.02), and with the presence of impairment on one or more cognitive tasks (p=0.01).

Despite a large body of evidence supporting mutagenesis as a conceivable antiviral strategy, there are currently no data on the sensitivity to increased mutagenesis for Zika virus (ZIKV) and Usutu virus (USUV), two emerging flaviviral threats. In this study, we demonstrate that both viruses are sensitive to three ribonucleosides, favipiravir, ribavirin, and 5-fluorouracil, that have shown mutagenic activity against other RNA viruses while remaining unaffected by a mutagenic deoxyribonucleoside. Serial cell culture passages of ZIKV in the presence of these compounds resulted in the rapid extinction of infectivity, suggesting elevated sensitivity to mutagenesis. USUV extinction was achieved when a 10-fold dilution was applied between every passage, but not in experiments involving undiluted virus, indicating an overall lower susceptibility than ZIKV. Although the two viruses are inhibited by the same three drugs, ZIKV is relatively more susceptive to serial passage in the presence of purine analogues (favipiravir and ribavirin), while USUV replication is suppressed more efficiently by 5-fluorouracil. These differences in sensitivity typically correlate with the increases in the mutation frequencies observed in each nucleoside treatment. These results are relevant to the development of efficient therapies based on lethal mutagenesis and support the rational selection of different mutagenic nucleosides for each pathogen. We will discuss the implications of these results to the fidelity of flavivirus replication and the design of antiviral therapies based on lethal mutagenesis.","output":"Extinction of Zika Virus and Usutu Virus by Lethal Mutagenesis Reveals Different Patterns of Sensitivity to Three Mutagenic Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has profoundly altered people's experiences of work around the world.

However, this can only be understood in the context of the broader dynamics and issues facing this field of study. We outline the challenges faced by academics and practitioners working in this area to build upon this new found attention to ensure that employment relations issues remain central in terms of research, teaching and public policy.","output":"Pandemics, politics, and the resilience of employment relations research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A major strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is the limiting of in-person contacts. However, this is impractical or impossible for the many disabled people who do not live in care facilities, but still require caregivers. We seek to determine which interventions can prevent infections among disabled people and their caregivers. We simulate transmission with a model that includes susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, symptomatically ill, hospitalized, and removed individuals. The networks on which we simulate disease spread incorporate heterogeneity in the risks of different types of interactions, time-dependent lockdown and reopening measures, and contact distributions for four different groups (caregivers, disabled people, essential workers, and the general population). We find the probability of becoming infected is largest for caregivers and second largest for disabled people. Our analysis of network structure illustrates that caregivers have the largest modal eigenvector centrality. We find that two interventions -- contact-limiting by all groups and mask-wearing by disabled people and caregivers -- most reduce the cases among disabled people and caregivers. We also test which group spreads COVID-19 most readily by seeding infections in a subset of each group. We find caregivers are the most potent spreaders of COVID-19, particularly to other caregivers and to disabled people. We test where to use limited vaccine doses most effectively and find (1) vaccinating caregivers better protects disabled people than vaccinating the general population or essential workers and (2) vaccinating caregivers protects disabled people about as much as vaccinating disabled people themselves. Our results highlight the potential effectiveness of mask-wearing, contact-limiting throughout society, and strategic vaccination for limiting the exposure of disabled people and their caregivers to COVID-19.","output":"Networks of Necessity: Simulating COVID-19 Mitigation Strategies for Disabled People and Their Caregivers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 52-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia two years ago; admitted to our hospital with complaints of fever (>38C), shortness of breath, and fatigue.

We completed a portable millimeter-wave radar module for wireless communication. The radar module was a small size and had a WIFI communication interface, so we only needed to provide a power cord for the radar module. The breathing and heartbeat signals were detected and separated by FIR digital filter and the wavelet transform method. By building a cloud computing framework, we realized remote and senseless monitoring of the vital signs for older people living alone.

The anticoagulant actions of nebulised heparin limit fibrin deposition and progression of lung injury. Serendipitously, unfractionated heparin also inactivates the SARS CoV 2 virus and prevents its entry into mammalian cells. Nebulisation of heparin may therefore limit both fibrin mediated lung injury and inhibit pulmonary infection by SARS CoV 2. For these reasons we have initiated a multicentre international trial of nebulised heparin in patients with COVID 19. Methods and intervention: Mechanically ventilated patients with confirmed or strongly suspected SARS CoV 2 infection, hypoxaemia and an acute pulmonary opacity in at least one lung quadrant on chest Xray, will be randomised to nebulised heparin 25,000 Units every 6 hours or standard care for up to 10 days while mechanically ventilated.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the prospective attendees emotional responses to cancelled events. This study draws upon grief cycle theory to articulate different layers of the grief process in the event domain of inquiry. Design/methodology/approach: The National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament was selected as the research context. Taking user-generated messages from Twitter, this study first performed content analysis to organize lexical patterns into categories and higher-order themes based on the grief cycle. It also performed social network analyses using UCINET to illustrate how different grief phases are inter-related. Findings: Results not only point to attendees self-expression manifested through a continuum of denial, anger, bargaining and acceptance but they also reveal a three-layer hierarchy of grief, namely, event-related, socio-politics-related and crisis-related. The network analysis further illustrates how grief phases are tied into a complex network of grief messages. Originality/value: This study advances the event literature by improving knowledge about attendees emotional responses to cancelled events. It increases our understanding of the grieving process in the aftermath of COVID-19. The proposed triple grief cycle helps advance the literature by showcasing how voices from prospective attendees represent three pillars of grief hierarchy.

WBE applicability has been demonstrated in a number of cases over short-term periods as a method for tracking the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and an early-warning tool for predicting outbreaks in the population. This study reports SARS-CoV-2 viral loads from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and hospitals over a 6-month period (June to December 2020). Results show that the overall range of viral load in positive tested samples was between 1.2  10(3) and 3.5  10(6) gene copies/L, unveiling that secondary-treated wastewaters mirrored the viral load of influents. The interpretation suggests that the viral titers found in three out of four WWTPs were associated to clinical COVID-19 surveillance indicators preceding 2C7 days the rise of reported clinical cases. The median wastewater detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was one out of 14,300 reported new cases. Preliminary model estimates of prevalence ranged from 0.02 to 4.6% for the studied period.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of nulliparous women with singleton gestations, recruited between 110 and 136 weeks gestation. Data on the following were collected: maternal age; ethnicity; chronic diseases; use of fertility treatment; body mass index; mean arterial blood pressure (MAP); serum levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (?-hCG); and mean uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI). We constructed a proportional hazard model for the prediction of preterm preeclampsia selected based on the Akaike information criterion. A receiver operating characteristic curve was created with the predicted risk from the final model. Our primary outcome was preterm preeclampsia and our secondary outcome was a composite of preeclampsia, small for gestational age, intrauterine death, and preterm birth. RESULTS: Among 4659 nulliparous women with singleton gestations, our final model included 4 variables: MAP MoM, log10PlGF MoM, log10AFP MoM and log10UtA-PI MoM. We obtained an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.75-0.93) with a detection rate of preterm preeclampsia of 55% (95% CI 37%-73%) and a false-positive rate of 10%.

To inform future development, this manuscript discusses the development and testing of mobile health fall risk applications for three unique clinical populations [older adults, individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and wheeled-device users]. We focus on key lessons learned and future directions to improve the field of fall risk mHealth. During the development phase, we first identified fall risk factors specific to each population that are measurable with mobile technology. Second, we determined whether inertial measurement units within smartphones can measure postural control within the target population. Last, we developed the interface of each app with a user-centered design approach with usability testing through iterative semi-structured interviews. We then tested our apps in real-world settings. Our cumulative work demonstrates that mobile technology can be leveraged to provide personalized fall risk screening for different clinical populations. Fall risk apps should be designed and tailored for the targeted group to enhance usefulness and feasibility. In addition, fall risk factors measured with mobile technology should include those that are specific to the population, are measurable with mobile technology, and can accurately measure fall risk.

This study was conducted to investigate the role of GHITM gene in the apoptosis and growth of the golden apple snail Pomacea canaliculate. RESULTS: The complete cDNA of this gene was cloned using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method and subjected to bioinformatics analysis. The full-length cDNA was 2242 bp, including an open reading frame of 1021 bp that encoded a protein of 342 amino acid residues. The mRNA expression profiles of GHITM gene in different tissues (liver, kidney, gonad and foot) and different growth phases (6-months old and 2-years old) showed that it was expressed in various tissues and different growth phases. Silencing of the GHITM gene by RNAi (RNA interference) experiments revealed that the GHITM gene possibly plays a role in inhibiting apoptosis through detecting the Caspase (Cysteine-requiring Aspartate Protease)-3 activity. In addition, the aperture width and body whorl length of the snail was significantly affected by RNAi, suggesting that this gene plays a significant role in promoting the growth of the organism.

Most BDIs are recognized either during the procedure or in the immediate postoperative period. However, some BDIs may be discovered later during the postoperative period, and this may translate to delayed or inappropriate treatments. Providing a specific diagnosis and a precise description of the BDI will expedite the decision-making process and increase the chance of treatment success.

METHODS: We collected epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and occupation information, along with contact history, of 671 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 reported from January 23 to February 5, 2020, in Henan province, China. We described characteristics of these cases, compared the diagnostic accuracy and features of blood testing, computed tomography (CT) scans and X-rays, and analysed SARS-CoV-2 transmission sources and patients' occupations in Henan province. RESULTS: The mean age of patients in this case series was 43 years, 56.2% were male and 22.4% had coexisting medical disorders. The death rate was 0.3%. Fourteen patients did not show any symptoms. Lymphocyte percentage was associated with disease severity (&#967;2 = 6.71, P = 0.035) but had a large variation in each sample group. The mean time from illness onset to diagnosis was 5.6 days. A total of 330 patients had ever lived in or visited Wuhan, 150 had contact with confirmed cases, 323 had been to a hospital and 119 had been to a wet market.

Methods: We collected incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan to other provinces was measured by Baidu Migration Index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. We used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province. Contributors to the provincial variation in the temporal associations were investigated. Additionally, we estimated the reduction in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases following the travel ban for Wuhan. Results: Cross-correlation function analyses suggested that the volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan was positively associated with COVID-19 incidence in all provinces, with correlation coefficients between 0.22-0.78 (all P<0.05). Approximately 42% of provinces showed <1 week of lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Migration had more prolonged impacts in provinces closer to Wuhan and with more passenger influx from Wuhan, but affected economically advantaged provinces to a lesser extent. We further estimated that the travel ban may have prevented approximately 19,768 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) outside of Wuhan by February 29, 2020. Conclusions: Outflowing migration from Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 transmission to other parts of China with varying time-lagged effects dependent on provincial characteristics. The travel ban led to a significant reduction in COVID-19 outside of Wuhan.","output":"Temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently there is only one method of treatment for human schistosomiasis, the drug praziquantel. Strong selective pressure has caused a serious concern for a rise in resistance to praziquantel leading to the necessity for additional pharmaceuticals, with a distinctly different mechanism of action, to be used in combination therapy with praziquantel. Previous treatment of Schistosoma mansoni included the use of oxamniquine (OXA), a prodrug that is enzymatically activated in S. mansoni but is ineffective against S. haematobium and S. japonicum. The oxamniquine activating enzyme was identified as a S. mansoni sulfotransferase (SmSULT-OR). Structural data have allowed for directed drug development in reengineering oxamniquine to be effective against S. haematobium and S. japonicum. Guided by data from X-ray crystallographic studies and Schistosoma worm killing assays on oxamniquine, our structure-based drug design approach produced a robust SAR program that tested over 300 derivatives and identified several new lead compounds with effective worm killing in vitro. Previous studies resulted in the discovery of compound CIDD-0066790, which demonstrated broad-species activity in killing of schistosome species. As these compounds are racemic mixtures, we tested and demonstrate that the R enantiomer CIDD-007229 kills S. mansoni, S. haematobium and S. japonicum better than the parent drug (CIDD-0066790). The search for derivatives that kill better than CIDD-0066790 has resulted in a derivative (CIDD- 149830) that kills 100% of S. mansoni, S. haematobium and S. japonicum adult worms within 7 days. We hypothesize that the difference in activation and thus killing by the derivatives is due to the ability of the derivative to fit in the binding pocket of each sulfotransferase (SmSULT-OR, ShSULT-OR, SjSULT-OR) and to be efficiently sulfated. The purpose of this research is to develop a second drug to be used in conjunction with praziquantel to treat the major human species of Schistosoma. Collectively, our findings show that CIDD-00149830 and CIDD-0072229 are promising novel drugs for the treatment of human schistosomiasis and strongly support further development and in vivo testing.","output":"An iterative process produces oxamniquine derivatives that kill the major species of schistosomes infecting humans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"School closures are an important strategy to mitigate the impacts of a pandemic.

The current study investigates the levels of stress, anxiety, insomnia, depression, and well-being among Yemeni HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : A web-based, cross-sectional survey was used among 1,248 Yemeni HCWs. An electronic self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data. The URL link was distributed to the HCWs via social media and emails. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS), version 24.0 was used in managing and analyzing the data collected. T-test and one-way ANOVA were used to compare the participants data and independent variables. Spearmans correlation coefficients were used to determine the relationship between study variables. A p-value of < 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval was considered statistically significant. The survey was conducted between 6 November 2020, 11 PM to 3 April 2021, 11 PM. Results: : The results indicated that 73.0, 57.3, 49.8, 53.2, and 85.2% of all HCWs reported symptoms of moderate or severe stress, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and worse quality of life, respectively. Out of ten independent variables, five were statistically significant (years of experience, working hours per day, marital status, age, and working days per week) ( p < 0.05). The results further showed significant positive correlations between stress and scores of anxiety, insomnia, and depression and also between anxiety and insomnia and depression and between insomnia and depression. There was significant negative correlation between wellbeing scores and scores of stress, anxiety, insomnia, and depression. Conclusion: Yemeni HCWs experience considerable levels of stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and poor quality of life.

Chest CT to identify patients suffering from COVID-19 has been reported to be limited by its low specificity for distinguishing COVID-19 from other atypical pneumonias (\\"COVID-19 mimics\\"). Meanwhile, the understanding of the morphologic patterns of COVID-19 has improved and they appear to be fairly specific. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 02/2020 and 04/2020, 60 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia underwent chest CT in our department. Cases were matched with a comparable control group of 60 patients of similar age, sex, and comorbidities, who underwent chest CT prior to 01/2020 for atypical pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Included were other viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens. All 120 cases were blinded to patient history and were reviewed independently by two radiologists and two radiology residents. Readers rated the probability of COVID-19 pneumonia according to the COV-RADS classification system. Results were analyzed using Clopper-Pearson 95a% confidence intervals, Youden's Index for test quality criteria, and Fleiss' kappa statistics. RESULTS: Overall, readers were able to correctly identify the presence of COVID-19 pneumonia in 219/240 (sensitivity: 91a%; 95a%-CI; 86.9a%-94.5a%), and to correctly attribute CT findings to COVID-19 mimics in 159/240 ratings (specificity: 66.3a%; 59.9a%-72.2a%), yielding an overall diagnostic accuracy of 78.8a% (378/480; 74.8a%-82.3a%). Individual reader accuracy ranged from 74.2a% (89/120) to 84.2a% (101/120) and did not correlate significantly with reader expertise. Youden's Index was 0.57. Between-reader agreement was moderate (&#954;a=a0.53). CONCLUSION: In this enriched cohort, radiologists were able to distinguish COVID-19 from \\"COVID-19 mimics\\" with moderate diagnostic accuracy. Accuracy did not correlate with reader expertise. KEY POINTS:  In a scenario of direct comparison (no negative findings), CT allows the differentiation of COVID-19 from other atypical pneumonias (\\"COVID mimics\\") with moderate accuracy..  Reader expertise did not significantly influence these results..  Despite similar patterns and distributions of pulmonary findings, radiologists were able to estimate the probability of COVID-19 pneumonia using the COV-RADS classification in a standardized manner in the larger proportion of cases..

Perturbations of the oral microbiota under particular conditions can contribute to the growth of non-oral pathogens that are hard to kill because of their higher resistance to antimicrobials, raising the probability of treatment failure and reinfection. The presence of these bacteria in the oral cavity has been proven to be associated with several oral diseases such as periodontitis, caries, and gingivitis, and systemic diseases of importance in clinical medicine such as cystic fibrosis, HIV, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, it is still controversial whether these species are merely transient members or unique to the oral cavity. Mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between the oral microbiota and non-oral pathogens can also occur, though the mechanisms used by these bacteria are not clear. Therefore, this review presents an overview of the current knowledge about the presence of non-oral bacteria in the oral cavity, their relationship with systemic and oral diseases, and their interactions with oral bacteria.

It is this reactivation that is responsible for the significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised children. We review CMV infection in the primary immunodeficient host, including early identification of these infants by newborn screening to allow for CMV infection prevention strategies.

With new outbreaks emerging, hospitals are now figuring out how to balance preparedness for future COVID-19 waves with their elective and regular services. This report discusses how four hospital systems deal with these dual responsibilities in China, Norway and the UK. Reflections Based on the experiences and combined reflections of hospital executives, we have formulated five strategic and leadership lessons for hospitals as they manage these dual responsibilities. (1) Redesign organisation to separate COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 services both within and across hospitals. (2) Expand virtual care strategies to improve access. (3) Use data-driven models to allocate resources across COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units. (4) Invest in programmes to promote frontline staff well-being. (5) Secure financial support to continue to deliver on the dual responsibilities. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic gives rise to leadership challenges that have fuelled organisational change and new approaches to healthcare delivery.

The olfactory dysfunction linked to COVID-19 is not associated with rhinorrhea but there is no objective evaluation. AIMS: To evaluate nasal mucosal secretion objectively in COVID-19 patients with anosmia. METHODS: Fifty-two COVID-19 patients with anosmia and 51 healthy individuals included. Anosmia was diagnosed by subjective questionnaires. Nasal Schirmer test was done to the left and the right nasal cavity separately. RESULTS: All patients had anosmia and 82.6% had gustatory dysfunction. In group 1, the mean of the nasal Schirmer test results in the right cavity was 12.4 mm, 12.01 mm in the left nasal cavity. The median wetting distance (right plus left divided by two) was calculated 12.21 mm. In group 2, the mean of the nasal Schirmer test results in the right cavity was 12.1 mm, 11.8 mm in the left nasal cavity. The median wetting distance (right plus left divided by two) was calculated11.97 mm. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of nasal schirmer. CONCLUSION: Olfactory dysfunction and gustatory dysfunction are the two of the unknown for this disease. We evaluated the nasal mucosa secretions in COVID-19 patients with anosmia objectively to evaluate if there is inflammation in the nasal mucosa. We found no difference between healthy individuals. According to our study, SARS-CoV-2 causes anosmia without causing nasal mucosal inflammation.

Three weeks later, the US federal government declared the pandemic a national emergency. The number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases increased rather rapidly and changed routine daily activities of the community. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This brief report describes the response from the hospital, the regional blood center, and the hospital-based transfusion services to the events that took place in the community during the initial phases of the pandemic. RESULTS In Washington State, the first week of March started with 4 confirmed cases and ended with 150; by the end of the second week of March there were more than 700 cases of confirmed COVID-19. During the first week, blood donations dropped significantly. Blood units provided from blood centers of non-affected areas of the country helped keep inventory stable and allow for routine hospital operations. The hospital-based transfusion service began prospective triaging of blood orders to monitor and prioritize blood utilization. In the second week, blood donations recovered, and the hospital postponed elective procedures to ensure staff and personal protective equipment were appropriate for the care of critical patients. CONCLUSION As community activities are disrupted and hospital activities switch from routine operations to pandemic-focused and urgent care-oriented, the blood supply and utilization requires a number of transformations.","output":"Prepare to adapt: Blood supply and transfusion support during the first 2 weeks of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affecting Washington State."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccinations are a safe and effective way to protect against infectious diseases. The World Health Organization estimates vaccines have saved more lives than any other interventions and every year about two to three million deaths are averted worldwide through immunization. To improve vaccination coverage, pharmacists have been increasingly involved in immunization roles in their communities-as advocates, educators, and immunizers. Community pharmacy-based vaccination services have increased both in the number of immunization providers and the number of sites where patients can receive immunizations. In Canada, health care is under provincial legislation-and so, there are distinct differences in scope of pharmacist practice across the country. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, in Qubec, Canada's second-largest province, pharmacists did not have the authority to administer vaccines. To help prepare pharmacists in Qubec to become immunizers, we developed and deployed a series of accredited workshops. In these facilitated workshops, pharmacists were able to share best practices that may lead to providing effective vaccination services, identify common competency gaps, discuss effective patient communication skills, and determine how to target the most vulnerable population groups. Participants were also asked to evaluate the workshop. Our results indicate the evaluation was very reliable in measuring participant satisfaction (Cronbach's &#945; = 0.94) and pharmacists commented that the workshops' learning outcomes exceeded their expectations, and the topics covered were relevant and applicable. The evaluation also asked participants to identify weaknesses of training, so future educational interventions can be planned accordingly.

Considering methodological insufficiency for assessing time-varying diseases, a continuous-time Markov multi-state transition model (CTMMTM) was used to investigate delirium evolution in elderly patients. This is a longitudinal observational study performed in September 2016 in an Italian hospital. Change of delirium states was modeled according to the 4AT score. A Cox model (CM) and a CTMMTM were used for identifying factors affecting delirium onset both with a two-state and three-state model. In this study, 78 patients were enrolled and evaluated for 5 days. Both the CM and the CTMMTM show that urine catheter (UC), aging, drugs, and invasive devices (ID) are risk factors for delirium onset. The CTMMTM model shows that transition from no-delirium/cognitive impairment to delirium was associated with aging (HR = 1.14; 95%CI, 1.05, 1.23) and neuroleptics (HR = 4.3; 1.57, 11.77), dopaminergic drugs (HR = 3.89; 1.2, 12.6), UC (HR = 2.92; 1.09, 7.79) and ID (HR = 1.67; 103, 2.71).

Interventions to enhance proxy decisions about trial participation are now being developed. However, a lack of standardised outcome measures limits evaluation of these interventions. The aim of this study was to establish an agreed standardised core outcome set (COS) for use when evaluating interventions to improve proxy decisions about trial participation. METHODS: We used established methods to develop the COS including a consensus study with key stakeholder groups comprising those who will use the COS in research (researchers and healthcare professionals) and patients or their representatives. Following a scoping review to identify candidate items, we used a modified two-round Delphi survey to achieve consensus on core outcomes, with equivocal items taken to a consensus meeting for discussion. The COS was finalised following an online consensus meeting in October 2020. RESULTS: A total of 28 UK stakeholders (5 researchers, 10 trialists, 3 patient/family representatives, 7 recruiters and 3 advisors/approvers) participated in the online Delphi survey to rank candidate items from the scoping review (n = 36) and additional items proposed by participants (n = 1). Items were broadly grouped into three categories: how family members make decisions, their experiences of making decisions, and the personal aspects that influence the decision. Following the Delphi survey, 27 items were included and ten items exhibited no consensus which required discussion at the consensus meeting. Sixteen participants attended the meeting, including additional patient/family representatives invited to increase representation from this key group (n = 2). We reached consensus for the inclusion of 28 outcome items, including one selected at the consensus meeting. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified outcomes that should be measured as a minimum in all evaluations of interventions to enhance proxy decisions about trials. These relate to the process of decision-making, proxies experience of decision-making, and factors that influence decision-making such as understanding. Further work with people with impairing conditions and their families is needed to explore their views about the COS and to identify appropriate outcome measures and timing of measurement.

Their V protein is a key player in the evasion of the host innate immune response. We previously showed that the Henipavirus V proteins consist of a long intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (NTD) and a -enriched C-terminal domain (CTD). These terminals are critical for V binding to DDB1, which is a cellular protein that is a component of the ubiquitin ligase E3 complex, as well as binding to MDA5 and LGP2, which are two host sensors of viral RNA. Here, we serendipitously discovered that the Hendra virus V protein undergoes a liquid-to-hydrogel phase transition and identified the V region responsible for this phenomenon. This region, referred to as PNT3 and encompassing residues 200C310, was further investigated using a combination of biophysical and structural approaches. Congo red binding assays, together with negative-staining transmisison electron microscopy (TEM) studies, show that PNT3 forms amyloid-like fibrils. Fibrillation abilities are dramatically reduced in a rationally designed PNT3 variant in which a stretch of three contiguous tyrosines, falling within an amyloidogenic motif, were replaced by three alanines. Worthy to note, Congo red staining experiments provided hints that these amyloid-like fibrils form not only in vitro but also in cellula after transfection or infection. The present results set the stage for further investigations aimed at assessing the functional role of phase separation and fibrillation by the Henipavirus V proteins.","output":"Identification of a Region in the Common Amino-terminal Domain of Hendra Virus P, V, and W Proteins Responsible for Phase Transition and Amyloid Formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to promote the rapid identification of the contacts of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and therefore the control of the pandemic.

Some reports proposed that patient selection criteria should be stringent, and pheochromocytoma (PHE) should be taken as an advanced indication. The aim of this study is to compare LESS adrenalectomy (ADX) with conventional adrenalectomy (CL-ADX) in patients with PHE, with attention paid not only to immediate postoperative outcomes but also to the intraoperative hemodynamic changes that occur with each technique. METHODS The records of 265 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic ADX at Keio University Hospital in Tokyo from January 2001 to June 2011 were entered into a database. Surgical procedures were performed or supervised by two experienced laparoscopic surgeons, who performed more than 100 cases of urologic laparoscopic surgery in 2011. Twenty consecutive patients who underwent LESS-ADX from December 2009 to October 2011 were compared with patients who underwent CL-ADX (controls, n = 30) to look at differences in hemodynamic parameters and surgical outcomes in a case-control analysis. RESULTS Each group was equivalent with respect to age, sex, and BMI. The mean size of 50 PHE was 45.1  4.0 mm, the mean operative time was 151.8  10.6 min, and there was no significant difference between the two groups. In one case of LESS-ADX, two additional ports were added. There was no significant difference between the CL-ADX and LESS-ADX groups in terms of operation time, total fluid during the operation, estimated blood loss, first oral feeding, postoperative stay in the intensive care unit, or postoperative hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS We consider the safety of LESS-ADX of PHE as similar to that of CL-ADX. With appropriate pre- and intraoperative hemodynamic control and experienced hands, LESS-ADX could become one of the treatments of choice for resection of PHE.","output":"Does laparoendoscopic single-site adrenalectomy increase surgical risk in patients with pheochromocytoma?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel corona virus pandemic culminated in a global emergency shutting down educational institutions with recommendations of distant learning.

We aimed to study the molecular epidemiology of a major care home outbreak in Denmark. Methods After a staff member had been tested positive on 16 November 2020, a bundle approach programme was initiated including frequent surveillance screenings of residents and staff, isolation and cohorting procedures. This approach also involved limiting the number of visitors and enhancing the use of personal protective equipment, hand hygiene, and environmental cleaning. Naso/oropharyngeal swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction. Available positive samples were sequenced and phylogenetic relationships between the outbreak and local circulating strains were reconstructed. Results In all, 50% (56/114) of residents and 26% (49/190) of staff members became infected during the 46-day outbreak period. Altogether 16% of the infected residents died within 30 days after becoming infected. A total of 44% (46/105) of the samples with SARS-CoV-2 were sequenced. and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a dominant outbreak lineage belonging to Global Lineage B.1.1.29 containing the mutation I233V in the S gene. The outbreak lineage was detected in the community 28 days before its introduction into the care home. Conclusions Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to care homes is associated with severe outbreaks.

All patients received heparin thromboprophylaxis, which was increased to the anticoagulation dose with D-dimer greater than 3g/mL. RESULTS A total of 127 patients were followed up, of whom 73 underwent pulmonary computed tomography angiography (mean age, 54  12 years; 49 men). Sixty-two of the 73 patients (84.9%) received full anticoagulation before computed tomography angiography. In addition, 18 of the 73 patients had pulmonary embolism (24.7%). When comparing patients with and without pulmonary embolism, no significant differences were observed in age, sex, obesity, smoking, Wells and revised Geneva scores, D-dimer or mortality. Anticoagulant use was similar in both groups. Days from the start of anticoagulation until computed tomography angiography were significantly lower in the pulmonary embolism group (p = 0.002).

We need detailed evidence of the impact on reproductive health in India so that lessons can be learnt. METHODS: Hospital-based repeated monthly survey of nine severe maternal complications and death in 15 hospitals across five states in India covering a total of 202,986 hospital births, December-2018 through to May-2021. We calculated incidence rates (with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) per 1000 hospital births, case-fatality and rate ratios (RR) with 95% CIs. Linear regression was used to examine the association between the Government Response Stringency Index (GRSI) for India and changes in hospital births, incidence and case-fatality. FINDINGS: There was a significant decrease in hospital births per month during the pandemic period with a 4.8% decrease per 10% increase in the GRSI scores (p < 0.001). The overall incidence of severe complications in the pandemic period was not significantly different from the pre-pandemic period, but hospital admissions from septic abortion was 56% higher (RR=1.56; 95% CI=1.22C1.99; p < 0.001).

There is strong public interest by the communities surrounding VEC to engage with all stakeholders towards the sustainable development of hydrocarbon in the region. The methodological framework of the exposome concept would allow for the holistic identification of all relevant environmental exposures by engaging the most relevant stakeholders in industrially contaminated sites. The main objectives of this study were to: (i) evaluate the stakeholders perceptions of the environmental and public health risks and recommended actions associated with the VEC hydrocarbon activities, and (ii) assess the stakeholders understanding and interest towards exposome-based technologies for use in oil and gas applications. Methods: Six major groups of stakeholders were identified: local authorities, small-medium industries (SMIs) (including multi-national companies), small-medium enterprises (SMEs), academia/professional associations, government, and the general public residing in the communities surrounding the VEC. During 2019C2021, a suite of stakeholder engagement initiatives was deployed, including semi-structured interviews (n = 32), a community survey for the general public (n = 309), technical meetings, and workshops (n = 4). Results from the semi-structured interviews, technical meetings and workshops were analyzed through thematic analysis and results from the community survey were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Almost all stakeholders expressed the need for the implementation of a systematic health monitoring system for the VEC broader area and its surrounding residential communities, including frequent measurements of air pollutant emissions. Moreover, stricter policies by the government about licensing and monitoring of hydrocarbon activities and proper communication to the public and the mass media emerged as important needs. The exposome concept was not practiced by the SMEs, but SMIs showed willingness to use it in the future as part of their research and development activities. Conclusions: The sustainable development of hydrocarbon exploitation and processing prospects for Cyprus involves the VEC. Continuous and active collaboration and mutual feedback among all stakeholders involved with the VEC is essential, as this may allow future environmental and occupational health initiatives to be formalized.","output":"Stakeholders Perceptions of Environmental and Public Health Risks Associated with Hydrocarbon Activities in and around the Vasilikos Energy Center, Cyprus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases have been reported in Hubei Province, China.

These data seem to imply that speakers avoid dropping their voice pitch too low by planning the height of sentence-initial pitch peaks prior to speaking. However, the length effect on sentence-initial pitch peaks appears to vary across different types of sentences, speakers and languages. Therefore, the notion that speakers plan sentence intonation in advance due to the limitations in low voice pitch leaves part of the data unexplained. Consequently, this study suggests a complementary cognitive account of length-dependent pitch scaling. In particular, it proposes that the sentence-initial pitch raise in long sentences is related to high demands on mental resources during the early stages of sentence planning. To tap into the cognitive underpinnings of planning sentence intonation, this study adopts the methodology of recording eye movements during a picture description task, as the eye movements are the established approximation of the real-time planning processes. Measures of voice pitch (Fundamental Frequency) and incrementality (eye movements) are used to examine the relationship between (verbal) working memory (WM), incrementality of sentence planning and the height of sentence-initial pitch peaks.","output":"Cognitive constraints on advance planning of sentence intonation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Marine floras are highly diverse and productive.

This paper describes the center's response from mid-March through June 30, 2020. METHODS A comprehensive needs assessment was conducted with agricultural stakeholders. Agriculture-specific COVID-19 resources were developed and disseminated, and a farmer/employer survey was launched. RESULTS The WCAHS COVID-19 resources web page, worksite checklist, and training guide were shared on over 50 web pages nationally. As of June 30, 2020, 282 online surveys have been received. Ongoing informal discussions with agricultural stakeholders indicate a disconnect between the experiences of farmers/employers and farmworkers in relation to COVID-19 prevention at the worksite. Initial survey responses indicate that implementing social distancing is one of the greatest challenges at the worksite. Confusion over local, state, and federal guidelines and which to follow is another concern. CONCLUSION The WCAHS response to COVID-19, in close collaboration with agricultural stakeholders, represents a useful model for a rapid response to a public health crisis by regional centers. Key elements to its success include rapid personalized communication with a wide range of agricultural stakeholders, an actively engaged External Advisory Board, the development of industry-specific resources and information, recurring and iterative engagement with stakeholders as new COVID-19 information emerged and resources were developed, and the identification of the unique gap WCAHS was positioned to fill.

Notably, social isolation in older adults is associated with a heightened risk of cardiovascular, autoimmune, and mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety). Furthermore, the mental health of women in particular has been greatly impacted by the pandemic. Although previous research indicates that social isolation among older adults is a serious public health concern, less is known about the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this issue. The primary objective is to investigate the effects of social isolation on mental health indices and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older women in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants include 77 postmenopausal women (aged 60+) who completed self-report measures online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Controlling for education and annual household income in all analyses, we used linear regression models to investigate the effects of social isolation on depression, anxiety, alcohol use, binge eating, and the 8 domains of the SF-36. Results indicate that, when controlling for education and income, social isolation significantly predicted depression, binge eating, and poorer HRQOL in all 8 domains of the SF-36 (all ps < .01) Social isolation did not predict anxiety and alcohol consumption when controlling for these sociodemographic variables.

However, understanding the pathogenesis, vaccines and antiviral drugs for EBV-associated disease has been hampered by the lack of suitable animal models. Tree shrew is a novel laboratory animal with a close phylogenetic relationship to primates, which is a critical advantage for many animal models for human disease, especially viral infections. Herein, we first identified the key residues in the CR2 receptor that bind the gp350 protein and facilitate viral entry. We found that tree shrew shares 100% sequence identity with humans in these residues, which is much higher than rabbits (50%) and rats (25%). In vitro analysis showed that B lymphocytes of tree shrews are susceptible to EBV infection and replication, as well as EBV-enhanced cell proliferation. Moreover, results of in vivo experiments show that EBV infection in tree shrews resembles EBV infection in humans. The infected animals exhibited transient fever and loss of weight accompanied by neutropenia and high viremia levels during the acute phase of the viral infection. Thereafter, tree shrews acted as asymptomatic carriers of the virus in most cases that EBV-related protein could be detected in blood and tissues. However, a resurgence of EBV infection occurred at 49 dpi. Nanopore transcriptomic sequencing of peripheral blood in EBV-infected animals revealed the dynamic changes in biological processes occurring during EBV primary infection. Importantly, we find that neutrophil function was impaired in tree shrew model as well as human Infectious Mononucleosis datasets (GSE85599 and GSE45918). In addition, retrospective case reviews suggested that neutropenia may play an important role in EBV escaping host innate immune response, leading to long-term latent infection. Our findings demonstrated that tree shrew is a suitable animal model to evaluate the mechanisms of EBV infection, and for developing vaccines and therapeutic drugs against EBV.","output":"Tree Shrew Is a Suitable Animal Model for the Study of Epstein Barr Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB) is known to the world for many years.

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is highly effective, however in patients that present with neurological symptoms the case-fatality ratio is extremely high (>99%). During the last decades several attempts to identify potent and effective antivirals were made. Only a few of these demonstrated improvement in clinical signs in animal studies and none of the trials in humans showed significant efficacy. Here we explore novel opportunities to identify more potent anti-rabies molecules. In particular important progress has been made on antivirals against other Mononegavirales (paramyxoviruses, filoviruses) which should be an impetus to test and optimize these molecules towards anti-rabies virus therapies. Effective rabies antivirals for therapeutic use need to be molecules that can be dosed into the cerebrospinal fluid and that rapidly and potently block ongoing virus replication and as such stop the further spread of the virus. Antivirals for prophylactic use can also be envisaged and these should be able to prevent infection of peripheral nerve cells and should have the potential to replace the current anti-rabies immunoglobulins that are used in PEP.","output":"The path towards effective antivirals against rabies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We calculate the frequency of games with a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium in the ensemble of n-player, m-strategy normal-form games.

All patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary severity criteria were included. AKI was defined using Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. A systematic urinary analysis was performed. The incidence, severity, clinical presentation, biological characterization (transient versus persistent AKI; proteinuria, haematuria and glycosuria) and short-term outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were included, with basal serum creatinine (SCr) of 69  21 mol/L. At admission, AKI was present in 8/71 (11%) patients. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] follow-up was 17 (12C23) days. AKI developed in a total of 57/71 (80%) patients, with 35% Stage 1, 35% Stage 2 and 30% Stage 3 AKI; 10/57 (18%) required renal replacement therapy (RRT). Transient AKI was present in only 4/55 (7%) patients and persistent AKI was observed in 51/55 (93%).

Patients completed surveys at enrollment and 5, 14 and 30 days after enrollment that included the Acute Otitis Media Severity of Symptoms (AOM-SOS?) scale. All patients had nasopharyngeal otopathogen testing completed. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients had been enrolled through December 2020 (all of whom were subsequently tested for SARS CoV-2). During the study period for this case series, 16 patients were enrolled, and 7 (43.6%) were identified with AOM/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. Among these 7 patients, fever was present in 3 children (29%). Four children (57%) attended daycare. Only 2 children (29%) had testing for SARS CoV-2 as part of their clinical workup. Mean AOM-SOS(?) scores were similar among the SARS CoV-2 positive and negative patients with no statistical significance noted with two-sided t-tests: 13.6 ( 4.5) vs 14.2 ( 4.9) at enrollment, 1.4 ( 1.8) vs 4.2 (4.9) on Day 5, and 0.6 ( 0.9) vs. 2.5 (6.1) on Day 14 (Table 1). Among the 7 patients, no child had an AOM treatment failure or recurrence. Of the 6 patients in whom bacterial and viral testing have been completed, a bacterial otopathogen was identified in 6 (100%), and a viral pathogen in 3 (50%) children (Table 2). Table 1. Clinical features of children with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 and AOM [Image: see text] Table 2. Laboratory findings of children with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 and AOM. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 can occur in children with AOM. It is important that providers maintain a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 even in patients with clinical evidence of AOM, particularly to ensure families are appropriately advised on isolation and quarantine requirements. AOM with SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to be more severe than AOM without SARS-CoV-2. DISCLOSURES: Samuel R.

PM exposure has been associated with several human diseases, notably respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In particular, recent evidence suggests that exposure to biomass-derived PM associates with airway inflammation and can aggravate asthma and other allergic diseases. Defective or excess responsiveness in the immune system regulates distinct pathologies, such as infections, hypersensitivity, and malignancies. Therefore, PM-induced modulation of the immune system is crucial for understanding how it causes these diseases and highlighting key molecular mechanisms that can mitigate the underlying pathologies. Emerging evidence has revealed that immune responses to biomass-derived PM exposure are closely associated with the risk of diverse hypersensitivity disorders, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergen sensitization. Moreover, immunological alteration by PM accounts for increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Evidence-based understanding of the immunological effects of PM and the molecular machinery would provide novel insights into clinical interventions or prevention against acute and chronic environmental disorders induced by biomass-derived PM.","output":"Mechanistic Implications of Biomass-Derived Particulate Matter for Immunity and Immune Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Varicose veins are common and frequently cause patient distress. In recent years, Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative to traditional open venous ligation surgery. AIMS The aim of this study was to directly compare RFA and open saphenofemoral ligation. METHODS This was a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Consecutive patients undergoing surgical management over a 2-year period commencing from January 2011 were studied. Radiological success, peri-operative serological testing and hospital length of stay were documented. Procedural cost was calculated. A focused cohort analysis was undertaken to compare the initial 50 RFA procedures performed with the last 50. RESULTS During the study period, 296 patients underwent surgical intervention. A total of 204 patients underwent RFA. Sixty-six percent of all patients were female. RFA was associated with a reduction in overnight hospital stay (18 vs. 78 %, P = <0.001) when compared with open ligation with a success rate of 98 %. No significant inter-group difference was noted for 30-day readmission (p = 0.203). Focused cohort analysis identified an increase in hospital day case activity (74 vs. 90 %, p = 0.002), which contributed to a reduction in procedural cost (1,024 vs. 971, p = 0.003) over the study period. CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency ablation is a viable alternative to open repair offering excellent efficacy. It is however associated with a higher procedural cost than the open surgical option.","output":"Radiofrequency ablation: an assessment of clinical and cost efficacy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) have major roles in the evaluation of parenchymal lung diseases in immunocompromised patients. Given the limited evidence, lack of standardized practice, and variable perception of procedural safety, uncertainty still exists on what constitutes the best approach in critically ill patients with immunocompromised state who present with pulmonary infiltrates in the era of prophylactic antimicrobials and the presence of new diagnostic tests. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic yield, safety and impact of FB and BAL on management decisions in immunocompromised critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A prospective, observational study of 106 non-HIV immunocompromised patients admitted to the intensive care unit with pulmonary infiltrates who underwent FB with BAL. RESULTS: FB and BAL established the diagnosis in 38 (33%) of cases, and had a positive impact on management in 44 (38.3%) of cases. Escalation of ventilator support was not required in 94 (81.7%) of cases, while 18 (15.7%) required invasive and 3 (2.6%) required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation after the procedure. Three patients (2.6%) died within 24 h of bronchoscopy, and 46 patients (40%) died in ICU. Significant hypoxemia developed in 5% of cases. CONCLUSION: FB can be safely performed in immunocompromised critically ill patients in the ICU. The yield can be improved when FB is done prior to initiation of empiric antimicrobials, within 24 h of admission to the ICU, and in patients with focal disease.","output":"The Diagnostic Yield, Safety, and Impact of Flexible Bronchoscopy in Non-HIV Immunocompromised Critically Ill Patients in the Intensive Care Unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mutation of SARS-CoV-2 influences viral function as residue replacements affect both physiochemical properties and folding conformations. Although a large amount of data on SARS-CoV-2 is available, the investigation of how viral functions change in response to mutations is hampered by a lack of effective structural analysis. Here, we exploit advances in protein structure fingerprint technology to study the folding conformational changes induced by mutations. With the integration of both protein sequences and folding conformations and alignments of SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2, the UK variant and India variant, we found that structural variations in the spike protein at the binding interface interacting with ACE2 play a critical role in coronavirus entry into human cells. Additionally, the structural variations impact vaccine effectiveness and drug function over the course of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

Currently, billions of people around the world are ordered to stay at home and use remote connection technologies to prevent the spread of the disease. The COVID-19 crisis brought a new reality to network service providers that will eventually accelerate the deployment of edge computing resources to attract the massive influx of users traffic. The user can elect to procure its resource needs from any edge computing provider based on a variety of attributes such as price and quality. The main challenge for the user is how to choose between the price and multiple quality of service deals when such offerings are changing continually. This problem falls under multi-attribute decision-making. This paper investigates and proposes a novel auction mechanism by which network service brokers would be able to automate the selection of edge computing offers to support their end-users. We also propose a multi-attribute decision-making model that allows the broker to maximize its utility when several bids from edge-network providers are present.

Therefore, this research tries to design and develop a mobile application that allows learners to perform a self-diagnostic on their learning progress. In this research, we conducted a mobile application usability evaluation for 36 students who participated in non-F2F Arduino practice learning. To this end, we applied the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implement, and Evaluation) model to develop a self-diagnostic mobile application for students learning progress according to the learning content. The research tool modified and distributed the question item appropriate for this subjects study for the mobile usability evaluation that was used in the previous study. This research applied the ADDIE model to analyze the characteristics of students and learning contents, including designed learning contents, database, menu structure, developed learning contents, and mobile application. After using this in non-F2F practice learning for 15 weeks, a mobile application usability evaluation was conducted. As a result of the study, due to receiving usability scores between 3.53 and 4.42, it was found that the learning progress self-diagnostic in non-F2F practice learning was essential and that mobile applications were useful in non-F2F practice learning. Additionally, 33 out of 36 students responded that it would be useful for their learning if they actively used it in other subjects as well.

Thirty-three human cadaveric functional spinal units were subjected to axial compression at three magnitudes of lateral eccentricity of the applied force. Injury was identified by high-speed video and graded by spine surgeons. Linear regression was used to define neck injury tolerance values based on a criterion incorporating coronal plane loads accounting for specimen sex, age, size and bone density. Larger coronal plane eccentricity at injury was associated with smaller resultant coronal plane force. The level of coronal plane eccentricity at failure appears to distinguish between the types of injuries sustained, with hard tissue structure injuries more common at low levels of eccentricity and soft tissue structure injuries more common at high levels of eccentricity.

DESIGN: : Cross-sectional study based on an online survey using quantitative methods. SETTING: : Midwives working in Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: : Self-selected convenience sample of 630 members of the Swiss FEDERATION OF MIDWIVES MEASUREMENT: : Open questions on advantages of health care at a distance and workrelated characteristics were used in the online questionnaire. The information was coded and integrative content analysis was applied. FINDINGS: : A good half of the respondents associated telemedicine with either an advantage beyond the pandemic (Reduced workload, Improved health care provision, Greater self-care of clients), while the others saw a pandemic-related advantage (Protection from COVID-19, Maintaining care/counselling in an exceptional situation), or no advantage at all. Older, more experienced midwives were less likely to see an advantage beyond the pandemic. The motive Reduced workload was positively associated with professionals aged younger than 40 years and midwives with up to 14 years of professional experience, and Protection from COVID-19 was more likely cited by midwives aged 50 and more and by midwives working solely in hospitals. Midwives who stated Maintaining care and Improved health care provision as motives to embrace telemedicine were more likely to experience health care at a distance as a positive treatment alternative.

In March 2019, we removed as much plastic litter as possible from Aldabra Atoll, a remote UNESCO World Heritage Site, and estimated the money and effort required to remove the remaining debris. We removed 25 tonnes at a cost of $224,537, which equates to around $10,000 per day of clean-up operations or $8,900 per tonne of litter. We estimate that 513 tonnes (95% CI 212C814) remains on Aldabra, the largest accumulation reported for any single island.

By weight, the composition is dominated by litter from the regional fishing industry (83%) and flip-flops from further afield (7%). Given the serious detrimental effects of plastic litter on marine ecosystems, we conclude that clean-up efforts are a vital management action for islands like Aldabra, despite the high financial cost and should be integrated alongside policies directed at turning off the tap.

How IAV balances the replication and transcription of its multiple genome segments is not understood. We developed a dual competition assay based on the co-transfection of firefly or Gaussia luciferase-encoding genome segments together with plasmids encoding IAV polymerase subunits and nucleoprotein. At limiting amounts of polymerase subunits, expression of the firefly luciferase segment was negatively affected by the presence of its Gaussia luciferase counterpart, indicative of competition between reporter genome segments. This competition could be relieved by increasing or decreasing the relative amounts of firefly or Gaussia reporter segment, respectively. The balance between the luciferase expression levels was also affected by the identity of the untranslated regions (UTRs) as well as segment length. In general it appeared that genome segments displaying inherent higher expression levels were more efficient competitors of another segment. When natural genome segments were tested for their ability to suppress reporter gene expression, shorter genome segments generally reduced firefly luciferase expression to a larger extent, with the M and NS segments having the largest effect. The balance between different reporter segments was most dramatically affected by the introduction of UTR panhandle-stabilizing mutations. Furthermore, only reporter genome segments carrying these mutations were able to efficiently compete with the natural genome segments in infected cells. Our data indicate that IAV genome segments compete for available polymerases. Competition is affected by segment length, coding region, and UTRs. This competition is probably most apparent early during infection, when limiting amounts of polymerases are present, and may contribute to the regulation of segment-specific replication and transcription.","output":"Competition between Influenza A Virus Genome Segments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies have revealed the presence ofastroviruses and rotavirus in numerous poorly performing and healthy chicken and turkey flocks in the United States. The phylogenetic analysis of the sequence data produced during these studies has identified four groups of avian astroviruses circulating in the United States: turkey astrovirus types 1 and 2 (TAstV-1 and TAstV-2), avian nephritis virus (ANV), and a chicken-origin astrovirus (CAstV). As the molecular epidemiology of poultry enteric disease is poorly understood, the development of updated diagnostic assays is crucial to the continued surveillance and management of enteric disease in affected as well as healthy flocks. This report details the development of a multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay specific for astroviruses and avian rotavirus in turkey-origin and chicken-origin samples. The assay consists of two multiplex tests, one for turkey-origin samples and one for chicken-origin samples. The turkey sample test differentially identifies TAstV-1, TAstV-2, ANV, and avian rotavirus. The test for chicken-origin samples differentially identifies CAstV, ANV, and avian rotavirus. Assay sensitivity varied by target sequence between approximately 10 copies for avian rotavirus alone and approximately 2 x 10(6) copies for TAstV-2 in the presence of a heterologous competitor RNA sequence. Each test was shown to be specific for the intended target by testing for cross-reaction with other common avian enteric viruses. The specificity was further shown by testing 109 chicken specimens and 32 turkey specimens from commercial flocks with the appropriate test and sequencing the RT-PCR amplicons to confirm amplification of the correct target.","output":"A multiplex RT-PCR test for the differential identification of turkey astrovirus type 1, turkey astrovirus type 2, chicken astrovirus, avian nephritis virus, and avian rotavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has spread throughout the world; various forecast models have been used to predict the development of the pandemic.

We combined the new model with a Gompertz-growth model, a generalized logistic model, and a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model; and fitted them via Bayesian methods to data from Cuba and Spain. The combined-model fits yielded better Bayesian-Information-Criterion values than the Gompertz, logistic, and SIR models alone. This suggests the new model can achieve improved descriptions of the evolution of a Covid-19 epidemic wave. The new model is also able to provide reliable predictions of the epidemic evolution in a short period of time.

Here, we examined relationships between vocal emotion recognition and socio-emotional adjustment in children. The sample included 141 6- to 8-year-old children, and the emotion tasks required them to categorize five emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, plus neutrality), as conveyed by two types of vocal emotional cues: speech prosody and non-verbal vocalizations such as laughter. Socio-emotional adjustment was evaluated by the children's teachers using a multidimensional questionnaire of self-regulation and social behaviour. Based on frequentist and Bayesian analyses, we found that, for speech prosody, higher emotion recognition related to better general socio-emotional adjustment. This association remained significant even when the children's cognitive ability, age, sex and parental education were held constant. Follow-up analyses indicated that higher emotional prosody recognition was more robustly related to the socio-emotional dimensions of prosocial behaviour and cognitive and behavioural self-regulation. For emotion recognition in non-verbal vocalizations, no associations with socio-emotional adjustment were found. A similar null result was obtained for an additional task focused on facial emotion recognition.

Here we assess the immune responses of individuals after vaccination with the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22. We measured neutralizing antibody responses after the first and second immunizations using pseudoviruses that expressed the wild-type spike protein or a mutated spike protein that contained the eight amino acid changes found in the B.1.1.7 variant. The sera from individuals who received the vaccine exhibited a broad range of neutralizing titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced against the B.1.1.7 variant. This reduction was also evident in sera from some patients who had recovered from COVID-19.

The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1(REACT-1) has estimated swab-positivity approximately monthly since May 2020 in England from RT-PCR testing of self-administered throat and nose swabs in random non-overlapping cross-sectional community samples. Estimating infection incidence from swab-positivity requires an understanding of the persistence of RT-PCR swab positivity in the community. Methods During round 8 of REACT-1 from 6 January to 22 January 2021, of the 2,282 participants who tested RT-PCR positive, we recruited 896 (39%) from whom we collected up to two additional swabs for RT-PCR approximately 6 and 9 days after the initial swab. We estimated sensitivity and duration of positivity using an exponential model of positivity decay, for all participants and for subsets by initial N-gene cycle threshold (Ct) value, symptom status, lineage and age. Estimates of infection incidence were obtained for the entire duration of the REACT-1 study using P-splines. Results We estimated the overall sensitivity of REACT-1 to detect virus on a single swab as 0.79 (0.77, 0.81) and median duration of positivity following a positive test as 9.7 (8.9, 10.6) days. We found greater median duration of positivity where there was a low N-gene Ct value, in those exhibiting symptoms, or for infection with the Alpha variant. The estimated proportion of positive individuals detected on first swab, P0, was found to be higher for those with an initially low N-gene Ct value and those who were pre-symptomatic. When compared to swab-positivity, estimates of infection incidence over the duration of REACT-1 included sharper features with evident transient increases around the time of key changes in social distancing measures. Discussion Home self-swabbing for RT-PCR based on a single swab, as implemented in REACT-1, has high overall sensitivity. However, participants' time-since-infection, symptom status and viral lineage affect the probability of detection and the duration of positivity.

METHODS: The expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by RT-PCR in corneal and scleral tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors who were eliminated from a surgical use per Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) donor screening guidelines or medical director review or positive COVID-19 test. Ocular levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RT-PCR), Envelope and Spike proteins (immunohistochemistry) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies (ELISA) in blood were evaluated in 10 COVID-19 donors.

Children with intellectual disability, especially adolescents, have a higher risk of being overweight/obese and having poor HRPF levels. Therefore, more interventions are needed to help this population attain their optimal health levels. However, there has been relatively limited research on this population compared with on their typically developing peers. OBJECTIVE: The proposed study aims to fill this knowledge gap by developing and examining the success of a physical activity (PA) intervention for the target population. METHODS: The proposed study will be a 12-week, school-based randomized controlled trial. The participants (N=48) will be recruited from special schools for students with mild intellectual disability and then randomly allocated to either the intervention group (IG) or the wait-list control group (CG). During the intervention period, the participants in the IG will receive a fun gameCbased moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) training program (2 sessions/week, 60 minutes/session, for a total of 24 sessions). The intensity of the activities will increase in a progressive manner. Participants in the CG will receive no program during the study period, but the same PA program will be provided to them after the completion of the study. To observe and evaluate the sustaining effects of the intervention, follow-up testing will be scheduled for the participants 12 weeks after the intervention concludes. The study outcomes will include primary outcomes (obesity- and fitness-related outcomes) and a secondary outcome (blood pressure). All of the measurements will be taken at 3 time points. After the follow-up tests, the same PA training program will be provided to the participants in the CG. RESULTS: This study is ongoing. The participants were recruited from October 2020 to November 2020. The total duration of the study is 13 months. Study results are expected at the end of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed study is expected to reduce obesity and improve HRPF levels in children with intellectual disability. If proven effective, the intervention will be made accessible to more special schools and mainstream schools with students with intellectual disability. Furthermore, the study can serve as an example for international researchers, policy makers, and members of the public who are seeking to tackle the problem of obesity and poor HRPF among children with intellectual disability.

Invasive mechanical ventilation IMV can support gas exchange in patients failing non-invasive ventilation, but its reported outcome is highly variable between countries. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on IMV for COVID-associated ARDS to study its outcome among different countries. METHODS: CENTRAL, MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were systematically searched up to August 8, 2020. Studies reporting five or more patients with end point outcome for severe COVID 19 infection treated with IMV were included. The main outcome assessed was mortality. Baseline, procedural, outcome, and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled with random-effect methods. Subgroup analysis for different countries was performed. Meta-regression for the effect of study timing and patient age and were tested. Publication bias was examined. This trial was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42020190365. FINDINGS: Our electronic search retrieved 4770 citations, 103 of which were selected for full-text review. Twenty-one studies with a combined population of 37359 patients with COVID-19 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. From this population, 5800 patients were treated by invasive mechanical ventilation. Out of those, 3301 patients reached an endpoint of ICU discharge or death after invasive mechanical ventilation while the rest were still in the ICU. Mortality from IMV was highly variable among the included studies ranging between 21% and 100%. Random-effect pooled estimates suggested an overall in-hospital mortality risk ratio of 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.608 to 0.797; I2 = 98%). Subgroup analysis according to country of origin showed homogeneity in the 8 Chinese studies with high pooled mortality risk ratio of 0.97 (I2 = 24%, p = 0.23) (95% CI = 0.94-1.00), similar to Italy with a low pooled mortality risk ratio of 0.26 (95% CI 0.08-0.43) with homogeneity (p = 0.86) while the later larger studies coming from the USA showed pooled estimate mortality risk ratio of 0.60 (95% CI 0.43-0.76) with persistent heterogeneity (I2 = 98%, p<0.001). Meta-regression showed that outcome from IMV improved with time (p<0.001). Age had no statistically significant effect on mortality (p = 0.102). Publication bias was excluded by visualizing the funnel plot of standard error, Egger's test with p = 0.714 and Begg&Mazumdar test with p = 0.334. INTERPRETATION: The study included the largest number of patients with outcome findings of IMV in this current pandemic.

The results should encourage physicians to use this facility when indicated for severely ill COVID-19 patients.","output":"Variation in outcome of invasive mechanical ventilation between different countries for patients with severe COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused delays in definitive treatment of patients with prostate cancer. Beyond the immediate delay a backlog for future patients is expected. Such delays can lead to disease progression. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop guidance on criteria for prioritization for surgery and reconfiguring management pathways for non-metastatic stage of prostate cancer who opt for surgical treatment. A second aim was to identify the infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to achieve low likelihood of COVID-19 hazard if radical prostatectomy was to be carried out during the outbreak and whilst the disease is endemic. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: An accelerated consensus process and systematic review. We conducted a systematic review of the evidence on COVID-19 and reviewed international guidance on prostate cancer. These were presented to an international prostate cancer expert panel (n=34) through an online meeting. The consensus process underwent three rounds of survey in total. Additions to the second- and third-round surveys were formulated based on the answers and comments from the previous rounds. OUTCOME MEASURES: Consensus opinion was defined as &#8805;80% agreement, which were used to reconfigure the prostate cancer pathways. RESULTS: Evidence on the delayed management of patients with prostate cancer is scarce. There was 100% agreement that prostate cancer pathways should be reconfigured and develop measures to prevent nosocomial COVID-19 for patients treated surgically. Consensus was reached on prioritization criteria of patients for surgery and management pathways for those who have delayed treatment. IPC measures to achieve a low likelihood of nosocomial COVID-19 were coined as \\"COVID-19 cold sites\\". CONCLUSION: Re-configuring management pathways for prostate cancer patients is recommended if significant delay (>3-6 months) in surgical management is unavoidable. The mapped pathways provide guidance for such patients. The IPC processes proposed provide a framework for providing radical prostatectomy within an environment with low COVID-19 risk during the outbreak or when the disease remains endemic. The broader concepts could be adapted to other indications beyond prostate cancer surgery.","output":"Management of patients who opt for radical prostatectomy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: an international accelerated consensus statement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The predominant approach for antibody generation remains animal immunization, which can yield exceptionally selective and potent antibody clones owing to the powerful evolutionary process of somatic hypermutation.

Job satisfaction was assessed through the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), while MSK pain was investigated by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ). Moreover, a home workplace analysis had to be carried out according to current Italian regulations. Participants declared that they were less productive (39.2%) but less stressed (39.2%) and equally satisfied (51%) compared to the time of office working. Regarding MSK disorders, low back pain (LBP) was referred by 41.2% of home workers and neck pain by 23.5% of them. Neck pain worsened in 50% of home workers, while LBP did not exacerbate in 47.6% of cases. Home workers with MSK pain reported a lower job satisfaction.

However, the total deficit in screening in the US associated with the pandemic and the differential impact on individuals in different geographic regions and by socioeconomic status (SES) index have yet to be fully characterized. Objectives To quantify the screening rates for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in different geographic regions and for individuals in different SES index quartiles and estimate the overall cancer screening deficit in 2020 across the US population. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study uses the HealthCore Integrated Research Database, which comprises single-payer administrative claims data and enrollment information covering approximately 60 million people in Medicare Advantage and commercial health plans from across geographically diverse regions of the US. Participants were individuals in the database in January through July of 2018, 2019, and 2020 without diagnosis of the cancer of interest prior to the analytic index month. Exposures Analytic index month and year. Main Outcomes and Measures Receipt of breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer screening. Results Screening for all 3 cancers declined sharply in March through May of 2020 compared with 2019, with the sharpest decline in April (breast, -90.8%; colorectal, -79.3%; prostate, -63.4%) and near complete recovery of monthly screening rates by July for breast and prostate cancers. The absolute deficit across the US population in screening associated with the COVID-19 pandemic was estimated to be 3.9 million (breast), 3.8 million (colorectal), and 1.6 million (prostate). Geographic differences were observed: the Northeast experienced the sharpest declines in screening, while the West had a slower recovery compared with the Midwest and South. For example, percentage change in breast cancer screening rate (2020 vs 2019) for the month of April ranged from -87.3% (95% CI, -87.9% to -86.7%) in the West to -94.5% (95% CI, -94.9% to -94.1%) in the Northeast (decline). For the month of July, it ranged from -0.3% (95% CI, -2.1% to 1.5%) in the Midwest to -10.6% (-12.6% to -8.4%) in the West (recovery). By SES, the largest screening decline was observed in individuals in the highest SES index quartile, leading to a narrowing in the disparity in cancer screening by SES in 2020. For example, prostate cancer screening rates per 100 000 enrollees for individuals in the lowest and highest SES index quartiles, respectively, were 3525 (95% CI, 3444 to 3607) and 4329 (95% CI, 4271 to 4386) in April 2019 compared with 1535 (95% CI, 1480 to 1589) and 1338 (95% CI, 1306 to 1370) in April 2020.

This study aimed to investigate the suitable timing to transfer D6 blastocysts in FET cycles and to identify factors affecting clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and early miscarriage rate (EMR) in FET cycles with blastocysts. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included 1788 FET cycles with blastocysts. There were 518 cycles with D6 blastocysts, and 1270 cycles with blastocysts formed and cryopreserved on day 5 (D5 blastocysts) (D5 group). According to the blastocyst transfer timing, the cycles with D6 blastocysts were divided into cycles with D6 blastocysts transferred on day 5 (D6-on-D5 group, 103 cycles) and cycles with D6 blastocysts transferred on day 6 (D6-on-D6 group, 415 cycles). The chi-square test, independent t-test or Mann-Whitney test, and logistic regression analysis were used for data analysis. RESULTS The CPR and implantation rate (IR) were significantly higher in the D6-on-D5 group than in the D6-on-D6 group (55.3% vs. 37.3%, 44.8% vs. 32.6%, P < 0.01). The CPR and IR were significantly higher in the D5 group than in the D6-on-D5 group (66.0% vs. 55.3%, 62.1% vs. 44.8%, P < 0.05), and the EMR was significantly lower in the D5 group than in the D6-on-D5 group (11.2% vs. 21.1%, P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that transfer D6 blastocysts on day 5, instead of day 6, could significantly increase the CPR (odds ratio[OR]: 2.031, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.296-3.182, P = 0.002). FET cycles with D6 blastocysts transferred on day 5 had a higher EMR than those with D5 blastocysts (OR: 2.165, 95% CI: 1.040-4.506, P = 0.039).

In the present study, we observed potential targets of Cx43 to determine new molecular functions in cardio-protection. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of Cx43 co-immunoprecipitated proteins showed that Cx43 interacts with several proteins related to metabolism. In GeneMANIA network analysis, SGSM3, which has not been previously associated with Cx43, was highly correlated with Cx43 in heart functions, and high levels of SGSM3 appeared to induce the turnover of Cx43 through lysosomal degradation in myocardial infarcted rat hearts. Moreover, we confirmed that lysosomal degradation of Cx43 is dependent upon the interaction between SGSM3 and Cx43 in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. The functional importance of the interaction between SGSM3 and Cx43 was confirmed by results showing that Cx43 expression was enhanced by SGSM3 siRNA knockdown in H9c2 cells.

Several studies compared the quality of life between patients with PTMC who underwent active surveillance with immediate total thyroidectomy. However, thyroid lobectomy is a quite acceptable intermediate alternative for most patients with PTMC, with less surgical morbidity.

References in this conversation are primarily to works after 2016. LeCompte briefly remarks on the importance of Since I Can Remember C one of the Groups ongoing works in progress in 2021 C as an archival project that draws on Valks memory of how Nayatt School was made during her formative years. Having become, since then, a quintessential Wooster Group performer, Valk extended her artistic skills to stage direction, undertaking, most recently, The B-Side (2017). Both the initiative and idea for the piece came from performer Eric Berryman, who had brought Valk the collection of blues, songs, spirituals, and preachings on the 1965 LP made from the research of scholar folklorist Bruce Chapman. Berryman had been inspired to approach Valk because of her exclusive use of unadulterated historical recordings in Early Shaker Spirituals (2014), her directorial debut. The main work in rehearsal during 2020 and which was still locked down by the Covid-19 pandemic at the time of this conversation is The Mother, a Wooster Group variant of Brechts dramatized version of Gorkys novel, directed by LeCompte. LeCompte discusses the current situation, emphasizing the increased vulnerability of independent artists and small-scale theatre, while giving a glimpse of the disadvantages for such groupings built into the North American system of project funding. The Wooster Group is a salient example of small-scale theatre that, despite continually precarious conditions, which the pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated, has achieved its creative goals and has defined its place in the exploratory avant-garde flourishing vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s. This particular avant-garde, LeCompte believes, has seen various important developments over the years but might well now be counting its last days.

Children are at high risk of developing IGD, however, previous studies have principally focused on the condition in adults and adolescents and reported non-clinical samples. A large-scale survey is needed to research and evaluate IGD and anxiety in children and adolescents to understand the current situation of IGD in children and explore the impact of IGD on anxiety. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire was conducted between March 1 and July 31, 2021. A total of 10,479 school children and adolescents in the western provinces of China were selected by convenience sampling. A questionnaire was used to collect data anonymously. The questionnaire covered IGD and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Welch's ANOVA Test and Games-Howell test were used to test for differences in anxiety levels between IGD groups. Poisson regression analysis was used to further investigate the key predictors of IGD. RESULTS: 3.2% of participants (n = 334) (95% CI: 2.9C3.2%) were classified as at high risk of presenting with IGD, 71.1% (n = 7,454) (95% CI: 70.3C72.0%) were classified as low-risk players, and 25.7% (n = 2,691) (95% CI: 24.9C26.5%) were classified as non-gaming. The average RCMAS score was (7.18  7.534). The high-risk group had a higher total score RCMAS, as well as scoring higher in its three dimensions. Regression analysis using gender, age, and total RCMAS score as independent variables, and risk of IGD as a dependent variable showed that the odds ratio (OR) for gender was 2.864 (95% CI: 2.267C3.618), and the OR for total RCMAS score was 1.101 (95% CI: 1.087C1.114). The OR for age was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Anxiety was a predictor of IGD, with statistically significant group differences in total anxiety, as well as the dimensions of physiological anxiety, social correlation, and sensitivity. The timely assessment of anxiety in children and adolescents, training social skills, and facilitating effective integration into society could be effective ways of reducing the incidence and impact of IGD.","output":"Differential Effects of Anxiety on Internet Gaming Disorder: A Large-Scale Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid\\\\19 pandemic forces North American churches to reckon with long\\\\standing crises and questions surrounding online community, access to worship, decline in membership, the struggle of small congregations, and the reality of our global communion.

By drawing on the existing literature, the study selects various determinants of sick and dead pig recycling and evaluates the impacts of rewards and punishment mechanisms on farmers commitment to proper handling of dead and sick pigs. We utilized face-to-face discussion accompanied by a structured questionnaire to grasp the opinion of the Chinese pig farmers. The article elucidates the moderating effects of reward and punishment mechanisms, which will be crucial for understanding the on-hand experience of the farmers towards dead and sick pig recycling. ABSTRACT: Improper handling of sick and dead pigs may seriously affect public health, socio-economic conditions, and eventually cause environmental pollution. However, effective promotion of sick and dead pig (SDP) waste recycling has become the prime focus of current rural governance. Therefore, the study explores the impact of commitment, rewards, and punishments to capture the recycling behavior of farmers sick and dead pig waste management. The study employs factor analysis, the probit model, and the moderating effect model to craft the findings. The studys empirical setup comprises the survey data collected from the Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, representing the major pig-producing provinces in China. The study found that the commitment, reward, and punishment mechanisms are essential factors affecting the farmers decision-making on recycling sick and dead pig waste. The marginal effect analysis found that the reward and punishment mechanism is more effective than the farmers commitment. The study confirmed that in the recycling treatment of sick and dead pig waste, the farmers commitment and the governments reward and punishment policy are the main factors that influence farmers to manage sick and dead pig waste properly. Therefore, the government should highlight the importance of effective waste management, and training facilities should also be extended firmly. The government should impose strict rules and regulations to restrict the irresponsible dumping of farm waste. Monitoring mechanisms should be put in place promptly.","output":"Determinants of Sick and Dead Pig Waste RecyclingA Case Study of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) It has affected 213 countries and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances, thus producing a significant impact on the physical and mental health, behaviour and economy In this era of crisis, lot of guidelines and measures to combat the disease are present, but the area of adverse mental health consequences is still neglected This review attempts to highlight the psychological problems associated with this disease Objective This article aims to retrieve from the existing literature and state the mental effects of COVID-19 Methods A review was developed based on the articles from PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Elsevier, JAMA Network , The Lancet , New England Journal of Medicine , Cell, Wiley, Nature, Science and special databases for COVID like the Stephen B Thacker CDC Library, World Health Organization's COVID-19 research article database, COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, LitCovid The search terms included combination of 'coronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'psychological', 'quarantine', 'children' All the studies mentioning about the mental consequences and interventions for psychological repercussions associated with COVID-19 are eligible for inclusion In addition, the research papers in English language have been included Conclusion There is a need for research among vulnerable population to study the long-term effects of psychological impact of COVID-19","output":"The Psychological Aspects of COVID-19: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives.-To use original mathematics to interpret COVID-19 test metrics;assess US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorizations and Health Canada targets;compare predictive values for multiplex, antigen, polymerase chain reaction kit, point-of-care antibody, and home tests;enhance test performance;and improve decision-making.

Ideally such investigations are performed &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt;, i.e., during a catalytic reaction. An example of &lt;i&gt;operando &lt;/i&gt;measurements is to observe the degradation of fuel cell catalysts during an accelerated stress test (AST). Fuel cell catalysts consist of Pt or Pt alloy nanoparticles (NPs) supported on a high surface area carbon. A key challenge of operando SAXS measurements is a proper background subtraction of the carbon support to extract the information of the size distribution of the Pt NPs as a function of the AST treatment. Typically, such operando studies require the use of synchrotron facilities. The background measurement can then be performed by anomalous SAXS (aSAXS) or in a grazing incidence con-figuration.

Furthermore, within the delta variant cohort, patients with none, partial, and full vaccination were also compared to assess vaccine effectiveness. Findings: For a total of 677 patients with COVID-19 included in this study, their median age was 53.0 years [interquartile range (IQR): 38.0C66.0] and 46.8% were men. No difference was found in age, gender, and percentage of patients with the leading comorbidity between wild-type and delta variant cohorts, but delta variant cohort showed a lessened time interval between disease onset to hospitalization, a reduced portion of patients with smoking history, and a lowered frequency of clinical symptoms. For hematological parameters, most values demonstrated significant differences between wild-type and delta variant cohorts, while full vaccination rather than partial vaccination alleviated the disease condition. This reflected the viremic effect of delta variant when vaccination succeeds or fails to protect.

OBJECTIVES: In this article, we focus on disability that has occurred with the overall lengthening of LE in many populations and the implications this has for decreased HRQoL. METHODS: We utilize the concept of rectangularization of population survival to depict the rising prevalence of disability associated with increased LE, especially among racial and ethnic minorities and people of low socioeconomic status (SES) and relate this to HRQoL. RESULTS: Disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and healthy life expectancy (HLE) are defined in terms of HRQoL. Specific attention is focused on disability experienced by disparate populations around the globe. By focusing on disparities in DFLE, and the need to expand LE to include HLE as a central component of HRQoL, this work provides an important counterpoint to the attention that has been paid to LE disparities according to race, gender, ethnicity, education, and SES. DISCUSSION: By calling attention to those factors that appear to be the most important drivers of the differences in quality and length of DFLE between different groups (i.e., the components of the social gradient, exposure to chronic stress, systemic inflammation, and the psychological and biological mechanisms associated with the gutCbrain axis) and, by logical extension, HRQoL, we hope to promote research in this arena with the ultimate goal of improving DFLE, HLE, and overall HRQoL, especially in disparate populations around the globe.","output":"Focus on disability-free life expectancy: implications for health-related quality of life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Digestive endoscopy is considered a high-risk procedure for COVID-19.

Simulations of the cumulative number of active cases (including those with comorbidity), at different reinfection rates, show infection peaks reducing with decreasing reinfection of those who have recovered from a previous COVID\\\\19 infection.

Todays cryo-EM maps can frequently reach the atomic-level resolution, while often containing a range of resolutions, with conformationally variable regions obtained at 6 ? or worse. Low resolution density maps obtained for protein flexible domains, as well as the ensemble of coexisting conformational states arising from cryo-EM, poses new challenges and opportunities for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. With the ability to describe the biomolecular dynamics at the atomic level, MD can extend the capabilities of cryo-EM, capturing the conformational variability and predicting biologically relevant short-lived conformational states. Here, we report about the state-of-the-art MD procedures that are currently used to refine, reconstruct and interpret cryo-EM maps. We show the capability of MD to predict short-lived conformational states, finding remarkable confirmation by cryo-EM structures subsequently solved. This has been the case of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing machinery, whose catalytically active structure has been predicted through both long-time scale MD and enhanced sampling techniques 2 years earlier than cryo-EM. In summary, this contribution remarks the ability of MD to complement cryo-EM, describing conformational landscapes and relating structural transitions to function, ultimately discerning relevant short-lived conformational states and providing mechanistic knowledge of biological function.","output":"Molecular Dynamics to Predict Cryo-EM: Capturing Transitions and Short-Lived Conformational States of Biomolecules"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an immense threat to healthcare systems worldwide. At a time when elective surgeries are being suspended and questions are being raised about how the remaining procedures on COVID-19 positive patients can be performed safely, it is important to consider the potential role of robotic assisted surgery within the current pandemic. Recently, several robotic assisted surgery societies have issued their recommendations. To date, however, no specific recommendations are available for cardiothoracic robotic assisted surgery in COVID-19 positive patients. Here, we discuss the potential risks, benefits, and preventive measures that need to be taken into account when considering robotic assisted surgery for cardiothoracic indications in patients with confirmed COVID-19. It is suggested that robotic assisted surgery might have various advantages such as early recovery after surgery, shorter hospital stay, and reduced loss of blood and fluids as well as smaller incisions. However, electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices, as well as CO2 insufflation should be managed with caution to prevent the risk of aerosolization of viral particles.","output":"Cardiothoracic robotic assisted surgery in times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China and later spread to every corner of the globe.

Cerebral cerebrospinal fluid loss in the presence of altered brain viscoelastic properties has previously been suggested as the pathophysiologic process leading to ventriculomegaly, despite low or negative intracranial pressures and patent shunts. More recently, cerebral venous overdrainage has been proposed as a possible explanation in the pathogenesis of LPH, although its connection to lumbar punctures in patients with shunts has not been contemplated yet. The effectiveness of epidural blood patch in the management of post-lumbar puncture LPH has been shown in children but has not been reported in adults. CASE DESCRIPTION: Herein we detail 2 episodes of shunt malfunction in a 30-year-old female patient with a history of hydrocephalus related to a posterior fossa tumor diagnosed during childhood. In both instances, imaging studies demonstrated ventricular dilation along with perimedullary cistern enlargement and brainstem distortion, which occurred following a lumbar puncture despite a patent shunt. A lumbar blood patch was effective in both episodes, enabling resolution of the ventriculomegaly and a good outcome. CONCLUSIONS: A blood patch can be efficient in adults with post-lumbar puncture LPH. Some symptoms may be explained by brainstem compression caused by enlarged cerebrospinal fluid spaces at the skull base. The role of cerebral venous overdrainage in the setting of post-lumbar puncture LPH is further supported.","output":"Low-Pressure Hydrocephalus and Shunt Malfunction Following a Lumbar Puncture in an Adult Reversed by an Epidural Blood Patch"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, mammalian cells have become the primary host cells for the production of recombinant therapeutic proteins (RTPs).

Since then, several clinical characteristics have been associated with poor outcomes. This study aimed to describe the morbidity profile of COVID-19 deaths in Portugal. Methods: A study was performed including deaths certificated in Portugal with COVID-19 (ICD-10: U07.1 or U07.2) coded as the underlying cause of death from the National e-Death Certificates Information System between 16 March and 31 December 2020. Comorbidities were derived from ICD-10 codes using the Charlson and Elixhauser indexes. The resident Portuguese population estimates for 2020 were used. Results: The study included 6701 deaths (death rate: 65.1 deaths/100,000 inhabitants), predominantly males (72.1). The male-to-female mortality ratio was 1.1. The male-to-female mortality rate ratio was 1.2; however, within age groups, it varied 5.0C11.4-fold. COVID-19 deaths in Portugal during 2020 occurred mainly in individuals aged 80 years or older, predominantly in public healthcare institutions. Uncomplicated hypertension, uncomplicated diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, dementia, and cerebrovascular disease were observed among COVID-19 deceased patients, with prevalences higher than 10%. A high prevalence of zero morbidities was registered using both the Elixhauser and Charlson comorbidities lists (above 40.2%). Nevertheless, high multimorbidity was also identified at the time of COVID-19 death (about 36.5%). Higher multimorbidity levels were observed in men, increasing with age up to 80 years old. Zero-morbidity prevalence and high multimorbidity prevalences varied throughout the year 2020, seemingly more elevated in the mortality waves peaks, suggesting variation according to the degree of disease incidence at a given period.

We studied the associations between group size, serum acute phase proteins, immunoglobulin G (IgG), calf morbidity and growth of dairy-beef calves in a random field trial in a calf-rearing unit in Finland. The randomized trial was carried out at a calf rearing unit, where approximately 80 dairy or crossbred calves were allocated either into a single group of 40 calves or into four groups of 10 on arrival at the calf-rearing unit (at age 24.1 SD  9.2 days). The study was carried out on 6 arrival batches: 476 calves. Calves were clinically examined and blood sampled on arrival (day 0), and haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA), albumin and IgG were determined. Calves were weighed on arrival (day 0, average age 24.1 days), at the end of the milk feed period (day 49), at approximately 200 days of age and at slaughter (carcass weight) at 15-18 months of age. During the rearing calves were observed by the farm workers and treated, if necessary, according to predetermined instructions of the veterinary surgeon. All NSAID and antimicrobial treatments were recorded and used as morbidity indicators in statistical analysis. There were no differences in the numbers of antimicrobial treatments or growth among the groups. The majority (84.1%) of antimicrobial treatments were used against respiratory tract infections.

Complex relationships between group size, morbidity, concentrations of serum acute phase proteins and IgG at arrival, and growth of calves were explored. Group size of 10 calves did not protect calves from respiratory tract infections, when the small groups were sharing the air space with a large group. An increased SAA concentration on arrival was associated with poorer average daily gain at two rearing periods and with lower carcass weight at slaughter. Serum proteins could be valuable health indicators for purchased calves because they have numerous and variable associations with health and growth.

Community-based interventions may improve the accessibility, availability, and acceptance of this vital care. For example, community mobilization strategies have been used to involve and collaborate with women, families and communities to improve maternal and newborn health. Objective To synthesize existing reviews of evidence on community mobilization strategies that strengthen support for appropriate and timely use of ANC and PNC. Methods Six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, PROSPERO) were searched for published reviews that describe community mobilization related strategies for ANC and/or PNC. Reviews were eligible for inclusion if they described any initiatives or strategies targeting the promotion of ANC and/or PNC uptake that included an element of community mobilization in a low- or middle-income country (LMIC), published after 2000. Included reviews were critically appraised according to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Evidence Syntheses. This review of reviews was conducted following JBI guidelines for undertaking and reporting umbrella reviews. Results In total 23 papers, representing 22 reviews were included. While all 22 reviews contained some description of community mobilization and ANC/PNC, 13 presented more in-depth details on the community mobilization processes and relevant outcomes. Seventeen reviews focused on ANC, four considered both ANC and PNC, and only one focused on PNC. Overall, 16 reviews reported at least one positive association between community mobilization activities and ANC/PNC uptake, while five reviews presented primary studies with no statistically significant change in ANC uptake and one included a primary study with a decrease in use of antenatal facilities. The community mobilization activities described by the reviews ranged from informative, passive communication to more active, participatory approaches that included engaging individuals or consulting local leaders and community members to develop priorities and action plans. Conclusions While there is considerable momentum around incorporating community mobilization activities in maternal and newborn health programs, such as improving community support for the uptake of ANC and PNC, there is limited evidence on the processes used.

In doing so, this work aims to answer the following research question: which stakeholders are required in an IE within biopharma industry and what are their main roles in the IE value creation. The research strategy was designed according to the grounded theory methodology. By applying this methodology, data were collected through verbatim interviews with several stakeholders. Both data collection and data analysis phases were carried out concurrently up to saturation where all data were identified and their consistency across the many forms was reached. The thesis of the paper intends to prove that biopharma IEs consist of a multilevel and longitudinal set of key stakeholders. Furthermore, by investigating the Lombardy case study, it explains the role of each stakeholder with regards to the comparative advantages required in the engagement with the IE. In addition, arising from a holistic view of the biopharma IEs, this research traces the biopharma IE dynamics through the analysis of the IEs driving forces. This paper represents one of the first heuristic attempts to analyze in-depth biopharma IE from a holistic perspective. The paper findings can be considered to be an impactful extension to biopharma IEs world-wide. This broader scope is well supported by expert interviews as a central part of the methodology and by the investigated scientific literature.","output":"Biopharmaceutical innovation ecosystems: a stakeholder model and the case of Lombardy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cold\\\\chain management is of high importance in preserving perishable products and in retaining quality.

Prevention measures accelerated an uptake of virtual care over in-person contacts. Here we propose to describe the adoption of this visit mode in a large academic cancer program. Materials and Methods: Four time periods of interest were used for comparison between October 2019 and December 2020;pre-COVID-19, first COVID-19 wave, in-between waves, and second COVID-19 wave. Scheduling data was extracted out of the electronic medical record. Visit types (RO consult, RO on treatment visits (OTV), RO follow-ups, nursing visits), visit modes (in-person, virtual), the patient's primary cancer diagnosis, and provider-specific data were compared across these periods. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the information extracted. Results: On average, the monthly number of RO follow up visits increased during the pandemic months (2077 versus 1681) and decreased for RO consults (445 versus 459) and RO on-treatment visits (966 versus 1085). The virtual visit mode was used the most during the first wave (65% of all RO visits), and at its lowest between the two waves defined (55%). Virtual mode was used the most for RO follow-ups (76%), followed by RO consults (42%). RO OTVs had the least virtual mode uptake (25%). Patients with a genitourinary cancer had the most virtual visits reported during the pandemic (86%) whereas patients with a head and neck primary had the least (36%). There was a wide range of per-provider virtual care adoption (36% to 86%). The average number of monthly in-person nursing interventions for patients decreased during the pandemic (731 versus 795). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced rapid adoption of virtual care along the cancer care continuum. From our review, the visit type and the patient's primary diagnosis seemed to influence the uptake of virtual care the most.

Moreover, the uncertainty that came with COVID-19 and its associated social stigma may worsen what was already a crisis (burnout) among oncologists. Data are scarce on the impact of COVID-19 on the occupational health and safety of oncologists in low and middle-income countries. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in February 2021 to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on practicing oncologists in Alexandria governorate, Egypt. An anonymised self-reporting questionnaire was electronically distributed to 88 participants to collect information on occupational safety at work, the prevalence of COVID-19 among respondents and the impact of COVID-19 on their wellbeing, including perceived burnout and family support. RESULTS: Out of the 88 contacted oncologists, 75% completed the survey. The mean age of participants was 34.79 years (SD  10.42), of which 45% were residents, 36% were specialists and 18% were consultants. Most of the oncologists (58% of 66) felt they were not adequately protected against COVID-19. The majority (78% of 66) have managed COVID-19 infected cancer patients, and 76% (out of 66) had experienced COVID-19 like symptoms. A third (n = 21) of the respondents were confirmed COVID-19 infected: 62% of the latter thought they were infected at the workplace, either by a patient or a colleague. The majority of the oncologists (78%) perceived being more overwhelmed or burned out than in the pre-COVID-19 era. Nearly half of the participants (48%) reported their family members and friends had reduced contact with them despite being COVID-19 negative, in fear of being infected. The burnout was significantly higher in those lacking family support than those who had, 52% versus 28% respectively (p = 0.038).

We use logistic regressions to examine associations between mental health and pandemic-related stressors, structural factors (gender, age), and lifelong protective/risk factors (parent and peer relationship, wealth, long-term health problems, past emotional problems, subjective well-being) measured at younger ages. SETTING: A geographically diverse, poverty-focused sample, also reaching those without mobile phones or internet access. PARTICIPANTS: 10 496 individuals were approached; 9730 participated. Overall, 8988 individuals were included in this study; 4610 (51%) men and 4378 (49%) women. Non-inclusion was due to non-location or missing data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms consistent with at least mild anxiety or depression were measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (&#8805;5) or Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (&#8805;5). RESULTS: Rates of symptoms of at least mild anxiety (depression) were highest in Peru at 41% (32%) (95% CI 38.63% to 43.12%; (29.49-33.74)), and lowest in Vietnam at 9% (9%) (95% CI 8.16% to 10.58%; (8.33-10.77)), mirroring COVID-19 mortality rates. Women were most affected in all countries except Ethiopia. Pandemic-related stressors such as health risks/expenses, economic adversity, food insecurity, and educational or employment disruption were risk factors for anxiety and depression, though showed varying levels of importance across countries. Prior parent/peer relationships were protective factors, while long-term health or emotional problems were risk factors.

Approach and Results: All patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study from January 19 to April 16, 2020, in Korea. We evaluated the association between the use of statins and COVID-19-related mortality in the overall and the nested 1:2 propensity score-matched study. Furthermore, a comparison of the hazard ratio for death was performed between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia between January and June 2019 in Korea. The median age of the 10 448 COVID-19 patients was 45 years. Statins were prescribed in 533 (5.1%) patients. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, Cox regression showed a significant decrease in hazard ratio associated with the use of statins (hazard ratio, 0.637 [95% CI, 0.425-0.953]; P=0.0283).

We aimed to assess the burden of chronic symptomatic FBDs on ambulatory care delivery in the United States and evaluate patterns of treatment. Methods Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to estimate annual rates and associated costs of ambulatory visits for symptomatic irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic functional abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea. The weighted proportion of visits associated with pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic (stress/mental health, exercise, diet counseling) interventions were calculated, and predictors of treatment strategy were evaluated in multivariable multinomial logistic regression. Results From 2007-2015, 36.9 million [95% CI, 31.4-42.4] weighted visits in non-federal patients for chronic symptomatic FBDs were sampled. There was an annual weighted average of 2.7 million [95% CI, 2.3-3.2] visits for symptomatic IBS/chronic abdominal pain, 1.0 million [95% CI, 0.8-1.2] visits for chronic constipation, and 0.7 million [95% CI, 0.5-0.8] visits for chronic diarrhea. Pharmacologic therapies were prescribed in 49.7% [95% CI, 44.7%-54.8%] of visits, compared to non-pharmacologic interventions in 19.8% [95% CI, 16.0%-24.2%] of visits (P < .001). Combination treatment strategies were more likely to be implemented by primary care physicians and in patients with depression or obesity. The direct annual cost of ambulatory clinic visits alone for chronic symptomatic FBDs is $358 million USD [95% CI, $233-482 million]. Conclusions The management of chronic symptomatic FBDs is associated with considerable health care resource utilization and cost. There may be an opportunity to improve comprehensive FBD management as fewer than 1 in 5 ambulatory visits include non-pharmacologic treatment strategies.","output":"Epidemiologic Burden and Treatment of Chronic Symptomatic Functional Bowel Disorders in the United States: A Nationwide Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Minute virus of canines (MVC), also known as canine parvovirus type 1, was initially believed to be a nonpathogenic agent, since it was first isolated from canine fecal specimens in the late 1960s.

The virus also has been shown to cause fetal deaths. Nevertheless, the virus was not detected in dogs outside the United States until recently, presumably because of a lack of widespread availability of the only susceptible canine cell line, WRCC/3873D, used for MVC isolation.

In this study, we explored clinical outcomes of patients with a high-risk diabetic foot who had been prescribed with custom-molded offloading footwear under different adherence conditions. METHODS: A total of 48 patients (17 females and 31 males) with high-risk diabetic feet, who had been with prescribed offloading footwear in 13 medical centers across 4 cities, were enrolled in the current study. The patients were assigned into either continuous offloading therapy (COT, n = 31) or interrupted offloading therapy (IOT, n = 17) groups, according to their adherence to the therapy. All patients were followed up monthly, and differences in recurrence, amputation, and deaths between the groups were analyzed at 4 months after therapy.

Results: The app, when compared to the FDA-cleared and novel references, respectively, showed a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.65 (SD=1.49) and 1.14 (1.44), relative MAE of 12.2 (9.23) and 9.5 (18.70) and bias of 0.81 (limits of agreement (LoA) =-3.27-4.89) and 0.08 (-3.68-3.51). Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.700 and 0.885. 93% of participants successfully operated the app on their first use. Conclusions: The accuracy and usability of the app demonstrated here show promise for the use of mHealth solutions employing smartphone sensors to remotely monitor RR.

The aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the spread of COVID-19 and enhance disease control strategies. We assessed the SIRD (susceptible, infected, recovered and death) model to describe COVID-19 reported cases in Cameroon from March 7 to May 31, 2020, and study the impact of social distancing. We assessed changes in the basic reproduction number (R(0)) on a phaseadjusted process and forecasted the longterm epidemic trend. Daily incidence data was fitted to a log-linear model before each peak of the epidemic with the purpose of studying the effective mechanism of variation of the reproduction number R(e). Before the first peak of the epidemic, R(0) was estimated as 6.8. Social distancing and restricted measures contributed to reduce the value to 3.24 by April 30 but remained greater than 1 (R(0)=2.43) by May 22 when the initial measures implemented by the government to control the spread of the disease were relaxed. The estimated number of infections ranged 13,703-18,456 by May 31, and will continue increasing throughout June 2020 with more than 20,000 cases expected by the end of June 2020, suggesting that the pandemic is still in the growth phase.

The aim of this work is to assess the frequency, patterns, and determinants of persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms and to evaluate the value of a proposed novel COVID-19 symptom score. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 in a hospital-based registry were included in a cross-sectional study (the hospitals including Assiut University Hospital, Assiut Chest Hospital, Aswan University Hospital, and Aswan Specialized Hospital). The patient demographics, comorbid disorders, the mean duration since the onset of the symptoms, history of hospital or ICU admittance, and the treatment taken during the acute state, as well as symptom score before and after convalescence, were recorded. RESULTS: The most frequent constitutional and neurological symptoms were myalgia (60.0%), arthralgia (57.2%), restriction of daily activities (57.0%), and sleeping troubles (50.9%), followed by anorexia (42.6%), chest pain (32.6%), gastritis (32.3%), cough (29.3%), and dyspnea (29.1%). The mean total score of acute stage symptoms was 31.0  16.3 while post-COVID 19 symptom score was 13.1  12.6 (P < 0.001). The main determinants of the persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms were the need for oxygen therapy (P < 0.001), pre-existing hypertension (P = 0.039), chronic pulmonary disorders (P = 0.012), and any chronic comorbidity (P = 0.004). There was a correlation between the symptom score during the acute attack and post-COVID-19 stage (P < 0.001, r = 0.67). The acute phase score had 83.5% sensitivity and 73.3% specificity for the cutoff point > 18 to predict occurrence of post-COVID-19 symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 can present with a diverse spectrum of long-term post-COVID-19 symptoms. Increased acute phase symptom severity and COVID-19 symptom score > 18 together with the presence of any comorbid diseases increase the risk for persistent post-COVID-19 manifestations and severity.","output":"Determinants of persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms: value of a novel COVID-19 symptom score"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical exercise can be effective in preventing or ameliorating various diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(23): 897-904. Summary. In the fight against the epidemic, the use of masks has become commonplace, which is a significant challenge in everyday communication situations. This problem has been present in some areas of healthcare in the past, but today's universal use of masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) is both a symbolic and practical barrier between doctor and patient, making it difficult to establish an effective communication and connectivity on several levels. Therefore, it has become necessary to develop unified communication protocols that help building a relationship of trust in healthcare so that emotional availability of providers and safe physical distance are achieved simultaneously. The aim of our study is to summarize the effects of mask wearing and PPE usage on the physician-patient communication and also the trust and empathy processes that emerge within the relationship through the review of the current literature. We would also like to draw attention to the effects on healthcare staff. Our goal is also to formulate recommendations, taking into account domestic and international experience, that can be used to improve the communication of healthcare professionals, and through that, the satisfaction of the most important actors in care, patients and caregivers.

In this research, we investigated the effect of social distancing duration on negative moods and memory. The relation between social distancing duration and both negative mood and memory errors followed the same U-shaped function: negative moods and memory errors initially decreased as social distancing duration increased, and then at approximately 30 days, they began to increase. Subsequent analyses indicated that memory errors were mediated by lonely mood in particular.

One avenue that financially constrained healthcare institutions pursued were donation platforms that offered access to donated PPE by individuals and organizations. We document a real-life case study of one of the most prominent donor platforms that emerged during this period: Get Us PPE.

METHODS: Individual billable services were identified by Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System CPT and G codes. Medicare utilization and payments were stratified by specialty and type of service (electrodiagnostic tests, including NCS and electromyography (EMG), and other neurologic procedures). We also assessed access to Medicare physicians using the annual number of unique beneficiaries receiving initial Evaluation and Management (E/M) services. RESULTS: We identified 676,113 Medicare providers included in all analysis years from 2012-2016 (10,599 neurologists, 5,881 physiatrists, and 659,633 other specialties). Comparing 2016to 2012, 21.1% fewer neurologists, 28.6% fewer physiatrists, and 69.3% fewer other specialists performed NCS and 3.8% fewer neurologists, 21.7% fewer physiatrists, and 5.6% fewer other specialists performed EMG. For NCS providers in 2012, the mean number of unique Medicare beneficiaries increased for neurologists (1.2%) and physiatrists (4.8%) but decreased for other specialists (-6.5%) by 2016. Following the NCS cut, the number of providers performing autonomic and evoked potential testing increased substantially. CONCLUSIONS: The Medicare NCS reimbursement policy resulted in a larger decrease in NCS providers than in EMG providers. Despite fewer neurologists and physiatrists performing NCS, Medicare access to these physicians for E/M services was not affected.

The role of MRF has also been advocated in modulation of state of arousal leading to transition from wakefulness to sleep and it is further considered to be a main player in the pathophysiology of gait disorders seen in Parkinson's disease. However, the existence of a mesencephalic locomotor region and of an arousal center has not yet been demonstrated in primates. Here, we provide the first extensive electrophysiological mapping of the MRF using extracellular recordings at rest and during locomotion in a nonhuman primate (NHP) (Macaca fascicularis) model of bipedal locomotion. We found different neuronal populations that discharged according to a phasic or a tonic mode in response to locomotion, supporting the existence of a locomotor neuronal circuit within these MRF in behaving primates. Altogether, these data constitute the first electrophysiological characterization of a locomotor neuronal system present within the MRF in behaving NHPs under normal conditions, in accordance with several studies done in different experimental animal models.

To overcome these obstacles, we developed a non-invasive one-step RT-qPCR assay performed directly on saliva specimens. The University of Nottingham Asymptomatic Testing Service (UoNATS) protocol simplifies sample collection and bypasses the need for RNA extraction, additives, or extraneous processing steps, thus helping to encourage more regular testing and reducing processing time and costs.

Since November 2020, cases were identified through Secondary Uses Services (SUS), a national healthcare activity dataset. A predictive model was developed to estimate PIMS-TS risk and lag times after SARS-CoV-2 infection for the Alpha (weeks 1-10, 2021) and Delta (weeks 22-30, 2022) waves. Findings: During the Alpha wave, the model accurately predicted PIMS-TS cases (506 (95% CI: 491-531) vs 502 observed cases), with a median estimated the risk of 0038% (IQR, 0037-0041%;38/100,000 infections) of paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections. For the Delta wave, the median risk of PIMS-TS was significantly lower at 0026% (IQR, 0025-0029%;27/100,000 infections) , with 212 observed PIMS-TS cases compared to 450 predicted by the model during June-October 2021. Interpretation: We developed a model that accurately predicted national and regional PIMS-TS cases in CYP during the Alpha wave. PIMS-TS cases were, however, 53% lower than predicted during the Delta wave. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of the observed lower risk with the Delta variant.","output":"Risk of Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (PIMS-TS) During the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta Variant Waves: National Observational Study, 2020-21, England (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The clinical application of robotic surgery is increasing. The skills necessary to perform robotic surgery are unique from those required in open and laparoscopic surgery. A validated laparoscopic surgical skills curriculum (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery or FLS?) has transformed the way surgeons acquire laparoscopic skills. There is a need for a similar skills training and assessment tool for robotic surgery. Our research group previously developed and validated a robotic training curriculum in a virtual reality (VR) simulator. We hypothesized that novice robotic surgeons could achieve proficiency levels defined by more experienced robotic surgeons on the VR robotic curriculum, and that this would result in improved performance on the actual daVinci Surgical System?. METHODS 25 medical students with no prior robotic surgery experience were recruited. Prior to VR training, subjects performed 2 FLS tasks 3 times each (Peg Transfer, Intracorporeal Knot Tying) using the daVinci Surgical System? docked to a video trainer box. Task performance for the FLS tasks was scored objectively. Subjects then practiced on the VR simulator (daVinci Skills Simulator) until proficiency levels on all 5 tasks were achieved before completing a post-training assessment of the 2 FLS tasks on the daVinci Surgical System? in the video trainer box. RESULTS All subjects to complete the study (1 dropped out) reached proficiency levels on all VR tasks in an average of 71 ( 21.7) attempts, accumulating 164.3 ( 55.7) minutes of console training time. There was a significant improvement in performance on the robotic FLS tasks following completion of the VR training curriculum. CONCLUSIONS Novice robotic surgeons are able to attain proficiency levels on a VR simulator. This leads to improved performance in the daVinci surgical platform on simulated tasks. Training to proficiency on a VR robotic surgery simulator is an efficient and viable method for acquiring robotic surgical skills.","output":"Proficiency training on a virtual reality robotic surgical skills curriculum."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented pressure to healthcare systems worldwide, resulting in significant and precipitous changes in demand, burden and method of delivery The psychosocial impact of this crisis is likely to increase over the course of the pandemic, peak later than medical cases and endure for longer thereby significantly exceeding medical morbidity It will have far reaching impact on the individual, their family and their care providers Frontline healthcare workers and those with pre-existing mental health difficulties are recognised at increased risk Now that the initial surge has been expertly curtailed, it is essential that urgent consideration is now directed towards the mental health implications of the current outbreak and ensure that we are as ready for the increased MH needs of the community as we were for the intensive medical care","output":"Impact and mechanism of COVID-19 on mental health and wellbeing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ketenzorg is een belangrijk onderdeel van de zorg in de huisartsenpraktijk.

Bisphenols majorly get into us by means of food as they are found in food packaging and beverage containers and can be easily absorbed by the body. They can make way into the body systems either by direct means like skin contact or by indirect means through food that is stored in a bisphenol-coated containers. Exposure of the human system to this compound may bring about mild to adverse ailments ranging from skin irritations to infertility. Pigmentation disorder is one such health condition that occurs due to melanocyte destruction and is caused by bisphenol exposures. They interact with various proteins and enzymes that have been involved in the melanocyte synthesis pathway, thereby disrupting their normal functions. METHODS: In silico analysis has been done to predict the interaction and other descriptive binding parameters when the bisphenol derivatives BPA. BPB, BPC, BPE, BPS and BPAF have been docked with some of the essential proteins for melanin synthesis such as tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1(TRP-1), dopachrome tautomerase/tyrosinase-related protein-2(TRP-2).

This access has been especially critical to households earning less than US $30,000, the majority of whom indicate that smartphones are their main source of internet access. The increasing ubiquity of smartphones and virtual care promises to offset some of the health disparities that cut through the United States. However, disparities cannot be addressed if the medical information offered though smartphones is not accessible or reliable. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to create a framework to review the strengths and weaknesses of mobile Health (mHealth) apps for diverse, low-income populations. METHODS: Focusing on smoking cessation, diabetes management, and medication adherence as models of disease management, we describe the process for selecting, evaluating, and obtaining patient feedback on mHealth apps. RESULTS: The top 2 scoring apps in each category were QuitNow! and Smoke Free-Quit Smoking Now for smoking cessation, Glucosio and MyNetDiary for diabetes management, and Medisafe and MyMeds for medication adherence.

While there are many definitions of longitudinal qualitative research (LQR), its most common characteristics are multiple data collection points and its focus on temporality, which prioritise the study of change and continuity. Thus, LQR can provide insights into the nature, causes and consequences of change (or its absence). In this paper, we discuss the key steps and considerations related to designing and conducting LQR in family medicine and community health. These include (1) deciding on the length of data collection and timing and number of interviews, (2) planning recruitment: attrition versus oversampling, (3) approaching data collection: asking the same or different questions, (4) planning and conducting the analysis and writing up findings, and (5) conducting ethical LQR. We also highlight what LQR can offer family medicine and community health, including (1) allowing exploration of views and experiences of a variety of participants over time; (2) following participants through important transitions; (3) studying implementation of new practices, processes or interventions; (4) exploring the importance of historical change and/or macro context on individuals lives; and (5) developing a deeper understanding of phenomena under study.

Due to the severe pneumonia infiltration, the patient received the clinical-trial treatment Remdesivir. In addition to facing the isolation and new-drug-related anxieties of the patient, the medical team faced difficulties in communicating effectively with the patient and in helping him through the isolation period. During the period of hospitalization (March 14th to April 13th, 2020), the author used Roy's adaptation model to perform a nursing assessment, which confirmed that the patient faced the following problems: (1) ineffective breathing pattern related to COVID-19, (2) impaired verbal communication related to hearing impairment, and (3) social isolation related to the isolation experience and the communication barrier with healthcare workers. During the nursing care process, the author helped the patient receive the antiviral treatment and taught him how to do diaphragmatic breathing in a comfortable, recumbent position to improve his breathing pattern. To reduce the difficulty of communication, the author made a pile of cards with common care-related words, provided pen and paper to write, and used a mobile-phone-based social-networking application to communicate with the patient. The author used writing to communicate with the patient and learned some simple signs from him to enable interaction. Moreover, the intervention helped him adapt to the isolation and treatment protocols to reach holistic nursing care. Based on this experience, the author suggests that hospitals cooperate with sign language organizations to teach healthcare workers simple communication skills, including sign language and cards to provide more complete care for patients with hearing loss during hospitalization.","output":"[Nursing Experience Caring for a COVID-19 Patient With Hearing Loss]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has affected millions of individuals and caused thousands of deaths worldwide. The pathophysiology of the disease is complex and mostly unknown. Therefore, identifying the molecular mechanisms that promote progression of the disease is critical to overcome this pandemic. To address such issues, recent studies have reported transcriptomic profiles of cells, tissues and fluids from COVID-19 patients that mainly demonstrated activation of humoral immunity, dysregulated type I and III interferon expression, intense innate immune responses and inflammatory signaling. Here, we provide novel perspectives on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 using robust functional approaches to analyze public transcriptome datasets. In addition, we compared the transcriptional signature of COVID-19 patients with individuals infected with SARS-CoV-1 and Influenza A (IAV) viruses. We identified a core transcriptional signature induced by the respiratory viruses in peripheral leukocytes, whereas the absence of significant type I interferon/antiviral responses characterized SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also identified the higher expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways including heme biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation and tryptophan metabolism. A BTM-driven meta-analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients showed significant enrichment for neutrophils and chemokines, which were also significant in data from lung tissue of one deceased COVID-19 patient. Importantly, our results indicate higher expression of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation both in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes and BALF, suggesting a critical role for mitochondrial activity during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

While omicron was capable of binding to ACE2 efficiently, antibodies elicited by infection or immunization showed reduced IgG binding and ACE2 binding inhibition compared to WT and all VOC. Among vaccinated samples, antibody binding responses towards omicron were only improved following administration of a third dose. Overall, our results identify that omicron can still bind ACE2 while pre-existing antibodies can bind omicron.

METHODS: A retrospective multicentre ecological analysis was undertaken evaluating all blood cultures taken from adults from 01 April 2017 to 30 April 2020 across five acute hospitals in London. Linear trend analysis and ARIMA models allowing for seasonality were used to look for significant variation. RESULTS: One hundred nineteen thousand five hundred eighty-four blood cultures were included. At the height of the UK SARS-CoV-2 first wave in April 2020, Enterobacterales bacteraemias were at an historic low across two London trusts (63/3814, 1.65%), whilst all CoNS BSI were at an historic high (173/3814, 4.25%). This differed significantly for both Enterobacterales (p = 0.013), CoNS central line associated BSIs (CLABSI) (p < 0.01) and CoNS non-CLABSI (p < 0.01), when compared with prior periods, even allowing for seasonal variation. S. pneumoniae (p = 0.631) and S. aureus (p = 0.617) BSI did not vary significant throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly fewer than expected Enterobacterales BSI occurred during the UK peak of the COVID-19 pandemic; identifying potential causes, including potential unintended consequences of national self-isolation public health messaging, is essential. High rates of CoNS BSI, with evidence of increased CLABSI, but also likely contamination associated with increased use of personal protective equipment, may result in inappropriate antimicrobial use and indicates a clear area for intervention during further waves.","output":"Bacteraemia variation during the COVID-19 pandemic; a multi-centre UK secondary care ecological analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Young and middle-aged people are vulnerable to developing acute stress disorder (ASD) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

In comparison with PBDT-Se and PBDSe-Se, PBDSe-T with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]diselenophene unit and thiophene -bridge exhibits the deepest HOMO energy level and the strongest crystallinity in neat films. The PBDSe-T:Y6 blend film exhibits the best absorption complementarity, the most distinctive face-on orientation with proper phase separation, the highest carrier mobilities, and the lowest charge recombination among three blend films. Finally, the PBDSe-T:Y6-based device delivers an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.50%, which is higher than that of PBDT-Se:Y6 and PBDSe-Se:Y6. Moreover, a decent open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.89 V with a remarkable small energy loss of 0.44 eV was achieved for PBDSe-T:Y6.

Originating as a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia, it turned out that this viral disease termed COVID-19 is not only a respiratory infection, but a systemic disease associated with a number of extrapulmonary complications. One of the medical disciplines that is strongly affected by this viral infection is gastroenterology. COVID-19 causes in some patients typical symptoms of enteritis such as diarrhea or abdominal pain. There is also evidence that this infection may lead to liver and pancreatic injury. Since the SARS-CoV2 virus was detected in stool, a fecal-oral route of transmission is possible. Moreover, viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and enables the invasion of the gastrointestinal epithelium as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the daily practice and the workflows in endoscopy leading to a dramatic decrease of screening and surveillance procedures. COVID-19 impacts the therapy of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly those using high doses of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents and biologics. Patients with preexisting liver disease, especially metabolic associated liver fatty disease (MALFD) with fibrosis or liver cirrhosis, are at high risk for severe COVID-19.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective, cross-protocol analysis to identify and compare pregnancy outcomes reported in 53 Phase 1 and Phase 2a HIV-1 vaccine clinical trials conducted by the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN). RESULTS: Two thousand six hundred seventy-three women of reproductive potential were identified and 193 pregnancies were reported. 39 of 53 (74%) studies had at least one pregnancy reported with an overall pregnancy rate of 3.15 per 100 woman-years (w-yr). While active contraception use was required during study participation, 13 of the 53 studies also contained a long-term follow up period during which pregnancy was no longer discouraged. The pregnancy rate during main study participation was 3.09 per 100 w-yr, while pregnancies occurred at a slightly greater rate in the long-term follow up period (3.22 per 100 w-yr).

From the onset of the pandemic, however, doubts have been expressed concerning the sensitivity of this molecular diagnosis method.

We developed two-color ddPCR assays for the detection of four different regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including non-structural (IP4-RdRP, helicase) and structural (E, N) protein-encoding sequences. We observed that N or E subgenomic RNAs are generally more abundant than IP4 and helicase RNA sequences in cells infected in vitro, suggesting that detection of the N gene, coding for the most abundant subgenomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2, increases the sensitivity of detection during the highly replicative phase of infection.

PURPOSE: To explore the perceptions of pharmacists and administrators who had an integral role in designing and operationalizing an integrated community pharmacist hypertension management program with collaboration between an academic medical center and a regional chain community pharmacy. SUMMARY: Community pharmacists (n = 3), ambulatory care pharmacists (n = 2), medical directors (n = 2), and health-system (n = 1) and pharmacy (n = 1) administrators reported positive experiences engaging with the hypertension management program. Strengths of the program included comprehensive training by the ambulatory care pharmacists, community pharmacist access to the electronic health record (EHR), and primary care providers who were receptive to referring patients and accepting recommendations from the community pharmacists. All participants felt that the program had a positive outlook and saw opportunity for expansion, such as extended hours of operation, new locations, and additional pharmacists. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists are well positioned to extend hypertension management programs from primary care clinics into local pharmacists if they have appropriate training, access to the EHR, and ongoing support from collaborating primary care offices. Additional research using implementation science methods is needed to further test the scalability and replicability of the program among different patient populations, community pharmacies, and health systems.","output":"Pharmacist engagement in a community pharmacy hypertension management program in collaboration with an academic medical center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cerebral microbleeds are increasingly reported in critical ill patients with respiratory failure in need of mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Typically, these critical illness-associated microbleeds involve the juxtacortical white matter and corpus callosum. Recently, this pattern was reported in patients with respiratory failure, suffering from COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we listed patients from March 11, 2020 to September 2, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, critical illness and cerebral microbleeds. Literature research was conducted through a methodical search on Pubmed databases on critical illness-associated microbleeds and cerebral microbleeds described in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: On 279 COVID-19 admissions, two cases of cerebral microbleeds were detected in critical ill patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Based on review of existing literature critical illness-associated microbleeds tend to predominate in subcortical white matter and corpus callosum. Cerebral microbleeds in patients with COVID-19 tend to follow similar patterns as reported in critical illness-associated microbleeds. Hence, one patient with typical critical illness-associated microbleeds and COVID-19 is reported. However, a new pattern of widespread cortico-juxtacortical microbleeds, predominantly in the anterior vascular territory with relative sparing of deep gray matter, corpus callosum and infratentorial structures is documented in a second case. The possible etiologies of these microbleeds include hypoxia, hemorrhagic diathesis, brain endothelial erythrophagocytosis and/or cytokinopathies.

The chapter describes and reflects on these recent changes in the landscape of childbirth in Chile, arguing they might bring winds of change and reverse the excessive medicalization of birth. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, activist and health professionals were alerted to how recent improvements in maternity care were being threatened and were pushing to accelerate a deep discussion on birth territories and alternatives to hospital. We are confident that after the passing of the pandemic, the humanistic winds of change in Chile will continue to blow with renewed momentum.","output":"Childbirth in Chile: Winds of Change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has resulted in a global pandemic with severe socioeconomic effects. Immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and organ failure. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) on bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells triggers host inflammatory pathways that lead to pathophysiological changes. Proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferon (IFN) signaling in alveolar epithelial cells counter barrier disruption, modulate host innate immune response to induce chemotaxis, and initiate the resolution of inflammation. Here, we discuss experimental models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection, molecular pathways involved in SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation, and viral hijacking of anti-inflammatory pathways, such as delayed type-I IFN response. Mechanisms of alveolar adaptation to hypoxia, adenosinergic signaling, and regulatory microRNAs are discussed as potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Host Response, Immunity, and Therapeutic Targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF STUDY To demonstrate a model for delivery of an international surgical training event, and demonstrate its educational and economic outcomes. STUDY DESIGN The Association of Surgeons in Training (ASiT) ran a course series on 16 January 2016 across the UK and Ireland. A mandatory, self-reported, online questionnaire collected delegate feedback, using 5-point Likert Scales, and a NetPromoter feedback tool. Precourse and postcourse matched questionnaires were collected for 'Foundation Skills in Surgery' (FSS) courses. Paired economic analysis was performed. Statistical analysis was carried out using RStudio (V.3.1.1 Boston, Massachusetts, USA). RESULTS Forty courses were held across the UK and Ireland (65.0% technical, 35.0% non-technical), with 184 faculty members. Of 570 delegates, 529 fully completed the feedback survey (92.8% response rate); 56.5% were male. The median age was 26 years (range: 18-67 years). The mean overall course NetPromoter Score was 8.7 out of 10. On logistic regression high NetPromoter Score was associated with completing a Foundation Skills in Surgery course (R=0.44, OR: 1.49, p=0.025) and having clear learning outcomes (R=0.72, OR: 2.04, p=0.029) but not associated with specialty, course style or teaching style. For Foundation Skills in Surgery courses, delegates reported increased commitment to a career in surgery (p<0.001), confidence with basic surgical skills (p<0.001) and confidence with assisting in theatre (p<0.001). A comparable cost saving of 231,462.37 was calculated across the 40 courses. CONCLUSION The ASiT '40-4-40' event demonstrated the diversity and depth of surgical training, with 40 synchronous technical and non-technical courses, demonstrable educational benefit and a significant cost saving to surgical trainees.","output":"40-4-40: educational and economic outcomes of a free, international surgical training event."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the relationship between daily weather and transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2, and to develop a generalised model for future prediction of the COVID-19 spreading rate for a certain area with meteorological factors. DESIGN: A retrospective, qualitative study. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We collected 382 596 records of weather data with four meteorological factors, namely, average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and air visibility, and 15 192 records of epidemic data with daily new confirmed case counts (1 587 209 confirmed cases in total) in nearly 500 areas worldwide from 20 January 2020 to 9 April 2020. Epidemic data were modelled against weather data to find a model that could best predict the future outbreak. RESULTS: Significant correlation of the daily new confirmed case count with the weather 3 to 7 days ago were found. SARS-CoV-2 is easy to spread under weather conditions of average temperature at 5 to 15C, relative humidity at 70% to 80%, wind speed at 1.5 to 4.5 m/s and air visibility less than 10 statute miles. A short-term model with these four meteorological variables was derived to predict the daily increase in COVID-19 cases; and a long-term model using temperature to predict the pandemic in the next week to month was derived. Taken China as a discovery dataset, it was well validated with worldwide data. According to this model, there are five viral transmission patterns, restricted, controlled, natural, tropical and southern. This models prediction performance correlates with actual observations best (over 0.9 correlation coefficient) under natural spread mode of SARS-CoV-2 when there is not much human interference such as epidemic control. CONCLUSIONS: This model can be used for prediction of the future outbreak, and illustrating the effect of epidemic control for a certain area.","output":"Predicting the local COVID-19 outbreak around the world with meteorological conditions: a model-based qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IVIM imaging technology can obtain physiological information of tissue cells and blood perfusion at the same time in one imaging process.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the capacity of three different series of synthetic compounds to inhibit the Candida glabrata enzyme denominated 3-hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase and thus affect ergosterol synthesis and yeast viability. Compounds 1c (-asarone-related) and 5b (with a pyrrolic core) were selected as the best antifungal candidates among over 20 synthetic compounds studied. Both inhibited the growth of fluconazole-resistant and fluconazole-susceptible C. glabrata strains. A yeast growth rescue experiment based on the addition of exogenous ergosterol showed that the compounds act by inhibiting the mevalonate synthesis pathway. A greater recovery of yeast growth occurred for the C. glabrata 43 fluconazole-resistant (versus fluconazole-susceptible) strain and after treatment with 1c (versus 5b). Given that the compounds decreased the concentration of ergosterol in the yeast strains, they probably target ergosterol synthesis. According to the docking analysis, the inhibitory effect of 1c and 5b could possibly be mediated by their interaction with the amino acid residues of the catalytic site of the enzyme. Since 1c displayed higher binding energy than -asarone and 5b, it is the best candidate for further research, which should include structural modifications to increase its specificity and potency. The derivatives could then be examined with in vivo animal models using a therapeutic dose. IMPORTANCE Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is currently an epidemiological alert in health care services due to outbreaks of Candida auris, Candida glabrata, and other fungal species multiresistant to conventional antifungals. Therefore, it is important to propose alternative molecular targets, as well as new antifungals. The three series of synthetic compounds herein designed and synthesized are inhibitors of ergosterol synthesis in yeasts. Of the more than 20 compounds studied, two were selected as the best antifungal candidates. These compounds were able to inhibit the growth and synthesis of ergosterol in C. glabrata strains, whether susceptible or resistant to fluconazole. The rational design of antifungal compounds derived from clinical drugs (statins, fibrates, etc.) has many advantages. Future studies are needed to modify the structure of the two present test compounds to obtain safer and less toxic antifungals. Moreover, it is important to carry out a more in-depth mechanistic approach.","output":"Antifungal Activity of Fibrate-Based Compounds and Substituted Pyrroles That Inhibit the Enzyme 3-Hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA Reductase of Candida glabrata (CgHMGR), Thus Decreasing Yeast Viability and Ergosterol Synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had serious health, social and economic consequences.

While vaccine damage as a scientific fact is statistically highly uncommon, emerging social and technological forces have converted probable vaccine damage into an alternative fact. Methods: Using the Eurobarometer 91.2 survey on a statistically representative EU27-UK sample interviewed in March 2019, we documented perceptions of vaccine risks and identified three belief configurations regarding vaccine effectiveness, safety, and usefulness, through exploratory cluster analysis. Results: The public beliefs in vaccine risks are frequent. Approximatively one-tenth of the EU27-UK population consider vaccines are not rigorously tested before authorization, one-third believe vaccines can overload or weaken the immune system and that they can cause the disease against which they protect, and almost one-half believe vaccines can cause serious side effects. We identified three belief configurations: the skeptical, the confident, and the trade-off clusters. The skeptical type (approx. 11 percent of EU27-UK respondents) is defined by the belief that vaccines are rather ineffective, affected by risks of probable vaccine damage, not well-tested, and useless; the confident type (approx. 59 percent) is defined by beliefs that vaccines are effective, safe, well-tested, and useful; and the trade-off type (approx. 29 percent) combines beliefs that vaccines are effective, well-tested and useful, with beliefs of probable vaccine damage.

This has traditionally involved an in-person appointment. During the Coronavirus Pandemic, these began to be offered as telephone appointments to reduce the number of hospital visits. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of these new telephone assessments and whether they should continue to be offered. METHODS: 20 patients from one renal transplant centre who had a telephone pre-transplant assessment between May and September 2020 were contacted and successfully completed a 12-question questionnaire. It was entirely voluntary and responses were anonymised. RESULTS: 80% of patients built a great rapport with their doctor and all felt able to ask questions. All patients received a set appointment time, although some occurred late and 75% received information leaflets through the post. Most patients received adequate information on the topics specified. Not enough information was given in 20-26% of cases on medications and follow-up post-transplant and SARS-COV-2 risks. 40% preferred a telephone appointment, mainly due to less SARS-COV-2 risk and less hassle. Whereas 55% would rather a face-to-face appointment, due to better abilities to communicate and build relationships. Ideas for improvements were suggested. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone assessments provide a good alternative to in-person pre-transplant assessments. Many patients prefer them, especially with SARS-COV-2 risks, however many still favour face-to-face appointments. Telephone assessments should therefore continue to be offered, but patient preference should be prioritised.

Objective To characterize the clinical features of ZIKV infection at a pediatric referral center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, among children with antenatal ZIKV exposure. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study conducted from May to July 2019 of a prospective cohort of 296 infants with antenatal ZIKV exposure followed up since December 2015 at a tertiary maternity-pediatric hospital. Exposures Zika virus infection during pregnancy. Main Outcomes and Measures Characterization of clinical features with anthropometric, neurologic, cardiologic, ophthalmologic, audiometric, and neuroimaging evaluations in infancy and neurodevelopmental assessments (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition) from 6 to 42 months of age, stratified by head circumference at birth (head circumference within the reference range, or normocephaly [NC] vs microcephaly [MC]). Results Antenatal exposure to ZIKV was confirmed for 219 of 296 children (74.0%) referred to Instituto Fernandes Figueira with suspected ZIKV infection through positive maternal or neonatal polymerase chain reaction analysis or IgM serology results. Of these children, 110 (50.2%) were boys, ages ranged from 0 to 4 years, and 53 (24.2%) had congenital microcephaly. The anomalies observed in ZIKV-exposed children with MC or NC were failure to thrive (MC: 38 of 53 [71.7%]; NC: 73 of 143 [51.0%]), cardiac malformations (MC: 19 of 46 [41.3%]; NC: 20 of 100 [20.0%]), excess nuchal skin (MC: 16 of 22 [72.7%]; NC: 35 of 93 [37.6%]), auditory abnormalities (MC: 13 of 50 [26.0%]; NC: 14 of 141 [9.9%]), and eye abnormalities (MC: 42 of 53 [79.2%]; NC: 28 of 158 [17.7%]). Although they experienced fewer neurologic abnormalities than children born with MC, those with NC also had frequent neurologic abnormalities (109 of 160 [68.1%]), including hyperreflexia (36 of 136 [26.5%]), abnormal tone (53 of 137 [38.7%]), congenital neuromotor signs (39 of 93 [41.9%]), feeding difficulties (15 of 143 [10.5%]), and abnormal brain imaging results (44 of 150 [29.3%]). Among 112 children with NC with Bayley-III evaluations, 72 (64.3%) had average or above-average scores; 30 (26.8%) scored 1 SD below average in at least 1 domain; and 10 (8.9%) scored 2 SD below average in at least 1 domain.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying the link between obesity and disease severity as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the development of new therapeutic interventions and preventive measures in this high-risk group. We propose that multiple features of obesity contribute to the prevalence of severe COVID-19 and complications. First, viral entry can be facilitated by the upregulation of viral entry receptors, like angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), among others. Second, obesity-induced chronic inflammation and disruptions of insulin and leptin signaling can result in impaired viral clearance and a disproportionate or hyper-inflammatory response, which together with elevated ferritin levels can be a direct cause for ARDS and cytokine storm. Third, the negative consequences of obesity on blood coagulation can contribute to the progression of thrombus formation and hemorrhage.

However, the expression of these proteins is often difficult depending upon the expressed protein. In this study, we demonstrated that the addition of arginine hydrochloride and proline to the culture medium dramatically increased protein expression. By culturing bacterial cells in 96-well plates, we were able to rapidly examine the expression conditions and easily scale up to 96 mL of culture for production. Although functional expression of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein without any solubility-enhancing tag in bacterial strains (including Escherichia coli) has not been reported to date, we succeeded in efficiently producing RBD which showed a similar CD spectrum to that of RBD produced by eukaryotic cell expression systems. Furthermore, RBD from the omicron variant (B.1.1.529) was also produced. Physicochemical analyses indicated that omicron RBD exhibited markedly increased instability compared to the wild-type.

The spread of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) across the United States and the globe impacts access to this crucial intervention through widespread societal and institutional changes. In this document, we review the implications of COVID-19 on the emergency care of large-vessel occlusion stroke, reviewing specific infection-control recommendations, available literature, existing resources, and expert consensus. As a population, patients with large-vessel occlusion stroke face unique challenges during pandemics. These are broad in scope. Responses to these challenges through adaptation of stroke systems of care and with imaging, thrombectomy, and postprocedural care are detailed. Preservation of access to thrombectomy must be prioritized for its public health impact. While the extent of required changes will vary by region, tiered planning for both escalation and de-escalation of measures must be a part of each practice.

There has been less research on the experiences and support needs of male victims than those of women. Historically research on mens experiences has not focused on what constitutes effective, needs-led service provision. The aim of this paper was to conduct an integrated mixed methods synthesis of systematic review evidence on the topic of help-seeking by male victims of domestic violence and abuse. METHODS: An integrated mixed methods synthesis approach was taken to enhance our understanding of the complex phenomenon of help seeking by, and service provision to male victims. This process also identifies gaps in the evidence. Using previously identified systematic review data; mixed methods data from four primary-level service evaluation studies, along with expert and patient consultation were used to develop research propositions. Primary-level qualitative interview and survey data from 12 studies of men experiences were mapped onto the propositions to support them. RESULTS: Fourteen propositions were composed. Seven propositions were supported or at least partly supported by the qualitative data. These supported propositions were used to make recommendations for policy and practice particularly concerning service preferences of male victims. The remaining seven propositions were not specifically supported by the qualitative data. These unsupported propositions were used to develop research recommendations concerning the need to further understand the potential blurred boundaries of victimCperpetrator, hybrid perpetrator-victim experiences, men who are/have been victims of childhood sexual abuse and determining the level of risk for men. They also highlight the need to produce better guidance for the response of the police & the criminal justice system. Finally, they highlight the need to produce the most appropriate service for men in terms of access, linkage, substance/alcohol abuse, mental health, sexuality, and race. CONCLUSION: Integrated mixed-methods synthesis of systematic review evidence is a relatively novel approach. This approach can lead to recommendations for policy and practice as well as highlighting gaps in the research agenda as shown in this example.","output":"Help seeking by male victims of domestic violence and abuse: an example of an integrated mixed methods synthesis of systematic review evidence defining methodological terms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Introduction: The prevalence of smoking is high among people living with severe mental illness (SMI). Evidence on feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions among smokers with SMI is lacking, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We aim to test the feasibility and acceptability of delivering an evidence-based intervention (i.e., the IMPACT 4S intervention) that is a combination of behavioural support and smoking cessation pharmacotherapies among adult smokers with SMI in India and Pakistan. We will also test the feasibility and acceptability of evaluating the intervention in a randomised controlled trial. Methods: We will conduct a parallel, open label, randomised controlled feasibility trial among 172 (86 in each country) adult smokers with SMI in India and Pakistan. Participants will be allocated 1:1 to either Brief Advice or the IMPACT 4S intervention. BA comprises a single five-minute BA session on stopping smoking. The IMPACT 4S intervention comprises behavioural support delivered in up to 15 one-to-one, face-to-face or audio/video, counselling sessions, with each session lasting between 15 and 40 minutes; nicotine gum and/or bupropion; and breath carbon monoxide monitoring and feedback. The outcomes are recruitment rates, reasons for ineligibility/non-participation/non-consent of participants, length of time required to achieve required sample size, retention in study and treatments, intervention fidelity during delivery, smoking cessation pharmacotherapy adherence and data completeness.

However, several studies have identified parenchymal changes in their placental tissues, suggesting a placental response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the maternal-fetal interface. Although many COVID-19 placental studies have focused on the expression of the canonical SARS-CoV-2 entry proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2, further characterization of subcellular molecules involved in viral trafficking have not yet been investigated in these tissues. Of interest are Rab proteins, a family of small GTPase proteins that direct intracellular transport between different endocytic organelles. Rab5 and Rab7 in particular have previously been implicated in HIV and cytomegalovirus invasion of placental trophoblast cells in vitro; the localization of these molecules has not been fully characterized within the human maternal-fetal interface, however, or within placental tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnancies. METHODS: Using fluorescent immunohistochemistry, Rab5 and Rab7 placental localization and comparative fluorescence intensity were explored in a cohort of placental tissues from pregnancies affected by maternal COVID-19 disease (COVID, n = 15) compared with contemporary control subjects (Control, n = 10). Fluorescence intensity was quantified by using corrected total cell fluorescence values. FINDINGS: Within placental villi, Rab5 was consistently localized in syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells. Rab5 had significantly higher mean (SEM) fluorescence intensity in the COVID cohort (Control, 1.96 [0.16]; COVID, 2.62 [0.09]; P = 0.0014). In contrast, although Rab7 was also localized within placental villous syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells, mean (SEM) Rab7 fluorescence intensity was significantly downregulated in COVID vs Control placentas (Control, 35.9 [4.1]; COVID, 20.1 [0.52]; P = 0.0001). IMPLICATIONS: This differential expression of Rab5 and Rab7 suggests that placental endocytic pathways may be altered at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnancies affected by maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. As key molecules governing intracellular vesicle transport, including viral trafficking, Rab GTPase proteins may be of interest for ongoing studies examining placental responses to COVID-19 in pregnancy.","output":"Differential Expression of Rab5 and Rab7 Small GTPase Proteins in Placental Tissues From Pregnancies Affected by Maternal Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate based on serum creatinine are commonly used in cancer patients to assess renal function. However, there is uncertainty regarding which equation is most appropriate for this population and the impact of different creatinine assays. METHODS Measured isotopic glomerular filtration rate results from 120 oncology patients were used to evaluate and compare all four versions of the Wright equation, Cockcroft and Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration and the Janowitz and Williams formula; using eight different creatinine assays (five Jaffe, three enzymatic). RESULTS The enzymatic version of the Wright equation without creatine kinase performed better than the other versions for all eight creatinine assays. However, MDRD and Janowitz and Williams gave the best overall performance in this patient population. Performance was highly dependent on the creatinine assay used, for example, the percentage of results within 30% of the isotopic glomerular filtration rate (P30) ranged from 90.8% to 60.8% for MDRD. CONCLUSION The performance of any equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate is highly dependent on the creatinine assay used.

The performance analysis was conducted for two different purposes: (1) prediction of neutralization activity in MERS-CoV-infected patients, and (2) epidemiologic surveillance of MERS-CoV infections among MERS-CoV-exposed individuals. To evaluate performance according to serum collection time, we used days post onset of illness (dpoi) and days post exposure (dpex) assessing neutralization activity and infection diagnosis, respectively. Performance of serologic tests improved with delayed sampling time, being maximized after a seroconversion period. In predicting neutralization activity, ELISA IgG tests showed optimal performance using sera collected after 21 dpoi at cut-off values of OD ratio 0.4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 100%), and ELISA IgA showed optimal performance using sera collected after 14 dpoi at cut-off value of OD ratio 0.2 (sensitivity 85.2% and specificity 100%). In diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection, ELISA IgG exhibited optimal performance using sera collected after 28 dpex, at a cut-off value of OD ratio 0.2 (sensitivity 97.3% and specificity 92.9%).

In 2017C18, a survey was distributed to medical students and residents at two accredited medical schools. Participants noted preferred styles of learning regarding lecture duration, timing, location, format, third-party resources, learner types and USMLE Step 1 scores. The Learning Environment, Learning Processes, and Learning Outcomes (LEPO) framework [5] was used to examine learner preferences, with responses compared using the Mann-Whitney U and two proportion z-tests. A total of 329 respondents completed the survey: 62.7% medical students and 37.3% residents. The majority of participants identified their learning style by Kolb [6] as converging (33.0%) or accommodating (39.2%). Students preferred lectures 30C40 minutes long (43.3%), during morning hours (54.2%), in their own homes (52.0%), via online lectures with simultaneous drawings (56.0%), and classroom/podcast lectures with PowerPoint? presentations (54.3%). Overall, students rated third-party resource characteristics higher than traditional curricula, including effectiveness of teachers, length, quality, time of day, and venue (p < 0.001), but also preferred small group formats. Students reported animated videos (46.6%) and simultaneous drawings (46.5%) as the most effective means of retaining information.

This is a retrospective cohort study of 159 hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia during a 9-month period to determine an association between the frequency of thromboembolic rates and hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Secondary outcomes sought to investigate association of thromboembolic events with relation to place of admission, risk factors, anticoagulation, mortality, hospital length of stay, and discharge disposition. Among the cohort of 159 hospitalized patients who met criteria, 16 (10%) were diagnosed with a thromboembolic event. There were a total of 18 thromboembolic events with 12 venous and 6 arterial.

We propose a statistical learning strategy (SLS) for identifying and spatiotemporally tracking potentially relevant Spike protein mutations. We analyzed 167,893 Spike protein sequences from US COVID-19 cases (excluding 21,391 sequences from VOI/VOC strains) deposited at GISAID from January 19, 2020 to March 15, 2021. Alignment against the reference Spike protein sequence led to the identification of viral residue variants (VRVs), i.e., residues harboring a substitution compared to the reference strain. Next, generalized additive models were applied to model VRV temporal dynamics, to identify VRVs with significant and substantial dynamics (false discovery rate q-value <0.01; maximum VRV proportion > 10% on at least one day). Unsupervised learning was then applied to hierarchically organize VRVs by spatiotemporal patterns and identify VRV-haplotypes. Finally, homology modelling was performed to gain insight into potential impact of VRVs on Spike protein structure. We identified 90 VRVs, 71 of which have not previously been observed in a VOI/VOC, and 35 of which have emerged recently and are durably present. Our analysis identifies 17 VRVs ~91 days earlier than their first corresponding VOI/VOC publication. Unsupervised learning revealed eight VRV-haplotypes of 4 VRVs or more, suggesting two emerging strains (B1.1.222 and B.1.234). Structural modeling supported potential functional impact of the D1118H and L452R mutations.

Methods This cohort study used linked national hospital records including ICU, virology testing and national death records to identify and describe patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care units in Scotland. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the impact of deprivation on 30-day mortality. Critical care capacity was described by reporting the percentage of baseline ICU bed utilisation required. Findings There were 735 patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care units across Scotland from 1/3/2020 to 20/6/2020. There was a higher proportion of patients from more deprived areas, with 183 admissions (24.9%) from the most deprived quintile and 100 (13.6%) from the least deprived quintile. Overall, 30-day mortality was 34.8%. After adjusting for age, sex and ethnicity, mortality was significantly higher in patients from the most deprived quintile (OR 1.97, 95%CI 1.13, 3.41, p=0.016).

Compared to most methods used in previous studies, the GFI model possesses the advantage of eliminating decomposition residuals, which enables it to display better decomposition characteristics (Ang et al., 2004). The results show: (i) The primary positive drivers of carbon emissions in the transportation sector include the economic growth, energy intensity and population size. The cumulative contribution of economic growth to transportation carbon emissions reaches 334.5%. (ii) The negative drivers are the transportation intensity and energy structure, while the transportation intensity is the main factor that restrains transportation carbon emissions. The energy structure displays a certain inhibition effect, but its inhibition is not obvious. (iii) The contribution rate of the output value of per unit traffic turnover on transportation carbon emissions appears as a flat M.

Among these, 19 had suffered from COVID-19 and successively recovered with no residual symptoms, while the remaining 28 had not previously been affected by COVID-19 and were not convalescent. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was administered before the treatment and at 1-month and 3-month follow-up in order to assess the clinical outcome. RESULTS: The two groups were similar in terms of patient age (p-value 0.54), treated levels (p-value 0.26) and pre-procedure ODI (p-value 0.33). Technical success was achieved in all cases. In patients previously affected by COVID-19, mean ODI decrease was 11.58  9.51 (35.72%) at 1-month follow-up and 20.63  9.87 (63.63%) at 3-month follow-up.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present cross-sectional study was carried out in the Obstetric Department in Al Imamain Al-Kadhimain Medical City, Baghdad, Iraq, including a total of 55 full-term pregnant women who were grouped into 25 women with SARS-CoV-2 and 30 control pregnant women, starting from January 2021 to December 2021. Pregnant women admitted to hospital for the purpose of delivery were routinely examined and assessed, and then, nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for the purpose of PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Then, 3 ml of venous blood was obtained from the antecubital vein following sterilization and the blood was transferred to the central hospital laboratory to do complete blood count within 24 h using the automated hematological analyzer that the results were then transferred into an Office Excel sheet for the future statistical analysis. RESULTS: Among the hematological variables that were analyzed, the mean WBC count and mean lymphocyte count were lower in COVID-19 group to compared category and the variation was significant (p < 0.001);however, there was no significant difference in mean neutrophil count. There has been no significant variation in mean hemoglobin, mean RBC count, mean PCV, mean MCV, mean MCH, and mean RDW between control group and COVID-19 group (p > 0.05).

It is tempting to consider that the same mechanism acts in COVID-19 as in SARS, where an overactive macrophage M1 inflammatory response, as neutralizing antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein form at day 7 to 10, results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in susceptible patients. It also allows consideration of agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, which may interfere with this overly brisk macrophage inflammatory response and perhaps influence the course of the disease, in particular, those that blunt but do not completely abrogate the M1 to M2 balance in macrophage polarization, as well as viral load, which in SARS appears to be temporally related to the onset of ARDS.","output":"Hyperglycemia, hydroxychloroquine, and the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) causes common cold, and is associated with severe respiratory symptoms in infants, elderly and immunocompromised patients. HCoV-OC43 is a member of Betacoronavirus genus that includes also the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were shown to express proteins with the potential to evade early innate immune responses. However, the ability of HCoV-OC43 to antagonise the intracellular antiviral defences has not yet been investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of HCoV-OC43 structural (membrane and nucleocapsid) and accessory (ns5a and ns2a) proteins in the modulation of antiviral gene expression profile in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells using PCR array analysis. METHODS: HCoV-OC43 membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), ns5a and ns2a mRNA were amplified and cloned into the pAcGFP1-N expression vector (Clontech), followed by transfection in HEK-293 cells. Expression of M, N, ns5a and ns2a proteins were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence test. Three days post-transfection, the cells were challenged by Sendai virus. The Human Antiviral Response PCR array system (Qiagen) was used to profile the antiviral gene expression in HEK-293 cells, using the fold regulation comparison and the manual normalisation methods. RESULTS: Around 50C60 genes were downregulated by HCoV-OC43 proteins, the most prominent genes being those critical for the activation of transcription factors involved in the antiviral response like interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and activator protein 1 (AP-1). Among the most important downregulated genes were those coding for Interferons (IFNs) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), pro-apoptotic and pyroptotic proteins (Caspases, cathepsins, tumour necrosis factor), pro-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukins), pattern recognition receptors (PRRs; toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors) and their signaling transduction proteins (TICAM1, MAVS). CONCLUSION: This study shows for the first time that similarly to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 has the ability to downregulate the transcription of genes critical for the activation of different antiviral signaling pathways.

The Dashboard reports live counts of the number and type of patients in each of the six adult metropolitan public EDs in Adelaide, South Australia.ResultsThere was a significant difference in the mean daily average occupied ED capacity before and during two distinct increases in COVID-19 cases in South Australia. An increase in COVID-19 cases coincided with a decrease in patients in EDs (Pearson's r=-0.93 and -0.67; P<0.001 for both). Presentations in Australasian Triage Scale (ATS) Categories 2-5 decreased during these periods, whereas ATS Category 1 stayed constant. Mental health patients continued to present to the ED, despite the overall drop in ED presentations.ConclusionsDuring the two periods of COVID-19 case growth in South Australia, there was a significant drop in the number of patients presenting to the major public EDs and a change in the casemix of patients over time.What is known about the topic?EDs in Australia often operate at or over capacity, with frequent reports of ambulance ramping, access block and long waiting times. There have been reports internationally of significant declines in ED presentations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.What does this paper add?This paper uses a novel publicly available data source that is available in real time to contribute a new perspective from South Australia, which has experienced two distinct periods of strict restrictions and lockdown. The research showed that the number of mental health presentations remained consistently high, despite a significant overall decline in ED occupancy.What are the implications for practitioners?This study demonstrates that South Australians are accessing emergency medical treatment differently in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context of an overall decline in presentation numbers, the number of mental health-related presentations has not changed significantly, suggesting that this trend should be closely monitored. The findings corroborate the national concern that unwell people have avoided accessing emergency medical care during the pandemic, leading to worse outcomes and increased need for healthcare resources at a later date. It will be important to monitor and quickly detect further changes in ED usage using real-time data as the pandemic evolves, as well as in any future significant health crises.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on South Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Multimodal exercise training can ameliorate the physiological decline associated with ageing. This study aimed to investigate whether 12 weeks of a home-based online multimodal training and health education intervention could improve functional ability and perceptions of physical and mental health in middle-aged and older adults. Methods: Sixty-one male (N = 18, 59.1  7.0 years) and female (N = 43, 60.9  6.8 years) participants with various clinical conditions completed two 60-minute training sessions per week for 12 weeks delivered online via Zoom. All sessions included aerobic, resistance, balance, and flexibility exercises. One weekly session incorporated 15 minutes of health and fitness education. The pre/post testing sessions were conducted in a local community centre in line with COVID-19 public health guidelines. Paired samples t-tests and the Wilcoxon signed rank tests were utilised to compare scores pre and post intervention. Results: There were significant improvements in participants 6-minute walk (p < 0.0001), sit-to-stand (p < 0.0001), timed-up-and-go (p < 0.0001), sit-and-reach (p < 0.0001), squat jump (p < 0.0001), core endurance (p < 0.0001), grip strength (right hand p = 0.03, left hand p = 0.04) and balance (right leg p < 0.0001, left leg p = 0.004) tests post intervention. Perceptions of physical (p < 0.0001) and mental (p < 0.0001) health also improved significantly. Discussion: Twelve weeks of online multimodal training and health education can significantly improve cardiovascular fitness, strength, power, balance, flexibility, and perceptions of physical health, mental health, and quality of life in middle-aged and older adults. While there are some limitations to online interventions, the benefits are numerous and equal to those reported for onsite interventions and should be considered for wider rollout in this population.

Three surface disinfectants were investigated at 0.5% for 30 min and 60 min (Mikrobac forte, based on benzalkonium chloride and laurylamine; Kohrsolin FF, based on benzalkonium chloride, glutaraldehyde and didecyldimonium chloride; Dismozon pur, based on magnesium monoperphthalate), and one instrument disinfectant was investigated at 4% for 15 min, 3% for 30 min and 2% for 60 min [Korsolex basic, based on glutaraldehyde and (ethylenedioxy)dimethanol]. Three types of organic load were used: 0.3% albumin, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.3% albumin with 0.3% sheep erythrocytes. Virus titres were determined by a quantitative test (endpoint titration) in 96-well microtitre plates. With all tested preparations, SARS-CoV was inactivated to below the limit of detection (reduction factor mostly 4), regardless of the type of organic load. In summary, SARS-CoV can be inactivated quite easily with many commonly used disinfectants.","output":"Efficacy of various disinfectants against SARS coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trinidad and Tobago, a small island developing state, has been ranked as number one in a report published by the University of Oxford that assessed responses to COVID-19 based on four of the six WHO criteria for rolling back COVID-19 \\"lockdown\\" measures.

METHODS We performed a post hoc analysis using data from the Japan Diabetes Outcome Trial-1. A total of 2607 participants aged 20-65 years with impaired fasting glucose were recruited from the workplace/community in Japan and randomized to a 1-year telephone support programme intervention arm (n = 1240) or self-directed control arm (n = 1367). Participants in both arms received monthly data feedback from a weight scale and pedometer. The main outcome measure was the stages of change toward healthy eating and active exercise. The secondary outcome was fasting plasma glucose (FPG). RESULTS After the 1-year intervention, the adjusted odds ratio of progressing to the action/maintenance stage in the intervention vs. control arm for healthy eating was 1.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-1.43; p < 0.001), but that for active exercise was 1.07 (95% CI 0.99-1.15; p = 0.062). The intervention decreased FPG levels in participants in the contemplation stage, but not in the precontemplation, preparation and action/maintenance stages.

The unavailability of specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection necessitates the focus of all scientists in this direction. The reported antiviral activities of guanidine alkaloids encouraged us to run a comprehensive in silico binding affinity of fifteen guanidine alkaloids against five different proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which we investigated. The investigated proteins are COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) (PDB ID: 6lu7), spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYB), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYO), membrane glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6M17), and a non-structural protein (nsp10) (PDB ID: 6W4H). The binding energies for all tested compounds indicated promising binding affinities. A noticeable superiority for the pentacyclic alkaloids particularly, crambescidin 786 (5) and crambescidin 826 (13) has been observed. Compound 5 exhibited very good binding affinities against Mpro (&#916;G = -8.05 kcal/mol), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (&#916;G = -6.49 kcal/mol), and nsp10 (&#916;G = -9.06 kcal/mol). Compound 13 showed promising binding affinities against Mpro (&#916;G = -7.99 kcal/mol), spike glycoproteins (&#916;G = -6.95 kcal/mol), and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (&#916;G = -8.01 kcal/mol). Such promising activities might be attributed to the long &#969;-fatty acid chain, which may play a vital role in binding within the active sites. The correlation of c Log P with free binding energies has been calculated. Furthermore, the SAR of the active compounds has been clarified. The Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) studies were carried out in silico for the 15 compounds; most examined compounds showed optimal to good range levels of ADMET aqueous solubility, intestinal absorption and being unable to pass blood brain barrier (BBB), non-inhibitors of CYP2D6, non-hepatotoxic, and bind plasma protein with a percentage less than 90%. The toxicity of the tested compounds was screened in silico against five models (FDA rodent carcinogenicity, carcinogenic potency TD50, rat maximum tolerated dose, rat oral LD50, and rat chronic lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL)). All compounds showed expected low toxicity against the tested models. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were also carried out to confirm the stable binding interactions of the most promising compounds, 5 and 13, with their targets.

Globally understanding the humoral immunity in asymptomatic carriers will provide scientific knowledge for developing serological tests, improving early identification, and implementing more rational control strategies against the pandemic. MEASURE: Utilizing both NAT and commercial kits for serum IgM and IgG antibodies, we extensively screened 11 766 epidemiologically suspected individuals on enrollment and 63 asymptomatic individuals were detected and recruited. Sixty-three healthy individuals and 51 mild patients without any preexisting conditions were set as controls. Serum IgM and IgG profiles were further probed using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray, and neutralizing antibody was detected by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay system. The dynamics of antibodies were analyzed with exposure time or symptoms onset. RESULTS: A combination test of NAT and serological testing for IgM antibody discovered 55.5% of the total of 63 asymptomatic infections, which significantly raises the detection sensitivity when compared with the NAT alone (19%). Serum proteome microarray analysis demonstrated that asymptomatics mainly produced IgM and IgG antibodies against S1 and N proteins out of 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Different from strong and persistent N-specific antibodies, S1-specific IgM responses, which evolved in asymptomatic individuals as early as the seventh day after exposure, peaked on days from 17 days to 25 days, and then disappeared in two months, might be used as an early diagnostic biomarker. 11.8% (6/51) mild patients and 38.1% (24/63) asymptomatic individuals did not produce neutralizing antibody. In particular, neutralizing antibody in asymptomatics gradually vanished in two months.

We showed previously that the epidermal growth factor family member Amphiregulin is expressed by T cell receptor-activated mouse CD4 T cells, particularly Th2 cells, and helps eliminate helminth infection. Here we report a detailed analysis of the regulation of Amphiregulin expression by human T cell subsets. Signaling through the T cell receptor induced Amphiregulin expression by most or all T cell subsets in human peripheral blood, including naive and memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, Th1 and Th2 in vitro T cell lines, and subsets of memory CD4 T cells expressing several different chemokine receptors and cytokines. In these different T cell types, Amphiregulin synthesis was inhibited by an antagonist of protein kinase A, a downstream component of the cAMP signaling pathway, and enhanced by ligands that increased cAMP or directly activated protein kinase A. Prostaglandin E2 and adenosine, natural ligands that stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity, also enhanced Amphiregulin synthesis while reducing synthesis of most other cytokines. Thus, in contrast to mouse T cells, Amphiregulin synthesis by human T cells is regulated more by acute signals than pre-commitment of T cells to a particular cytokine pattern. This may be appropriate for a cytokine more involved in repair than attack functions during most inflammatory responses.","output":"The Acute Environment, Rather than T Cell Subset Pre-Commitment, Regulates Expression of the Human T Cell Cytokine Amphiregulin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, as well as other coronaviruses, can be dispersed and potentially transmitted by aerosols directly or via ventilation systems. We therefore investigated ventilation openings in one COVID-19 ward and central ducts that expel indoor air from three COVID-19 wards at Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden, during April and May 2020. Swab samples were taken from individual ceiling ventilation openings and surfaces in central ducts. Samples were subsequently subjected to rRT-PCR targeting the N and E genes of SARS-CoV-2. Central ventilation HEPA filters, located several stories above the wards, were removed and portions analyzed in the same manner. In two subsequent samplings, SARS-CoV-2 N and E genes were detected in seven and four out of 19 room vents, respectively. Central ventilation HEPA exhaust filters from the ward were found positive for both genes in three samples. Corresponding filters from two other, adjacent COVID-19 wards were also found positive. Infective ability of the samples was assessed by inoculation of susceptible cell cultures but could not be determined in these experiments. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in central ventilation systems, distant from patient areas, indicate that virus can be transported long distances and that droplet transmission alone cannot reasonably explain this, especially considering the relatively low air change rates in these wards.

We describe practices observed by mobile SARS containment teams (mobile teams) during outbreak investigations. METHODS: We retrospectively summarized infection control practices observed in hospitals visited by mobile teams in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Taiwan, and Thailand, during March and April 2003. RESULTS: Mobile teams investigated 22 reports of SARS in 20 hospitals (1, 5, and 14 hospitals in Lao PDR, Taiwan, and Thailand, respectively). Facilities ranged from urban hospitals with negative-pressure isolation rooms and high-efficiency particulate air filtration to rural hospitals with patient rooms open to outside air circulation and intermittent running water. At the time of mobile team visits, 5 (25%) hospitals implemented infection control practices consistent with World Health Organization recommendations on visitor policies, private negative-pressure rooms, and personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Early in the SARS epidemic, mobile teams found wide variations in infection control practices and resources among Asian hospitals evaluating patients for SARS, indicating the importance of ongoing assessment during SARS preparedness. Mobile teams are one mechanism to assess practices and promote implementation of recommended infection control measures.","output":"Infection control practices for SARS in Lao People's Democratic Republic, Taiwan, and Thailand: Experience from mobile SARS containment teams, 2003"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) are the major viral RNA sensors that are essential for activation of antiviral immune responses. However, their roles in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-causing coronavirus (CoV) infection are largely unknown. Herein we investigate their functions in human epithelial cells, the primary and initial target of SARS-CoV-2, and the first line of host defense. A deficiency in MDA5 (MDA5(?/?)), RIG-I or mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) greatly enhanced viral replication. Expression of the type I/III interferons (IFN) was upregulated following infection in wild-type cells, while this upregulation was severely abolished in MDA5(?/?) and MAVS(?/?), but not in RIG-I(?/?) cells. Of note, ACE2 expression was ~2.5 fold higher in RIG-I(?/?) than WT cells. These data demonstrate a dominant role of MDA5 in activating the type I/III IFN response to SARS-CoV-2, and an IFN-independent anti-SARS-CoV-2 role of RIG-I.","output":"Differential roles of RIG-I Clike receptors in SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a second messenger that releases Ca2+ from acidic organelles through the activation of two-pore channels (TPCs) to regulate endolysosomal trafficking events.

While a positive family history is recognised as a predisposing factor for early or precocious puberty, the role of environmental factors is not fully understood. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To make a retrospective evaluation of the incidence of newly diagnosed central precocious puberty (CPP) and the rate of pubertal progression in previously diagnosed patients during and after the Italian lockdown for COVID-19, comparing data with corresponding data from the previous 5 years. To determine whether body mass index (BMI) and the use of electronic devices increased during lockdown in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 49 females with CPP. We divided the patients into two groups: group 1, patients presenting a newly diagnosed CPP and group 2, patients with previously diagnosed slow progression CPP whose pubertal progression accelerated during or after lockdown. We collected auxological, clinical, endocrinological and radiological data which were compared with data from two corresponding control groups (patients followed by our Unit, March to July 2015C2019). Patients families completed a questionnaire to assess differences in the use of electronic devices before and during lockdown. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients presented newly diagnosed CPP (group 1) and 12, with previously diagnosed but untreated slow progression CPP presented an acceleration in the rate of pubertal progression (group 2). The number of new CPP diagnoses was significantly higher than the mean for the same period of the previous 5 years (p < 0.0005). There were no significant differences between patients in group 1 and control group 1 regarding time between appearance of B2 and CPP diagnosis, although group 1 patients had a significantly earlier chronological age at B2, a more advanced Tanner stage at diagnosis (p < 0.005), higher basal LH and E2 levels, higher LH peak after LHRH test (p < 0.05) and increased uterine length (p < 0.005) and ovarian volume (p < 0.0005). The number of patients with previously diagnosed CPP whose pubertal development accelerated was also statistically higher compared to controls (p < 0.0005). In this group, patients basal LH (p < 0.05) and E2 levels (p < 0.0005) became more markedly elevated as did the LH peak after LHRH test (p < 0.05). These patients also showed a significantly accelerated progression rate as measured by the Tanner scale (p < 0.0005), uterine length (p < 0.005), and ovarian volume (p < 0.0005). In both group 1 and group 2, BMI increased significantly (p < 0.05) and patients families reported an increased use of electronic devices (p < 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Our data show an increased incidence of newly diagnosed CPP and a faster rate of pubertal progression in patients with a previous diagnosis, during and after lockdown compared to previous years. We hypothesize that triggering environmental factors, such as the BMI and the use of electronic devices, were enhanced during lockdown, stressing their possible role in triggering/influencing puberty and its progression. However, more studies are needed to determine which factors were involved and how they interacted.","output":"Increased incidence of precocious and accelerated puberty in females during and after the Italian lockdown for the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians have had to use personal protective equipment (PPE) for prolonged periods. This has been associated with detrimental effects, especially in relation to the skin health. The present study describes a comprehensive survey of healthcare workers (HCWs) to describe their experiences using PPE in managing COVID-19 patients, with a particular focus on adverse skin reactions. A 24-hour prevalence study and multi-centre prospective survey were designed to capture the impact of PPE on skin health of hospital staff. Questionnaires incorporated demographics of participants, PPE type, usage time, and removal frequency. Participants reported the nature and location of any corresponding adverse skin reactions. The prevalence study included all staff in intensive care from a single centre, while the prospective study used a convenience sample of staff from three acute care providers in the United Kingdom. A total of 108 staff were recruited into the prevalence study, while 307 HCWs from a variety of professional backgrounds and demographics participated in the prospective study. Various skin adverse reactions were reported for the prevalence study, with the bridge of the nose (69%) and ears (30%) being the most affected. Of the six adverse skin reactions recorded for the prospective study, the most common were redness blanching (33%), itchiness (22%), and pressure damage (12%). These occurred predominantly at the bridge of the nose and the ears. There were significant associations (P < .05) between the adverse skin reactions with both the average daily time of PPE usage and the frequency of PPE relief. The comprehensive study revealed that the use of PPE leads to an array of skin reactions at various facial locations of HCWs. Improvements in guidelines are required for PPE usage to protect skin health. In addition, modifications to PPE designs are required to accommodate a range of face shapes and appropriate materials to improve device safety.","output":"Personal protective equipment related skin reactions in healthcare professionals during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the world welcomes the availability and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, coupled with it is the 'hesitant' predicament of some Filipinos to get vaccinated because of the confusing information regarding its efficacy.

This study investigated the Pmcf and other determinants of venous return in dysrhythmic and asphyxial circulatory shock and arrest. METHODS Twenty Landrace/Large-White piglets were allocated into two groups of 10 animals each. In the dysrhythmic group, ventricular fibrillation was induced with a 9 V cadmium battery, while in the asphyxia group, cardiac arrest was induced by stopping and disconnecting the ventilator and clamping the tracheal tube at the end of exhalation. Mean circulatory filling pressure was calculated using the equilibrium mean right atrial pressure at 5-7.5 s after the onset of cardiac arrest and then every 10 s until 1 min post-arrest. Successful resuscitation was defined as return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) with a MAP of at least 60 mmHg for a minimum of 5 min. RESULTS After the onset of asphyxia, a Pmca increase of 0.004 mmHg, 0.01 mmHg, and 1.26 mmHg was observed for each mmHg decrease in PaO2, each mmHg increase in PaCO2, and each unit decrease in pH, respectively. Mean Pmcf value in the ventricular fibrillation and asphyxia group was 14.81  0.5 mmHg and 16.04  0.6 mmHg (p < 0.001) and decreased by 0.031 mmHg and 0.013 mmHg (p < 0.001), respectively, for every additional second passing after the onset of cardiac arrest. With the exception of the 5-7.5 s time interval, post-cardiac arrest right atrial pressure was significantly higher in the asphyxia group. Mean circulatory filling pressure at 5 to 7.5 s after cardiac arrest predicted ROSC in both groups, with a cut-off value of 16 mmHg (AUC = 0.905, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Mean circulatory filling pressure was higher in hypoxic hypercapnic conditions and decreased at a lower rate after cardiac arrest compared to normoxemic and normocapnic state. A Pmcf cut-off point of 16 mmHg at 5-7.5 s after cardiac arrest can highly predict ROSC.","output":"Determinants of venous return in steady-state physiology and asphyxia-induced circulatory shock and arrest: an experimental study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aims of this study were to assess the impact of epidemiological variables, severity of presurgical respiratory signs, diagnostic findings from pharyngeal and laryngeal examination using a new grading scheme and CT scan images, on postsurgical outcome in dogs undergoing surgery for brachycephalic obstruction airway syndrome (BOAS). METHODS An owner-based questionnaire was used to grade dogs based on their respiratory signs before surgery and at least six weeks after surgery. Epidemiological data and results from presurgical pharyngeal and laryngeal examination and CT scan findings for 75 dogs undergoing airway surgery were collected from the medical records. RESULTS 70.7 per cent of dogs showed an improvement in respiratory signs following rhinoplasty and palatoplasty. This improvement was associated with the severity of inspiratory efforts and the Poncet score on presentation, but not with any other clinical sign or anatomical abnormality found during BOAS assessment, nor by the degree of craniofacial shortening as determined by CT-scan. Presurgical snoring was positively associated with the degree of narrowing of pharyngeal dimensions.

Aspirin is used widely as a cardioprotective agent due to its antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory properties. Its role in hospitalized COVID-19 patients has been assessed and evaluated in the literature. However, no data regards its role in COVID-19 critically ill patients. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the use of low-dose aspirin (81-100 mg) and its impact on outcomes in COVID-19 critically ill patients. Method: This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study for all adult critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICUs) between March 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021. Eligible patients were classified into two groups based on aspirin use during ICU stay. The primary outcome is the in-hospital mortality;other outcomes were considered secondary. Propensity score-matched used based on patients age, SOFA score, MV status within 24 hours of ICU admission, prone position status, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and stroke as co-existing illness. We considered a P value of < 0.05 statistically significant. Results: A total of 1033 patients were eligible;352 patients were included after propensity score matching (1:1 ratio). The in-hospital mortality (HR (95%CI): 0.73 (0.56, 0.97), p-value=0.03) were lower in patients who received aspirin during hospital stay. On the other hand, patients who received aspirin have a higher risk of major bleeding compared to the control group (OR (95%CI): 2.92 (0.91, 9.36), p-value=0.07);but was not statistically significant.

Although COVID-19 severely impacted the Brazilian health care system, it is crucial to further characterize the degree of disruption caused to public health efforts, in order to address and manage long term effects of this pandemic. We therefore quantified the demand for preventive and treatment services from the Brazilian Unified Health System (Sistema nico de Sade/SUS) in 2020 to evaluate potential repercussions of COVID-19 in this setting. METHODS: Using the SUS database, we compared preventative and treatment services rendered in 2020 to the same services rendered from 2017 to 19. We also evaluated the frequency of respiratory infection (RI) diagnoses during the pandemic, relative to the preceding years. RESULTS: Compared to 2017C19, in 2020 non-urgent medical appointments decreased 1.4-fold (p = 0.0017), dental consultations 2.8-fold (p = 0.05), and immunization coverage 1.5 fold (p = 0.0005). The number of RI visits to SUS ambulatory care units in 2020 was 4.2 times higher than in preceding years (p = 0.0014), with a peak of 280,898 diagnoses in July 2020. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have led to a dramatic decline in preventative and treatment services provided by SUS to the Brazilian population.

Patient and professional feedback on an acute male inpatient ward in South London highlighted a demand for more medication information outside the formal ward round setting. We aimed to have 100% of patients meet our criteria for Patient-Centred Prescribing on the ward by March 2021. To fulfil criteria, all patients are offered: (1) ward round discussion, (2) written patient information leaflets (PILs), (3) informal discussion groups, all regarding medication. The principles of this quality improvement project (QIP) were drawn from definitions of patient-centred care and standards of good practice; patients should have access to a variety of information formats, relevant to the individual, and the knowledge gained empowers patients. Patient experience data revealed that 30% of clients answered passively to the question, Do you feel involved in your care? We hypothesized that medication discussion groups positively impact patients wellbeing, by providing a safe space that facilitates conversation surrounding medication issues. METHOD: We conducted weekly audits on patients whose admission duration was >7 days, and recorded fulfilment of the above criteria. At week 1, we introduced a program of weekly medication discussion groups led by members of the wider multi-disciplinary team covering a broad topic range. At week 6, we developed a rolling rota of the discussion groups and posters were displayed in advance. At week 14, all patients were offered PILs through a 1:1 interaction and this continued as routine practice. Medication discussion group feedback was obtained via questionnaires and The Blob Tree, a psycho-emotional assessment tool commonly used in healthcare settings. RESULT: In 19 weeks, the median percentage of patients who fulfilled our criteria for Patient-Centred Prescribing was 92.86%. After 11 medication discussion groups, 79.3% of questionnaire responders wanted further sessions. 88% of The Blob Tree responses collected inferred a positive emotional response after the group discussions and half of those noticed an improvement in their emotional state. CONCLUSION: This QIP was overall a success; it fulfilled a requirement to meet good standards in information sharing and became embedded in the fabric of the ward, continuing to run as part of the activities program. It demonstrated the impact of education on patients mental wellbeing through empowerment and peer support. As a by-product it established multidisciplinary connections and improved therapeutic relationships.

Health professionals, as well as hospital workers, are the most vulnerable population for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 due to their greater proximity to sick patients, especially in specialized hospitals for the treatment of these patients. Study Design: We ran a questionnaire by all the employees of a Public Service Hospital specialised in COVID-19 treatment (1307 employees), in the municipality of Santos, Sao Paulo, Brazil, who presented some symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and positive results by RT-PCR, in Oropharynx Swab collection. The questionnaire collected socio-demographic information, as well as data related to the work areas where they were divided into two groups: Employees at higher risk or those who directly deal with patients (914 employees or 69.9%) and lower risk for employees in the administrative area (393 employees or 30.1%). Results: 211 (16.1%) of the Hospital's employees had to stop their work-related activities due to presenting positive RT-PCR. There were 39 (9.9%) positives in low risk areas and 172 (18.8%) positives in employees in high risk areas. Within the latter group, Nurses, Nursing Assistants and Doctors were the most frequently infected professionals.

Unique adjustments to endotracheal intubation and extubation practices are necessary to decrease the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to healthcare workers (HCWs) while avoiding complications of airway management. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the practice of endotracheal intubation and extubation, resources available and complications encountered by clinicians performing endotracheal intubation and extubation of COVID-19 and suspected COVID-19 patients in South Africa (SA). METHOD: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted during the initial surge of COVID-19 cases in SA. Data were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire completed by clinicians in the private and public healthcare sectors after performing an endotracheal intubation and/or extubation of a patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. RESULTS: Data from 135 endotracheal intubations and 45 extubations were collected. Anaesthetists accounted for 87.0% (n=120) of the study participants, specialist clinicians in their respective fields for 59.4% (n=82), and public HCWs for 71.0% (n=98). Cases from Gauteng Province made up 76.8% (n=106) of the database. Haemoglobin desaturation was the most frequent complication encountered during endotracheal intubation (40.0%;n=54). Endotracheal intubations performed at private healthcare institutions were associated with a significantly lower complication rate of 17.5% (n=7) compared with 52.6% (n=50) in the public healthcare sector (p<0.001). Endotracheal intubations performed in theatre had the lowest complication rate of 10.4% (n=5;p<0.001). Propofol was used in 90 endotracheal intubations (66.7%), and its use was associated with fewer complications relative to other induction agents. Minimising the number of intubation attempts (p=0.009) and the use of checklists (p=0.013) significantly reduced the frequency of complications encountered during endotracheal intubation. Intravenous induction technique, neuromuscular blocking agent used, intubating device used and time at which intubation was performed did not affect the incidence of complications. The majority of endotracheal extubations were uncomplicated (88.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The study provides valuable insight into the resources used by clinicians and complications encountered when endotracheal intubations and/or extubations were performed.

This virus immediately spread throughout the world due to its highly contagious nature. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 has changed the way of our life and has caused a huge economic and public health disaster. Therefore, it is urgent to identify positive cases as soon as possible and treat them as isolated. Automatic detection of viruses using computer vision and machine learning will be a valuable contribution to detecting and limiting the spread of this epidemic. The delay introduction of X-ray technology as diagnostic tool limited our ability to distinguish COVID-19 from other pneumonia cases. These images can be feed into a machine learning system that can be trained to detect lung infections, which can arise in acute pneumonia. However, some efforts attempt to detect SARS-CoV-2 using binary data and such combinations, which may leading to confusion. Indeed, in this case, the classifier's training minimizes the intra-class similarity between pneumonia in COVID-19 and typical pneumonia. Due to the fact that in addition to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, there are two other common types: viral and bacterial pneumonia. They all appear in similar shapes, thus making them difficult to distinguish. This research proposed a deep multi-layered classification of pneumonia based on a neural network using chest X-ray images. The experiment was conducted using the combination of two images from an open-source dataset collected by Cohen GP and Kagel. The data consists of 4 categories: normal pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and COVID19, for 2,433 images. We considered two architectures: Xception and ResNet50.

Using an animal model of hemorrhagic shock under general anesthesia, we hypothesized that the pulse pressure-heart rate ratio (PP/HR) would be an accurate marker of stroke volume changes during hemorrhage and resuscitation. METHODS In 16 swine under bispectral index-controlled, intravenous propofol-remifentanil anesthesia, pressure-controlled hemorrhagic shock was induced to achieve 30 mm Hg of mean arterial pressure, after which treatment was randomized to fluid (HES, n = 4), norepinephrine (NE, n = 4), both (HES + NE, n = 4), or neither (control, n = 4). Pulmonary artery thermodilution continuous cardiac output, stroke volume, and central arterial pressures were recorded at baseline (T0), after 30 minutes (T30) and 60 (T60) minutes of hemorrhage, during treatment (T90 and T120) and after blood retransfusion (T180). RESULTS At T60, blood withdrawal was 995 (301) mL (38 [8] mL/kg), resulting in a 70% decrease in stroke volume and a 3.3-fold decrease in PP/HR (each p < 0.01). When stroke volume data pointed at T0, T30 and T60 were plotted against the various hemodynamic variables under study, the PP/HR ratio exhibited the strongest relationship to stroke volume (r = 0.72). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve set to detect a 15% stroke volume decrease was larger for PP/HR (0.95 [0.94-0.97]) than for mean arterial pressure (0.91 [0.89-0.93]) (p < 0.013). During resuscitation in the HES and NE groups, correlation coefficients were significantly higher between stroke volume and PP/HR (0.75 [0.63-0.84] and 0.79 [0.67-0.86]) than between stroke volume and mean arterial pressure (0.52 [0.32-0.67], p = 0.042, and 0.49 [0.28-0.65], p = 0.0018, respectively).

The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the vulnerability of globalized supply chains, accelerated the digital transformation of the economy, and the development of CASE (Connected, Autonomous, Shared & Services, Electric) technologies in the automotive industry. Russia lags far behind other countries in readiness to use such technologies. It is obvious that the global pandemic will lead to the emergence of deferent car markets, the Russian market by the world's leading car manufacturers in the long term will be considered as a market for cars with gasoline and diesel engines. The global challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the development of new technologies, the existing imbalance between production capacities and the demand for automotive equipment, a low level of localization of production, and low export potential of the Russian automotive industry actualize the issues of improving the strategic management of the industry development. The analysis of strategies and programs for the development of the automotive industry indicates a weak account of the economic potential and risks of the industry development, weak coordination of hierarchically related state, regional, cluster and corporate strategies and development programs. The paper proposes a hierarchical approach to the process of strategic planning for the development of the automotive industry, based on the principles of consistency and subordination of state programs, sectoral, regional, cluster and corporate strategic development plans, which allows balancing the interests of federal and regional governments and automotive corporations, resources and development projects.

Minorities are overrepresented in EKSD, making this group more susceptible to poor outcomes given existing racial disparities. Studies have emerged spotlighting vitamin D's effects on autocrine regulation of immune function and the relevance of extra-renal one alpha hydroxylase. Many studies describe links between vitamin D deficiency and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk patients, but there is a paucity of data specific to ESKD patients. This study explored the association between vitamin D status and COVID-19 infection in a primarily black HD population. Methods: Emory Dialysis patients' vitamin D levels [25(OH) D] were collected November 2020 as part of a quality improvement project. All SARS-CoV-2 positive HD patients were identified (October 2020 to April 2021). Retrospective chart review including baseline data and labs were collected. An unpaired t-test was used to compare vitamin D levels between COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Results: 620 patients were included. All patients enrolled in-center HD three times per week. Patient identified race makeup included black (n=570) and non-black n= 50. Average age was 59 years. Gender: males (n=324) and females (n=296). 73 patients developed COVID-19 and 68 patients identified as black race. Average vitamin D levels for COVID-19 positive patients 27.33 and COVID-19 negative patients 26.2 (p=0.55). Average PTH in COVID-19 positive patients 507.3371 and COVID-19 negative patients 557.57458 (p=0.25). Average calcium level in COVID-19 positive patients 8.740.66 and COVID-19 negative patients 8.730.72 (p=0.48). Relative risk of developing COVID-19 in black HD patients was 1.14 compared to others (p=0.75). Conclusions: Our study showed no statistically significant correlation between Vitamin D level and COVID-19 acquisition. The role of vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor and the role of Vitamin D supplementation for prevention or treatment COVID-19 in this population is unclear. Further studies investigating the relation between Vitamin D levels and severity of COVID-19 infection in this population should be explored.","output":"COVID-19 and vitamin d in an urban us hemodialysis population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Onboard quarantining has been only partially effective to control outbreaks of coronavirus disease on cruise ships.

This is especially true when it comes to Mediterranean insular regions as they are climate change (CC) hotspots where adaptation and mitigation policy design is an urgent matter. Looking at 2030 as a time horizon for climate action and focusing on the Balearic Islands, this paper reviews the physical changes projected for the coming decades as a result of CC and analyses their impacts on regional environmental, economic and social variables. Mitigation and adaptation measures are also proposed based on the identified priority impacts. The fact the Balearics are a top world holiday destination allows the analysis to serve as a guide to other Mediterranean islands with tourism-based economies facing similar CC scenarios. Results show the projected rise of temperature and sea level; the reduction of the average precipitation and increase in evapotranspiration, the droughts and the increase in ocean acidification and deoxygenation are the main threats faced by the Balearics, this putting their economy at risk due to the high tourisms vulnerability to CC. Mitigation and adaptation action on terrestrial and marine ecosystems, water resources, energy, infrastructure and urban planning, human health, economy, law and education is recommended. Sustainable mobility and waste managing are also viewed as important fields for mitigation action. Conclusions show that diversifying the current socioeconomic model is needed to increase the community and territory resilience.

The purpose of this study is to estimate the frequency of vaccine refusal against COVID-19 vaccines and to identify the underlying factors for refusal or hesitation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study carried out in a district of Istanbul from 25 to 30 December 2020. A sample of people from the ages of 20 to 85 in the district was selected, and a total of 384 people were enrolled. A questionnaire about the COVID-19 vaccine was administered to the participants by phone. The questionnaire consisted of questions about the sociodemographic characteristics of participants and their thoughts about possible COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: 45.3% of the participants were hesitant about getting the COVID-19 vaccine, which was declared appropriate by the Ministry of Health. The rate of those who think that the COVID-19 vaccine will be effective in preventing and controlling the disease was 51.6%. 89.6% of the participants were hesitant about getting their children vaccinated. Those who do not consider COVID-19 disease as a risk to their health were 22.9%, and 32.8% thought that they would be protected from the disease by natural and traditional ways. The median score of the participants' risk perception was 7 (IQR: 6-8; Mean: 6.8; SD: 1.7). The median value of risk perception score of those who accept the vaccine was 6 (IQR: 4-6), while the median value for those who did not accept the vaccine was 4 (IQR: 4-6) (P < .01). Factors affecting vaccine acceptance were determined as the perception of risk (OR: 1.26% 95CI 1.03-1.55) and age (OR: 0.94% 95CI: 0.91-0.98) in logistic regression analysis.

Although recent methods are based on highly selective chromatography-mass spectrometry technology, most are limited to a few cannabinoids, while relying on unnecessarily sophisticated and expensive ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Here we report an optimised, simple extraction method followed by a reliable and simple high performance liquid chromatography method for separation. The detection is performed using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer that is available in most natural products research laboratories. Due to the simplicity of instrumentation, and the robustness resulting from a high resolution in the chromatography of isobaric cannabinoids, the method is well suited for routine phytocannabinoid analysis for a range of applications. The method was validated in terms of detection and quantification limits, repeatability, and recoveries for a total of 17 cannabinoids: detection limits were in the range 11C520 pg when using a 1 L sample injection volume, and the recovery percentages ranged from 85% to 108%.

Nevertheless, studies have not explored specifically gender disparities in access to healthcare in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: To evaluate gender disparities in access to medical in Chile we conducted an interrupted time series analysis using segmented regression. The outcome variable was the number of weekly confirmed cases of a set of oncologic and cardiovascular time-sensitive conditions at a national level. The series contained data from weeks 1 to 39 for 2017 to 2020. The intervention period started at week 12. We selected this period because preventive interventions, such as school closures or teleworking, were implemented at this point. We estimated the level effect using a dummy variable indicating the intervention period and slope effect using a continuous variable from weeks 12 to 39. To test heterogeneity by gender and age group, we conducted a stratified analysis. RESULTS: We observed a sizable reduction in access to care with a slowly recovery for oncologic (level effect 0.323; 95% CI 0.291C0.359; slope effect 1.022; 95% CI 1.016C1.028) and cardiovascular diseases (level effect 0.586; 95% CI 0.564C0.609; slope effect 1.009; 95% CI 1.007C1.011). Greater reduction occurred in women compared to men, particularly marked on myocardial infarction (level effect 0.595; 95% CI 0.566C0.627 versus 0.532; 95% CI 0.502C0.564) and colorectal cancer (level effect 0.295; 95% CI 0.248C0.35 versus 0.19; 95% CI 0.159C0.228). Compared to men, a greater absolute reduction was observed in women for oncologic diseases, excluding sex-specific cancer, (1352; 95% CI 743C1961) and cardiovascular diseases (1268; 95% CI 946C1590). CONCLUSION: We confirmed a large drop in new diagnoses for time-sensitive conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. This reduction was greater for women.

Due to their status as a vulnerable social group and the inherent need for transition-related treatments (e.g., hormone treatment), transgender people are assumed to be affected particularly severely by the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and health care of transgender people. Methods and findingsAs an ad hoc collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and 23 community organizations, we developed a web-based survey. The survey was translated into 26 languages, and participants were recruited via various social media and LGBTIQ-community sources. Recruitment started in May 2020. We assessed demographical data, physical and mental health problems (e.g., chronic physical conditions), risk factors (e.g., smoking), COVID-19 data (symptoms, contact history, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19), and the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to transgender health care and health-related supplies. To identify factors associated with the experience of restrictions to transgender health care, we conducted multivariate logistic regression analysis. 5267 transgender people from 63 higher-middle income and high-income countries participated in the study. Over 50% of the participants had risk factors for a severe course of a COVID-19 infection and were at a high risk of avoiding testing or treatment of a COVID-19 infection due to the fear of mistreatment or discrimination. Access to transgender health care services was restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic for 50% of the participants. Male sex assigned at birth and a lower monthly income were significant predictors for the experience of restrictions to health care. 35.0% of the participants reported at least one mental health conditions. Every third participant had suicidal thoughts, and 3.2% have attempted suicide since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. A limitation of the study is that we did not analyze data from low-income countries and access to the internet was necessary to participate. ConclusionsTransgender people are assumed to suffer under the severity of the pandemic even more than the general population due to the intersections between their status as a vulnerable social group, their high amount of medical risk factors, and their need for ongoing medical treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic can potentiate these vulnerabilities, add new challenges for transgender individuals, and, therefore, can lead to devastating consequences, like severe physical or mental health issues, self-harming behaviour, and suicidality.","output":"How the COVID-19 pandemic affects transgender health care in upper-middle income and high income countries - A worldwide, cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an acute infectious respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The disease is highly communicable and produces mild to severe symptoms, generating a high demand for intensive care and thousands of deaths. In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and has already surpassed five million cases and 300,000 deaths in the world. The natural history of the disease has still not been fully established, hindering the elaboration of effective clinical protocols and preventive measures. Nevertheless, the disease requires a systemic approach, since there is evidence of acute and chronic complications, in addition to the catastrophic effects on the population's mental health. This highlights the need for a methodology that more effectively captures the effect of COVID-19, considering such aspects as severity, duration, and the potential to generate chronic complications that will increase the demands on Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). DALYs, or disability-adjusted life years, are thus an extremely useful indictor that adds mortality, an estimate of years of life lost (YLLs), and morbidity, an estimate of years of life lived with disability (YLDs). This article discusses the relevance and difficulties of studying the burden of COVID-19 and its complications in the Brazilian context, highlighting the natural history of the disease and estimating indicators such as YLDs, considering the high burden of disease in planning strategies to deal with the consequences of COVID-19 after the pandemic.

Goal planning identifies priorities for treatment through discussion and negotiation between service users and health practitioners. Goal planning enhances motivation, directs effort, and focuses the development of strategies and treatment options to improve recovery outcomes and promote service users' ownership of the recovery process. While goal planning is a common practice in mental health settings, evidence regarding its impact on treatment outcomes is lacking. This paper outlines a protocol for a systematic review that aims to explore the types of goals planned, experiences of service users and practitioners, and the effectiveness of goal planning as a mental health intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic search will be conducted during March 2021 by searching Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus and PsycINFO electronic databases to answer the following questions: (1) What types of goals are being developed within mental healthcare?; (2) What is the evidence for the effectiveness of goal planning on health and well-being for mental health service users?; (3) What are the experiences of mental health service users and their treating healthcare practitioners in relation to goal planning?; and (4) What are the barriers and facilitators to effective goal planning in mental health settings? Two independent researchers will screen the articles, selecting literature that meets criteria. All literature, regardless of study design that involves adult participants, with a mental illness and reporting on goal planning will be considered for inclusion.

However, the role of pre-existing neurological comorbidities in modulating COVID-19-related mortality still remains unclear. This cohort study evaluates the COVID-19-related case fatality rate (CFR) of patients with pre-existing neurological diseases. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all patients consecutively admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between March and April 2020. We used a multivariate regression analysis to estimate the association between pre-existing neurological diseases and COVID-19-related mortality. Then, we compared the CFR and survival curves of two cohorts (patients suffering vs. those not suffering from pre-existing neurological disease), matched trough the propensity score (PS). Age and other comorbidities were considered for PS calculation. We applied a 1:1 matching for the entire neurological cohort and, separately, for cerebrovascular, neurodegenerative, and other neurological diseases. RESULTS: Among 332 patients, 75 (22.6%) were affected by pre-existing neurological disease (n = 29 cerebrovascular, n = 26 neurodegenerative, n = 20 others). From the multivariate regression analysis, they resulted with a significant increase of COVID-19-related mortality (OR:2.559; 95%CI 1.181C5.545; p < 0.017). From the cohort analysis, CFR resulted 2-fold higher in patients with neurological disease (48.0% vs. 24.0%; p = 0.002). CFR was significantly higher in patients with neurodegenerative diseases compared to matched individuals (73.9% vs. 39.1%; p = 0.017), while CFR increase in patients with cerebrovascular diseases did not reach statistical significance (48.3% vs. 41.4%; p = 0.597).

The long-term consequences of delaying procedures in response to COVID-19 remains unknown. We developed a high-throughput approach to understand the impact of delaying procedures on patient health outcomes using electronic health record (EHR) data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used EHR data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center's (VUMC) Research and Synthetic Derivatives. Elective procedures and non-urgent visits were suspended at VUMC between March 18, 2020 and April 24, 2020. Surgical procedure data from this period were compared to a similar timeframe in 2019. Potential adverse impact of delay in cardiovascular and cancer-related procedures was evaluated using EHR data collected from January 1, 1993 to March 17, 2020. For surgical procedure delay, outcomes included length of hospitalization (days), mortality during hospitalization, and readmission within six months. For screening procedure delay, outcomes included 5-year survival and cancer stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: We identified 416 surgical procedures that were negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same timeframe in 2019. Using retrospective data, we found 27 significant associations between procedure delay and adverse patient outcomes. Clinician review indicated that 88.9% of the significant associations were plausible and potentially clinically significant. Analytic pipelines for this study are available online.

RESULTS Among patients 65 years of age or older who had two-vessel or three-vessel coronary artery disease without acute myocardial infarction, 86,244 underwent CABG and 103,549 underwent PCI. The median follow-up period was 2.67 years. At 1 year, there was no significant difference in adjusted mortality between the groups (6.24% in the CABG group as compared with 6.55% in the PCI group; risk ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.00). At 4 years, there was lower mortality with CABG than with PCI (16.4% vs. 20.8%; risk ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.82). Similar results were noted in multiple subgroups and with the use of several different analytic methods. Residual confounding was assessed by means of a sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS In this observational study, we found that, among older patients with multivessel coronary disease that did not require emergency treatment, there was a long-term survival advantage among patients who underwent CABG as compared with patients who underwent PCI.

There is urgent need to characterize the coping styles associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes in perinatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic to help mitigate the potential for lasting sequelae on both mothers and infants. This study uses a data-driven approach to identify the patterns of behavioral coping strategies that associate with maternal psychosocial distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large multicenter sample of pregnant women (N = 2876) and postpartum women (N = 1536). Data was collected from 9 states across the United States from March to October 2020. Women reported behaviors they were engaging in to manage pandemic-related stress, symptoms of depression, anxiety and global psychological distress, as well as changes in energy levels, sleep quality and stress levels. Using latent profile analysis, we identified four behavioral phenotypes of coping strategies. Critically, phenotypes with high levels of passive coping strategies (increased screen time, social media, and intake of comfort foods) were associated with elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and global psychological distress, as well as worsening stress and energy levels, relative to other coping phenotypes. In contrast, phenotypes with high levels of active coping strategies (social support, and self-care) were associated with greater resiliency relative to other phenotypes. The identification of these widespread coping phenotypes reveals novel behavioral patterns associated with risk and resiliency to pandemic-related stress in perinatal women. These findings may contribute to early identification of women at risk for poor long-term outcomes and indicate malleable targets for interventions aimed at mitigating lasting sequelae on women and children during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Behavioral coping phenotypes and associated psychosocial outcomes of pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND COVID-19, which is characterised by life-threatening symptoms, difficulty in breathing, and pneumonia symptoms and requires global emergency intervention, may cause psychological problems such as phobia, fear and anxiety. This study aims to examine the psychometric properties of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in Turkish people and to determine the level of fear of COVID-19 among Turkish people. METHODS The research was carried out between March and April 2020. A Personal Information Form and the FCV-19S were used to collect the research data. In the validity and reliability stage, 84 people were contacted randomly for data collection. After the validity and reliability analyses of the scale, a total of 431 Turkish people volunteered to participate in the study and answered the questions in the online questionnaire form using a convenience and snowball sampling method. Confirmatory factor analysis, item-total correlation and Cronbach's alpha coefficient were calculated for psychometric evaluation. Bivariate analysis was applied to determine the level of fear of COVID-19. RESULTS Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.89, which is stated to have high reliability. FCV-19S scores of participants were determined to be 21.47  6.28. FCV-19S scores of females were determined as 20.48  6.33 and FCV-19S scores of males were determined as 19.78  7.34 according to the bivariate analysis (p < .05). Age, marital status, having children and living alone or with others, tobacco use and anxiety about going to the hospital during the pandemic did not affect on fear of COVID-19 (p > .05). Particularly being female, the presence of chronic disease requiring long-term medication and rarely taking protective measures recommended by the Ministry of Health and having a chronic disease had a significant effect on higher levels of fear of COVID-19 (p < .05). CONCLUSION The FCV-19S is a valid and reliable tool for determining the fear of COVID-19. It was found that the fear level of COVID-19 infection was high in Turkish people.","output":"The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on community mental health: A psychometric and prevalence study in Turkey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Household travel survey data is a critical input to travel behavior modeling, and it also can be used to generate trip schedules for activity-based traffic simulation. With emerging information and communication technology (ICT) tools like smartphones, the collection of passive datasets for travelers real-time information becomes available. Smartphone GPS survey apps have emerged to be a popular tool for conducting household travel surveys. Most existing studies employ high-frequency smartphone GPS data and collect accurate activity information. However, their study periods are still rather short, ranging from a few days to a few weeks. For a long-term GPS survey, the issues of missing activity information and sparse GPS data are inevitable and must be addressed carefully. This paper uses 7-month low-frequency smartphone GPS data collected from over 2000 participants, who report 5 most frequently visited locations weekly. The essential goal is to develop a synthetic model of daily activity-location scheduling to capture data with both known and unknown activities. To handle missing activity data, this research develops a new probabilistic approach, which measures the probability of visiting a place by three scores, global visit score (GVS), temporal visit score (TVS), and periodical visit score (PVS). Three different levels of activity-location schedule are modeled respectively. The first level handles only those data with known activities, while data with unknown activities are disregarded. The second takes unknown activities into account but combines all types of them into a single category. The third one models each location with unknown activities separately. These models are able to generate activity-location schedule in different levels of detail for activity-based traffic simulator. After developing activity-location schedule models, both individual and aggregated validation processes are performed with simulation. The validation result shows that the simulated proportion of activity types and activity duration are close to the survey data, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. This research sheds a light on building sustainable and long-term travel survey using GPS data with missing activity information. In addition, this study will be valuable to model infectious disease transmission, e.g. COVID-19 and assess health risk in urban areas.","output":"Generating a synthetic probabilistic daily activity-location schedule using large-scale, long-term and low-frequency smartphone GPS data with limited activity information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background and Objective:The COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia and is estimated to have a high impact on the healthcare system. Early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system. The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. Although CT scan is the gold standard, CXR are still useful because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread. This study aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only CXR images. Methods:In order to achieve the objectives, we have proposed a classification schema considering the following perspectives: i) a multi-class classification; ii) hierarchical classification, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in the schema in order to re-balance the classes distribution. We observed that, texture is one of the main visual attributes of CXR images, our classification schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion techniques in the schema in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others. Results:The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario. Conclusions:As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.","output":"COVID-19 identification in chest X-ray images on flat and hierarchical classification scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decision-making autonomy may have played a crucial role in protecting, or on the contrary, intensifying the onset of negative psychological outcomes for workers with roles with responsibilities during the lockdown due to the Covid-19 crisis The present study analyzed the emotional dimension of workaholism in relation to emotional exhaustion, considering decision-making autonomy as a moderator of this relationship, in a sample of 101 managers and freelancers in the middle of the lockdown in Italy (early April 2020) Results showed that the relationship between negative (workaholic) emotions and emotional exhaustion was moderated by decision-making autonomy and this moderation differed for managers and freelancers In particular, the results showed that in the target of managers high levels of negative emotional experiences related to workaholism and low decision-making autonomy are associated with higher levels emotional exhaustion, while high levels of emotional experiences linked to workaholism and high decision-making autonomy produced significantly lower levels of emotional exhaustion On the contrary, low levels of job autonomy were associated to higher level of emotional exhaustion when negative (workaholic) emotions were low for the freelancers Limitations are related to the limited sample and the cross-sectional nature of the study Practical implications lie in considering decision-making autonomy as a double-edged sword, such that when low it could be a risk for managers and when high it could be a risk for freelancers ? 2020 by the authors","output":"Negative (Workaholic) emotions and emotional exhaustion: Might job autonomy have played a strategic role in workers with responsibility during the COVID-19 crisis lockdown?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Videoconferencing platforms have received a large influx of traffic due to COVID-19 and the global pandemic it has caused.

Little is known, however, about the individuals considering acquiring firearms during the pandemic. Recent research has highlighted that individuals considering acquiring firearms may be motivated by exaggerated threat expectancies. In a sample of 3,500 Americans matched to 2010 United States Census data, we compared individuals intending to buy firearms in the coming 12 months (assessed in late June and early July 2020) to those undecided or not planning to acquire firearms on a range of demographic, anxiety, and firearm ownership variables. Our results indicated that those intending to acquire a firearm in the next twelve months are less tolerant of uncertainty, endorse exaggerated threat expectancies, and are experiencing more severe COVID-19 specific fears. Individuals intending to purchase firearms were also more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation in the past year, to have worked in law enforcement, and to have been considered essential workers during COVID-19. Furthermore, such individuals were more likely to already own firearms and to have purchased firearms during the opening months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those intending to purchase firearms did not endorse lower perceived neighborhood safety, however, indicating that their intent to purchase firearms is unlikely to be driven by tangible threats in their immediate environment. These findings highlight that exaggerated fears may be motivating individuals to purchase firearms to diminish anxiety and that this trend may be particularly common among individuals who already own firearms.","output":"Threat perceptions and the intention to acquire firearms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Five randomized controlled trials recently appeared in the literature demonstrating that early mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke is significantly related to an improved outcome. Stent retrievers are accepted as the most effective devices for intracranial thrombectomy. OBJECTIVE To analyze the mechanical properties of stent retrievers, their behavior during retrieval, and interaction with different clots and to identify device features that might correlate with the effectiveness of thrombus removal. MATERIALS AND METHODS All stent retrievers available in France up to June 2015 were evaluated by mechanical and functional tests aimed at investigating the variation of their radial force and their behavior during retrieval. Devices were also tested during in vitro thrombectomies using white and red experimental thrombi produced with human blood. Functional tests and in vitro thrombectomies were conducted using a rigid 3D printed vascular model. RESULTS Mechanical tests showed a variation in radial force during retrieval for each stent. A constant radial force during retrieval was related to continuous cohesion over the vessel wall and a higher rate of clot removal efficacy. All stent retrievers failed when interacting with white large thrombi (diameter 6 mm). CONCLUSIONS None of the tested devices were effective in removing white clots of large diameter (6 mm). Constant radial force during retrieval allows constant cohesion to the vessel wall and pressure over the clot; such features allow for a higher rate of clot removal.","output":"Experimental evaluation of stent retrievers' mechanical properties and effectiveness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan, China, and subsequently spread worldwide affecting all ages including newborns.

Chi-square test and multinomial logistic regression were used to determine risk factors of life-threatening COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: The mean age of the study participants was 43.23 (15.48) years. The study identified several lifestyle-related factors and common commodities as risk factors for severeCcritical COVID-19. The patients age was one of the most important predictors, as people >59 years were at higher risk (AOR=18.223). Among other lifestyle factors, active smoking (AOR=1.482), exposure to secondary smoking (AOR=1.728), sleep disturbance (AOR=2.208) and attachment with SLT/alcohol/substance abuse (AOR=1.804) were identified as significant predictors for severeCcritical COVID-19. Patients those were overweight/obese (AOR=2.105), diabetic (AOR=4.286), hypertensive (AOR=3.363), CKD patients (AOR=8.317), asthma patients (AOR=2.152), CVD patients (AOR=7.747) were also at higher risk of severeCcritical COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: This study has identified several vital lifestyles and comorbidity-related risk factors of severeCcritical COVID-19. People who have these comorbidities should be under high protection, and risky lifestyles of the general population should modify through the proper educational campaign.","output":"Lifestyle and Comorbidity-Related Risk Factors of Severe and Critical COVID-19 Infection: A Comparative Study Among Survived COVID-19 Patients in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Ontario, the unpredictable funding climate of the 1990s led health care organizations to look for ways to reduce costs. Adopting a just-in-time staffing policy, they employed fewer full-time workers, scheduled part-time workers to work regular shifts, took on more casual staff, and became increasingly reliant on agency nurses and overtime to cover shifts. These policies resulted in higher costs and reduced surge capacity, and placed the health of nurses and patients in jeopardy. Fewer staff meant more overtime. Stress-related absenteeism increased. Some nurses reacted to casualization by working for multiple employers. During the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in Toronto, nursing resources were stretched to their limits. An exploratory investigation, based on relevant literature and interviews with 13 nurse administrators who held key positions during the epidemic, confirmed the lack of spare capacity in the health care system and indicated that community and long-term care sectors had less capacity than acute care. Low surge capacity in these sectors increased the vulnerability of the entire health care system. Capacity issues should be addressed as part of a larger human resources initiative to create a more flexible workforce. Since SARS, a number of government and organizational initiatives have been developed to increase nursing capacity.","output":"Surge capacity and casualization: Human resource issues in the post-SARS health system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Secondhand smoke exposure in many countries decreased dramatically after the implementation of smoke-free legislation in public places, but the exposure at home did not change to the same degree. The aim of this study was to describe the status and correlates of a home smoking ban in Chongqing, China. METHODS: From June to August 2021, we selected two healthcare centers in the East, West, North, South and Middle regions of Chongqing. We investigated the family smoke-free situation in the selected region using a stratified random sampling method. A chi-squared test was performed to compare the totally and partially smoke-free homes, and a binary logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlates of smoke-free rules at home. RESULTS: The study investigated 2121 families, among which 884 (41.7%) implemented a total ban on smoking at home. The covariates included age (OR=1.54; 95% CI: 1.18C2.01), living with children aged <14 years (OR=1.51; 95% CI: 1.20C1.90), no smokers in the family (OR=2.37; 95% CI: 1.78C3.17), awareness of the hazards of secondhand smoke (OR=1.30; 95% CI: 1.07C1.59), worrying about the impact of smoking in the presence of children on health (OR=1.92; 95% CI: 1.25C2.95), no difficulty (OR=1.34; 95% CI: 1.07C1.67) and confidence (OR=1.73; 95% CI: 1.41C2.13) in stopping others from smoking, no smoking rules in cars (OR=3.67; 95% CI: 2.58C5.22), and frequency of entertaining guests with cigarettes (OR=0.41; 95% CI: 0.28C0.59). CONCLUSIONS: It is common for households in Chongqing to have smoking bans, especially those with children. If a family has members that are smokers, education researchers should pay more attention to the hazards of secondhand smoke on the health of family members, and to adopt more tobacco control measures and enhance the self-efficacy of implementing a home smoking ban.

International lockdowns were the catalyst for a global shift from traditional face-to-face learning to distance learning. This comparative study utilized a mixed method approach to investigate the readiness of Higher Education instructors and students and the challenges arising from the shift to distance education in two different Arab countries, Qatar and Jordan. Generally, the findings gleaned from the questionnaires (230 instructors and 551 students) revealed certain inconsistencies with the findings that emerged from the interviews (18 instructors and 38 students) in terms of both the level of readiness and the challenges faced. The results showed a substantial variation in instructors and students readiness at both participating universities. While factors like country, age, gender, specialization, years of experience/year in the program, and the number of online training courses prior to the COVID-19 epidemic proved to cause statistically insignificant differences in instructors and students readiness, variables including age, gender and prior experience in online courses were relatively influential for students in terms of the challenges they faced. ? 2021 by the authors;licensee Asian Online Journal Publishing Group","output":"COVID-19 enforced shift to distance education: Readiness and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant (B.1.1.529) is highly transmissible, but disease severity appears to be reduced compared with previous variants such as alpha and delta. We investigated the risk of severe outcomes following infection in residents of long-term care facilities. Methods We did a prospective cohort study in residents of long-term care facilities in England who were tested regularly for SARS-CoV-2 between Sept 1, 2021, and Feb 1, 2022, and who were participants of the VIVALDI study. Residents were eligible for inclusion if they had a positive PCR or lateral flow device test during the study period, which could be linked to a National Health Service (NHS) number, enabling linkage to hospital admissions and mortality datasets. PCR or lateral flow device test results were linked to national hospital admission and mortality records using the NHS-number-based pseudo-identifier. We compared the risk of hospital admission (within 14 days following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test) or death (within 28 days) in residents who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the period shortly before omicron emerged (delta-dominant) and in the omicron-dominant period, adjusting for age, sex, primary vaccine course, past infection, and booster vaccination. Variants were confirmed by sequencing or spike-gene status in a subset of samples. Results 795 233 tests were done in 333 long-term care facilities, of which 159 084 (200%) could not be linked to a pseudo-identifier and 138 012 (174%) were done in residents. Eight residents had two episodes of infection (>28 days apart) and in these cases the second episode was excluded from the analysis. 2264 residents in 259 long-term care facilities (median age 845 years, IQR 779C900) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, of whom 253 (112%) had a previous infection and 1468 (648%) had received a booster vaccination. About a third of participants were male. Risk of hospital admissions was markedly lower in the 1864 residents infected in the omicron-period (451%, 95% CI 365C555) than in the 400 residents infected in the pre-omicron period (1050%, 787C1394), as was risk of death (548% [452C664] vs 1075% [809C1422]). Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) also indicated a reduction in hospital admissions (064, 95% CI 041C100; p=0051) and mortality (aHR 068, 044C104; p=0076) in the omicron versus the pre-omicron period. Findings were similar in residents with a confirmed variant. Interpretation Observed reduced severity of the omicron variant compared with previous variants suggests that the wave of omicron infections is unlikely to lead to a major surge in severe disease in long-term care facility populations with high levels of vaccine coverage or natural immunity. Continued surveillance in this vulnerable population is important to protect residents from infection and monitor the public health effect of emerging variants.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Novel drugs and biologics Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in 2016 and 2017 and their company sponsors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Using established Good Pharma Scorecard (GPS) measures, companies and products were evaluated on their clinical trial registration, results dissemination and FDA Amendments Act (FDAAA) implementation; companies were ranked using these measures and a multicomponent data sharing measure. Associations between company transparency scores with company size (large vs non-large), location (US vs non-US) and sponsored product type (drug vs biologic) were also examined. RESULTS: 26% of products (16/62) had publicly available results for all clinical trials supporting their FDA approval and 67% (39/58) had public results for trials in patients by 6 months after their FDA approval; 58% (32/55) were FDAAA compliant. Large companies were significantly more transparent than non-large companies (overall median transparency score of 95% (IQR 91C100) vs 59% (IQR 41C70), p<0.001), attributable to higher FDAAA compliance (median of 100% (IQR 88C100) vs 57% (0C100), p=0.01) and better data sharing (median of 100% (IQR 80C100) vs 20% (IQR 20C40), p<0.01). No significant differences were observed by company location or product type. CONCLUSIONS: It was feasible to apply the GPS transparency measures and ranking tool to non-large companies and biologics. Large companies are significantly more transparent than non-large companies, driven by better data sharing procedures and implementation of FDAAA trial reporting requirements. Greater research transparency is needed, particularly among non-large companies, to maximise the benefits of research for patient care and scientific innovation.","output":"Clinical trial transparency and data sharing among biopharmaceutical companies and the role of company size, location and product type: a cross-sectional descriptive analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: A 30-year-old woman presented with sudden syncope.

We sought to explore effective message strategies communicating about nicotine reduction in cigarettes across the different key audiences that the regulation is most likely to influence. METHODS We designed four types of messages: efficacy messages, risk messages, a message about alternative sources of nicotine and a compensation message. Sixteen virtual focus groups were conducted in Atlanta and San Francisco in April-May 2020. Data were analysed in NVivo 12.0 using a thematic analysis approach. FINDINGS Exclusive smokers were receptive to both efficacy messages and risk messages. Dual users were the only group that was open to resorting to alternative sources of nicotine. Former smokers were critical of these messages as promoting the new kinds of cigarettes and potentially encouraging initiation and relapse of smoking. Non-smokers felt that efficacy messages downplayed the risks of smoking and did not scare people away from smoking. Presenting information that very low nicotine cigarettes (VLNCs) still contain harmful chemicals made smokers question continued smoking in the absence of nicotine and view VLNCs as harmful. CONCLUSIONS Messages communicating about nicotine reduction in cigarettes might help to motivate smokers to quit and can correct the misperceptions that VLNCs are less harmful. The FDA should consider specific target audiences and use different messages that complement each other in communicating about this regulation.","output":"'It brings light to what you really put into your body': a focus group study of reactions to messages about nicotine reduction in cigarettes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats are exceptional among mammals for harbouring diverse pathogens and for their robust immune systems. In addition, bats are unusually long-lived and show low rates of cancer. Contiguous and complete reference genomes are needed to determine the genetic basis of these adaptations and establish bats as models for research into mammalian health. Here we sequenced and analysed the genomes of the Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) and the Mesoamerican mustached bat (Pteronotus mesoamericanus). We sequenced these two species using a mix of Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), assembling draft genomes with some of the highest contig N50s (28-29Mb) of bat genomes to date. Work is in progress to increase the base-level accuracies of these genomes. We conducted gene annotation and identified a set of 10,928 orthologs from bats and mammalian outgroups including humans, rodents, horses, pigs, and dogs. To detect positively selected genes as well as lineage-specific gene gains and losses, we carried out comprehensive branch-site likelihood ratio tests and gene family size analyses. Our analysis found signatures of rapid evolution in the innate immune response genes of bats, and evidence of past infections with diverse viral clades in Artibeus jamaicensis and Pteronotus mesoamericanus. We additionally found evidence of positive selection of tumor suppressors, which may play a role in the low cancer rates, in the most recent common ancestor of bats.

The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between IgE reactivity to the vaccines and immediate-type allergic reactions after vaccination in dogs. Sera from 10 dogs that developed immediate-type allergic reactions such as circulatory collapse, cyanosis, dyspnea, facial edema, and vomiting within 1 h after vaccination with non-rabies monovalent or combined vaccines and sera from 50 dogs that did not develop allergic reactions after vaccination were collected. Serum IgE reactivity to the injected vaccines was measured by fluorometric ELISA using a mouse monoclonal anti-dog IgE antibody. Then, IgE reactivity to fetal calf serum (FCS) and stabilizer proteins (gelatin, casein, and peptone) included in the vaccines was measured in sera that had high levels of IgE to the vaccines. Levels of serum specific IgE to the vaccines in dogs with immediate-type allergic reactions (59C4173 fluorescence units [FU], mean  S.D.: 992.5  1181.9 FU) were significantly higher than those in control dogs (38C192 FU, 92.4  43.3 FU) (P < 0.001). Of the eight dogs that developed immediate-type allergic reactions and had high levels of serum specific IgE to the vaccines, seven had specific IgE directed to FCS. The IgE reactivity to the vaccines in sera from these dogs was almost completely inhibited by FCS. The other one dog had serum IgE directed to gelatin and casein included in the vaccine as stabilizers. The results obtained in this study suggest that immediate-type allergic reactions after vaccination in dogs were induced by type I hypersensitivity mediated by IgE directed to vaccine components.

Schools had to shift to distance education as part of the effort to stop the spread of the virus. Although distance learning undoubtedly resulted in challenges for all students, there is much concern that it exacerbated existing educational inequalities and led to disadvantages C particularly for students who were already struggling academically and lacking support from family and school. The aim of this paper was to investigate the possible impact of family and child characteristics, school performance prior to lockdown, and support at home and from school during lockdown in coping with self-regulated distance learning during times of COVID-19. The paper draws on data from a two-wave longitudinal study surveying 155 lower secondary school students aged 13C14years from a rural-alpine region in Austria. Data were collected 1year before the start of the pandemic and directly after schools had returned to in-class teaching after the first lockdown. Our findings support the notion that distance learning poses a substantial risk for exacerbating existing educational disadvantages. They show that coping with out-of-school learning was especially challenging for students with low academic achievement and learning motivation prior to the pandemic. Furthermore, findings demonstrate that the support from parents and teachers foster students capabilities to cope with the self-regulatory demands connected with distance learning. Although the importance of competencies for self-regulated learning became particularly evident in the context of the pandemic, from our findings, it can be concluded that in the future, schools should strengthen their investment in promoting competencies for self-regulated learning. Self-regulation must be recognized as an essential educational skill for academic achievement and life-long learning.","output":"Predicting Coping With Self-Regulated Distance Learning in Times of COVID-19: Evidence From a Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To explore clustered epidemic of COVID-19 in Liaocheng city and analyze infection status and chain of transmission of the cases.

Residents and attendings rated the trainee's autonomy on a 4\\\\level Zwisch scale, performance on a 5\\\\level scale, and case complexity on a 3\\\\level scale. We examined associations between ratings of autonomy and performance with variables including postgraduate year (PGY), case complexity, gender, week of the academic year (AY), and whether multiple procedures were logged. RESULTS: 78 attendings and 92 residents logged 2984 evaluations. PGY level and week of the AY were positively associated with attending ratings of autonomy and performance (PGY3 vs. PGY2: B = 0.63, p < .001 for autonomy and B = 1.05, p < .001 for performance; week of the AY: B = 0.013, p = .002 for autonomy; B = 0.025, p < .001 for performance).

METHODS: To better understand risk factors for malaria transmission in central Viet Nam, a survey of 1000 malaria positive cases and 1000 malaria negative controls was conducted. Cases and controls were matched for age and gender and self-presented at commune health stations (CHS) in Binh Phuoc, Dak Nong and Dak Lak Provinces. Diagnoses were confirmed with microscopy, rapid diagnostic test and PCR. Participants were interviewed about 50 potential risk factors for malaria, which included information about occupation, forest visitation, travel, healthcare-seeking behaviour and prior use of anti-malaria interventions. Participants were enrolled by trained government health workers and the samples were analysed in Vietnamese government laboratories. Data were analysed by univariable, block-wise and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among cases, 61.8% had Plasmodium falciparum, 35.2% Plasmodium vivax and 3% mixed species infections. Median (IQR) age was 27 (21C36) years and 91.2% were male. Twenty-five risk factors were associated with being a case and eleven with being a control. Multivariable analysis found that malaria cases correlated with forest workers, recent forest visitation, longer duration of illness, having a recorded fever, number of malaria infections in the past year, having had prior malaria treatment and having previously visited a clinic. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the benefits of increased statistical power from matched controls in malaria surveillance studies, which allows identification of additional independent risk factors.

COVID-19 is currently recognized to be associated with both venous and arterial thrombosis. However, only a limited number of COVID-19 cases associated with aortic thrombosis have been reported in the literature since the beginning of the pandemic. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old lady was admitted to our hospital with acute ischemic stroke. Floating aortic arch thrombus was detected incidentally on CT imaging. Interestingly, the patient reported a history of fever and cough and was found to have COVID-19 pneumonia based on nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and imaging. The patient received three months of anticoagulant therapy, and repeated imaging study did not reveal any aortic thrombus. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: COVID-19 related aortic thrombosis has been reported chiefly in severe cases. The SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect the endothelium of the vessels, which might explain the occurrence of arterial thrombosis in milder COVID-19 cases with the absence of the hyperinflammatory state. The management guideline for aortic thrombosis is scarce and based only on case reports and series. CONCLUSION: Aortic thrombosis is a devastating condition that can be easily missed without clinical suspicion. Our patient developed acute ischemic stroke, most likely embolic originating from the aortic thrombus. The clinician should consider this condition in any COVID-19 patient presenting with thromboembolic events, such as stroke or acute limb ischemia.

Final- and penultimate-year physiotherapy students undertook the fully simulated fieldwork placement either as peer learners or peer teachers. The placement was then evaluated using four outcome measures: The measure of quality of giving feedback scale (MQF) was used to assess peer learner satisfaction with peer-teacher supervision; plus/delta reflections were provided by peer teachers and faculty supervisors; student pass/fail rates for the penultimate-year physiotherapy students.

Improvement is complex, given the interaction of multiple people, processes and institutions. We aimed to develop a mixed-method approach to understand the TBI pathway based on the lived experience of local people, supported by quantitative methodologies and to determine potential improvement targets. DESIGN: We describe a systems approach based on narrative exploration, participatory diagramming, data collection and discrete event simulation (DES), conducted by an international research collaborative. SETTING: The study is set in the tertiary neurotrauma centre in Yangon General Hospital, Myanmar, in 2019C2020 (prior to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic). PARTICIPANTS: The qualitative work involved 40 workshop participants and 64 interviewees to explore the views of a wide range of stakeholders including staff, patients and relatives. The 1-month retrospective admission snapshot covered 85 surgical neurotrauma admissions. RESULTS: The TBI pathway was outlined, with system boundaries defined around the management of TBI once admitted to the neurosurgical unit. Retrospective data showed 18% mortality, 71% discharge to home and an 11% referral rate. DES was used to investigate the system, showing its vulnerability to small surges in patient numbers, with critical points being CT scanning and observation ward beds. This explorative model indicated that a modest expansion of observation ward beds to 30 would remove the flow-limitations and indicated possible consequences of changes. CONCLUSIONS: A systems approach to improving TBI care in resource-poor settings may be supported by simulation and informed by qualitative work to ground it in the direct experience of those involved. Narrative interviews, participatory diagramming and DES represent one possible suite of methods deliverable within an international partnership. Findings can support targeted improvement investments despite coexisting resource limitations while indicating concomitant risks.","output":"Systems approach to improving traumatic brain injury care in Myanmar: a mixed-methods study from lived experience to discrete event simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>This study aims to investigate the relationship between the attributes of corporate boards in UK companies and their tendency to assure their corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports.Design/methodology/approach>From the agency theory perspective, the authors examine the impact of board attributes on the assurance of CSR reports for the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 350 during 2016C2019. The authors used annual integrated reports, companies websites and Thomson Reuters Eikon database for data collection and the logistic regression for data analysis.Findings>The results confirm that some board attributes significantly influence a companys decision to assure its CSR reports. While board size, board tenure, the presence of female board members and female executive directors and Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) global working experience positively contribute to CSR assurance (CSRA) decisions, the chairmans independence negatively contributes to it. However, board independence, board meetings and board financial expertise demonstrate no effect on the CSRA decision.Research limitations/implications>The authors focus on some attributes of board members, but the authors did not consider board diversity in its broader meaning. Moreover, the effect of board committees and their attributes on CSRA was not addressed. The authors also did not consider the impact of scope, the quality level of assurance service and the differences between assurance providers on companies decisions to neither undertake CSRA nor choose between assurance providers.Practical implications>The study provides insights into the increasing demand on voluntary assurance to boost the credibility of CSR reports and the role of the board of directors (BOD) in taking this initiative. The findings highlight the importance of board diversity (e.g. gender) in improving transparency and sustainability reporting, which can help policymakers and regulators in shaping future governance policies. Additionally, the findings refer to a drawback in the UK Corporate Governance Code regarding the chairmans independence, which requires corrective actions from the Financial Reporting Council. The findings raise concern over the small share of audit firms in the assurance service market, despite the growing demand for these services in the UK, which may require more attention to these services from the audit firms.Social implications>Companies are increasingly pressurized, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, to discharge their accountability to stakeholders and to act in a socially responsible manner in their business activities. CSR reporting is one of the main tools that companies use to communicate their social activities. Understanding the determinants of voluntary CSRA helps to increase the credibility of CSR reports and the favorable response to social pressure.Originality/value>The authors add empirical evidence to the limited literature on CSRA about the role of the BOD in undertaking companies social responsibility, improving CSR reporting and reducing information asymmetry. It also highlights the significance of maintaining a balanced BOD in terms of gender, experience and tenure, in minimizing the risk of perpetuating non-transparent integrated reporting.","output":"Attributes of corporate boards and assurance of corporate social responsibility reporting: evidence from the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the outcomes of adult patients with spontaneous intracranial and subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed with comorbid COVID-19 infection in a large, geographically diverse cohort.

The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Favorable discharge and length of hospital and intensive-care stay were the secondary outcomes. We fit multivariate mixed-effects logistic regression models to our outcomes. RESULTS: There were 559 ICH-COVID patients and 23,378 ICH controls from 194 hospitals. In the ICH-COVID cohort versus controls, there was a significantly higher proportion of Hispanic patients (24.5% vs. 8.9%), Black patients (23.3% vs. 20.9%), nonsmokers (11.5% vs. 3.2%), obesity (31.3% vs. 13.5%), and diabetes (43.4% vs. 28.5%), and patients had a longer hospital stay (21.6 vs. 10.5 days), a longer intensive-care stay (16.5 vs. 6.0 days), and a higher in-hospital death rate (46.5% vs. 18.0%). Patients with ICH-COVID had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.43 [1.96-3.00] for the outcome of death and an aOR of 0.55 [0.44-0.68] for favorable discharge. There were 212 SAH-COVID patients and 5,029 controls from 119 hospitals. The hospital (26.9 vs. 13.4 days) and intensive-care (21.9 vs. 9.6 days) length of stays and in-hospital death rate (42.9% vs. 14.8%) were higher in the SAH-COVID cohort compared with controls.

Methods: This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Results: 200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30 kg/m2. The median age was 64 years.

We aim to evaluate how SFS and wider healthy eating recommendations (from the national School Food Plan (SFP)) are implemented in secondary schools and how they influence pupils diets and dental health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Secondary-level academies/free schools in the West Midlands, UK were divided into two groups: SFS mandated and SFS non-mandated. Using propensity scores to guide sampling, we aim to recruit 22 schools in each group. We will compare data on school food provision and sales, school food culture and environment, and the food curriculum from each group, collected through: school staff, governor, pupil, parent surveys; school documents; and observation. We will explore the implementation level for the SFS requirements and SFP recommendations and develop a school food typology. We aim to recruit 1980 pupils aged 11C15 years across the 44 schools and collect dietary intake (24-hour recall) and dental health data through self-completion surveys. We will compare free sugar/other dietary intake and dental health across the two SFS groups and across the identified school types.

To determine the factors that influenced health and treatment-related issues, as well as the respondents perception of the impact of the pandemic, study participants were asked to complete a non-validated online questionnaire comprising 31 questions (including 27 single-choice, two multiple-choice and two open-ended ones). A total of 571 patients or their parents completed the questionnaire, with 9.5% of respondents not performing any blood phenylalanine (Phe) test in the analysed period, 21.3% declaring a blood Phe increase, and 15.3% a decrease. Increased problems in contacting the doctor or dietitian were reported by 26.1% of subjects, whereas 39.3% of them felt restricted access to dietary products. Most (63.4%) participants were satisfied with remote contact with their PKU clinic. Better compliance was associated with higher odds of acceptance of remote contact and of reporting fewer problems with contacting the doctor, and with lower odds of missing Phe testing. Self-reported high stress was associated with higher odds of reporting the limited availability of low-Phe products and Phe-free formulas, as well as with increased Phe concentrations and non-PKU-related health problems. These patients also had poor dietary compliance and experienced more problems in contacting specialists. Health and treatment-related problems experienced during the pandemic lockdown were related to a higher intensity of stress in patients family and worse therapy compliance before the pandemic. Previous experience of remote visits resulted in a better perception of this method of contact. It seems that this form of communication should be popularized and improved to increase therapy effectiveness in case of different limitations in the future.

METHODS: We obtained peripheral blood samples from 27 hospitalized patients recruited during the epidemic that occurred in 2015 in South Korea. Plasma cytokines/chemokines and antibodies were quantified. Virus-specific T cells were examined by intracellular cytokine staining after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with overlapping peptides spanning whole virus structural proteins. RESULTS: At the acute phase of infection, elevated levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines were detected in proportion to the severity of the disease. Distinctively high frequencies of MERS coronavirusCreactive CD8(+) T cells were also observed in patients with severe/moderate illness, whereas antibody and CD4(+) T-cell responses were minimally detected at this stage. At the convalescent phase, disease severityCdependent antibody responses emerged and antigen-reactive cells were identified in both T-cell subsets. These T cells belonged to the T-helper 1 or type 1 cytotoxic T cell subtypes. While CD8(+) T cells responded preferentially to the viral S protein compared with E/M/N proteins, especially at the acute stage, slightly more CD4(+) T cells recognized E/M/N proteins compared with S protein at the convalescent phase.

Several authors have shown that this approach is safe and improves obstructive defaecation symptoms and faecal incontinence, without inducing new-onset constipation, possible after posterior rectopexy. Over the last decade, as for other procedures, biological meshes are used to correct pelvic floor disorders. Literature data are scant. In this study, we present our experience with this procedure using biological mesh. PATIENTS AND METHODS Prospectively collected data on laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy for internal rectal prolapse were analysed. All patients underwent preoperative evaluation with defaecating proctography and/or pelvic dynamic MRI, full colonoscopy, anal physiology studies and endo-anal ultrasound. End-points were to evaluate surgical complications and functional results of this technique such as changes in bowel function (Wexner Constipation Score and Faecal Incontinence Severity Index) at 3 and 6 months. Analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired data and Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data (two-sided p test). RESULTS Thirty-four consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (median age 59, range 25-78 years, mean follow-up was 12 months). Twenty-eight patients (82%) had a constipation score  5, while 14 (41%) a FISI score  10. Nine patients (26%) had mixed obstructed defaecation and faecal incontinence. One patient required conversion to open (3%). Median length of stay was 2 days. Overall complication rate was 23.5%. Preoperative constipation (median Wexner score 15) and faecal incontinence (median FISI score 12) improved significantly at 3 months (Wexner 5, FISI 5, both p < 0.001).

Thus, emissions from industrial and transport sectors were halted during lockdown (LD), which has resulted in a significant reduction of anthropogenic pollutants. The first two lockdown phases were strictly implemented (phase I and phase II) and hence were considered to be total lockdown (TLD) in this study. Satellite-based tropospheric columnar nitrogen dioxide (TCN) from the years 2015 to 2020, tropospheric columnar carbon monoxide (TCC) during 2019/20, and aerosol optical depth (AOD550) from the years 2014 to 2020 during phase I and phase II LD and pre-LD periods were investigated with observations from Aura OMI, Sentinel-5P TROPOMI, and Aqua and Terra MODIS. To quantify lockdown-induced changes in TCN, TCC, andAOD550, detailed statistical analysis was performed on de-trended data using the Student paired statistical t test. Results indicate that mean TCN levels over India showed a dip of 18 % compared to the previous year and also against the 5-year mean TCN levels during the phase I lockdown, which was found to be statistically significant (p value &lt; 0.05) against the respective period. Furthermore, drastic changes in TCN levels were observed over hotspots, namely eastern region and urban cities. For example, there was a sharp decrease of 62 % and 54 % in TCN levels compared to 2019 and against 5-year mean TCN levels over New Delhi with a p value of 0.0002 (which is statistically significant) during total LD. The TCC levels were high in the northeast (NE) region during the phase I LD period, which is mainly attributed to the active fire counts in this region. However, lower TCC levels are observed in the same region due to the diminished fire counts during phase II. Further,AOD550 is reduced over the country by  16 % (Aqua and Terra) from the 6-year (2014C2019) mean AOD550 levels, with a significant reduction (Aqua MODIS 28 %) observed over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region with a p value of ? 0.05. However, an increase in AOD550 levels (25 % for Terra MODIS, 15 % for Aqua MODIS) was also observed over central India during LD compared to the preceding year and found significant with a p value of 0.03.

This pandemic is quite unique when compared to previous epidemic disruptions and has had a severe impact on supply chains. As a result, the operational challenges (OCs) caused by COVID-19 are still unknown among practitioners and academics. It is critical to comprehensively document current OCs so that firms can plan and implement strategies to overcome them. Consequently, this study systematically identifies and ranks COVID-19-related OCs. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an integrated methodology combining expert interviews and the best-worst method (BWM) to analyze the results. The data have been collected from the electronics industry of Bangladesh, an emerging economy. This study also conducts a sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of the results. Findings: The results reveal 23 COVID-19-related OCs under five categories: sourcing, production and inventory management, demand management and distribution, return management and after-sales service, and supply chain-wide challenges. The quantitative investigation reveals that overstock in finished goods inventory, low end-customer demands, order cancellations from dealers and retailers, high inventory holding costs and lack of transportation are the top five OCs. Practical implications: The findings will help practitioners to understand the OCs and allow them to prepare for future major disruptions and formulate long-term strategies for operations during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature on supply chain complexity and challenges by considering a major pandemic outbreak.

The country received more than 18 million international tourists in 2019, compared to only 1.5 million twenty-five years ago. Tourist spending has translated into rising employment and incomes for Vietnams tourism sector, making it the key driver to the socio-economic development of the country. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, only 3.8 million international tourists visited Vietnam in 2020, plummeting by 78.7% year-on-year. The latest outbreak in early summer 2021 made the sector continue to hit bottom. Although Vietnams tourism has suffered extreme losses, once the contagion is under control worldwide, the number of international tourists to Vietnam is expected to rise again to reach pre-pandemic levels in the next few years. First, the paper aims to provide a summary of Vietnams tourism characteristics with a special focus on international tourists. Next, the predictive capability of artificial neural network (ANN) methodology is examined with the datasets of international tourists to Vietnam from 2008 to 2020. Some ANN architectures are experimented with to predict the monthly number of international tourists to the country, including some lockdown periods due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that, with the correct selection of ANN architectures and data from the previous 12 months, the best ANN models can be forecast for next month with a MAPE between 7.9% and 9.2%.

A questionnaire was carried out after written consents were obtained. In the first part of the questionnaire, there were a total of 9 questions including socio-demographic information and nutritional characteristics, and the second part included the \\"Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children\\" (SDSC). The data were analyzed with the SPSS 20 statistical program. RESULTS: The total number of participants was 114 parents; 64 (56%) of the children were girls and 50 (43.9%) were boys.

However, clinical laboratory metrics suggest key differences in these pathologies. We sought to determine whether plasma coagulation and fibrinolytic potential in patients with COVID-19 differ compared with healthy donors and critically ill patients with sepsis. Approach and Results: We performed comparative studies on plasmas from a single-center, cross-sectional observational study of 99 hospitalized patients (46 with COVID-19 and 53 with sepsis) and 18 healthy donors. We measured biomarkers of endogenous coagulation and fibrinolytic activity by immunoassays, thrombin, and plasmin generation potential by fluorescence and fibrin formation and lysis by turbidity. Compared with healthy donors, patients with COVID-19 or sepsis both had elevated fibrinogen, d-dimer, soluble TM (thrombomodulin), and plasmin-antiplasmin complexes. Patients with COVID-19 had increased thrombin generation potential despite prophylactic anticoagulation, whereas patients with sepsis did not. Plasma from patients with COVID-19 also had increased endogenous plasmin potential, whereas patients with sepsis showed delayed plasmin generation. The collective perturbations in plasma thrombin and plasmin generation permitted enhanced fibrin formation in both COVID-19 and sepsis. Unexpectedly, the lag times to thrombin, plasmin, and fibrin formation were prolonged with increased disease severity in COVID-19, suggesting a loss of coagulation-initiating mechanisms accompanies severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Both COVID-19 and sepsis are associated with endogenous activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, but these diseases differently impact plasma procoagulant and fibrinolytic potential.

However, their ability to interact with proteins is a theme still in need of investigation for the therapeutic importance that benzofurans could have in the modulation of protein-driven processes and for the possibility of making use of serum albumins as benzofurans delivery systems. To this scope, we investigated the protein binding ability of two 4-nitrophenyl-functionalized benzofurans previously synthesized in our laboratory and herein indicated as BF1 and BDF1, which differed for the number of furan rings (a single moiety in BF1, two in BDF1), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein. By circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy we demonstrated the ability of the two heteroaromatic compounds to alter the secondary structure of the serum albumin leading to different consequences in terms of BSA thermal stability with respect to the unbound protein (T(m) > 3 C for BF1, ?0.8 C for BDF1 with respect to unbound BSA, in PBS buffer, pH 7.5) as revealed in our CD melting studies. Moreover, a molecular docking study allowed us to compare the possible ligand binding modes of the mono and difuranic derivatives showing that while BF1 is preferentially housed in the interior of protein structure, BDF1 is predicted to bind the albumin surface with a lower affinity than BF1. Interestingly, the different affinity for the protein target predicted computationally was confirmed also experimentally by fluorescence spectroscopy (k(D) = 142.4  64.6 nM for BDF1 vs. 28.4  10.1 nM for BF1).

Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel open reading frame (ORF4) encoded by the murine norovirus (MNV) subgenomic RNA, in an alternative reading frame overlapping the VP1 coding region. ORF4 is translated during virus infection and the resultant protein localizes predominantly to the mitochondria. Using reverse genetics we demonstrated that expression of ORF4 is not required for virus replication in tissue culture but its loss results in a fitness cost since viruses lacking the ability to express ORF4 restore expression upon repeated passage in tissue culture. Functional analysis indicated that the protein produced from ORF4 antagonizes the innate immune response to infection by delaying the upregulation of a number of cellular genes activated by the innate pathway, including IFN-Beta. Apoptosis in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was also increased during virus infection in the absence of ORF4 expression. In vivo analysis of the WT and mutant virus lacking the ability to express ORF4 demonstrated an important role for ORF4 expression in infection and virulence. STAT1-/- mice infected with a virus lacking the ability to express ORF4 showed a delay in the onset of clinical signs when compared to mice infected with WT virus. Quantitative PCR and histopathological analysis of samples from these infected mice demonstrated that infection with a virus not expressing ORF4 results in a delayed infection in this system.

We used 3D coarse-grained computational models to estimate the antibody pressure on the seasonal flu H1N1 and the SARS subgenus spikes. Analyzing publically available sequences, we show that antibody pressure, through the geometrical organization of these spikes on the viral surface, shaped their mutability. Studying the mutability patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic spikes, we find that they are not predominantly shaped by antibody pressure. However, for SARS-CoV-2, we find that over time, it acquired, at low frequency, several mutations at antibody-accessible positions, which could indicate possible escape as define by our model.

We investigated seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD)Cspecific antibodies in the samples of participants recruited for various cardiovascular studies unrelated to exposure to the virus in 2011-2021. A cohort study recruited in 2019-2021 was used to evaluate the vaccination and anti-IgG-SARS-CoV-2CS1 RBD-positive statuses to assess the resistance and severity of Covid-19. Materials: and Methods The present observational study included subjects 18 years of age and older randomly selected from various cohorts previously recruited from 2011 to 2021 from the city of Moscow and Moscow Region for a total of 565 serum samples including recent participants (N = 310);recruited in 2019-2021. The phone survey of the participants of this cohort was conducted in October, 2021. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD-specific antibodies were assayed in the serum samples (N = 565). At endpoint (October 30, 2021), participants of the 2019-2021 cohort (N = 310) were interviewed over phone using a questionnaire that included 5 questions as follows: 1) did the participant experience a respiratory disorder at any time before or after the enrolment in the study;2) the date of the disorder;3) severity of the disorder, including asymptomatic, mild, medium (fever and cough), or severe (hospitalization);4) was the participant vaccinated and the date of vaccination;and 5) brand of a vaccine. Results: The data of the present study indicated that a small percentage (3-6%) of SARS-CoV-2-S1 RBD-specific antibodies was detected in participants recruited in 2011-2019. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2-S1 RBD-specific antibodies was increased to 16.5% in 2020 and to 46% in 2021. The vaccination rate of 238 respondents of this cohort was 58% from August, 2020 to October, 2021. If this rate is added to the rate of not vaccinated SARS-CoV-2-S1 RBD-positive subjects (11%), collective immunity was able to reach 69%. The data indicated that 12% of respondents were hospitalized. No cases of hospitalization were reported in vaccinated respondents. The morbidity rate in the subgroup of anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 RBD-positive respondents was 5.4-fold higher than that in the subgroup of vaccinated respondents (OR = 5.4;CI: 1.4 -19.8;P = 0.01). Conclusion: Detected small percentage of SARS-CoV-2-S1 RBD-specific antibodies in participants recruited in 2011-2019 indicated possible spreading of coronaviruses during the pre-pandemic period.

Our objective was to assess results of weight loss, complications and reflux in a large consecutive series of LSG, describing technical detail which contributed to outcomes. METHODS Retrospective review of prospectively collected data of 500 consecutive patients undergoing LSG. Patient demographics, weight loss, complications and functional outcomes were analysed and operative technique described. RESULTS Five hundred patients underwent LSG over 3 years (37 revisional). Mean (range) preoperative body mass index was 45 kg/m(2) (35-76 kg/m(2) ). Mean follow-up and length of hospital stay were 14 months (1-34) and 3.8 days (3-12), respectively. All-cause 30-day readmission rate 1.2%. Mean excess weight loss (interquartile range, available patient data) was 43% (22-65%, 423 patients), 58% (45-70%, 352 patients), 76% (52-84%, 258 patients), 71% (51-87%, 102 patients) and 73% (55-86%, 13 patients) at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 months, respectively. There was no mortality. Intraoperative complications occurred in two (0.4%) - splenic bleeding; bougie related oesophageal injury. Early surgical complications in four (1.2%) patients (one staple line leak and three post-operative bleeds). Other early complications occurred in three (0.6%) patients (one pseudomembranous colitis; one central line sepsis; one portal venous thrombosis) and late in four (0.8%) patients (three port-site incisional hernias; mid-sleeve stricture requiring endoscopic dilatation). Gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms decreased from 45 to 6%. CONCLUSION With attention to detail, LSG can lead to good excess weight loss with minimal complications.

METHODS: We performed a literature search using the term distributed learning OR federated learning in the PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. No start date limit was used, and the search was extended until July 21, 2020. We excluded articles outside the field of interest; guidelines or expert opinion, review articles and meta-analyses, editorials, letters or commentaries, and conference abstracts; articles not in the English language; and studies not using medical data. Selected studies were classified and analysed according to their aim(s). RESULTS: We included 26 papers aimed at predicting one or more outcomes: namely risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment side effect/adverse drug reaction. Distributed learning was compared to centralized or localized training in 21/26 and 14/26 selected papers, respectively. Regardless of the aim, the type of input, the method, and the classifier, distributed learning performed close to centralized training, but two experiments focused on diagnosis. In all but 2 cases, distributed learning outperformed locally trained models. CONCLUSION: Distributed learning resulted in a reliable strategy for model development; indeed, it performed equally to models trained on centralized datasets. Sensitive data can get preserved since they are not shared for model development. Distributed learning constitutes a promising solution for ML-based research and practice since large, diverse datasets are crucial for success.","output":"Distributed learning: a reliable privacy-preserving strategy to change multicenter collaborations using AI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is capable of broad virus detection encompassing both known and unknown adventitious viruses in a variety of sample matrices.

Therefore, molecular entities able to interfere with the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2 have great potential to inhibit viral entry. Starting from the available structural data on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor, we engineered a set of soluble and stable spike interactors, here denoted as S-plugs. Starting from the prototype S-plug, we adopted a computational approach by combining stability prediction, associated to single-point mutations, with molecular dynamics to enhance both S-plug thermostability and binding affinity to the spike protein. The best developed molecule, S-plug3, possesses a highly stable -helical con-formation (with melting temperature Tm of 54 C) and can interact with the spike RBD and S1 domains with similar low nanomolar affinities. Importantly, S-plug3 exposes the spike RBD to almost the same interface as the human ACE2 receptor, aimed at the recognition of all ACE2-accessing coronaviruses. Consistently, S-plug3 preserves a low nanomolar dissociation constant with the delta B.1.617.2 variant of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (K(D) = 29.2  0.6 nM).

It is reported that the infected people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), generally develop mild respiratory symptoms in the early stage. It will be more important to continuously monitor the RR of people in nursing homes and houses with a non-contact method. Conventional, contact-based, methods are not suitable for long-term health monitoring especially in-home care services. The potentials of wireless radio signals for health care applications, such as fall detection, etc., are examined in literature.

In this paper, for real-time monitoring, we modify the standard joint unscented Kalman filter (JUKF) method for this new and time-critical problem. Due to the nonlinear structure of the RR estimation problem with respect to the measurements, a novel modification is proposed to transform measurement errors into parameter errors by using the hyperbolic tangent function. It is shown in the experiments conducted with the real measurements taken using healthy volunteers that the proposed modified joint unscented Kalman filter (ModJUKF) method achieves the highest accuracy according to the windowing-based methods in the time-varying RR scenario.

RESULTS: In this sample, 1493 people (24.3%) thought they had had COVID-19 but only 245 (4.0%) reported having received a positive test result. Reported test results were often incongruent with participants' belief that they had had COVID-19. People who believed that they had had COVID-19 were: more likely to agree that they had some immunity to COVID-19; less likely to report adhering to lockdown measures; less worried about COVID-19; and less likely to know that cough and high temperature / fever are two of the most common symptoms of COVID-19.

The aim of this study is the identification and characterization of enteric coronaviruses on Spanish pig farms between 2017 and 2019. The study was carried out on 106 swine farms with diarrhea outbreaks where a viral etiology was suspected by using two duplex RT-PCRs developed for the detection of porcine enteric coronaviruses. PEDV was the only coronavirus detected in our research (38.7% positive outbreaks, 41 out of 106) and neither TGEV, SeCoV, PDCoV nor SeACoV were detected in any of the samples. The complete S-gene of all the PEDV isolates recovered were obtained and compared to PEDV and SeCoV sequences available in GenBank. The phylogenetic tree showed that only PEDV of the INDEL 2 or G1b genogroup has circulated in Spain between 2017 and 2019. Three different variants were detected, the recombinant PEDV-SeCoV being the most widespread. These results show that PEDV is a relevant cause of enteric disorders in pigs in Spain while new emerging coronavirus have not been detected so far. However, the monitoring of these virus is advisable to curtail their emergence and spread.","output":"Detection and Genetic Diversity of Porcine Coronavirus Involved in Diarrhea Outbreaks in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pools of overlapping synthetic peptides are routinely used for ex vivo monitoring of antigen-specific T-cell responses. However, it is rather unlikely that these peptides match those resulting from naturally processed antigens. T-activated proteins have been described as immunogenic and more natural stimulants, since they have to pass through antigen processing and comprise activation of all clinically relevant effector cell populations. METHODS: We performed comparative analysis of numbers and cytokine expression pattern of CD4 and CD8 T cells after stimulation with recombinant, urea-formulated T-activated EBV-BZLF1, -EBNA3A, and HCMV-IE1, and -pp65 proteins or corresponding overlapping peptide pools. Freshly isolated and cryopreserved PBMC of 30 EBV- and 19 HCMV-seropositive and seven EBV- and HCMV-seronegative subjects were stimulated ex vivo and analysed for IFN-, TNF and IL-2 production by flow cytometry-based intracellular cytokine staining. RESULTS: T-activated proteins showed a high specificity of 100% (EBV-BZLF1, HCMV-IE1, and -pp65) and 86% (EBV-EBNA3A), and a high T-cell stimulatory capacity of 73C95% and 67C95% using freshly isolated and cryopreserved PBMC, respectively. The overall CD4 T-cell response rates in both cohorts were comparable after stimulation with either T-activated protein or peptide pools with the exception of lower numbers of CD8 T cells detected after stimulation with T-activated EBV-EBNA3A- (p = 0.038) and HCMV-pp65- (p = 0.0006). Overall, the number of detectable antigen-specific T cells varied strongly between individuals. Cytokine expression patterns in response to T-activated protein and peptide pool-based stimulation were similar for CD4, but significantly different for CD8 T-cell responses. CONCLUSION: EBV and HCMV-derived T-activated proteins represent innovative, highly specific recall antigens suitable for use in immunological endpoint assays to evaluate success or failure in immunotherapy clinical trials (e.g. to assess the risk of EBV and/or HCMV reactivation after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation). T-activated proteins could be of particular importance, if an impaired antigen processing (e.g. in a post-transplant setting) must be taken into account.","output":"Evaluation of T-activated proteins as recall antigens to monitor EpsteinCBarr virus and human cytomegalovirus-specific T cells in a clinical trial setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a massive release of inflammatory cytokines and high mortality Preliminary mortality rates of those who require mechanical ventilation ranges from 31-66% Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have anti-inflammatory properties and are being studied as a potential treatment for steroid-resistant graft-vs-host disease, which is characterized by excessive immune activation and tissue damage Furthermore, MSCs have shown activity in pre-clinical studies in treating acute lung injury We aimed to determine the safety and feasibility of MSC in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 moderate to severe ARDS METHODS: Eleven patients were treated with remestemcel-L, an allogeneic cryopreserved MSC product, under individual patient emergency investigational new drug (eIND) applications Patients were eligible if they had COVID-19 disease with moderate to severe ARDS and had been receiving mechanical ventilation for less than 72 hours prior to the first infusion Patients with pre-existing lung disease requiring supplemental oxygen or severe liver or kidney injury were excluded Each patient received two infusions of remestemcel-L at a dose of 2 million cells/kg/ infusion, 48-120 hours apart RESULTS: Remestemcel-L infusions were well-tolerated in all eleven patients After 28 days of follow-up, ten patients (91%) were extubated, nine (82%) remained liberated from mechanical ventilation and were discharged from the ICU and two (18%) died The median time to extubation was ten days Eight patients (73%) were discharged from the hospital C reactive protein levels significantly declined within five days of MSC infusion Five patients developed secondary infections and one patient experienced pulmonary embolism, which were thought to be attributable to their underlying disease CONCLUSIONS: Remestemcel-L infusions to treat COVID-19 associated moderate to severe ARDS were safe and associated with substantial clinical and laboratory improvement A randomized controlled trial based on these results is underway","output":"Mesenchymal stromal cell therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted an implementation research study to integrate a holistic package of physical health, mental health and psychosocial care for podoconiosis, lymphatic filariasis and leprosy into routine healthcare in Gusha cluster, Guagusa Shikudad district, northwest Ethiopia.

While first-line therapy is well-established for metastatic HER2 + breast cancer, the standard of care for second-line therapy will likely be changing soon based on the results of the DESTINY-Breast03 trial. In the third-line setting, many options are available. Considerations in choosing between regimens in the third-line include resistance to trastuzumab, the presence of brain metastases, and tolerability. High rates of resistance exist in this setting particularly due to expression of p95, a truncated form of HER2 that constitutively activates downstream signaling pathways. We suggest a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-based regimen because of the activity of TKIs in brain metastases and in p95-expressing tumors. Attempts to overcome resistance to anti-HER2 therapies with PI3K inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, and CDK 4/6 inhibitors are an active area of research.

This study explores the impact of SIPOs on health, with particular attention to heterogeneity in their impacts. First, using daily state-level social distancing data from SafeGraph and a difference-in-differences approach, we document that adoption of a SIPO was associated with a 5 to 10 percent increase in the rate at which state residents remained in their homes full-time. Then, using daily state-level coronavirus case data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we find that approximately three weeks following the adoption of a SIPO, cumulative COVID-19 cases fell by 44 percent. Event-study analyses confirm common COVID-19 case trends in the week prior to SIPO adoption and show that SIPO-induced case reductions grew larger over time. However, this average effect masks important heterogeneity across states  early adopters and high population density states appear to reap larger benefits from their SIPOs.

However, from the literature, perception of artificial meat in China is not well known. A survey was thus carried out to investigate Chinese attitudes toward artificial meat. The answers of 4666 respondents concluded that 19.9% and 9.6% of them were definitely willing and unwilling to try artificial meat respectively, whereas 47.2% were not willing to eat it regularly, and 87.2% were willing to pay less for it compared to conventional meat. Finally, 52.9% of them will accept artificial meat as an alternative to conventional meat. Emotional resistance such as the perception of absurdity or disgusting would lead to no willingness to eat artificial meat regularly. The main concerns were related to safety and unnaturalness, but less to ethical and environmental issues as in Western countries. Nearly half of the respondents would like artificial meat to be safe, tasty, and nutritional. Whereas these expectations have low effects on willingness to try, they may induce consumers rejection to eat artificial meat regularly, underlying the weak relationship between wishes to try and to eat regularly.

Besides, the SARS-CoV-02 virus survives for several hours on different surfaces, where a new host can contract it with a delay. These passive modes of infection transmission remain an unexplored area for traditional mean-field epidemic models. Here, we design an agent-based model for simulations of infection transmission in an open system driven by the dynamics of social activity; the model takes into account the personal characteristics of individuals, as well as the survival time of the virus and its potential mutations. A growing bipartite graph embodies this biosocial process, consisting of active carriers (host) nodes that produce viral nodes during their infectious period. With its directed edges passing through viral nodes between two successive hosts, this graph contains complete information about the routes leading to each infected individual. We determine temporal fluctuations of the number of exposed and the number of infected individuals, the number of active carriers and active viruses at hourly resolution. The simulated processes underpin the latent infection transmissions, contributing significantly to the spread of the virus within a large time window. More precisely, being brought by social dynamics and exposed to the currently existing infection, an individual passes through the infectious state until eventually spontaneously recovers or otherwise is moves to a controlled hospital environment. Our results reveal complex feedback mechanisms that shape the dependence of the infection curve on the intensity of social dynamics and other sociobiological factors. In particular, the results show how the lockdown effectively reduces the spread of infection and how it increases again after the lockdown is removed. Furthermore, a reduced level of social activity but prolonged exposure of susceptible individuals have adverse effects. On the other hand, virus mutations that can gradually reduce the transmission rate by hopping to each new host along the infection path can significantly reduce the extent of the infection, but can not stop the spreading without additional social strategies. Our stochastic processes, based on graphs at the interface of biology and social dynamics, provide a new mathematical framework for simulations of various epidemic control strategies with high temporal resolution and virus traceability.","output":"Modeling latent infection transmissions through biosocial stochastic dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Climate change is a well-recognized threat to human health with impacts on every organ system and with implications for disease processes across subspecialties.

Patients reported their sense of well-being with the WHO-5 questionnaire and their perception and fears for the impact of the pandemic on their ongoing ARMD treatment. RESULTS: There was a significant drop in mental well-being during the pandemic that paralleled the self-reported impact of the pandemic on ARMD treatment. Patients who reported a higher impact of COVID-19 on their treatment had experienced a higher drop in mental wellbeing compared to those who hadnt, with female gender being an additional risk factor. Objective measurements of visual acuity did not factor in the drop of sense of well-being.

There was a significantly greater proportion of people who reported seeing, hearing or reading something about the harms of waterpipe smoking after the campaign (67.5%) compared with before (45.0%) (p=0.003). Post-campaign, there were higher proportions of people who strongly agreed that waterpipe smoking causes damage, and that it contains cancer-causing substances, but these increases were not statistically significant. There was low awareness of waterpipe cessation services at baseline and post campaign (22.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The Shisha No Thanks project increased awareness of messages about the harms of waterpipe smoking. Although this is a small study, the longitudinal evaluation findings have international relevance and make a useful contribution to the understanding of the impact such interventions can have in addressing one of the few forms of tobacco use that is growing in both developed and developing countries.

Furthermore, comparison to a conventional learning-method with special attention on orientation and recognition of physiological structures. METHODS: Prospective two-arm study with the participation of 226 clinical students. 108 students were given an extract from a textbook on fetal echocardiography (PDF-group, n = 108) for 30 min to study. 118 students were able to use the new ultrasound-simulator-app (Simulator-group, n = 118) to learn for 30 min. The knowledge of the students was examined both before and after the learning-period by having them identify sonographic structures in videos using single-choice selection. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding age (p = 0.87), gender (p = 0.28), and the number of previously performed ultrasound-examinations (p = 0.45). In the Simulator-group, there was a significantly higher learning effect regarding the proportion of students with an increase of correct answers in the video test examination (p = 0.005). At the end of learning, the students in the Simulator-group needed significantly less time to display the structures in the apps simulation (median initially 10.9 s vs. 6.8 s at the end; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The novel ultrasound-simulation-app seems to be a useful addition and improvement to ultrasound training. Previous difficulties such as simultaneously having patients, ultrasound-machines, and professors at disposal can thus be avoided.

METHODS: A retrospective observational chart analysis of OGI patients was performed. The collected variables consisted of age, date, gender, time of injury, time until repair, mechanism of injury, zone of injury, injury associated vitreous hemorrhage, trauma associated RD, post traumatic RD, aphakia at injury, periocular trauma and OTS in cases of OGI. RESULTS: Totally 102 patients with traumatic OGI with a minimum of 12mo follow-up and a median age at of 48.6y (range: 3-104y) were identified. Final best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was independent from the time of repair, yet a statistically significant difference was present between the final BCVA and the zone of injury. Severe trauma presenting with an OTS score I (P<0.0001) or II (P<0.0001) revealed a significantly worse BCVA at last follow up when compared to the cohort with an OTS score >III. OGI associated RD was observed in 36/102 patients (35.3%), whereas post traumatic RD (defined as RD following 14d after OGI) occurred in 37 patients (36.3%). OGI associated RD did not correlate with the OTS and the zone of injury (P=0.193), yet post traumatic RD correlated significantly with zone III injuries (P=0.013). CONCLUSION: The study shows a significant association between lower OTS score and zone III injury with lower final BCVA and a higher number of surgeries, but only zone III could be significantly associated with a higher rate of RD.","output":"Reliability of the ocular trauma score for the predictability of traumatic and post-traumatic retinal detachment after open globe injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The G20 proclaimed that Value-Based Healthcare (VBHC) offers the best approach to sustain and improve healthcare services after the pandemic. Value-Based Procurement (VBP) enables the implementation of VBHC by considering total cost of care and health outcomes to support better purchasing decisions. This poster advocates for a broader adoption of VBP in Latin America (LA). Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with six experts from academia, government, industry and multilateral organizations. A standardized questionnaire was used to identify case studies, key success factors and hurdles for implementation of VBP in LA. Experts provided supporting literature that was further expanded using the snowball technique. Results: We identified three examples: (1) Integrated Renal Care Services (Colombia), where the High Cost Account defines and record clinical outcomes financially rewarding those outperformers;(2) Vaccines value-based recommendation (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia), where a National Vaccine Advisory Committee selects the vaccine to be procured informed by a cost-effectiveness analysis;and (3) Diabetes Type 1 care model (Brazil), in a public-private collaboration defines and gather outcomes to support a value-based tender for 2022. Common key success factors include multi-stakeholder alignment on value attributes;monitoring and reporting performance indicators and the training of stakeholders. Hurdles identified included lack of IT infrastructure, price-based procurement mandates and institutional misalignment (finance, procurement, health agencies). Conclusions: Traditional procurement approaches undermine value realization from healthcare investments. Although we focused in 3 cases involving public funding, there are more examples in the private sector which demonstrate the feasibility and sustainability of a VBP approach. Education and mentoring to develop local expertise are key to strengthen decision makers confidence in advancing VBP, while multilateral organizations could play a role in capacity building and institutional alignment.

Due to the Covid 19 pandemic, teaching was changed to an inverted classroom concept combining asynchronous and synchronous teaching. The students worked at the beginning of the semester on an e-learning module of the learning platform docCom.deutsch on the topic sharing information using reflection and processing tasks. In two digital sessions, the students then were able to practice discharge interviews and discussions about risk communication illustrated by the example of screening methods for cancer prevention. In the first zoom session, students practiced in role-plays among themselves. In the second zoom session, they practiced with SP. The evaluation results revealed that 76% of the responding students considered working with the e-learning module as a good preparation for the interviews. According to the evaluation results, satisfaction with the Zoom meeting including SP contact was slightly higher than those with role-plays among themselves. Although the group atmosphere was rated by all responding students as conducive to learning, almost half of them confirmed that using Zoom significantly impaired the atmosphere (47%). In retrospect, the conversion of the communication training to a digital format worked better than expected from both the perspective of teachers and students. The students explicitly appreciated working with SP. From the teachers perspective, some specific aspects of successful communication were difficult to reflect on, e.g. non-verbal communication.

Nurses play a key role in fighting this disease and are at risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, there is an urgent need to assess the mental health condition of nurses and establish appropriate interventions to reduce the negative psychiatric outcomes of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the knowledge and psychological stress related to COVID-19 among nursing staff and to provide evidence of the need for targeted training and psychological intervention. METHODS: This cross-sectional web-based survey study was performed in a class 3 grade A general hospital in a southwest province of China from March 1 to March 15, 2020. A self-designed questionnaire with questions about COVID-19-related prevention and control knowledge and the Triage Assessment Form (TAF) were used to assess nursing staff's knowledge of COVID-19 and their degree of psychological stress, respectively. SPSS 23.0 was applied for statistical analysis of the collected data. RESULTS: A total of 979 nurses completed the questionnaire. The results showed that the nursing staff provided the fewest correct answers to questions about continuous viral nucleic acid testing specifications (379/979 correct answers, 38.7%), isolation/discharge criteria (539/979 correct answers, 55.1%), and management measures for patients with suspected symptoms (713/979 correct answers, 72.8%). The median total score of the TAF was 7.0 (IQR 5.0-12.0), and there were statistically significant differences in scores between different nursing roles, years of work experience, and hospital departments (P<.05).

Materials and Methods After thorough oral examination of adult Saudi SLE patients of Asir hospital and that of healthy control subjects, the subjects underwent BMCA from normal unaffected bilateral buccal mucosae. Results Pearson's correlation test showed that MN count did not significantly correlate with either disease activity or duration of SLE. Conclusions Controlled state SLE does not lead to a significant increase in MN formation.

In order to obtain molecular insights to unknown functions of p57, we performed a protein interaction screen. We identified the transcription regulator four-and-a-half LIM-only protein 2 (FHL2) as a novel p57-binding protein. Co-immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assays were used to elucidate the physiological and functional relevance of p57/FHL2 interaction. We found in cancer cells that endogenous p57 and FHL2 are in a complex. We observed a substantial induction of established FHL2-regulated gene promoters by p57 in reporter gene experiments and detected strong induction of the intrinsic transactivation activity of FHL2. Treatment of cells with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and binding of exogenous FHL2 to HDACs indicated repression of FHL2 transcription activity by HDACs. In the presence of the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate activation of FHL2 by p57 is abrogated suggesting that p57 shares a common pathway with HDAC inhibitors. p57 competes with HDACs for FHL2 binding which might partly explain the mechanism of FHL2 activation by p57.

It could be hypothesized that immunodeficient patients, due to immunosuppressive drugs or their disease, have a more severe disease course due to their immunocompromised state. However, it could also be hypothesized that some of the immunosuppressive drugs protect against a hyperinflammatory state. METHODS: We collected data on the incidence of COVID-19, disease course and SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in COVID-19 positive patients in a cohort of patients (n= 4497) known at the Clinical Immunology outpatient clinic in a tertiary care hospital in the Netherlands. RESULTS: In the first six months of the pandemic, 16 patients were identified with COVID-19, 14 by nasal swab PCR, and 2 patients by SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Eight patients were admitted to the hospital. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured in 8 patients and were detectable in all, including one patient on B-cell ablative therapy and one patient with Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorder. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the disease course differs among immunocompromised patients, independently of (dis)continuation of immunosuppressive drugs. Antibody production for SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised patients was shown.

Despite the tremendous efforts and resources spent around the world trying to explore antiviral drugs, there is still no effective clinical treatment for COVID-19. Approximately 15% of COVID-19 cases progress to pneumonia, patients with severe pneumonia may die from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In addition, further pulmonary fibrosis from SARS-CoV-2 infection causes ARDS that often leads to irreversible impairment of lung function. If the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily cause immune responses or immune cell infiltration can be identified, it is possible to alleviate or prevent severe lung damage by modulating the infiltration and activation of specific immune cells to mitigate excessive immunity response.The extent to which subsets of immune cells are significantly altered in the lung tissue of COVID-19 patients remains unclear. This study applied the CIBERSORT method to comprehensively evaluate the immune infiltration landscape in lung tissues of COVID-19 patients, and further compared with the one from lung tissue of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We found several immune cell subtypes;particularly na?ve B cells are highly infiltrated in COVID-19 group. A comparison of functional gene set analysis revealed that non-differentiated na?ve B cells may be the main cause of the overactive humoral immune response.

The presently available treatment with interferon plus ribavirin, has limited benefits due to adverse side effects such as anemia, depression, fatigue, and \\"flu-like\\" symptoms. Herbal plants have been used for centuries against different diseases including viral diseases and have become a major source of new compounds to treat bacterial and viral diseases. MATERIAL: The present study was design to study the antiviral effect of Glycyrrhizin (GL) against HCV. For this purpose, HCV infected liver cells were treated with GL at non toxic doses and HCV titer was measured by Quantitative real time RT-PCR. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrated that GL inhibit HCV titer in a dose dependent manner and resulted in 50% reduction of HCV at a concentration of 14  2 g. Comparative studies were made with interferon alpha to investigate synergistic effects, if any, between antiviral compound and interferon alpha 2a. Our data showed that GL exhibited synergistic effect when combined with interferon. Moreover, these results were verified by transiently transfecting the liver cells with HCV 3a core plasmid. The results proved that GL dose dependently inhibit the expression of HCV 3a core gene both at mRNA and protein levels while the GAPDH remained constant. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that GL inhibit HCV full length viral particles and HCV core gene expression or function in a dose dependent manner and had synergistic effect with interferon. In future, GL along with interferon will be better option to treat HCV infection.","output":"Glycyrrhizin as antiviral agent against Hepatitis C Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article focuses on the Considerations related to the use of molecular diagnostic tests in veterinary clinical and regulatory practice .

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of referrals to and eligible donors from an eye bank between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, was performed, with the same time period in 2019 as a control. Referrals who were not procured because of Eye Bank Association of America COVID-19 guidelines and eye bank-specific restrictions were noted. The results of 1 month of routine postmortem testing performed by the eye bank were examined. Analysis of variance tests were performed to assess the change between donors from 2019 to 2020. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in both the number of total referrals to the eye bank (P = 0.044) and donors eligible for surgical transplantation (P = 0.031). Eye Bank Association of America COVID-19 guidelines reduced the number of referrals over this period by 4% to 14%. Of the 266 surgically eligible donors who received postmortem COVID-19 testing in June by the eye bank, 13 resulted positive (4.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a reduction in referrals and eligible corneal transplant donors at a single eye bank, there was a surplus of surgically suitable corneal tissue during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, little is known about a serious health-risk-behavior named \\"food and alcohol disturbance\\" (FAD), characterized by engaging in dysfunctional eating on days of planned alcohol consumption. The aim of the present study was to investigate potential factors that may have put young adults at risk or protected against FAD during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: A sample of 447 young adults (280 females, 167 males; range 18-26) completed an online survey during the country's nationwide lockdown composed of self-reported measures assessing FAD behaviors, alcohol consumption, compensatory behaviors, eating and weight concerns, social support, emotion regulation strategies, and living arrangement. RESULTS: Our findings showed that FAD was significantly and positively correlated to alcohol consumption, use of laxatives, self-induced vomiting, eating and weight concerns, and expressive suppression, and negatively correlated to social support and living with family. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that alcohol consumption, eating concern, and expression suppression positively predicted FAD, while social support and living with family were negative predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that during the COVID-19 lockdown, preoccupation with eating and the use of expressive suppression may have increased vulnerability to FAD; conversely, perceived social support and living with family may have been a source of protection against this dysfunctional behavior.

Our model further includes a crucial third factor in decisions: a cost of non-compliance with the policy-maker immediately above in the hierarchy, such as non-compliance of state with federal policies. Our first contribution is a closed-form approximation of a recently published agent-based model to compute the number of infections for any implemented policy.

DESIGN: In this cross-sectional design, participants were recruited via random area probability sampling to participate in a comprehensive public health survey. The questionnaire examined demographic, health and socioeconomic factors. Logistic regression analysis was employed to identify predictors of SI. SETTING: Community setting from high (n=20) and low (n=8) deprivation neighbourhoods across the North West of England, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 4319 people were recruited between August 2015 and January 2016. There were 809 participants from low-deprivation neighbourhoods and 3510 from high-deprivation neighbourhoods. The sample comprised 1854 (43%) men and 2465 (57%) women. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: SI was the dependent variable which was assessed using item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 instrument. RESULTS: 454 (11%) participants reported having SI within the last 2 weeks. Model 1 (excluding mental health variables) identified younger age, black and minority ethnic (BME) background, lower housing quality and current smoker status as key predictors of SI. Higher self-esteem, empathy and neighbourhood belonging, alcohol abstinence and having arthritis were protective against SI. Model 2 (including mental health variables) found depression and having cancer as key health predictors for SI, while identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer (LGBTQ) and BME were significant demographic predictors. Alcohol abstinence, having arthritis and higher empathy levels were protective against SI. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that it could be useful to increase community support and sense of belonging using a public health approach for vulnerable groups (e.g. those with cancer) and peer support for people who identify as LGBTQ and/or BME.

The analysis was guided by four overarching questions: 1) What were robots used for in the COVID-19 response? 2) When were they used? 3) How did different countries innovate? and 4) Did having a national policy on robotics influence a countrys innovation and insertion of robotics for COVID-19? The findings indicate that robots were used for six different sociotechnical work domains and 29 discrete use cases. When robots were used varied greatly on the country; although many countries did report an increase at the beginning of their first surge. To understand the findings of how innovation occurred, the data was examined through the lens of the technologys maturity according to NASAs Technical Readiness Assessment metrics. Through this lens, findings note that existing robots were used for more than 78% of the instances; slightly modified robots made up 10%; and truly novel robots or novel use cases constituted 12% of the instances. The findings clearly indicate that countries with a national robotics initiative were more likely to use robotics more often and for broader purposes. Finally, the dataset and analysis produces a broad set of implications that warrant further study and investigation.

Second, we find evidence of a segregation effect, since mobility contraction is stronger in municipalities in which inequality is higher and for those where individuals have lower income per capita. Our results highlight both the social costs of lockdown and a challenge of unprecedented intensity: On the one hand, the crisis is inducing a sharp reduction of fiscal revenues for both national and local governments; on the other hand, a significant fiscal effort is needed to sustain the most fragile individuals and to mitigate the increase in poverty and inequality induced by the lockdown.","output":"Economic and social consequences of human mobility restrictions under COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case report describes an intentional intoxication with 18 g of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) presenting with unconsciousness, ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock and pulmonary oedema.

Natural compounds such as alkaloids are usually known as effective compounds due to their medicinal characteristics and easy access to their sources. To this end, more than 3,200 natural alkaloid structures interacted with pentameric ion channels. Alkaloid compounds established significant and stable interactions with the channel.

The compound of psammaplysin U (NA-1) with a binding affinity of-13.52 kcal/mol and binding free energy of-82.21 kcal/mol established hydrogen interactions with the amino acid of Val 25 in the B chain of the ion channel, which placed the compound at the top of the selected compounds. The molecular dynamics simulation of the ligand-protein complex in the 100 ps trajectory showed that the principal interactions were hydrogen and halogen bonding with the amino acids of Val 25 and Thr 30 in the B chain and A chain, respectively, which could be a suitable inhibitor to combat the COVID-19. ? 2021 by the authors.","output":"Blocking effect of natural alkaloids on covid-19 pentameric ion channel: An in silico perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an infection caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) virus.

NCS are abundant in our food supply and found in consumable products such as diet beverages, yoghurts and chewing gum. Studies in rodents have shown adverse effects, including increased oxidative stress and elevated glucose concentrations. Despite noted effects on metabolic outcomes. there is limited research on the impact of NCS on human reproductive health, with some evidence of in utero exposure to NCS promoting pregnancy complications. Female rodent studies has found associations between NCS consumption and reduced pregnancy length, with adverse outcomes reported in offspring, including reduced fetal growth, however the effect of NCS on reproduction has been relatively under-researched in a human setting, particularly in relation to male reproductive outcomes. We therefore set out to systematically examine the literature in relation to pre-clinical rodent studies investigating the role of NCS on male fertility outcomes. A literature search was performed in Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus to find all studies investigating the effects of NCS on male fertility when compared with controls or a nutritive sweetener group. Searches were conducted for the following NCS;aspartame, stevia, acesulfame k, advantame, saccharin, neotame, cyclamate and sucralose. Primary outcomes were effects on sperm quality, quantity, or pregnancy success. Secondary outcomes were effects on reproductive organ weights, litter size and gestational length. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion and carried out a risk of bias assessment in Covidence, using the Syrcle risk of bias tool. In total, 9 studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in our review. The NCS studied in mice and included in the final studies were aspartame, advantame, rebaudioside a (stevia), saccharin, and sucralose. Acesulfame k, neotame and cyclamate did not arise in our searches and were not included. Overall, 44% of studies showed a negative effect of NCS on male reproductive parameters, with an observed reduction in sperm count, compared with controls. 33% of the studies observed significant reductions in sperm motility, viability, and an increase in abnormal sperm in the NCS group, however only one included study on saccharin used the appropriate ADI equivalent to humans of < 5 mg/kg bw/day, while the remaining NCS exceeded the ADI for human consumption. Two studies showed a dose-dependent effect of NCS on fertility parameters and four studies reported decreased reproductive organ weights. Studies using advantame and sucralose observed no effect on male fertility, however in the advantame study, only high dose groups were assessed and in the sucralose study, sperm motility and viability were not assessed. NCS seem to affect male fertility in rodents, with some studies showing significant effects on reduced sperm quality and quantity in rodents consuming aspartame, saccharin, and stevia. There may be a dose-dependent manner of NCS effects, with higher intakes associated with worse outcomes, compared with lower intakes and controls. The specific effects of NCS on fertility have been conflicting and the available studies have been heterogeneous in terms of the study duration, sample size and the doses evaluated, with most studies using NCS doses well above the ADI for humans. Further research in humans is needed to assess whether NCS could be a potential cause of male fertility issues.","output":"The impact of non-caloric sweeteners on male fertility: a systematic review in rodent models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With more and more people infected with COVID-19, it was found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was quite different from SARS-CoV.

Cytopathic effects (CPE) that consisted of enlarged and rounded cells followed by cell shrinkage and detachment, were identified by the 3rd viral passage in the IPEC-J2 cells. PDCoV antigen was detected in the cells showing CPE. By double IF and TUNEL staining, most PDCoV antigen-positive IPEC-J2 cells failed to show TUNEL-positive signals, indicating that PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells may not undergo apoptosis, but rather necrosis, similar to necrotic cell death of infected enterocytes in vivo.

The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) emerged as a promising drug target because of its essential role in the processing of polyproteins, which is translated from viral RNA. The present study reports a designed novel hybrid antiviral molecule (VTRRT-13.V2.1) against SARS-CoV2 main protease. A series of different combinations of hybrid antiviral were generated from nonspecific antiviral molecules currently used to control COVID-19. To enhance the specificity of the designed hybrid antiviral molecule, the core pocket region of the active site of M(pro) protein was targeted. In-silico screening, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) analysis identified a hybrid VTRRT-13.V2 molecule. Retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis generated 1000 analogs of VTRRT-13.V2 molecules. Docking, molecular mechanics, and MDS analysis selected VTRRT-13.V2.1 as a possible inhibitor for SARS-CoV2 main protease. Comparative analysis of all the results showed that VTRRT-13.V2.1 have the highest docking Glide score (-12.28 kcal/mol) and best binding energy (-52.23 kcal/mol) as compared to the other hybrid constructs such as VTRRT-13.V2 (-9.47 and -47.36 kcal/mol), VTRRT-13 (-8.9 and -47.55 kcal/mol), and current antiviral investigated. The mutational sensitivity screening showed that binding residues of M(pro) are not present in mutation hotspots. It was also observed that VTRRT-13.V2.1 does not have any human off-targets. SARS-CoV2 main protease is essential for the survival of this virus; hence, a designed novel hybrid antiviral molecule (VTRRT-13.V2.1) might be useful to control the infection of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Novel hybrid antiviral VTRRT-13V2.1 against SARS-CoV2 main protease: retro-combinatorial synthesis and molecular dynamics analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a tool used to integrate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics knowledge to optimize and personalize various drug therapies. The optimization of drug dosing may improve treatment outcomes, reduce toxicity, and reduce the risk of developing drug resistance. To adequately implement TDM, accurate and precise analytical procedures are required. In clinical practice, blood is the most commonly used matrix for TDM; however, less invasive samples, such as dried blood spots or non-invasive saliva samples, are increasingly being used. The choice of sample preparation method, type of column packing, mobile phase composition, and detection method is important to ensure accurate drug measurement and to avoid interference from matrix effects and drug metabolites. Most of the reported procedures used liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques due to its high selectivity and sensitivity. High-performance chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) methods are also used when a simpler and more cost-effective methodology is desired for clinical monitoring. The application of high-performance chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) with and without derivatization processes and high-performance chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED) techniques for the analysis of various drugs in biological samples for TDM have been described less often. Before chromatographic analysis, samples were pretreated by various procedures-most often by protein precipitation, liquid-liquid extraction, and solid-phase extraction, rarely by microextraction by packed sorbent, dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction.

This effect is greater in the people, who are the most violated in their rights. In relation to the social crisis and gender perspective, women are particularly affected by the pandemic. Given the disadvantaged situation of women socially, economically, and politically, their self-care is diminished. OBJECTIVE: To identify whether there is an association between the classic risk factors for prematurity and fetal growth restriction and the increase in these pathologies in the period March-September 2020, in a maternity hospital that assists women from low resources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study, with a comparative analysis of the periods between 15 March and 30 September 2019 and the same period in 2020. The data were obtained from an electronic clinical database. The prevalence of preterm birth and small-for-gestational age newborn was analyzed. Indicators available in the database that reflect maternal conditions that lead to an unfavorable maternal environment were selected and they were classified into categories. RESULTS: In the period of 2019, 3225 births were registered and in the period of 2020, 3036 births. In the 2019 period, 12.2% of prematurity was evidenced, while in the 2020 period, 14.5% (RR = 1.19, IC 95% = 1.05-1.35, p = .005). In relation to PEG 5.5% in the first period versus 6.9% in the second (RR = 1.26, CI 95% = 1.04-1.53, p = .01). No increases were found in the indicators that are traditionally related to the etiologies proposed to explain the increase in prematurity and small-for-age gestational, there was no evidence of an increase in inflammatory or vascular conditions. CONCLUSION: The economic, psychological and social crises, in the 1st semester of the health emergency, seriously affected the social determinants of the health of pregnant women who use the Public Maternity of reference in Uruguay.

However, existing models are especially ineffective in predicting conflicts (or negative links) among users. This is due to a strong correlation between link signs and the network structure, where negative links between polarized communities are too sparse to be predicted even by state-of-the-art approaches.

This review seeks to quantify the plethora of pre-departure preparation training available to public health, clinical, and undergraduate trainees across the continuum of education for short-term experiences in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS We performed a systematic review of Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Ovid Global Health in February, 2018. A three-concept search was employed and included \\"global or international health\\"; \\"education or preparation of personnel/students\\"; and \\"field programs or travel.\\" The study teamed used PRISMA reporting guidelines to conduct title and full-text reviews and conduct data extraction and analysis. RESULTS The search returned 2506 unique articles. Of these, 55 met inclusion criteria and were included in the final review. Ninety one percent (91%) of articles focused on pre-departure trainings for medical students and residents. Nine thematic domains for short-term international field experiences emerged; culture, safety, and project-specific knowledge were the most frequently covered domains while mentorship, professionalism, and emotional wellness and culture shock were least common. Approximately half (53.3%) of studies specifically evaluated the pre-departure component of the international experience using a survey or evaluation form. Recommendations emerged from these evaluations including early engagement with international partners, inclusion of self-reflection exercises and site-specific content, and utilization of interactive approaches in learning. Some institutions face barriers to conducting pre-departure preparation such as lack of dedicated faculty, finances, and institutional support. CONCLUSIONS Interest in pre-departure training for international experiences is growing but few programs conduct and publish evaluations of these trainings. Pre-departure trainings should be developed in partnership with receiving institutions and faculty and incorporate critical self- reflection throughout the experience. In addition to the experience itself, institutions need to evaluate these curricula to better understand how they influence trainees' capacity to effectively engage in LMIC settings.","output":"Are you ready?

Thus, its impacts on maternal health are not yet fully established. This study aimed to verify the relationship between the maternal mortality ratio and the incidence of COVID-19 in the State of Bahia, Brazil, 2020. METHODS: This time-series study used publicly available information in Brazil, to obtain data on maternal deaths and live births in Bahia, State, from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2020. The time trend of Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) was analysed through polynomial regression, of order 6. Expected MMR, monthly (Jan-Dec) and annual values for 2020, were predicted by the additive Holt-Winters exponential smoothing algorithm, with 95% confidence interval, based on the time series of the MMR from 2011 to 2019, and the accuracy of the forecasts for 2020 was assessed by checking the smoothing coefficients and the mean errors. According to the statistical forecast, the MMR values recorded in the year 2020 were compared to those expected. RESULTS: In 2020, the annual MMR in Bahia, Brazil, was 78.23/100,000 live births, 59.46% higher than the expected ratio (49.06 [95% CI 38.70C59.90]). The increase in maternal mortality ratio relative to expected values was observed throughout the 2020 months; however, only after May, when the COVID-19 epidemic rose sharply, it exceeded the upper limit of the 95% CI of the monthly prediction. Of the 144 registered maternal deaths in 2020, 19 (13.19%) had COVID-19 mentioned as the cause of death.

Global Health Directorate of The Indus Health Network supported the provincial government by rolling out several walk-in community-based testing initiatives across Karachi. Results were conveyed to the patients through each district government. With a disproportionate rise in cases, an increasing delay in reporting results was observed. Methods: To help the district government bridge this gap, two physicians were engaged to convey timely results to patients who tested positive, through a helpline. Subsequently, proactive teleconsultation was initiated. We present a retrospective review of data collected during teleconsultation for COVID-19 cases identified through community-based testing between April 5 and June 10, 2020. Results: A total of 4,279 tests were conducted, revealing a 28% positivity rate (1,196 cases). Out of these, 752 (62.9%) baseline positive patients were contactable. Most patients identified either a close contact (46.8%) or a household contact (30.1%) as the source of infection. 41.8% patients were asymptomatic, 52.9% had mild to moderate illness, and 1.1% needed referral to the emergency department. 82.7% patients reported no comorbidities.

Antigenic tests have recently been made available to help the diagnostics. We have conducted a retrospective study to determine the sensitivity of these antigenic tests, comparing them to the reference RT-PCR method. METHOD: Between December 7, 2020 and January 31, 2021, each patient we received in our laboratories for an RT-PCR test was enrolled. Out of 271,649 patients, 4,881 had been submitted to an antigenic test (TDR) in the preceding 24 hours. Comparing the data resulting from both tests, we established the sensitivity and the specificity of the antigenic tests. For our analysis we included the parameter of symptom and/or the value of Cycles threshold (Ct) in our parameters. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the TDRs compared to all the positive RT-PCR tests is 56%. We further demonstrate the correlation between the symptom duration and the reduction of the nasopharyngeal viral load. Based on this data, we have established that the sensitivity of the TDRs decreases very rapidly after symptom onset, contrary to the estimated viral load in the RT-PCR. Indeed, less the 24 hours after clinical symptom onset, the sensitivity of the TDRs decreases from 74% to 60%. By including the Ct value in our parameters, we have established that, despite a high viral load and clinical symptoms since 7 days or less, the sensitivity of the TDRs is 66%. Although, a high number of asymptomatic patients among carriers of SARS-CoV-2, we have estimated a specificity of 93% for our test.

RESULTS: There were 74 patients with COVID-19 that met the inclusion criteria of this study and they composed our experimental group. Fifty-four (73%) were men and 20 (27%) women. There were 30 (40.5%) patients with hearing loss. Seventeen patients had unilateral and 13 had bilateral hearing loss. Significant differences between hearing loss groups and control group were found across all age groups, but not at all frequencies. No important differences were found when unilateral hearing loss and bilateral hearing loss groups were compared. There were no significant differences in distributions of comorbidities between the patients with hearing loss and normal hearing patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found that 30 (40.5%) of the COVID-19 positive patients had sensorineural type of hearing loss. Across all age groups, there were statistically significant differences in frequencies between the COVID-19 positive patients and the control group. There were no significant differences in distributions of comorbidities between the patients with hearing loss and normal hearing patients. Distribution of unilateral and bilateral hearing loss and audiogram types was also not significantly different between the age groups.","output":"COVID-19 caused hearing loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivated by the current Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which is due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the important problem of forecasting daily deaths and cumulative deaths, this paper examines the construction of prediction regions or intervals under the Poisson regression model and for an over-dispersed Poisson regression model. For the Poisson regression model, several prediction regions are developed and their performance are compared through simulation studies. The methods are applied to the problem of forecasting daily and cumulative deaths in the United States (US) due to COVID-19. To examine their performance relative to what actually happened, daily deaths data until May 15th were used to forecast cumulative deaths by June 1st. It was observed that there is over-dispersion in the observed data relative to the Poisson regression model. An over-dispersed Poisson regression model is therefore proposed. This new model builds on frailty ideas in Survival Analysis and over-dispersion is quantified through an additional parameter. The Poisson regression model is a hidden model in this over-dispersed Poisson regression model and obtains as a limiting case when the over-dispersion parameter increases to infinity. A prediction region for the cumulative number of US deaths due to COVID-19 by July 16th, given the data until July 2nd, is presented. Finally, the paper discusses limitations of proposed procedures and mentions open research problems, as well as the dangers and pitfalls when forecasting on a long horizon, with focus on this pandemic where events, both foreseen and unforeseen, could have huge impacts on point predictions and prediction regions.","output":"Prediction Regions for Poisson and Over-Dispersed Poisson Regression Models with Applications to Forecasting Number of Deaths during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a unique disaster has stressed the extreme importance of the three issues for medicine, society and humanity in general: comorbidity, pandemic and syndemic. There are many reasons why the study of comorbidities and syndemics of COVID-19 is of great importance for researchers, clinicians and health policy makers who are responsible for health care organization and funding in a bid to develop more effective and efficient prevention and treatment. Thinking about COVID-19 through a syndemics concept and taking biological, psychological, social and spiritual dimensions into account, physicians could be more effective in clinical practice and community-based interventions. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is determined by the virus-host interaction, with pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 being related to the presence of comorbid diseases. The risk for severe COVID-19 clinical manifestations and death increases with age of patients and comorbidity. General mechanisms of multi-system dysfunction and multi-organ damage reported in COVID-19 are probably related to ubiquitous expression of ACE2 in many tissues and its important role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) functioning. Physicians all over the world should be aware of COVID-19 related comorbidities, multisystem disorders and syndemics, as well as treatment and preventive strategies. COVID-19 age is a right time to reconsider the state of science and practice in comorbidity medicine field from the both epistemological and treatment perspective. Comorbidities and multimorbidities are indifferent to medical specializations, so the integrative and complementary medicine is an imperative in the both education and practice. Shifting the paradigm from vertical and mono-morbid interventions to comorbidity, multimorbidity and multi-system disease approaches enhances effectiveness and efficiency of human resources utilization.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study is a case series of 463 consecutive patients with COVID-19 evaluated at Henry Ford Health System in metropolitan Detroit, Michigan, from March 9 to March 27, 2020. Data analysis was performed from March to April 2020. EXPOSURE: Laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Demographic data, underlying comorbidities, clinical presentation, complications, treatment, and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: Of 463 patients with COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 57.5 [16.8] years), 259 (55.9%) were female, and 334 (72.1%) were African American. Most patients (435 [94.0%]) had at least 1 comorbidity, including hypertension (295 patients [63.7%]), chronic kidney disease (182 patients [39.3%]), and diabetes (178 patients [38.4%]). Common symptoms at presentation were cough (347 patients [74.9%]), fever (315 patients [68.0%]), and dyspnea (282 patients [60.9%]). Three hundred fifty-five patients (76.7%) were hospitalized; 141 (39.7%) required intensive care unit management and 114 (80.8%) of those patients required invasive mechanical ventilation.

Material and methods: The medical data and computed tomography of the chest of 247 patients with confirmed pneumonia caused by SARS-Cov2 were used. A technique has been developed for determining MMI based on the cross-sectional area of paraspinal muscles at the level of the Th12 vertebra and the length of the thoracic spine. A correlation analysis of MMI calculated based on the length of the thoracic spine MMI(L) and height MMI(H) was performed. A statistical analysis of the differences of the MMI(L) in the groups of male and female patients with fatal outcome and recovered, as well as younger and older than 65 years were performed. Results: A strong correlation was found between the MMI calculated on the basis of the length of the thoracic spine and height (r = 0.861, p &lt;0.001). The age threshold, which was associated with an increase in the likelihood of death, in men was 60 years (Se 77.3 %, Sp 60.5 %, PPV 51.5 %, NPV 83.1 %, Youden's index 0.378, area under ROC- curve 0.728), in women 65 years old (Se 72.2 %, Sp 68.6 %, PPV 49.1 %, NPV 85.5 %, Youden's index 0.408, the area under the ROC curve 0.734). The odds ratio of death when the age thresholds are exceeded was 5.2 for men (95 % CI: 2.3 - 12.0), for women - 5.7 (95 % CI: 2.4 - 13.4). MMI(L) 3.37cm2/m2 is a threshold value, below which the probability of death in male patients under 60 years increased 26.3 times (95 % CI: 4.8 - 143.0). In female patients, there was no statistically significant threshold value of MMI(L), which would be associated with a higher risk of death. Conclusion: MMI, calculated at the level Th12 on the basis of the length of the thoracic spine, can be reliably used as a tool to estimate sarcopenia associated muscle atrophy, if there is no anthropometric data. The MMI(D) less than 3.37 cm2/m2 is a strong predictor of death in men under 60 years of age.

HV deformity is best evaluated by weight-bearing computed tomography (WBCT). The objective was (1) to assess the reliability of WBCT computer-assisted semi-automatic imaging measurements in HV, (2) to compare semi-automatic with manual measurements in the setting of an HV, and (3) to compare semi-automatic measurements between HV and control group. METHODS: In this retrospective IRB (ID# 201904825) approved study, we assessed patients with hallux valgus deformity. The sample size calculation was based on the hallux valgus angle (HVA). Thus to obtain the 0.8 power, including 26 feet with HV in this study, was necessary. Our control group consisted of 19 feet from 19 patients without HV. Raw multiplanar data was evaluated using software CubeVue?. In the axial plane, hallux valgus angle (HVA), intermetatarsal angle (IMA), and interphalangeal angle (IPA) were measured. The semiautomatic 3D measurements were performed using the Bonelogic?Software. Inter-rater reliabilities were performed using ICC. Agreement between methods was tested using the Bland-Altman plots. The difference between Patologic and Control cases using semi-automatic measurements was assessed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Alpha risk was set to 5% ( = 0.05). P  0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: Reliabilities utilizing ICC were over 0.80 for WBCT manual measurements and WBCT semi-automatic readings. Inter and intraobserver agreement for Manual and Semi-automatic WBCT measurements demonstrated excellent reliability. CONCLUSIONS: Semi-automatic measurements are reproducible and comparable to measurements performed manually. The software differentiated pathological from non-pathological conditions when subjected to semi-automatic measurements. The development of advanced semi-automatic segmentation software with minimal user intervention is essential for the establishment of big data and can be integrated into clinical practice, facilitating decision-making.","output":"Comparison between Weightbearing-CT semiautomatic and manual measurements in Hallux Valgus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>This paper presents my experience of breast cancer care in which I describe my care as positive and integrated.Design/methodology/approach>I have applied an autoethnographical approach to my patient story to analyse my care in order to reflect and share insights.

Blockade of IL-6, by Tocilizumab, is used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and those diagnosed with cytokine storm. However, brain-produced IL-6 has recently emerged as a critical mediator of gut/adipose communication with the brain. Central nervous system (CNS) IL-6 is engaged by peripheral and central signals regulating energy homeostasis. IL-6 is critical for mediating hypophagia and weight loss effects of a GLP-1 analog, exendin-4, a clinically utilized drug. However, neuroanatomical substrates and behavioral mechanisms of brain IL-6 energy balance control remain poorly understood. We propose that the lateral hypothalamus (LH) is an IL-6-harboring brain region, key to food intake and food reward control. Microinjections of IL-6 into the LH reduced chow and palatable food intake in male rats. In contrast, female rats responded with reduced motivated behavior for sucrose, measured by the progressive ratio operant conditioning test, a behavioral mechanism previously not linked to IL-6. To test whether IL-6, produced in the LH, is necessary for ingestive and motivated behaviors, and body weight homeostasis, virogenetic knockdown by infusion of AAV-siRNA-IL6 into the LH was utilized. Attenuation of LH IL-6 resulted in a potent increase in sucrose-motivated behavior, without any effect on ingestive behavior or body weight in female rats. In contrast, the treatment did not affect any parameters measured (chow intake, sucrose-motivated behavior, locomotion, and body weight) in chow-fed males. However, when challenged with a high-fat/high-sugar diet, the male LH IL-6 knockdown rats displayed rapid weight gain and hyperphagia. Together, our data suggest that LH-produced IL-6 is necessary and sufficient for ingestive behavior and weight homeostasis in male rats. In females, IL-6 in the LH plays a critical role in food-motivated, but not ingestive behavior control or weight regulation. Thus, collectively these data support the idea that brain-produced IL-6 engages the hypothalamus to control feeding behavior.","output":"Key role for hypothalamic interleukin-6 in food-motivated behavior and body weight regulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early detection of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is needed to reduce cardiovascular sequelae and mortality.

Arachidonic acid derivatives 5-HETE and 5-oxoETE were detected in urine samples. The levels (mean  SD, ng per mg creatinine) of 5-HETE and 5-oxoETE were 56.4  26.2 and 46.9  18.4 in OSA patients, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in controls (22.5  4.6 and 18.7  3.6).

After the treatment with the continuous positive airway pressure, the metabolite levels were significantly reduced compared with those before the treatment. In human mononuclear cells subjected to intermittent hypoxia, 5-HETE and 5-oxoETE productions were induced by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and glutathione peroxidase. When mice were exposed to intermittent hypoxia, 5-HETE and 5-oxoETE were excreted more in urine. They were identified and verified as new OSA markers reflecting hypoxic stress.

The optimal policy allocation is the one corresponding to the smallest loss.

Persistently high levels of inequality despite a booming labour market and drastically falling unemployment rates constituted a puzzle, suggesting either that the German job miracle mainly benefitted individuals in the mid- or high-income range or that other developments offset the effects of the drastically improved labour market conditions. The present paper solves this puzzle by breaking down the observed changes in the distribution of disposable incomes between 2005C06 and 2015C16 into the contributions of eight different factors, one of them being the employment boom. Our results suggest that, while the latter did have an equalising impact, it was partially offset by the disequalising impact of other factors, and substantially dampened by the transfer system. Our results point to a strong role of the German transfer system as a distributional stabiliser implying that, if the COVID-19 shock were to persistently reverse all the employment gains that occurred during the boom, this would only have a moderately disequalising effect on the distribution of net incomes. ? 2022 The Authors.

Orthoses are the most commonly used treatment material in AIS. However, the physiological and psychological problems that arise due to these orthoses' rigid structures prevent their use by patients. Due to these problems, the authors have developed a posture supporting garment (soft exosuit) design for individuals aged 10C18, with Cobb angles of 25C40, which is the most rapidly progressing stage of the disease. Design/methodology/approach: Soft exosuit prepared with experimental research method and user-centered design approach. The posture supporting effect is achieved by pattern engineering using fabric, belts, baleens and a gradual zipper system for to increase functionality, ease of use and fit. Findings: The first six-month clinical trial in prototype use was carried out with a female patient with a 29 scoliosis Cobb angle and suitable wearing a rigid corset due to AIS. The patient was satisfied with the prototype and its functionality, ease of use, fit and comfort. Cosmetic body deformity due to scoliosis was not observed, and the Cobb angle was decreased by 10.7% at the end of the sixth month. Soft exosuit has been found effective in supporting the posture of individuals who had ongoing spinal growth. Research limitations/implications: The most important limitation of this study is that, despite a large number of prototype and prototype studies, trials could not be conducted on a large number of patients with different characteristics due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More experimental studies are needed to generalize the product to large audiences. The first goal is to investigate more patients with different spinal deformities in the future. The second goal is to measure the materials used and the quantitative measurement of body responses with the biomechanics field. It is planned to increase the soft exosuit functionality with smart textiles by adding wearable devices with future research. Practical implications: This study is important because it constitutes the basis for future studies on pattern cutting soft materials' positioning. Social implications: It is thought that the study will contribute to functional solutions for different spinal deformities. Originality/value: It is an entire functional soft garment without an actuator. It is customizable and modular for patients with spinal deformities. It is thought that the study will contribute to functional solutions for spinal deformities. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"The development of posture supporting soft exosuit design for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVIDSurg Collaborative Mortality and pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection: an international cohort study Lancet 2020;published online May 29 https://doi org/10 1016/S0140-6736(20)31182-XIn this Article, in the Summary, the proportion of all deaths that were in patients with pulmonary complications has been corrected, as well as the total number of deaths denominator, to 817% (219 of 268) Also, the appendix has been corrected These corrections have been made to the online version as of June 9, 2020, and the printed version will be correct","output":"Department of Error"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveTo describe the incidence and nature of co-infection in critically ill adults with COVID-19 infection in England.

The proportion and type of organisms were determined at <48 and >48 hours following hospital admission, corresponding to community and hospital-acquired co-infections. ResultsOf 254 patients studied (median age 59 years (IQR 49-69); 64.6% male), 139 clinically significant organisms were identified from 83(32.7%) patients. Bacterial co-infections were identified within 48 hours of admission in 14(5.5%) patients; the commonest pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (four patients) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (two patients). The proportion of pathogens detected increased with duration of ICU stay, consisting largely of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.

However, continuously emerging variants, such as Omicron, have significantly reduced the potency of most known NAbs. The selection of NAbs with broad neutralizing activities and the identification of conserved critical epitopes are still urgently needed. Here, we identified an extremely potent antibody (55A8) by single B-cell sorting from convalescent SARS-CoV-2-infected patients that recognized the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. 55A8 could bind to wild-type SARS-CoV-2, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2 simultaneously with 58G6, a NAb previously identified by our group. Importantly, an antibody cocktail containing 55A8 and 58G6 (2-cocktail) showed synergetic neutralizing activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the picomolar range in vitro and prophylactic efficacy in hamsters challenged with Omicron (BA.1) through intranasal delivery at an extraordinarily low dosage (25 g of each antibody daily) at 3 days post-infection. Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that 55A8 is a Class III NAb that recognizes a highly conserved epitope. It could block angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding to the RBD in the S protein trimer via steric hindrance. The epitopes in the RBD recognized by 55A8 and 58G6 were found to be different and complementary, which could explain the synergetic mechanism of these two NAbs. Our findings not only provide a potential antibody cocktail for clinical use against infection with current SARS-CoV-2 strains and future variants but also identify critical epitope information for the development of better antiviral agents.","output":"A cocktail containing two synergetic antibodies broadly neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and its variants including Omicron BA.1 and BA.2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 quickly spread all over the world and dramatically affected the financial markets in almost everycountry.

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey (ECLB-COVID19) was launched on April 6, 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing. METHODS: The ECLB-COVID19 electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists, following a structured review of the literature. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online-survey-platform and was promoted by thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western-Asia and the Americas. All participants were asked for their mental wellbeing (SWEMWS) and depressive symptoms (SMFQ) with regard to \\"during\\" and \\"before\\" home confinement. RESULTS: Analysis was conducted on the first 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%). The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on both mental-wellbeing and on mood and feelings. Specifically, a significant decrease (p < .001 and &#916;% = 9.4%) in total score of the SWEMWS questionnaire was noted. More individuals (+12.89%) reported a low mental wellbeing \\"during\\" compared to \\"before\\" home confinement. Furthermore, results from the mood and feelings questionnaire showed a significant increase by 44.9% (p < .001) in SMFQ total score with more people (+10%) showing depressive symptoms \\"during\\" compared to \\"before\\" home confinement.

Several types of pulmonary diseases are emphysema, fibrosis, pneumothorax, asthma, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and so on. Pulmonary diseases are otherwise known as lung disorders and respiratory diseases. Pulmonary diseases are predicted by several methods using x-ray images and CT scan images. Some of the recent works predict only a specific disease, and optimal prediction is not yet achieved. Hence, we proposed a novel method known as African vulture optimization (AVO) algorithm-based weighted support vector machine approach (w-SVM). The proposed method in this article predicts emphysema, fibrosis, pneumothorax, and normal kinds from the NIH chest x-ray dataset. The X-images are preprocessed after data acquisition to obtain the desired size and to remove undesirable noise. The preprocessed images are then sent into the SVM for feature extraction, and the AVO is used to improve the SVM so that a kernel function may be obtained. The proposed w-SVM effectively predicts the emphysema, fibrosis, pneumothorax, and normal classes from the dataset.

We analysed the prevalence and prognostic utility of myocardial injury, characterized by elevated cardiac troponin, in a large population of COVID-19 patients, and further evaluated separately the role of troponin T and I. METHODS: This is a multicentre, retrospective observational study enrolling patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized in 32 Spanish hospitals. Elevated troponin levels were defined as values above the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit, as recommended by international guidelines. Thirty-day mortality was defined as endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 1280 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, of whom 187 (14.6%) died during the hospitalization. Using a nonspecific sex cut-off, elevated troponin levels were found in 344 patients (26.9%), increasing to 384 (30.0%) when a sex-specific cut-off was used. This prevalence was significantly higher (42.9% vs 21.9%; P < .001) in patients in whom troponin T was measured in comparison with troponin I. Sex-specific elevated troponin levels were significantly associated with 30-day mortality, with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 3.00 for total population, 3.20 for cardiac troponin T and 3.69 for cardiac troponin I. CONCLUSION: In this multicentre study, myocardial injury was a common finding in COVID-19 patients. Its prevalence increased when a sex-specific cut-off and cardiac troponin T were used. Elevated troponin was an independent predictor of 30-day mortality, irrespective of cardiac troponin assay and cut-offs to detect myocardial injury.

Data representing population demographics, SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, and social interventions guides the model's behavior, which is calibrated and validated using data reported by the government. The model indicates a modest but significant increase (8.15%) in the total number of reported cases in the region for a complete (100%) reopening compared to keeping schools and colleges fully virtual. For partial returns of 75% and 50%, the percent increases in the number of reported cases are shown to be small (2.87% and 1.26%, respectively) and statistically insignificant. The AB model also predicts that relaxing the stringency of the school safety protocol for sanitizing, use of mask, social distancing, testing, and quarantining and thus allowing the school transmission coefficient to double may result in a small increase in the number of reported infected cases (2.14%). Hence for pandemic outbreaks from viruses with similar characteristics as for SARS-CoV-2, keeping the schools and colleges open with a modest campus safety protocol and in-person attendance below a certain threshold may be advisable.","output":"Impact of school reopening on pandemic spread: A case study using an agent-based model for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Providing effective ventilation of the unconscious patient is an essential skill in every specialty dealing with airway management. In this randomized cross-over study aimed to compare intra-oral and classic face mask in terms of ventilation success of patients, practitioners' workload and anxiety assessments. Also we analyzed potential risk factors of difficult mask ventilation for both masks. METHODS Twenty four anesthesiology residents and 12 anesthesiologists participated in the study. Each of the practitioners ventilated 4 patients with both masks at settled pressure and frequency. Practitioners rated their workload and anxiety related to masks with National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index score and State Trait Anxiety Inventory scale. Ventilation success was evaluated with Han scale, expiratory tidal volume and leak volume. We analyzed potential risk factors of difficult mask ventilation with anthropometric characteristics and STOP-Bang score. RESULTS Ventilation success rate was superior with intraoral mask comparing to classic face mask in terms of succesful ventilation (p=0.000 ) and tidal volume (p=0.000). Leak volume in in intraoral mask ventilation was significantly lower than classic face mask (p=0000). Difficult mask ventilation risk factors for classic face mask were high weight (p=0.011), neck circumference (95% CI OR=1.180,p=0.002), Mallampati score (p=0.029) and high risk of OSAS (p=0.001) . Difficult mask ventilation risk factors for intraoral mask were high body mass index (95 % CI, OR 1.162 p=0.006) and Mallampati score (p=0.043). The anxiety ratings of practitioners were similar between two masks. The work-load rating is higher with intraoral mask comparing to classic face mask.

Surgical treatment of non-COVID-19 related disease during this period, however, still remains necessary. The decision to proceed with medically necessary, time-sensitive (MeNTS) procedures in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic requires incorporation of factors (resource limitations, COVID-19 transmission risk to providers and patients) heretofore not overtly considered by surgeons in the already complicated processes of clinical judgment and shared decision-making. We describe a scoring system that systematically integrates these factors to facilitate decision-making and triage for MeNTS procedures, and appropriately weighs individual patient risks with the ethical necessity of optimizing public health concerns. This approach is applicable across a broad range of hospital settings (academic and community, urban and rural) in the midst of the pandemic and may be able to inform case triage as operating room capacity resumes once the acute phase of the pandemic subsides.","output":"Medically Necessary, Time-Sensitive Procedures: Scoring System to Ethically and Efficiently Manage Resource Scarcity and Provider Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bayesian adaptive designs have gained popularity in all phases of clinical trials with numerous new developments in the past few decades.

We found that antibodies elicited by the 2021-2022 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine poorly neutralize the new H3N2 strain.

Controversial cases of security related political communication, salient media enunciations, and social media reframing are explored through the theoretical lenses of securitization and cascading activation of framing in the contexts of Slovakia, Russia, and the United States. The first research question explores whether and how the frame element of moral evaluation factors into the conversations on the securitization of the pandemic. The analysis tracks the framing process through elite, media, and public levels of communication. The second research question focused on fairly controversial actors- \\"rogue actors\\" -such as individuals linked to far-leaning political factions or militias. The proliferation of digital media provides various actors with opportunities to join publicly visible conversations. The analysis demonstrates that the widely differing national contexts offer different trends and degrees in securitization of the pandemic during spring and summer of 2020. The studied rogue actors usually have something to say about the pandemic, and frequently make some reframing attempts based on idiosyncratic evaluations of how normatively appropriate is their government's \\"war\\" on COVID-19. In Slovakia, the rogue elite actors at first failed to have an impact but eventually managed to partially contest the dominant frame. Powerful Russian media influencers enjoy some conspiracy theories but prudently avoid direct challenges to the government's frame, and so far only marginal rogue actors openly advance dissenting frames. The polarized political and media environment in the US has shown to create a particularly fertile ground for rogue grassroots movements that utilize online platforms and social media, at times going as far as encouragement of violent acts to oppose the government and its pandemic response policy.","output":"\\"Wars\\" on COVID-19 in Slovakia, Russia, and the United States: Securitized Framing and Reframing of Political and Media Communication Around the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most countries did not have a consolidated digital health structure before the pandemic.

However, in contrast to smokers' cells, exposure of nonsmokers' macrophages to these antiviral lymphokines totally prevented viral replication. This difference could not be attributed to diminished adsorption of virus to smokers' macrophages or to an increased proportion of extracellular to intracellular virus in smokers' cell cultures.

However, worries about adverse effects have led to vaccine hesitancy in some people. On the other hand, as COVID-19 may be associated with a range of sequelae, it is possible that vaccines may protect against hospitalization and mortality of various diseases. Methods We leveraged a large prospective cohort, the UK-Biobank (UKBB), and studied associations of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination (BioNTech BNT162b2 or Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) with hospitalization and mortalities from cardiovascular and other diseases (N=180,727). Multivariable Cox and Poisson regression was conducted controlling for main confounders. For hospitalizations, we also conducted separate analysis for new-onset and recurrent cases. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were also included as outcome. Results We observed that COVID-19 vaccination (at least one dose) was associated with lower risks of hospitalizations from stroke (hazard ratio [HR]=0.371, 95% CI: 0.254-0.543, p=3.36e-7), venous thromboembolism (VTE) (HR=0.485, 95% CI: 0.292-0.804, p=4.99e-3), dementia (HR=0.207, 95% CI 0.091-0.470; p=1.66e-4) and non-COVID-19 pneumonia (HR=0.482, 95% CI 0.313-0.742; p=9.18e-4). Regarding mortality, an association with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was observed, as well as lower mortality from several diseases including stroke, coronary artery disease(CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and dementia. There is no evidence that vaccination was associated with increased hospitalization/fatality from any specific disorders. Conclusions Taken together, this study provides further support to the safety and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, and such benefits may extend beyond reduction of infection risk or severity per se. As an observational study, causal relationship cannot be concluded and further studies are required to verify the findings.","output":"Association of COVID-19 vaccination with risks of hospitalization and mortality due to cardiovascular and other diseases: A study of the UK Biobank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Engineered heterostructures formed by complex oxide materials are a rich source of emergent phenomena and technological applications.

Using atomic-resolution imaging/spectroscopic techniques and first-principles calculations, we determine the atomic-scale structure, composition, and bonding at the interface. The epitaxial antiperovskite/perovskite heterointerface is mediated by a coherent interfacial monolayer that interpolates between the two antistructures.

Canadians have been instructed to stay at home, which has likely resulted in significant changes in their physical activity. Using data from a national physical activity tracking app (PAC app), we aimed to determine device-measured physical activity levels immediately prior to and following the implementation of physical distancing measures in Canada to provide evidence for the development of physical activity recommendations for future pandemics or second wave infections. Methods: Demographic and physical activity data were extracted from the ParticipACTION app (PAC app), using a 10-week (10 February to 19 April 2020) quasi-experimental design to determine changes in physical activity 4 weeks pre-pandemic and 6 weeks post-pandemic declaration. Weekly physical activity levels were monitored through wearable fitness trackers and health apps linked to the PAC app, to record moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), light physical activity (LPA), and steps. Repeated measure ANOVA was used to determine changes over time (mean  SE). Findings: A total of 2,338 Canadians who were mostly 35C44 years old (26.6%) and female (90.2%) were included in the analysis. MVPA, LPA, and steps significantly declined immediately following the declaration of the pandemic (MVPA: pre-pandemic: 194.2  5.2 min, post-pandemic: 176.7  5.0 min, p < 0.001; LPA: pre-pandemic: 1,000.5  17.0 min, post-pandemic: 874.1  15.6 min, p < 0.001; steps: pre-pandemic: 48,625  745 steps, post-pandemic: 43,395  705 steps, p < 0.001). However, 6 weeks following pandemic declaration, MVPA (week 6: 204.4  5.4 min, p = 0.498) had returned to pre-pandemic levels.

Due to the lack of consistency in data reporting during the initial spread of COVID-19, the Equitable Data Collection and Disclosure on COVID-19 Act was introduced into the Congress that mandates collection and reporting of demographic COVID-19 data on testing, treatments, and deaths by age, sex, race and ethnicity, primary language, socioeconomic status, disability, and county. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated how COVID-19 demographic data have been collected before and after the introduction of this legislation. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate differences in reporting and public availability of COVID-19 demographic data by US state health departments and Washington, District of Columbia (DC) before (pre-Act), immediately after (post-Act), and 6 months after (6-month follow-up) the introduction of the Equitable Data Collection and Disclosure on COVID-19 Act in the Congress on April 21, 2020. METHODS: We reviewed health department websites of all 50 US states and Washington, DC (N=51). We evaluated how each state reported age, sex, and race and ethnicity data for all confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths and how they made this data available (ie, charts and tables only or combined with dashboards and machine-actionable downloadable formats) at the three timepoints. RESULTS: We found statistically significant increases in the number of health departments reporting age-specific data for COVID-19 cases (P=.045) and resulting deaths (P=.002), sex-specific data for COVID-19 deaths (P=.003), and race- and ethnicity-specific data for confirmed cases (P=.003) and deaths (P=.005) post-Act and at the 6-month follow-up (P<.05 for all). The largest increases were race and ethnicity state data for confirmed cases (pre-Act: 18/51, 35%; post-Act: 31/51, 61%; 6-month follow-up: 46/51, 90%) and deaths due to COVID-19 (pre-Act: 13/51, 25%; post-Act: 25/51, 49%; and 6-month follow-up: 39/51, 76%). Although more health departments reported race and ethnicity data based on federal requirements (P<.001), over half (29/51, 56.9%) still did not report all racial and ethnic groups as per the Office of Management and Budget guidelines (pre-Act: 5/51, 10%; post-Act: 21/51, 41%; and 6-month follow-up: 27/51, 53%). The number of health departments that made COVID-19 data available for download significantly increased from 7 to 23 (P<.001) from our initial data collection (April 2020) to the 6-month follow-up, (October 2020). CONCLUSIONS: Although the increased demand for disaggregation has improved public reporting of demographics across health departments, an urgent need persists for the introduced legislation to be passed by the Congress for the US states to consistently collect and make characteristics of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations available in order to allocate resources to mitigate disease spread.","output":"Reporting and Availability of COVID-19 Demographic Data by US Health Departments (April to October 2020): Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Burnout is a global work-related phenomenon. Intensive care unit (ICU) nurses are at risk of burnout and the COVID-19 pandemic may increase this risk. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of burnout risk and identify risk factors among ICU nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: Web-based survey performed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in French speaking Belgium. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of burnout was assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory scale. RESULTS: A total of 1135 ICU nurses responded to the questionnaire. The overall prevalence of burnout risk was 68%. A total of 29% of ICU nurses were at risk of depersonalisation (DP), 31% of reduced personal accomplishment (PA), and 38% of emotional exhaustion (EE). A 1:3 nurse-to-patient ratio increased the risk of EE (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.07-2.95) and DP (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.09-2.40). Those who reported having a higher perceived workload during the COVID-19 pandemic were at higher risk for all dimensions of burnout. Shortage of personal protective equipment increased the risk of EE (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.35-3.34) and nurses who reported having symptoms of COVID-19 without being tested were at higher risk of EE (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.68-1.87).

The etiology of KD has been studied comprehensively but remains largely unknown. The disease seems to result from the interplay of genetic and environmental susceptibility factors with infectious triggers, followed by a subsequent abnormal immune response characterized by increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during the acute phase. Evidence has mounted to suggest that an imbalance between T helper 17 cells (Th17s) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) is associated with aberrant immune responses in KD. Recent advances in culture-independent techniques for detection and identification of intestinal commensal bacteria enabled the discovery that Th17 and Treg differentiation are regulated by short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in particular butyrate, produced by the gut microbiota. This finding provided a mechanistic link between dysbiosis, defined as changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, and various inflammatory diseases. On this basis, we propose that dysbiosis, with reduced production of SCFAs leading to imbalances of Th17s/Tregs, could be involved in the etiology of KD. A pilot study supported this hypothesis, as only fecal concentrations of butyrate were significantly reduced in KD patients among SCFAs. This evolving perspective prompted us to undertake metagenomic analyses of bacterial DNA from the feces of KD patients who were antibiotic-na?ve at diagnosis. Simultaneous measurements of Th17s/Tregs in peripheral blood and SCFA concentrations in feces would provide valuable information regarding the association between dysbiosis and dysregulated immune responses in KD.","output":"Our Evolving Understanding of Kawasaki Disease Pathogenesis: Role of the Gut Microbiota"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meskipun studi tentang analisis wacana semakin lazim dalam beberapa tahun terakhir, studi tentang tindak tutur ilokusi yang lebih spesifik, khususnya tentang penyelidikan tindak tutur ilokusi holistik relatif jarang.

Previous studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected for many weeks after symptom onset. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear and, in most patients, likely does not represent active infection. There are, however, patients who shed infectious virus for weeks. Detection of subgenomic RNA transcripts expressed by SARS-CoV-2 has been proposed to represent productive infection and may be a tractable marker for monitoring infectivity. Here, we use RT-PCR to quantify total and subgenomic nucleocapsid (N) and envelope (E) transcripts in 190 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected on hospital admission. We relate these findings to duration of symptoms. We find that all transcripts decline at the same rate; however, subgenomic E becomes undetectable before other transcripts. In Kaplan-Meier analysis the median duration of symptoms to a negative test is 14 days for sgE and 25 days for sgN. There is a linear decline in subgenomic RNA compared to total RNA suggesting subgenomic transcript copy number is highly dependent on copy number of total transcripts. The mean difference between total N and subgenomic N is 16-fold (4.0 cycles) and the mean difference between total E and sub-genomic E is 137-fold (7.1 cycles). This relationship is constant over duration of symptoms allowing prediction of subgenomic copy number from total copy number. Although Subgenomic E is undetectable at a time that may more closely reflect the duration of infectivity, its utility in determining active infection may be no more useful than a copy number threshold determined for total transcripts.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Total and Subgenomic RNA Viral Load in Hospitalized Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) has become a global pandemic and affected almost all aspects of our daily life. The total number of positive COVID-2019 cases has exponentially increased in the last few months due to the easy transmissibility of the virus. It can be detected using the nucleic acid test or the antibodies blood test which are not always available and take several hours to get the results. Therefore, researchers proposed computer-aided diagnosis systems using the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques to learn imaging biomarkers from chest computed tomography and X-ray radiographs to effectively diagnose COVID-19. However, previous methods either adopted transfer learning from a pre-trained model on natural images or trained on limited datasets. Either cases may lead to accuracy deficiency or overfitting. In addition, feature space suffers from noise and outliers when collecting X-ray images from multiple datasets. In this paper, we overcome the previous limitation by firstly collecting a large-scale X-ray dataset from multiple resources. Our dataset includes 11,312 images collected from 10 different data repositories. To alleviate the effect of the noise, we suppress it in the feature space of our new dataset. Secondly, we introduce a supervision mechanism and combine it with the VGG-16 network to consider the differences between the COVID-19 and healthy cases in the feature space. Thirdly, we propose a multi-site (center) COVID-19 graph convolutional network (GCN) that exploits dataset information, the status of training samples, and initial scores to effectively classify the disease status. Extensive experiments using different convolutional neural network-based methods with and without the supervision mechanism and different classifiers are performed.

We aimed to investigate for which pathogens this association is particularly strong. DESIGN A retrospective observational study was conducted. METHODS Data from the SSI-module of the German nosocomial infection surveillance system between 2000 and 2016 were linked with data from the German Meteorological Service. Patient- and procedure-related data were associated with monthly aggregated meteorological data. Due to high correlation with other meteorological parameters, we focused on the outside temperature. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated for SSI rates relating to temperature. SSIs were stratified by pathogen. A P value of <.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Altogether, 2,004,793 procedures resulting in 32,118 SSIs were included. Generally, warmer temperatures were associated with a higher SSI risk, especially for SSIs with gram-negative pathogens. This association was particularly prominent for Acinetobacter spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and certain Enterobacteriaceae. Per additional 1C, we observed a 6% increase in the SSI risk for Acinetobacter spp and a 4% increase for Enterobacter spp. Superficial SSIs with Acinetobacter spp were 10 times more likely to occur when comparing surgeries in months with mean temperatures of 20C to mean temperatures of <5C. CONCLUSIONS Higher temperatures were associated with increased SSI rates caused by gram-negative bacteria. Future SSI prevention measures should consider this aspect.

Initially, the evaluation criteria based on functionality, security, usability, technical performance, and pricing have been determined using a literature review and expert's opinions to employ the MCDM approach. G-AHP was utilized to identify the criteria weights, and G-EDAS was then used to select the best VCS among the alternatives. A case illustration in Vietnam is presented to exhibit the proposed approach's applicability. From the G-AHP findings, quality of video/audio, ease of use, mobile experience, number of participants allowed, and video recording capability have been ranked as the five most important criteria. From G-EDAS analysis, Microsoft Teams (VCS-03) was found to be the best.

Thus present study aims to estimate the lipid parameters and correlate the serum lipid parameters with clinical profile, stage of the disease and duration of onset of mucormycosis in patients with COVID associated Mucormycosis. MATERIAL This is a cross sectional study conducted on 103 patients diagnosed with COVID 19 associated mucormycosis admitted to the hospitals attached to BMCRI from July 2021 to September 2021. Serum fasting lipid profile and other biochemical parameters were determined. The correlation of lipid levels with clinical profile, onset and staging of mucormycosis patients were obtained. OBSERVATION The age distribution varied from 22yrs to 75yrs of whom majority were males (83.4%). Among patients with mucormycosis of all severity stages, nasal block (79.6%) was found to be most common symptom followed by headache(75.7%). Among patients with mucormycosis most frequent associated comorbidity was Diabetes mellitus (DM) followed by hypertension (HTN) followed by DM and HTN followed by Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) followed by DM,HTN and IHD. The study showed statistically significant correlation such that severity of mucormycosis increased with progressive worsening lipid parameters. It also showed statistically significant correlation such that patients with increasing TC,LDL,VLDL,TG levels had shorter COVID 19 onset to mucormycosis onset duration. CONCLUSION The study showed a positive correlation between serum lipid profile and staging of mucormycosis and negative correlation between lipid levels with duration between onset of COVID 19 to onset of mucormycosis. Hence serum lipid profile can be used as an excellent marker to predict the severity and prognosis of COVID 19 associated mucormycosis.","output":"A Novel Study of Correlation of Lipid Parameters with Clinical Profile, Staging and Onset of Rhino Orbito Cerebral Mucormycosis Covid 19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The economic and financial crisis generated by COVID-19 has determined a huge pressure on the state, to which is automatically assigned a dual role, with a major importance in relaunching the Romanian economy.

The intervention on the existing fiscal pressure requires rapid action, applicable as soon as possible, without exceptions and without excessive bureaucracy, with an involvement and collaboration between the state authorities and the business environment, respectively taxpayers, based on honesty, fairness and total transparency. The reduction of fiscal budget revenues (felt today) is indisputable. However, taking into consideration this context, measures as increasing taxation, maintaining the fiscal burden in order to obtain budgetary revenues to cover the existent budgetary expenditures represents only a clear path to the disaster of Romanias economy.

Methods: Beginning in September 2019, CSHSCD (R01HL149121), a 5-year NIH-sponsored observational comparative study of children with SCD from Haitian ethnicity in Miami and in Haiti compared to children of African American ethnicity with SCD, was designed to increase access to care in Haiti. The study aims are 1) to compare the incidence of SCD among newborns from Haitian and African American ethnicity in Miami, 2) to establish NBS programs for hemoglobinopathies in Haiti, and 3) to compare cohorts of children in SCD at the study sites. The participating sites are the University of Miami (UM, Miami, Florida), H?pital Saint Damien (HSD, Tabarre, Haiti), H?pital de l'Universit d'Etat d'Ha?ti (HUEH, Port-au-Prince, Haiti), H?pital Universitaire Justinien (HUJ, Cap Haitien, Haiti), and H?pital Sacr Coeur (HSC, Milot, Haiti). HUJ and HSC use two NBS screening methods (isoelectric focusing and Sickle SCAN rapid test) and HSD and HUEH use isoelectric focusing only. CSHSCD supplies penicillin and HU and trains TCD examiners to implement stroke risk screening. Data are collected in REDCap. Results: During the first 2 years and despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we established NBS sites with a cohesive network of physicians and nurses trained in the care of children with SCD in Haiti. This capacity building will support sustainability of the program. We successfully identified at least 15 new cases of SCD via newborn screening, trained six TCD examiners, and enrolled 130 children with SCD in follow up, providing them with penicillin prophylaxis and hydroxyurea for severe cases according to local protocols. Implementation activities which have helped are close communications between the investigators, monthly Zoom meetings to coordinate efforts with enrollment updates every month, the availability of rapid tests (Sickle SCAN and Gazelle miniature cellulose acetate electrophoresis) for the diagnosis of SCD, especially when there is no laboratory equipment on site. Implementation challenges we have faced are mostly two. The first is the timely completion of DUNS and SAM registration for the two public hospitals, with one site achieving this after 9 months and the other site taking 18 months to complete. The reasons for the delay are the inability for the UM site to direct these efforts, following strict rules, and the Haitian hospital officers' lack of familiarity with website requirements. We were able to achieve these registrations with the assistance of one Haitian study staff who is very acquainted with internet navigation and became familiarized with requirements. Outsourcing materials to Haiti is another major challenge, with either gaps in the delivery of supplies because of multiple steps involved in ordering and shipping or with delays in releasing equipment once it is at the Port-au-Prince customs, resulting in gaps in NBS in one of the sites for 8 weeks. We have minimized these issues by opening a one-year ticket to order materials from the different companies involved. Also, Haiti's lack of infrastructure, available materials and medications, and political instability limit health care delivery. Conclusion: Since its inception, we have achieved major milestones, including capacity building and implementation of NBS, TCD training, and enrollment of children with SCD into the prospective cohorts despite the current COVID-19 pandemic. Material outsourcing challenges have been the major implementation problem we have faced due to systemic factors. We anticipate that these factors will be corrected or minimized as we have learned how to handle them. These problems were expected as part of conducting an international study in a low-resource setting. Acknowledgment: We acknowledg NHLBI for supporting this work.

Use of the Shannon information entropy, constructed from an intermolecular orientational spatial distribution function, to drive a search for crystal structures via enhanced molecular dynamics can be an efficient way to map out a landscape of putative polymorphs. Here, the Shannon entropy is used to generate a set of collective variables for differentiating polymorphs of a 1:1 cocrystal of resorcinol and urea. We show that driven adiabatic free energy dynamics, a particular enhanced-sampling approach, combined with these entropy variables, can transform the stable phase into alternate polymorphs. Density functional theory calculations confirm that a structure obtained from the enhanced molecular dynamics is stable at pressures above 1 GPa. We thus show that enhanced sampling should be considered an integral component of crystal structure searching protocols for systems with multiple independent molecules.","output":"Generating Cocrystal Polymorphs with Information Entropy Driven by Molecular Dynamics-Based Enhanced Sampling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Social media use has exploded, attaining a significant influence within medicine. Previous studies have denoted the use of social media in various surgical specialties as a means to exchange professional ideas and improve the conference experience and at the same time, some have assessed its feasibility as a method of education. This systematic review aims to characterize the use of social media as a tool for general surgery education. METHODS: A systematic review of several databases from each database inception was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. The JBIs critical appraisal tools were used to assess quality of the studies. RESULTS: A total of 861 articles were identified of which 222 were duplicates removed. The titles and abstracts from the remaining 639 abstracts were screened and 589 were excluded. The remaining 51 full articles were analyzed for eligibility, of which 24 met inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. These studies covered the general surgery specialty, of which 11 (n = 46%) focused on the laparoscopic surgical approach, 1 (n = 4%) on robotic-assisted surgical procedures, 1 (n = 4%) on both surgical approaches previously mentioned and 11 (n = 46%) on the general surgery specialty regardless of the surgical approach or technique.

Before the pandemic, over 50% of children were not achieving physical activity guidelines.7 Despite restrictions allowing 60 minutes of exercise in a local area, nearly 30% of children report not leaving the house on a typical lockdown day.8 With parks, recreational areas, and sports clubs closed and screen time increased, there has been further reduction in physical activity in young people;this is more pronounced among ethnic minority communities.89 Like previous policy documents, the July 2020 UK Obesity Strategy does not go far enough to tackle underlying health inequalities linked with childhood obesity.10 It contains many previously proposed (but never implemented) strategies, and these measures are weak in comparison with other countries.101112 Convergence of the childhood obesity epidemic and the covid-19 pandemic means that now is the time for urgent and decisive action by government to protect the wellbeing of children and future health of the UK population.

Serodiagnostic methods, typically ELISA (with either native or recombinant antigens), are often used for early diagnosis. The use of native antigens, as in the MM3-SERO ELISA (commercialized as BIO K 211, BIO-X Diagnostics), continues to be beneficial in terms of sensitivity and specificity; however, there is interest in developing ELISA tests based on recombinant antigens to avoid the need to culture parasites. Of the antigens secreted by adult flukes, recombinant procathepsin L1 (rFhpCL1) is the most commonly tested in ELISA to date. However, although adult flukes produce three different clades of CLs (FhCL1, FhCL2, and FhCL5), to our knowledge, the diagnostic value of recombinant FhCL2 and FhCL5 has not yet been investigated. In the present study, we developed and tested three indirect ELISAs using rFhpCL1, rFhpCL2, and rFhpCL5 and evaluated their recognition by sera from sheep and cattle naturally infected with F. hepatica. Although the overall antibody response to these three rFhpCLs was similar, some animals displayed preferential recognition for particular rFhpCLs. Moreover, for cattle sera, the highest sensitivity was obtained using rFhpCL2 (97%), being equal for both rFhpCL1 and rFhpCL5 (87.9%), after adjusting cut-offs for maximum specificity. By contrast, for sheep sera, the sensitivity was 100% for the three rFhpCLs.

These measures comprised, among others, social distancing, the temporary closure of shops and schools, and a ban of large public gatherings and meetings with people not living in the same household. OBJECTIVE: It is fair to assume that the issued NPIs have heavily affected social life and psychological functioning. We therefore aimed to examine possible effects of this lockdown in conjunction with daily new infections and the state of the national economy on people's interests, motives, and other psychological states. METHODS: We derived 249 keywords from the Google Trends database, tapping into 27 empirically and rationally selected psychological domains. To overcome issues with reliability and specificity of individual indicator variables, broad factors were derived by means of time series factor analysis. All domains were subjected to a change point analysis and time series regression analysis with infection rates, NPIs, and the state of the economy as predictors. All keywords and analyses were preregistered prior to analysis. RESULTS: With the pandemic arriving in Germany, significant increases in people's search interests were observed in virtually all domains. Although most of the changes were short-lasting, each had a distinguishable onset during the lockdown period. Regression analysis of the Google Trends data confirmed pronounced autoregressive effects for the investigated variables, while forecasting by means of the tested predictors (ie, daily new infections, NPIs, and the state of economy) was moderate at best. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that people's interests, motives, and psychological states are heavily affected in times of crisis and lockdown. Specifically, disease- and virus-related domains (eg, pandemic disease, symptoms) peaked early, whereas personal health strategies (eg, masks, homeschooling) peaked later during the lockdown. Domains addressing social life and psychosocial functioning showed long-term increases in public interest. Renovation was the only domain to show a decrease in search interest with the onset of the lockdown. As changes in search behavior are consistent over multiple domains, a Google Trends analysis may provide information for policy makers on how to adapt and develop intervention, information, and prevention strategies, especially when NPIs are in effect.","output":"Interests, Motives, and Psychological Burdens in Times of Crisis and Lockdown: Google Trends Analysis to Inform Policy Makers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study provided comparisons of confirmed cases between face\\\\cover\\\\required states and partially or not\\\\required states from a time\\\\series analysis on effects of face mask use in public based on eight different states between March 1 and June 15, 2020.

Replacement with the BCoV 32-nucleotide (nt) inter-stem-loop fourth domain between stem-loops III and IV, however, required blind cell passaging for virus recovery. Here, we describe suppressor mutations within the transplanted BCoV 32-nt domain that along with appearance of potential base pairings identify an RNA-RNA interaction between this domain and a 32-nt region 200 nt downstream within the nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1)-coding region.

This study investigated significant and prominent changes of the transcriptome of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that immediately after isolation are exposed to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-modulated immune challenges over a time frame of 24-48 h. In this in vitro study design, most LPS and BG responsive genes are downregulated and their counts are drastically reduced when cells are treated 24 h after, 24 h before or in parallel with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Interestingly, only a 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) pre-treatment of the LPS challenge results in a majority of upregulated genes. Based on transcriptome-wide data both immune challenges display characteristic differences in responsive genes and their associated pathways, to which the actions of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) often oppose.

Objective: To assess whether a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, mood disorder, or anxiety disorder is associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study assessed 7348 consecutive adult patients for 45 days following laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and May 31, 2020, in a large academic medical system in New York. The final date of follow-up was July 15, 2020. Patients without available medical records before testing were excluded. Exposures: Patients were categorized based on the following International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses before their testing date: (1) schizophrenia spectrum disorders, (2) mood disorders, and (3) anxiety disorders. Patients with these diagnoses were compared with a reference group without psychiatric disorders. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality, defined as death or discharge to hospice within 45 days following a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result. Results: Of the 26a?540 patients tested, 7348 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 54 [18.6] years; 3891 [53.0%] women). Of eligible patients with positive test results, 75 patients (1.0%) had a history of a schizophrenia spectrum illness, 564 (7.7%) had a history of a mood disorder, and 360 (4.9%) had a history of an anxiety disorder. After adjusting for demographic and medical risk factors, a premorbid diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder was significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.67; 95% CI, 1.48-4.80). Diagnoses of mood disorders (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.87-1.49) and anxiety disorders (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.65-1.41) were not associated with mortality after adjustment. In comparison with other risk factors, a diagnosis of schizophrenia ranked behind only age in strength of an association with mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of adults with SARS-CoV-2-positive test results in a large New York medical system, adults with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder diagnosis were associated with an increased risk for mortality, but those with mood and anxiety disorders were not associated with a risk of mortality. These results suggest that schizophrenia spectrum disorders may be a risk factor for mortality in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Association of Psychiatric Disorders With Mortality Among Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine the influence of infectious agents on the initiation of diabetes in the spontaneously diabetic Bio-Breeding/Worcester (BB/W) rat, susceptible rats were raised in a germ-free environment.

Because of its potential impact upon real-world translation into downstream applications, there has been much research interest in multiple disciplines such as materials science, chemistry, biology, and engineering. Various antimicrobial technologies have been developed and currently applied on surfaces in public spaces, such as elevator buttons and escalator handrails. These technologies are mainly based on conventional methods of grafting quaternary ammonium salts (QACs) such as benzalkonium chloride or the immobilization of metal species of silver or copper. However, neither the long-term efficacy nor the fast-killing properties have been proven, and the future repercussions from extended use, such as environmental hazards and the induction of MDR development, is unknown. Nanostructured surfaces with excellent antimicrobial activities have been claimed to be the next generation of self-disinfecting surfaces with various promising applications and passive antimicrobial mechanisms, without the potential repercussions of active ingredient overuse. In this Account, we briefly introduce the concept of mechanobactericidal action realized by these nanostructured surfaces first discovered on cicada wings. The elimination of microbes on the surface was actualized by the physical rupture of the microbe cell wall by nanoprotusions, without any involvement of chemical species. By mimicking the physical features of naturally occurring biocidal surfaces, the fabrication of nanostructures on various substrates such as titania, silicon, and polymers has been well described. Observations of the dependence of their antimicrobial efficacy on physical characteristics such as height, density, and rigidity have also been documented. However, the complex fabrication of such nanostructures remains the main drawback preventing its widespread application. We outline our efforts in fabricating a series of zinc-based nanostructured materials with facile and generally applicable wet chemistry methods, including nanodaggered zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-L) and ZnO nanoneedles. In our investigations, we discovered that there were additional modes of action that contributed to the excellent biocidal activities of our materials. The impact of surface chemistry and charge was partially responsible for the selectivity and efficacy of ZIF-L-coated surfaces, where the positively charged surfaces were able to attract and adhere negatively charged bacteria to the surface. The combination of semiconductor ZnO nanoneedles on electron-donating substrates allowed for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), realizing the remote killing of bacteria unadhered to the nanostructured surface. Additionally, we demonstrate several real-life applications of the synthesized materials, underscoring the importance of materials development suited for scale-up and eventual translation to potential applications and commercial end products.","output":"Nanostructured Surfaces with Multimodal Antimicrobial Action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The burnout syndrome has represented a subject of great interest for both medicine professionals, and those in the sphere of psychology.

Most times, pressed by their superiors, people grow mentally and physically exhausted, the permanent stress giving birth to various medical conditions that are hard to combat. Unfortunately, the recommendations given by specialists are frequently ignored. Because of this, the symptoms of the burnout syndrome affect increasingly more people, regardless of the age range they belong to or their profession. Even if the human resource is finite, it should be exploited very gently. The era we live in, demands that we are productive, while health-related aspects (rest, sport and so on) are deemed less important.

A serial, weekly, nationally representative, cross-sectional, observational study of randomly selected adults was conducted in Scotland during June and July 2020. If available, validated instruments were used to measure psychological distress, individual demographics, illness beliefs, and the following characteristics: Rurality, area deprivation, access to residential outside space, frequency of visiting, and duration in green space. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect were conducted. There were 2969 participants in Study 1, of which 1765 (59.6%) were female, 349 (11.9%) were in the shielding category, and the median age was 54 years.

Reporting radiographers provide a cost-effective and safe solution for managing CXR backlogs, but not all Trusts support this service development. This study aimed to establish the service enablers and challenges associated with training and employing radiographers to report CXR images in acute hospital sites in England, UK. METHODS: Approval for this electronic survey was granted in 84 of 146 (58%) Trusts approached. The survey was open for 10 weeks during August to October 2020, comprising of qualitative and quantitative questions. Data was exported in to an Excel spreadsheet where manual thematic analysis was performed. Descriptive statistics were also generated. RESULTS: Sample size was 75 (89% response rate). Thirty-three departments (44%) had at least one trainee. Most departments (n = 53, 71%) employ at least one CXR reporting radiographer. A total of 121/160 (76%) radiographers report CXRs. Number of reporting sessions shows progression. Factors enabling training and employment arise from service improvements, financial pressures, and developing the workforce. The main challenges relate to staffing issues with a number of associated sub-themes. A small faction indicated lack of radiographer interest to report CXRs due to litigation worries; possibly uncovering a new and emerging issue. CONCLUSION: Enablers and challenges associated with radiographers reporting CXRs are similar to previous studies. The growth of CXR reporting radiographers and reporting sessions indicates a continuing reliance on radiographers to contributing to managing CXR backlogs.

They also provide a focus for detailed epidemiological studies and allow the timing and impact of interventions to be assessed.A common approach is to aggregate case data to administrative regions. Whilst providing a good visual impression of change over space, this method masks spatial variation and assumes that disease risk is constant across space. Risk factors for COVID-19 (e.g. population density, deprivation and ethnicity) vary from place to place across England so it follows that risk will also vary spatially. Kernel density estimation compares the spatial distribution of cases relative to the underlying population, unfettered by arbitrary geographical boundaries, to produce a continuous estimate of spatially varying risk.Using test results from healthcare settings in England (Pillar 1 of the UK Government testing strategy) and freely available methods and software, we estimated the spatial and spatio-temporal risk of COVID-19 infection across England for the first 6 months of 2020. Widespread transmission was underway when partial lockdown measures were introduced on 23 March 2020 and the greatest risk erred towards large urban areas. The rapid growth phase of the outbreak coincided with multiple introductions to England from the European mainland. The spatio-temporal risk was highly labile throughout.In terms of controlling transmission, the most important practical application of our results is the accurate identification of areas within regions that may require tailored intervention strategies. We recommend that this approach is absorbed into routine surveillance outputs in England.

Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with solid masses or lesions needing EUS-guided core biopsy at the University of Utah between May 2016 and November 2017. All core biopsies were obtained using an Acquire?Fine Needle Biopsy Device (Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick MA, USA). Rapid on-site evaluation was performed by a board-certified cytopathologist in all cases. Results One hundred thirty-two patients (87 male) were included. Ninety-nine (73.3%) of the lesions were located in the pancreas. All needle sizes (19 G, 22 G and 25 G) had similar yield. The mean number of passes needed was 2.280.7.

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has greatly improved our ability to study these populations, however, major challenges remain, such as accurate identification of intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) that represent within-host viral diversity of influenza virus. In order to investigate the sources and the frequency of called iSNVs in influenza samples, we used a set of longitudinal influenza patient samples collected within a University of Maryland (UMD) cohort of college students in a living learning community. Our results indicate that technical replicates aid in removal of random RT-PCR, PCR, and platform sequencing errors, while the use of clonal plasmids for removal of systematic errors is more important in samples of low RNA abundance. We show that the choice of reference for read mapping affects the frequency of called iSNVs, with the sample self-reference resulting in the lowest amount of iSNV noise. The importance of variant caller choice is also highlighted in our study, as we observe differential sensitivity of variant callers to the mapping reference choice, as well as the poor overlap of their called iSNVs. Based on this, we develop an approach for identification of highly probable iSNVs by removal of sequencing and bioinformatics algorithm-associated errors, which we implement in phylogenetic analyses of the UMD samples for a greater resolution of transmission links. In addition to identifying closely related transmission connections supported by the presence of highly confident shared iSNVs between patients, our results also indicate that the rate of minor variant turnover within a host may be a limiting factor for utilization of iSNVs to determine patient epidemiological links.","output":"High confidence identification of intra-host single nucleotide variants for person-to-person influenza transmission tracking in congregate settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pork has become the number one meat consumed worldwide. Meeting the demand for pork has forced the revolution of swine production from traditional husbandry practices that involved a few pigs or small herds to intensive concentration of swine raised in multisite production systems. This dramatic change has made the production of pork very efficient, but it has also changed the ecology of many swine diseases, may encourage the emergence of new diseases, and amplifies the economic impact of swine diseases. Sustained treatment of diseases in livestock production is not feasible making prevention of disease a priority. Prevention of livestock diseases involves eliminating exposure to pathogens and anti-viral strategies to prevent or reduce clinical disease. For some swine diseases, efficacious vaccines can be made, however, for other diseases the host/pathogen relationship is more complex and efficacious vaccines are not available. Given the increasing demand for pork, the development of new approaches to improve swine anti-viral immunity is critical. Rate-limiting steps to improving vaccines are understanding how the pathogen interacts with the host's immune system, any immunopathology resulting from such interactions and how the host's immune system resolves the infection.

Moreover, recent technology innovations led to the diffusion of commercial head-mounted displays for immersive VR: users can enjoy entertainment activities that fill their visual fields, experiencing the sensation of physical presence in these virtual immersive environments. Even if AR and VR are mostly used separately, they can be effectively combined to provide a multi-user shared environment (SE), where two or more users perform some specific tasks in a cooperative or competitive way, providing a wider set of interactions and use cases compared to immersive VR alone. However, due to the differences between the two technologies, it is difficult to develop SEs offering a similar experience for both AR and VR users. This paper presents Harmonize, a novel framework to deploy applications based on SEs with a comparable experience for both AR and VR users. Moreover, the framework is hardware-independent, and it has been designed to be as much extendable to novel hardware as possible. An immersive game has been designed to test and to evaluate the validity of the proposed framework.

This paper describes a new approach to smart mask technology that actively monitors for airborne pathogens using a PM sensor and reduces the wearer's exposure to them by an active mitigation strategy. This strategy involves using a mist spray to increase the pathogen's particle size, which reduces their ability to linger in the air. This system can be controlled wirelessly via a mobile application, which also displays the monitoring data. Deployment areas of this smart mask include classrooms, hospitals, and workspaces.

Given the nation-wide spread of the coronavirus in major Japanese cities and the rapid increase in the number of cases with untraceable infection routes, large-scale monitoring for capturing the current epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in Japan is urgently required. Methods A chatbot-based healthcare system named COOPERA (COvid-19: Operation for Personalized Empowerment to Render smart prevention And AN care seeking) was developed to surveil the Japanese epidemiological situation in real-time. COOPERA asked questions regarding personal information, location, preventive actions, COVID-19 related symptoms and their residence. Empirical Bayes estimates of the age-sex-standardized incidence rate and disease mapping approach using scan statistics were utilized to identify the geographical distribution of the symptoms in Tokyo and their spatial correlation r with the identified COVID-19 cases. Findings We analyzed 353,010 participants from Tokyo recruited from 27th March to 6th April 2020. The mean (SD) age of participants was 42.7 (12.3), and 63.4%, 36.4% or 0.2% were female, male, or others, respectively. 95.6% of participants had no subjective symptoms. We identified several geographical clusters with high spatial correlation (r = 0.9), especially in downtown areas in central Tokyo such as Shibuya and Shinjuku. Interpretation With the global spread of COVID-19, medical resources are being depleted. A new system to monitor the epidemiological situation, COOPERA, can provide insights to assist political decision to tackle the epidemic. In addition, given that Japan has not had a strong lockdown policy to weaken the spread of the infection, our result would be useful for preparing for the second wave in other countries during the next flu season without a strong lockdown.

METHODS Assessment of 739 colorectal lesions >or=6 mm detected prospectively at CTC screening in 479 patients was performed. By-polyp PPV was analyzed according to small (6-9 mm) versus large (>or=10 mm) size; morphology (sessile/pedunculated/flat); diagnostic confidence level (3 = most confident, 1 = least confident); and histology. By-patient PPV was analyzed at various polyp size thresholds. RESULTS By-polyp PPV for CTC-detected lesions >or=6 mm, 6-9 mm, and >or=10 mm was 91.6% (677/739), 90.1% (410/451), and 92.7% (267/288), respectively (p = 0.4). By-polyp PPV according to sessile, pedunculated, flat, and mass-like morphology was 92.5% (441/477), 96.5% (139/144), 77.7% (73/94), and 97.6% (40/41), respectively (p < 0.0001 for flat versus polypoid morphology). By-polyp PPV according to diagnostic confidence level was 94.7% (554/585) for highest (= level 3), 83.5% (106/127) for intermediate (= level 2), and 63.0% (17/27) for lowest (= level 1) confidence (p < 0.0001 for levels-2/3 versus level-1).

The World Health Organization recently reported that the virus may infect the organism through any organ in the living body, such as the respiratory, the immunity, the nervous, the digestive, or the cardiovascular system. Targeting the abovementioned goal, we envision an implanted nanosystem embedded in the intra living-body network. The main function of the nanosystem is either to perform diagnosis and mitigation of infectious diseases or to implement a targeted drug delivery system (i.e., delivery of the therapeutic drug to the diseased tissue or targeted cell). The communication among the nanomachines is accomplished via communication-based molecular diffusion. The control/interconnection of the nanosystem is accomplished through the utilization of Internet of bio-nano things (IoBNT). The proposed nanosystem is designed to employ a coded relay nanomachine disciplined by the decode and forward (DF) principle to ensure reliable drug delivery to the targeted cell. Notably, both the sensitivity of the drug dose and the phenomenon of drug molecules loss before delivery to the target cell site in long-distance due to the molecules diffusion process are taken into account. In this paper, a coded relay NM with conventional coding techniques such as RS and Turbo codes is selected to achieve minimum bit error rate (BER) performance and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while the detection process is based on maximum likelihood (ML) probability and minimum error probability (MEP). The performance analysis of the proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of channel capacity and bit error rate by varying system parameters such as relay position, number of released molecules, relay and receiver size. Analysis results are validated through simulation and demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly improve delivery performance of the desirable drugs in the molecular communication system.","output":"Embedded Coded Relay System for Molecular Communications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A surgeon failed to heed his own misgivings on taking a family vacation cruise.

Biomarkers are needed to effectively translate these promising therapies to clinical trials. Our objective was to investigate electrophysiological biomarkers of compound muscle action potential (CMAP), motor unit number estimation (MUNE) and electromyography (EMG) using an SMA mouse model. METHODS Sciatic CMAP, MUNE, and EMG were obtained in SMN7 mice at ages 3-13 days and at 21 days in mice with SMN selectively reduced in motor neurons (ChATCre ). To investigate these measures as biomarkers of treatment response, measurements were obtained in SMN7 mice treated with antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) or gene therapy. RESULTS CMAP was significantly reduced in SMN7 mice at days 6-13 (p<0.01), and MUNE was reduced at days 7-13 (p<0.01). Fibrillations were present on EMG in SMN7 mice but not controls (p=0.02). Similar findings were seen at 21 days in ChATCre mice. MUNE in ASO-treated SMN7 mice were similar to controls at day 12 and 30. CMAP reduction persisted in ASO-treated SMN7 mice at day 12 but was corrected at day 30. Similarly, CMAP and MUNE responses were corrected with gene therapy to restore SMN. INTERPRETATION These studies confirm features of preserved neuromuscular function in the early postnatal period and subsequent motor unit loss in SMN7 mice. SMN restoring therapies result in preserved MUNE and gradual repair of CMAP responses. This provides preclinical evidence for the utilization of CMAP and MUNE as biomarkers in future SMA clinical trials.","output":"Electrophysiological Biomarkers in Spinal Muscular Atrophy: Preclinical Proof of Concept."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the continuous growth of the quantity, scale, and speed of vessels in recent years, maritime accidents are posing increasing risks to societies and individuals, especially in narrow inland waterways. Therefore, it is of great significance to analyze navigational risks to ensure the safety of waterborne transportation. In this paper, the navigational risks of Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge (NYRB) waters are investigated based on spatiotemporal mining on massive automatic identification system (AIS) trajectories by using geographic information system (GIS) techniques. A time-series-oriented trajectory processing method is proposed to deal with the historical AIS data in the whole year of 2019. The method adopts a periodic processing strategy to produce traffic density estimation products in multiple temporal scales for supporting spatiotemporal analysis. The proposed method greatly improves the data-processing efficiency and provides a flexible way to deeply understand the vessel behavior patterns in NYRB waters. Then the complete characteristics of the spatial distribution and temporal variation of AIS trajectories are revealed. Based on that, three types of critical navigational risks are discovered, which include the safety distance risk, the pier collision risk, and the traffic congestion risk.

Method: We determined sociodemographic, clinical features, information status on COVID-19 pandemic, geriatric anxiety scale and loneliness scale for the elderly values of 290 individuals (65- 90 years old) in Turkey. Results: The mean age was 71.2+/-5.9 years, and 54.8% were male(n: 159). 87.6% followed COVID-19 process, and 88.3% received the information from the television. 14.1% reported significant worries about the individuals in their family, 14.1% about their social life, and 19.7% about their economic situation. A statistically significant relationship was observed between the geriatric anxiety and the loneliness scale(r: 0.498, p: 0.001). Anxiety scores were increased 1.29 fold by loneliness scores, 3.56 fold by having a chronic disease and 3.26 fold by the history of a psychiatric disorder. Discussion: We suggest that quarantine increases anxiety and loneliness levels in geriatric population with a positive correlation between anxiety and loneliness levels. Having a chronic disease and History of a psychiatric disorder was also associated with anxiety levels. The majority of concerns is about their family members, future social and economic lives. It has been observed that television has become an essential source of information in the pandemic for the geriatric population.

No significant overall associations between selected SNPs and the risk of IA were found in this large cohort. Although a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)-stratified analysis revealed that carriers of the IRF4(rs12203592T/T) genotype had a six-fold increased risk of developing the infection when compared with those carrying the C allele (OR(REC) = 6.24, 95%CI 1.25C31.2, P = 0.026), the association of this variant with IA risk did not reach significance at experiment-wide significant threshold. In addition, we found an association of the IRF4(AATC) and IRF4(GGTC) haplotypes (not including the IRF4(rs12203592T) risk allele) with a decreased risk of IA but the magnitude of the association was similar to the one observed in the single-SNP analysis, which indicated that the haplotypic effect on IA risk was likely due to the IRF4(rs12203592) SNP. Finally, no evidence of significant interactions among the genetic markers tested and the risk of IA was found.

Projects tend to have some commonalities that allow most of them to be divided up into several bins, if the bins are made large enough.. The term target validation can mean different things to different people. To a chemist proposing a new project it might refer to affirmative evidence from a mouse knockout or even just an RNA interference experiment in cells. To a clinician it probably means no less than proven statistically significant efficacy by a drug in large-scale, controlled human trials. Target validation, that is, systematically building up evidence that the interaction of a proposed target with an agent like a small molecule or a monoclonal antibody (mAB) can have a therapeutic effect in a human disease state, is often far from trivial. It represents an ongoing, labor-intensive process that can be rate-limiting, but is necessary to avoid disastrous losses in time, money, and manpower that occur when a clinical drug fails to work because its target is not at all crucial to disease progression or symptoms. Target identification, in this case the process whereby a new target is first proposed based on some minimal evidence, is less cumbersome but still requires devoted resources. The beauty of working on a project based upon an already established target is that both of these steps can be skipped.","output":"Chapter 5 Project Considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telehealth is an extraordinary advancement of modern medicine.

METHOD Data were derived from a longitudinal prospective cohort study. Participants included 2065 students who were followed up for 13 years. Generalized estimating equations were used to clarify the influential effects of family-related factors on suicidal ideation during the past month. RESULTS The peak of the rate of recent suicidal ideation arrived during junior high school years. Family interaction, family support, family involvement, and parental punishment had simultaneous effects on recent suicidal ideation. Family involvement, parental conflict, and psychological control had lagged and lasting effects on suicidal ideation. Notably, the lasting protective effects of family involvement were more obvious than simultaneous effects.

Moreover, an innovation was introduced and included the use of a commercially produced liquid lysozyme concentrate (LLC) as the starting material instead of the dried form that is commonly used. The obtained results showed that the modified preparations contained an abundant amount of oligomers, and the surface hydrophobicity increased by more than 50% compared to the native form of the enzyme, which means that the modification had a strong influence on the effectiveness of the antibacterial activity. Moreover, these changes made it possible to obtain preparations with complete solubility, which could not be obtained with other thermal methods. Thus, using microwave radiation to modify LLC is a unique and effective modification scheme because it can obtain the highest quality of a large number of attractive products in a simple and fast way with multidirectional application potential, especially in food technology, medicine, pharmacology, and veterinary medicine.","output":"Microwave Modification as an Excellent Way to Produce Unique Lysozyme with Potential for Food and Human Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loneliness was deemed a behavioral epidemic even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent social distancing policy measures have raised concerns about increased social isolation and loneliness, especially in vulnerable populations such as military veterans. However, little is known about the impact of the pandemic on longitudinal changes in loneliness in veterans, and potential protective psychosocial factors that may mitigate loneliness in this population. We analyzed data from the 2019C2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 3,078 US veterans before and 1-year into the pandemic. Prevalence, and risk and protective factors associated with changes in loneliness were examined. Results revealed that the prevalence of loneliness decreased over the study period17.3% pre-pandemic to 15.9% peri-pandemic (p = 0.032). A total of 5.4% (n = 164) of veterans reported increased loneliness, 6.4% (n = 196) decreased loneliness, and 10.6% (n = 325) persistent loneliness during the pandemic. Multivariable logistic regression models indicated that not being married/partnered, and scoring lower on pre-pandemic measures of purpose in life and cognitive functioning were most strongly associated with increased loneliness. Pre-pandemic psychiatric disorder, unpartnered marital status, and pandemic-related social restriction and financial stressors were most strongly associated with persistent loneliness. Collectively, these results suggest that, contrary to concerns, the prevalence of loneliness subtly decreased one year into the pandemic. Veterans who are not partnered, have pre-existing psychiatric conditions, and endorse more COVID-related stressors may be at higher risk for experiencing loneliness during the pandemic. Interventions that promote social connectedness, as well as that target the aforementioned risk and protective factors, may help mitigate loneliness in veterans.","output":"Loneliness in U.S. military veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic: A nationally representative, prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To compare the efficiency, efficacy, and safety, as well as the educational value, of heads-up (three-dimensional visualization systemCassisted) and traditional microscopic cataract surgery. METHODS: This randomized noninferiority trial enrolled 242 eyes of 201 patients who received femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery. The questionnaire study enrolled 26 medical interns and 39 medical students. Patients received surgery under either a three-dimensional visualization system (3D group, 117 eyes) or traditional microscope (TM group, 125 eyes) after random allocation. The primary outcome was surgical time. The noninferiority margin of surgical time was 60 seconds. Secondary outcomes included ultrasound power, phacoemulsification time, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, endothelial cell density, central corneal thickness, complications, and observer satisfaction scores for surgical procedures. RESULTS: Surgical time was 462.03  80.36 seconds in the 3D group and 452.13  76.63 seconds in the TM group (difference 9.90 seconds; 95% CI, C9.98 to 29.78; P = 0.365).

However, estimated epidemic quantities such as rates of severe illness and death, the case fatality rate (CFR), and infection fatality rate (IFR), are often expressed in terms of aggregated population-level estimates due to the lack of epidemiological data at the refined subpopulation level. For public health policy makers to better address the pandemic, stratified estimates are necessary to investigate the potential outcomes of policy scenarios targeting specific subpopulations. METHODS: We develop a framework for using available data on the prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors (age, comorbidities, BMI, smoking status) in subpopulations, and epidemic dynamics at the population level and stratified by age, to estimate subpopulation-stratified probabilities of severe illness and the CFR (as deaths over observed infections) and IFR (as deaths over estimated total infections) across risk profiles representing all combinations of risk factors including age, comorbidities, obesity class, and smoking status. A dynamic epidemic model is integrated with a relative risk model to produce time-varying subpopulation-stratified estimates. The integrated model is used to analyze dynamic outcomes and parameters by population and subpopulation, and to simulate alternate policy scenarios that protect specific at-risk subpopulations or modify the population-wide transmission rate. The model is calibrated to data from the Los Angeles County population during the period March 1 - October 15 2020. FINDINGS: We estimate a rate of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.13,0.33) of infections observed before April 15, which increased over the epidemic course to 0.41 (0.11,0.69). Overall population-average IFR( t ) estimates for LAC peaked at 0.77% (0.38%,1.15%) on May 15 and decreased to 0.55% (0.24%,0.90%) by October 15. The population-average IFR( t ) stratified by age group varied extensively across subprofiles representing each combination of the additional risk factors considered (comorbidities, BMI, smoking). We found median IFRs ranging from 0.009%-0.04% in the youngest age group (0-19), from 0.1%-1.8% for those aged 20-44, 0.36%-4.3% for those aged 45-64, and 1.02%-5.42% for those aged 65+. In the group aged 65+ for which the rate of unobserved infections is likely much lower, we find median CFRs in the range 4.4%-23.45%. The initial societal lockdown period avoided overwhelming healthcare capacity and greatly reduced the observed death count. In comparative scenario analysis, alternative policies in which the population-wide transmission rate is reduced to a moderate and sustainable level of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) would not have been sufficient to avoid overwhelming healthcare capacity, and additionally would have exceeded the observed death count. Combining the moderate NPI policy with stringent protection of the at-risk subpopulation of individuals 65+ would have resulted in a death count similar to observed levels, but hospital counts would have approached capacity limits. INTERPRETATION: The risk of severe illness and death of COVID-19 varies tremendously across subpopulations and over time, suggesting that it is inappropriate to summarize epidemiological parameters for the entire population and epidemic time period. This includes variation not only across age groups, but also within age categories combined with other risk factors analyzed in this study (comorbidities, obesity status, smoking). In the policy analysis accounting for differences in IFR across risk groups in comparing the control of infections and protection of higher risk groups, we find that the strict initial lockdown period in LAC was effective because it both reduced overall transmission and protected individuals at greater risk, resulting in preventing both healthcare overload and deaths. While similar numbers of deaths as observed in LAC could have been achieved with a more moderate NPI policy combined with greater protection of individuals 65+, this would have come at the expense of overwhelming the healthcare system. In anticipation of a continued rise in cases in LAC this winter, policy makers need to consider the trade offs of various policy options on the numbers of the overall population that may become infected, severely ill, and that die when considering policies targeted at subpopulations at greatest risk of transmitting infection and at greatest risk for developing severe outcomes.","output":"Estimation of COVID-19 risk-stratified epidemiological parameters and policy implications for Los Angeles County through an integrated risk and stochastic epidemiological model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Identifying lung pathogens and acute spikes in lung counts remain a challenge in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Our goal was to develop a robust and accessible assay technology that is suitable for high-throughput screening and applicable to a wide range of proteins acting as either hydrolysing or non-hydrolysing binders of mono- and poly-ADP-ribosyl groups. As a foundation of our work, we developed a C-terminal protein fusion tag based on a Gi protein alpha subunit peptide (GAP), which allows for site-specific introduction of cysteine-linked mono- and poly-ADP-ribosyl groups as well as chemical ADP-ribosyl analogs. By fusion of the GAP-tag and ADP-ribosyl binders to fluorescent proteins, we were able to generate robust FRET signals and the interaction with 22 previously described ADP-ribosyl-binders was confirmed. To demonstrate the applicability of this binding assay for high-throughput screening, we utilized it to screen for inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 macrodomain and identified the drug suramin as a moderate yet unspecific inhibitor of this protein. To complement the binding technology, we prepared high-affinity ADP-ribosyl binders fused to a nanoluciferase, which enabled simple blot-based detection of mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins.

An algorithm has been previously developed to identify patients with high EHR-continuity. We sought to assess whether applying this algorithm to patient selection for inclusion can reduce bias caused by data-discontinuity in 4 RWE examples. Among Medicare beneficiaries aged >=65 years from 2007 to 2014, we established four cohorts assessing drug effects on short-term or long-term outcomes, respectively. We linked claims data with two US EHR systems and calculated %bias of the multivariable-adjusted effect estimates based on only EHR vs. linked EHR-claims data since the linked data capture medical information recorded outside of the study EHR. Our study cohort included 77,288 patients in system 1 and 60,309 in system 2. We found the sub-cohort in the lowest quartile of EHR-continuity captured 72-81% of the short-term and only 21-31% of the long-term outcome events, leading to %bias of 6-99% for the short-term and 62-112% for the long-term outcome examples. This trend appeared to be more pronounced in the example using a non-user comparison rather than an active comparison. We did not find significant treatment effect heterogeneity by EHR-continuity for most subgroups across empirical examples. In EHR-based RWE studies, investigators may consider excluding patients with low algorithm-predicted EHR-continuity as the EHR data capture relatively few of their actual outcomes, and treatment effect estimates in these patients may be unreliable.","output":"Longitudinal data discontinuity in electronic health records and consequences for medication effectiveness studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether social determinants of health (SDOH) are predictive of adherence to public health preventive measures and to describe changes in adherence over time among parents and children. METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted in children aged 0-10 years and their parents through the TARGet Kids! COVID-19 Study in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada (April-July 2020). This study included 335 parents (2108 observations) and 416 children (2632 observations). Parents completed weekly questionnaires on health, family functioning, socio-demographics, and public health practices. The outcome was adherence to public health preventive measures measured separately for parents and children. Marginal log-binomial models were fitted using repeated measures of the outcome and predictors. RESULTS: Unemployment (RR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.97), apartment living (RR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.99), and essential worker in the household (RR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55, 1.00) were associated with decreased likelihood of adherence among parents; however, no associations were observed for other SDOH, including family income and ethnicity. Furthermore, there was no strong evidence that SDOH were associated with child adherence. The mean number of days/week that parents and children adhered at the start of the study was 6.45 (SD = 0.93) and 6.59 (SD = 0.86), respectively, and this decreased to 5.80 (SD = 1.12) and 5.84 (SD = 1.23) by study end. Children consistently had greater adherence than parents. CONCLUSION: SDOH were predictive of adherence to public health preventive measures among parents but less so in children among our sample of relatively affluent urban families.

The crystal packing of favipiravir is mainly constructed through intermolecular NCHO, NCHN and CCHO hydrogen bonds, yielding a 3D supramolecular framework with a zst topology defined by the point symbol of (6(5)8). The crystal structure of favipiravir is further stabilized by weak CCFFCC intermolecular type II dihalogen interactions, yielding a 1D supramolecular polymeric chain. More than 80% of the total Hirshfeld surface area for favipiravir is occupied by HH/C/N/O/F and CN/O contacts. Energy frameworks have been calculated to additionally analyze the overall crystal packing. It was established that the structure of favipiravir is mainly characterized by the dispersion energy framework followed by the less significant electrostatic energy framework contribution. Finally, by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, we have assigned the interaction energy of each hydrogen bond, which can be helpful to develop scoring functions to be used in force fields/docking calculations.","output":"Favipiravir: insight into the crystal structure, Hirshfeld surface analysis and computational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Latin America is a vast heterogeneous territory where chronic diseases such as mild cognitive impairment or dementia are becoming higher.

Varying degrees of PF and its rapid progress have been widely reported in post-COVID-19 patients and there is consequently an urgent need to develop an appropriate, cost-effective approach for the prevention and management of PF. Aim: The potential therapeutic effect of the tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) and carotene against bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis was investigated in rats via the modulation of TGF-/Smad, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and NF-B signaling pathways. Design/Methods: Lung fibrosis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by a single intratracheal BLM (5 mg/kg) injection. These rats were subsequently treated with TRF (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body wt/day), carotene (10 mg/kg body wt/day), or a combination of TRF (200 mg/kg body wt/day) and carotene (10 mg/kg body wt/day) for 28 days by gavage administration. A group of normal rats was provided with saline as a substitute for BLM as the control. Lung function and biochemical, histopathological, and molecular alterations were studied in the lung tissues. Results: Both the TRF and carotene treatments were found to significantly restore the BLM-induced alterations in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions. The treatments appeared to show pneumoprotective effects through the upregulation of antioxidant status, downregulation of MMP-7 and inflammatory cytokine expressions, and reduction in collagen accumulation (hydroxyproline). We demonstrated that TRF and carotene ameliorate BLM-induced lung injuries through the inhibition of apoptosis, the induction of TGF-1/Smad, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and NF-B signaling pathways. Furthermore, the increased expression levels were shown to be significantly and dose-dependently downregulated by TRF (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body wt/day) treatment in high probability. The histopathological findings further confirmed that the TRF and carotene treatments had significantly attenuated the BLM-induced lung injury in rats. Conclusion: The results of this study clearly indicate the ability of TRF and carotene to restore the antioxidant system and to inhibit proinflammatory cytokines. These findings, thus, revealed the potential of TRF and carotene as preventive candidates for the treatment of PF in the future.","output":"Potential Therapeutic Effects of Tocotrienol-Rich Fraction (TRF) and Carotene Against Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis in Rats via TGF-/Smad, PI3K/Akt/mTOR and NF-B Signaling Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tetraspanins are four-span transmembrane proteins that organize the membrane by forming tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. These have been shown to be important for virus entry. The human herpesvirus (HHV)-6A receptor CD46 is known to form complexes with the tetraspanin CD9 and 1-integrins, however the significance of this for HHV-6A infection remains unexplored. Using a genetic approach, we demonstrate that knock out of CD46 abolishes binding to and infection of SupT1 cells by both HHV-6A and HHV-6B, establishing CD46 as a necessary receptor for productive infection of these cells. Knock out of CD9 in SupT1 cells had no effect on binding of either virus to the cell surface, but it reduced expression of immediate early transcripts to between 25-60% compared with the wild type cells. Although HHV-6B required CD46 for infection of SupT1, infection of Molt3 cells was independent of CD46 expression. Conversely, the absence of CD9 expression promoted infection of Molt3 cells with HHV-6B, indicating a negative role of CD9 for CD46-independent infection. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CD9 modulates infection with HHV-6A/B by promoting CD46-dependent infection and impairing CD46-independent infection. This also suggests that HHV-6A is strictly dependent on CD46 for entry, although other proteins, like CD9, may enhance the infection, whereas HHV-6B is more promiscuous and may use CD134, as demonstrated by others, CD46 in SupT1, and a novel yet unidentified receptor in Molt3 cells.Importance The mechanisms of entry of human herpesvirus (HHV)-6A and HHV-6B into host cells are of significance in order to develop novel drugs that may inhibit infection. To elucidate the contribution of the membrane proteins CD9 and CD46, we employed a genetic approach that eliminated these molecules from the host cell. This demonstrated that CD46 is critical for infection by HHV-6A, whereas infection by HHV-6B appeared to be more promiscuous. The infection of a T-cell line in the absence of CD46 and CD134 strongly suggest that an additional receptor for HHV-6B entry exists. Moreover, elimination of CD9 and subsequent reconstitution experiments demonstrated that CD9 promoted infection with HHV-6A and HHV-6B mediated by CD46, but inhibited infection with HHV-6B that occurred independent of CD46. Together, this demonstrated a CD46-dependent role of CD9 during infection with HHV-6A and HHV-6B and emphasized that HHV-6B may employ different entry mechanisms in various cells.","output":"The tetraspanin protein CD9 modulates infection with human herpesvirus 6A and 6B in a CD46-dependent manner."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of cholesterol in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other coronavirus-host cell interactions is currently being discussed in the context of two main scenarios: i) the presence of the neutral lipid in cholesterol-rich lipid domains involved in different steps of the viral infection and ii) the alteration of metabolic pathways by the virus over the course of infection.

The Korean outbreak was initiated by a single infected individual, allowing studies of virus evolution in the absence of further MERS-CoV introduction into human populations. In contrast, MERS is primarily a camel disease on the Arabian Peninsula and in Africa, with clinical disease in humans only in the former location. Previous work identified two mutations in the South Korean MERS-CoV, D510G and I529T on the Spike (S) protein, that led to impaired binding to the receptor. However, whether these mutations affected virulence is unknown. To address this question, we constructed isogenic viruses expressing mutations found in the S protein from Korean isolates and showed that isogenic viruses carrying the Korean MERS-CoV mutations, D510G or I529T, were attenuated in mice, resulting in greater survival, less induction of inflammatory cytokines, and less severe lung injury. In contrast, isogenic viruses expressing S proteins from African isolates were nearly fully virulent; other studies showed that West African camel isolates carry mutations in MERS-CoV accessory proteins, which may limit human transmission. These data indicate that following a single-point introduction of the virus, MERS-CoV S protein evolved rapidly in South Korea to adapt to human populations, with consequences on virulence. In contrast, the mutations in S proteins of African isolates did not change virulence, indicating that S protein variation likely does not play a major role in the lack of camel-to-human transmission in Africa.","output":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus Spike protein variants exhibit geographic differences in virulence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To study the correlation between the cycle threshold (CT) of reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction (RTCPCR) test in confirmed COVID-19 patients and the severity of disease. Background: RTCPCR test is a standard method for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. This test is based upon the amplification of the fluorescent signal. The number of cycles that the fluorescent signal undergoes to reach the threshold is called cycle threshold. It is inversely related to the nucleic acid content of the sample. Patients and methods: This is a single-centered, retrospective observational study. We have included a total of 192 patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by the RTCPCR test. Entire data have been collected from the electronic medical records. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, whereas the secondary outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive ventilation, acute kidney injury, renal replacement therapy (RRT), shock, and COVID-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS) score on high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, total length of stay in the hospital, and the number of ICU days and ventilator days. Results: We have calculated the mean CT value for all groups and calculated the p-value for statistical significance.

Limited information exists regarding the interrelationship between CD47 expression and tumour-associated macrophage-related immuno-microenvironment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These factors may predict novel immunotherapy efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS CD47 and PD-L1 expression was retrospectively assessed in 191 resected NSCLC specimens via immunohistochemistry. Forty-six patients with pulmonary infectious diseases were enrolled as the control group. The infiltration of macrophages (M2 and M1) and CD8+ T-lymphocytes was evaluated via dual-immunofluorescence staining. Targeted DNA sequencing was performed on NSCLC specimens. Survival analysis was performed using the Cox model. RESULTS Using 2+/3+ as a CD47 positive (CD47pos) expression cut-off, the prevalence of CD47pos expression in NSCLC was 33.0% (63/191), significantly higher than in pulmonary infectious diseases. CD47pos expression was significantly higher in female, non-smoking and adenocarcinoma patients (p=0.020, p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Furthermore, CD47pos expression was significantly correlated with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation (p<0.001). The expression of CD47 (H-score) in NSCLC was negatively correlated with tumour PD-L1 expression (p=0.0346) and tumour mutation burden (p=0.0107). CD47pos expression was independently correlated with poor disease-free survival in patients with resected NSCLC in multivariate Cox regression analysis (p=0.035). CONCLUSION This study revealed the demographic, molecular and immuno-microenvironment characteristics of CD47 expression in NSCLC. We identified tumour CD47pos expression as an independent prognostic factor for recurrence in resected NSCLC.

However, recombinant gp120 preparation has proven to be difficult because of extremely low expression levels. In order to facilitate gp120 expression, previous methods predominantly involved the replacement of native signal peptide with a heterologous one, resulting in very limited improvement. Currently, preparation of recombinant gp120 with native glycans relies solely on transient expression systems, which are not amendable for large scale production. In this work, we employed a different approach for gp120 expression. Besides replacing the native gp120 signal peptide with that of rat serum albumin and optimizing its codon usage, we generated a stable gp120-expressing cell line in a glutamine synthetase knockout HEK293T cell line that we established for the purpose of amplification of recombinant gene expressions. The combined usage of these techniques dramatically increased gp120 expression levels and yielded a functional product with human cell derived glycan. This method may be applicable to large scale preparation of other viral envelope proteins, such as that of the emerging SARS-CoV-2, or other glycoproteins which require the presence of authentic human glycans.","output":"High level stable expression of recombinant HIV gp120 in glutamine synthetase gene deficient HEK293T cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to curve the ongoing trend of the COVID-19 pandemic and save more lives, effective treatments against COVID-19 are urgently needed.

The prevalence of COVID-19 among older adults in independent/assisted living is not understood. Objectives To conduct surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and describe symptoms of COVID-19 among residents and staff of an independent/assisted living community. Design, Setting, and Participants In March 2020, public health surveillance of staff and residents was conducted on site at an assisted and independent living residence for older adults in Seattle, Washington, after exposure to 2 residents who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Exposures Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a congregate setting implementing social isolation and infection prevention protocols. Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs from residents and staff; a symptom questionnaire was completed assessing fever, cough, and other symptoms for the preceding 14 days. Residents were retested for SARS-CoV-2 7 days after initial screening. Results Testing was performed on 80 residents; 62 were women (77%), with mean age of 86 (range, 69-102) years. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 3 of 80 residents (3.8%); none felt ill, 1 male resident reported resolved cough and 1 loose stool during the preceding 14 days. Virus was also detected in 2 of 62 staff (3.2%); both were symptomatic. One week later, resident SARS-CoV-2 testing was repeated and 1 new infection detected (asymptomatic). All residents remained in isolation and were clinically stable 14 days after the second test. Conclusions and Relevance Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic residents highlights challenges in protecting older adults living in congregate settings. In this study, symptom screening failed to identify residents with infections and all 4 residents with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic after 14 days. Although 1 asymptomatic infection was found on retesting, a widespread facility outbreak was avoided. Compared with skilled nursing settings, in assisted/independent living communities, early surveillance to identify asymptomatic persons among residents and staff, in combination with adherence to recommended preventive strategies, may reduce viral spread.","output":"Outbreak Investigation of COVID-19 Among Residents and Staff of an Independent and Assisted Living Community for Older Adults in Seattle, Washington."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Design and development of different forms of soft matter from renewable (biomass) feedstocks is gaining attention in current research.

In this study, we aim to identify the determinants of anxiety in physicians on duty in coronavirus wards or quarantine centers. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional quantitative survey with an additional qualitative item. Five constructs of workload, exhaustion, family strain, feeling of protection, and anxiety were measured using items from two validated tools. Modifications were made for regional relevance. Factor analysis was performed showing satisfactory Cronbach alpha results. Overall, 103 physicians completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: T-test results revealed significant associations between gender and anxiety. Structural equation modeling identified that high workload contributed to greater exhaustion (? = 0.41, R2 = 0.17, p < 0.001) and greater family strain (? = 0.47, R2 = 0.22, p < 0.001). Exhaustion (? = 0.17, p < 0.005), family strain (? = 0.34, p < 0.001), and feelings of protection (? = - 0.30, p < 0.001) significantly explained anxiety (R2 = 0.28). Qualitative findings further identified specific needs of physicians with regard to protective equipment, compensation, quarantine management, resource allocation, security and public support, governance improvement, and health sector development. CONCLUSIONS: It is imperative to improve governmental and social support for physicians and other healthcare providers during the corona pandemic.

General and Internal Medicine ? Nephrology OBJECTIVE: Rare disease BACKGROUND: Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a relatively rare adverse effect of metformin therapy. It usually occurs in patients with metformin overdose or in those with underlying acute and/or chronic conditions resulting in impaired lactate metabolism. Among these, patients with acute kidney injury, heart failure, sepsis, and cirrhosis are the most vulnerable to MALA, even in the setting of appropriate therapy. The most common symptoms of MALA include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, encephalopathy, hypothermia, respiratory failure, and hypotension. Blindness is a dramatic symptom that has been rarely reported with MALA. CASE REPORT: We report a case of 78-year-old woman with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus with nephropathy for which she was treated with metformin and insulin. She developed nausea, non-bloody emesis, and watery diarrhea, which led to dehydration, anion gap metabolic acidosis due to hyperlactatemia, and acute kidney injury (AKI). She was hospitalized for i.v. hydration and further management when she suddenly developed blindness. The diagnostic work-up ruled out central causes and her symptoms resolved briefly after continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated, confirming the diagnosis of MALA. CONCLUSIONS: By reporting this case, we wish to increase awareness about MALA symptoms, its diagnosis, and the importance of early recognition and initiation of treatment among clinicians involved in the care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who take metformin for diabetes mellitus. Although rare, this metformin adverse effect can present dramatically and can be distressing for both patient and treating team.","output":"Transient Complete Blindness Due to Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis (MALA) Reversed with Hemodialysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This mixed methods study explored how social media use informed physical activity and diet-related behaviours, and self-perceived Quality of Life (QoL) during COVID-19, and assessed the contextual factors that drive social media use for health-related behaviour change in diverse groups. During the COVID-19 lockdown periods there were reported changes to social media use and health behaviours, and this gave an opportunity to investigate potential relationships. METHODS: An explanatory sequential research design of two parts was used: (1) An online survey that assessed social media use in relation to physical activity levels, diet quality and QoL (n = 786; Mage 45.1  19.1 (range 16C88) years; Female =69%); (2) 20 purposive focus groups (n = 69; Mage = 52.88  18.45 years, Female n = 68%) to understand the contextual factors that drive social media use for health-related behaviour change. Descriptive and thematic analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Participants in this study reported that social media facilitated the self-management of behaviours related to physical activity, diet and QoL, through access to information to inform workouts and dietary quality, and the opportunities for interaction with peers, family members and within social groups. Contextual factors including work, home and lifestyle arrangements, pre-existing health-related knowledge and behaviours, and the perceived value of social media for health influenced the relationship between social media use and self-reported outcomes. Social media influencers, peers/family members, and official organisations influenced the application of health-related information accessed via social media. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence shows that participants were critical users of social media and were able to use social media to derive benefit for their health and wellbeing. Detailed guidance for those who use social media, as well as those who recommend and endorse social media content is required to maximise the potential of social media to support health behaviours. Future public health strategies and social media interventions should acknowledge diversity in contextual factors driving social media use for health behaviour change.

Its aim is to match the sensor detections to the known objects. To treat such issue, recent research focus on the evidential approach using belief functions, which are interpreted as an extension of the probabilistic model for reasoning about uncertainty. The data fusion process begins by quantifying sensor data by belief masses. Thereafter, these masses are combined in order to provide more accurate information. Finally, a probabilistic approximation of these combined masses is done to make-decision on associations. Several probabilistic transformations have been proposed in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, these transformations have been evaluated only on simulated examples.

This disease has an impact on the human hormone system. A computer-aided diagnosis is needed to predict COVID-19. The blood volume must be determined in order to predict the disease's severity level. The blood vessels or capillaries provide oxygen to the Red Blood Cells (RBCs), and the RBCs, in turn, provide oxygen to the internal organs. The wall and lining of the alveolus and capillaries are damaged and thickened by COVID-19. The oxygen transfer by RBCs becomes extremely difficult as the wall thickens.

Respiratory issues cause problems on the retina, triggering haemorrhages. It also has an impact on the human digestive tract and taste buds. This has been confirmed in medical studies. As a result, of diagnosis, the proposed IoT-based method needs microscopic blood smear images, CT images of the digestive tract, X-ray images of the chest, and fundus images of the eye.

However, the Covid-19 deaths data reported by some countries display a significant weekly variability, which can make the interpretation and use of the death data in analysis and modeling difficult. Methods: We derive the mathematical relationship between the series of new daily deaths by reporting date and the series of deaths by death date. We then apply this formalism to the corresponding time-series reported by Sweden during the Covid-19 pandemic. Results: The practice of reporting new deaths daily, as is standard procedure during an outbreak in most countries and regions, should be viewed as a time-dependent filter, modulating the underlying true death curve. After having characterized the Swedish reporting process, we show how smoothing of the Swedish reported daily deaths series results in a curve distinctly different from the true death curve. We also comment on the use of nowcasting methods. Conclusions: Modelers and analysts using the series of new daily deaths by reporting date should take extra care when it is highly variable and when there is a significant reporting delay.

Immunity is only achieved after repeated exposure. There has been a lack of methods to mimic the in vivo co-occurrence, where cells and parasites can be grown together for many days, and it has been difficult with long time in vitro studies. METHODS AND RESULTS: A new method for growing P. falciparum in 5% CO(2) with a specially formulated culture medium is described. This knowledge was used to establish the co-culture of live P. falciparum together with human B-cells in vitro for 10 days. The presence of B-cells clearly enhanced parasite growth, but less so when Transwell inserts were used (not allowing passage of cells or merozoites), showing that direct contact is advantageous. B-cells also proliferated more in presence of parasites. Symbiotic parasitic growth was verified using CESS cell-line and it showed similar results, indicating that B-cells are indeed the cells responsible for the effect. In malaria endemic areas, people often have increased levels of atypical memory B-cells in the blood, and in this assay it was demonstrated that when parasites were present there was an increase in the proportion of CD19 + CD20 + CD27 ? FCRL4 + B-cells, and a contraction of classical memory B-cells. This effect was most clearly seen when direct contact between B-cells and parasites was allowed.

The use of humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) may represent a potential treatment strategy. We analyzed the effects of compassionate use of Tocilizumab and Sarilumab on clinical outcome of patients affected by ARDS due COVID-19. METHODS This single-center, observational, exploratory study was performed during the acute phase of COVID-19 outbreak, between March 7th and April 21st, 2020 in a University Hospital in Rome, Italy. All consecutive adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and fulfilling ARDS criteria were enrolled. Patients who were treated with anti-IL-6R therapy were compared to those who were not, as per clinical decision. Inverse probability weights were applied to weight individual's contribution to survival curves and in the multivariate regression model. RESULTS Among 105 ARDS patients, 65 received compassionate treatment with anti-IL-6R therapy [43 (66%) Tocilizumab and 22 (34%) Sarilumab, respectively], with oxygenation improvement. In the multivariable Cox proportional regression hazards model with propensity score inverse probability weighting, patients who received anti-IL-6R treatment had lower risk of death compared to those who did not, with a hazard ration of 0.34 [95% confidence interval 0.17-0.74], p=0.001.

Most current microfluidic diagnostic devices are designed to target a single disease, such as a given cancer or a variety of pathogens, and there will likely be a large market for these focused devices; however, the future of molecular diagnostics lies in highly multiplexed microfluidic devices that can screen for potentially hundreds of diseases simultaneously.","output":"Applications of Microfluidics for Molecular Diagnostics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Melphalan flufenamide (melflufen), an alkylating peptide-drug conjugate, plus dexamethasone showed clinical activity and manageable safety in the phase 2 HORIZON study. We aimed to determine whether melflufen plus dexamethasone would provide a progression-free survival benefit compared with pomalidomide plus dexamethasone in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. METHODS In this randomised, open-label, head-to-head, phase 3 study (OCEAN), adult patients (aged 18 years) were recruited from 108 university hospitals, specialist hospitals, and community-based centres in 21 countries across Europe, North America, and Asia. Eligible patients had an ECOG performance status of 0-2; must have had relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, refractory to lenalidomide (within 18 months of randomisation) and to the last line of therapy; and have received two to four previous lines of therapy (including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by age, number of previous lines of therapy, and International Staging System score, to either 28-day cycles of melflufen and dexamethasone (melflufen group) or pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pomalidomide group). All patients received dexamethasone 40 mg orally on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle. In the melflufen group, patients received melflufen 40 mg intravenously over 30 min on day 1 of each cycle and in the pomalidomide group, patients received pomalidomide 4 mg orally daily on days 1 to 21 of each cycle. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by an independent review committee in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03151811, and is ongoing. FINDINGS Between June 12, 2017, and Sept 3, 2020, 246 patients were randomly assigned to the melflufen group (median age 68 years [IQR 60-72]; 107 [43%] were female) and 249 to the pomalidomide group (median age 68 years [IQR 61-72]; 109 [44%] were female). 474 patients received at least one dose of study drug (melflufen group n=228; pomalidomide group n=246; safety population). Data cutoff was Feb 3, 2021. Median progression-free survival was 68 months (95% CI 50-85; 165 [67%] of 246 patients had an event) in the melflufen group and 49 months (42-57; 190 [76%] of 249 patients had an event) in the pomalidomide group (hazard ratio [HR] 079, [95% CI 064-098]; p=0032), at a median follow-up of 155 months (IQR 94-228) in the melflufen group and 163 months (101-232) in the pomalidomide group. Median overall survival was 198 months (95% CI 151-256) at a median follow-up of 198 months (IQR 120-250) in the melflufen group and 250 months (95% CI 181-319) in the pomalidomide group at a median follow-up of 186 months (IQR 118-237; HR 110 [95% CI 085-144]; p=047). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were thrombocytopenia (143 [63%] of 228 in the melflufen group vs 26 [11%] of 246 in the pomalidomide group), neutropenia (123 [54%] vs 102 [41%]), and anaemia (97 [43%] vs 44 [18%]). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 95 (42%) patients in the melflufen group and 113 (46%) in the pomalidomide group, the most common of which were pneumonia (13 [6%] vs 21 [9%]), COVID-19 pneumonia (11 [5%] vs nine [4%]), and thrombocytopenia (nine [4%] vs three [1%]). 27 [12%] patients in the melflufen group and 32 [13%] in the pomalidomide group had fatal treatment-emergent adverse events. Fatal treatment-emergent adverse events were considered possibly treatment related in two patients in the melflufen group (one with acute myeloid leukaemia, one with pancytopenia and acute cardiac failure) and four patients in the pomalidomide group (two patients with pneumonia, one with myelodysplastic syndromes, one with COVID-19 pneumonia). INTERPRETATION Melflufen plus dexamethasone showed superior progression-free survival than pomalidomide plus dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Measurement of the magnitude of eye recession, duration of skin tenting in the lateral neck region, and urine specific gravity by refractometry provide the best estimates of hydration status in calves and cattle. Intravenous and oral electrolyte solutions (OES) are frequently administered to critically ill calves and adult cattle. Application of physicochemical principles indicates that 0.9% NaCl, Ringer's solution, and 5% dextrose are equally acidifying, lactated Ringer's and acetated Ringer's solution are neutral to mildly acidifying, and 1.3C1.4% sodium bicarbonate solutions are strongly alkalinizing in cattle. Four different crystalloid solutions are recommended for intravenous fluid therapy in dehydrated or septic calves and dehydrated adult cattle: (1) lactated Ringer's solution and acetated Ringer's solution for dehydrated calves, although neither solution is optimized for administration to neonatal calves or adult cattle; (2) isotonic (1.3%) or hypertonic (5.0 or 8.4%) solutions of sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of calves with diarrhea and severe strong ion (metabolic) acidosis and hyponatremia, and adult cattle with acute ruminal acidosis; (3) Ringer's solution for the treatment of metabolic alkalosis in dehydrated adult cattle, particularly lactating dairy cattle; and (4) hypertonic NaCl solutions (7.2%) and an oral electrolyte solution or water load for the rapid resuscitation of dehydrated neonatal calves and adult cattle. Much progress has been made since the 1970's in identifying important attributes of an OES for diarrheic calves. Important components of an OES for neonatal calves are osmolality, sodium concentration, the effective SID that reflects the concentration of alkalinizing agents, and the energy content. The last three factors are intimately tied to the OES osmolality and the abomasal emptying rate, and therefore the rate of sodium delivery to the small intestine and ultimately the rate of resuscitation. An important need in fluid and electrolyte therapy for adult ruminants is formulation of a practical, effective, and inexpensive OES.","output":"Intravenous and Oral Fluid Therapy in Neonatal Calves With Diarrhea or Sepsis and in Adult Cattle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As nationalist ideologies intensify in Australia, so do the experiences of everyday racism and exclusion for Black African immigrants.

The tropes and discourses that render the bodies of Black African migrants simultaneously invisible and hyper-visible indicate that immigration is not only a movement of bodies, but also a phenomenon solidly tied to global inequality, power, and the abjection of blackness. Drawing on critical race perspectives and theories of belonging, we highlight through use of literature how Black Africans in Australia are constructed as perpetual strangers.

However, the pathogenic mechanism of the diseases linked to TDP-43 is largely unknown. We hypothesized that the failure of mRNA transport to neuronal axons by TDP-43 may contribute to neurodegeneration in ALS and FTLD, and sought to examine the function of TDP-43 by identifying its target mRNA for axonal transport. We found that mRNAs related to translational function including ribosomal proteins (RPs) were decreased by shRNA-based TDP-43 knock-down in neurites of cortical neurons. TDP-43 binds to and transports the RP mRNAs through their 5' untranslated region, which contains a common 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tract motif and a downstream GC-rich region. We showed by employing in vitro and in vivo models that the RP mRNAs were translated and incorporated into native ribosomes locally in axons to maintain functionality of axonal ribosomes, which is required for local protein synthesis in response to stimulation and stress to axons. We also found that RP mRNAs were reduced in the pyramidal tract of sporadic ALS cases harboring TDP-43 pathology. Our results elucidated a novel function of TDP-43 to control transport of RP mRNAs and local translation by ribosomes to maintain morphological integrity of neuronal axons, and proved the influence of this function of TDP-43 on neurodegeneration in ALS and FTLD associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy.","output":"TDP-43 transports ribosomal protein mRNA to regulate axonal local translation in neuronal axons."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mok and colleagues from Australia, Armenia, and Saudi Arabia provide an update on selected internationally oriented guidance documents and relevant literature at the application level that are associated with the implementation of the process evaluation and improvement stage of ISO 15189:2012 Siddique and colleagues from the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia tested drugs that are clinically used for CNS disorders (phenobarbitone, phenytoin, and levetiracetam) in their available formulation and following conjugation with silver nanoparticles against Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Wilson and colleagues looked at the implementation of a targeted next generation sequencing panel (AmpliSeq for Illumina Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 consisting of 207 amplicons representing the covered hotspot regions of 50 oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes) at the Wellington Regional Genetics Laboratory and compared results to those previously reported externally","output":"In this issue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As long as critical levels of vaccination have not been reached to ensure heard immunity, and new SARS-CoV-2 strains are developing, the only realistic way to reduce the infection speed in a population is to track the infected individuals before they pass on the virus.

Sampling can be implemented at different times during the epidemic and may be done either per individual or for combined groups of people at a time. The work we present here makes two main contributions. We first extend and refine our scalable agent-based COVID-19 simulator to incorporate an improved socio-demographic model which considers professions, as well as a more realistic population mixing model based on contact matrices per country. These extensions are necessary to develop and test various sampling strategies in a scenario including the 62 largest cities in Spain; this is our second contribution. As part of the evaluation, we also analyze the impact of different parameters, such as testing frequency, quarantine time, percentage of quarantine breakers, or group testing, on sampling efficacy. Our results show that the most effective strategies are pooling, rapid antigen test campaigns, and requiring negative testing for access to public areas.

However, both sample types need to be collected by trained professionals. Using self-collected buccal swabs as an alternative could simplify and accelerate diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: To assess self-collected buccal swab samples as an alternative method for SARS-CoV-2 detection in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Buccal swab samples were self-collected by 73 patients with COVID-19. Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen kits. RNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Env protein and human RNase P as an internal control was amplified using the TRUPCR? SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kit version 2.1 and a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time Detection System. RESULT: The sensitivity of RT-qPCR from buccal swabs was 58.9% (43/73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 46.77%-70.27%) and that of RT-qPCR from saliva was 62.90% (39/62; 95% CI 49.69%-74.84%) taking positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swabs as the gold standard.

In this study, changes in the concentrations of the six criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) in Wuhan were investigated before (January 1 to 23, 2020), during (January 24 to April 5, 2020), and after the COVID-19 lockdown (April 6 to June 20, 2020) periods. Also, the relationships between the air pollutants and meteorological variables during the three periods were investigated. The results showed that there was significant improvement in air quality during the lockdown. Compared to the pre-lockdown period, the concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, PM10, and CO decreased by 50.6, 41.2, 33.1, and 16.6%, respectively, while O3 increased by 149% during the lockdown. After the lockdown, the concentrations of PM2.5, CO and SO2 declined by an additional 19.6, 15.6, and 2.1%, respectively. However, NO2, O3, and PM10 increased by 55.5, 25.3, and 5.9%, respectively, compared to the lockdown period. Except for CO and SO2, WS had negative correlations with the other pollutants during the three periods. RH was inversely related with all pollutants. Positive correlations were observed between temperature and the pollutants during the lockdown. Easterly winds were associated with peak PM2.5 concentrations prior to the lockdown. The highest PM2.5 concentrations were associated with southwesterly wind during the lockdown, and northwesterly winds coincided with the peak PM2.5 concentrations after the lockdown. Although, COVID-19 pandemic had numerous negative effects on human health and the global economy, the reductions in air pollution and significant improvement in ambient air quality likely had substantial short-term health benefits. This study improves the understanding of the mechanisms that lead to air pollution under diverse meteorological conditions and suggest effective ways of reducing air pollution in Wuhan.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan: Ambient air quality and the relationships between criteria air pollutants and meteorological variables before, during, and after lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF) is associated with high mortality. However, few studies have so far reviewed analyses of autopsy findings in patients with AE-IPF. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 52 consecutive patients with AE-IPF who underwent autopsies at five university hospitals and one municipal hospital between 1999 and 2013. The following variables were abstracted from the medical records: demographic and clinical data, autopsy findings and complications during the clinical course until death. RESULTS: The median age at autopsy was 71 years (range 47C86 years), and the subjects included 38 (73.1%) males. High-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated in 45 (86.5%) patients after AE-IPF. The underling fibrotic lesion was classified as having the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern in all cases. Furthermore, 41 (78.8%) patients had diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), 15 (28.8%) exhibited pulmonary hemorrhage, nine (17.3%) developed pulmonary thromboembolism and six (11.5%) were diagnosed with lung carcinoma. In addition, six (11.5%) patients developed pneumothorax prior to death and 26 (53.1%) developed diabetes that required insulin treatment after the administration of high-dose corticosteroid therapy. In addition, 15 (28.8%) patients presented with bronchopneumonia during their clinical course and/or until death, including fungal (seven, 13.5%), cytomegalovirus (six, 11.5%) and bacterial (five, 9.6%) infections. CONCLUSIONS: The pathological findings in patients with AE-IPF represent not only DAD, but also a variety of pathological conditions.

The positivity and boundedness of the model solution are derived. For the dynamics of the tuberculosis model, we find the equilibrium points and the basic reproduction number. The proposed model is locally and globally stable at disease-free equilibrium, if the reproduction number ?0<1. Furthermore, to examine the behavior of the various parameters and different values of fractional-order derivative graphically, the most common iterative scheme based on fundamental theorem and Lagrange interpolation polynomial is implemented. From the numerical result, it is observed that the contact rate and treatment rate have a great impact on curtailing the tuberculosis disease. Furthermore, proper treatment is a key factor in reducing the TB transmission and prevalence. Also, the results are more precise for lower fractional order.

Methods A retrospective study on complete (diagnosed two weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer/Moderna/AstraZeneca or first dose of the Janssen vaccine was administered) or partial vaccine scheme (CV or PV) patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between December 27, 2020, and October 17, 2021, was conducted. The main outcomes were all-cause mortality and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The baseline factors associated with the outcomes were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, estimating the odds ratios (OR; 95% CI). Results One hundred and forty-five patients (101 CV) were included. The CV subgroup was mainly composed of elderly males with high comorbidity (Charlson index 3, 72%; immunosuppression, 20%), with bilateral pneumonia in 63.4%; limited therapeutic effort (LTE) was agreed upon for 28% of the patients. In the CV subgroup, endotracheal intubation was required in 10.9%, reaching 15.3% when excluding LTE patients; the global mortality was 22.8% and 41.4% in the subgroup with LTE. Although the PV patients were younger and had fewer comorbidities, the main outcomes did not differ significantly between the CV and PV groups. The predictors of poor outcomes were age  65 years, confusion, ferritin > 500 mg/L, extensive lung infiltrates, and a Charlson index  3.

To take advantage of this new market, major content producers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have emerged, focusing on video streaming services. However, despite the large number and diversity of videos made available by these content providers, few of them attract the attention of most users. For example, in the data explored in this article, only 6% of the most popular videos account for 85% of total views. Finding out in advance which videos will be popular is not trivial, especially given many influencing variables. Nevertheless, a tool with this ability would be of great value to help dimension network infrastructure and properly recommend new content to users. In this way, this manuscript examines the machine learning-based approaches that have been proposed to solve the prediction of web content popularity. To this end, we first survey the literature and elaborate a taxonomy that classifies models according to predictive features and describes state-of-the-art features and techniques used to solve this task. While analyzing previous works, we saw an opportunity to use textual features for video prediction. Thus, additionally, we propose a case study that combines features acquired through attribute engineering and word embedding to predict the popularity of a video. The first approach is based on predictive attributes defined by resource engineering. The second takes advantage of word embeddings from video descriptions and titles. We experimented with the proposed techniques in a set of videos from GloboPlay, the largest provider of video streaming services in Latin America.

Due to better accessibility and usage flexibility, newly emergent dockless sharing bikes have become quite popular and are reviving the fashion of cycling in cities. Urban congestion is simultaneously influenced by heterogeneous saptio-temporal travel demands, topology and spatial characteristics of road networks, and the interplay between travel modes. In this paper, by considering aforementioned factors, we discover a robust sublinear scaling relation between the level of congestion for vehicles and the detour ratio weighted by biking traffic, which is intriguing given the fact that congestion and detour ratio is linearly independent. Such a scaling relation implies a strong interplay between vehicle traffic and cycling activities and can be applied in predictions for congestion or aggregated to more sophisticated traffic models. In addition, biking-traffic-weighted detour ratio can be applied to detect inefficient routes, which would help alleviate urban congestion, make better urban planning, and improve transportation efficiency and equity in cities.","output":"Understanding urban congestion with biking traffic and routing detour ratio"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most pathogens threatening to cause extinction of a host species are maintained on one or more reservoir hosts, in addition to the species that is threatened by disease. Further, most conventional host-pathogen theory assumes that transmission is related to host density, and therefore a pathogen should become extinct before its sole host. Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease is a recently emerged infectious cancer that has led to massive population declines and grave concerns for the future persistence of this largest surviving marsupial carnivore. Here we report the results of mark-recapture studies at six sites and use these data to estimate epidemiological parameters critical to both accurately assessing the risk of extinction from this disease and effectively managing this disease threat. Three sites were monitored from before or close to the time of disease arrival, and at three others disease was well established when trapping began, in one site for at least 10 years. We found no evidence for sex-specific differences in disease prevalence and little evidence of consistent seasonal variation in the force of infection. At all sites, the disease was maintained at high levels of prevalence (>50% in 2-3-year-old animals), despite causing major population declines. We also provide the first estimates of the basic reproductive rate R0 for this disease. Using a simple age-structured deterministic model, we show that our results are not consistent with transmission being proportional to the density of infected hosts but are consistent with frequency-dependent transmission. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that local disease prevalence in 2-3-year-olds still exceeds 50% at a site where population density has been reduced by up to 90% in the past 12 years. These findings lend considerable weight to concerns that this host-specific pathogen will cause the extinction of the Tasmanian devil.

These events involve structural rearrangements, including heteromerization between two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) to form a trimer of dimers as a six-helix bundle (6-HB), a quaternary protein structure that brings two distant clusters of hydrophobic sequences into the proximity of each other, the internal fusion peptide (IFP) preceding HR1, and the highly conserved tryptophan (Trp)-rich membrane proximal external region (MPER) following HR2. Here, we show that MPER can undergo self-oligomerization and heteromerization with IFP, events that are Trp-dependent. To delineate the roles of Trp residues of MPER in forming these quaternary structures and interacting with membranes, we employed a panel of synthetic peptides: MPER peptide (M-wt) and its alanine (Ala) and phenylalanine (Phe) analogues. Ala substitutions of Trp inhibited its association with cellular membranes. Chemical cross-linking experiments showed that M-wt can self-interact to form oligomers and cross-interact with IFP23, a synthetic IFP peptide, to form a heterohexamer. In comparison, little high-order oligomer was formed between M-wt and fusion peptide. The specific interaction between M-wt and IFP23 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining experiments. In aqueous solutions, both M-wt and IFP23 displayed random secondary structures that became helical in hydrophobic solvents. Triple-Ala substitutions of Trp in M-wt, but not the corresponding triple-Phe analogue, disrupted oligomerization of M-wt and hetero-oligomerization of M-wt with IFP23. Overall, our results show that Trp residues of MPER play a key role in maintaining the structure and functions of MPER, allowing it to interact with IFP to form a MPER-IFP heteromer, a putative quaternary structure extending from the 6-HB, and function in membrane fusion. Finally, we showed that a MPER peptide could serve as an inhibitor in the entry process.","output":"Tryptophan-dependent membrane interaction and heteromerization with the internal fusion peptide by the membrane proximal external region of SARS-CoV spike protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, forcing them to abruptly shift from face-to-face to online teaching and learning. This case study illustrates how a traditional lecture-based activity for undergraduate students in a Management of Health Service Organizations program was transformed into an argumentation-based learning activity using the technique of digital concept mapping and was deployed in an online format during the COVID-19 lockdown. Design/methodology/approach: The students were tasked with solving an ill-structured problem bearing significance for their future professional lives and connected to the contents of their course (entitled Assimilation of service quality in health systems). The activity was composed of two phases. In Phase 1, participants were asked to provide five arguments to establish their proposed solution to the problem by using a concept map on a digital platform (Mindomo). In Phase 2, they were asked to substantiate their arguments. Reflective journals were used to ascertain how the participants viewed the activity. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data by searching for themes demonstrating different epistemological positions. Findings: Six themes were inductively derived from the students' reflections: (1) transitioning from passive to active learning;(2) generating epistemic change;(3) social perspective-taking;(4) domain-based knowledge;(5) prior knowledge and experience;and (6) online collaboration with other students. Episodes, thoughts and feelings expressed by the students were reported so as to increase the reliability of the recurrent and common themes. Originality/value: This study mainly shows that combining constructivist teaching and learning tools with advanced technology in an online course enables the development of lifelong learning capabilities among students in the health management professions. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Online argumentation-based learning aided by digital concept mapping during COVID-19: implications for health management teaching and learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ribosomes can be programmed to shift from one reading frame to another during translation. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) uses such a mechanism to produce F protein from the -2/+1 reading frame. We now report that the HCV frameshift signal can mediate the synthesis of the core protein of the zero frame, the F protein of the -2/+1 frame, and a 1.5-kDa protein of the -1/+2 frame. This triple decoding function does not require sequences flanking the frameshift signal and is apparently independent of membranes and the synthesis of the HCV polyprotein. Two consensus -1 frameshift sequences in the HCV type 1 frameshift signal facilitate ribosomal frameshifts into both overlapping reading frames. A sequence which is located immediately downstream of the frameshift signal and has the potential to form a double stem-loop structure can significantly enhance translational frameshifting in the presence of the peptidyl-transferase inhibitor puromycin.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, including their components and technological platforms used in other vaccines during pregnancy. We searched literature databases from inception to September 2021 without language restriction, COVID-19 vaccine pregnancy websites, and reference lists of systematic reviews and the included studies. Pairs of reviewers independently selected studies through COVIDENCE and performed the data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The study is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021234185). Findings: We retrieved 8,837 records from the search strategy;71 studies (61 clinical and 10 non-clinical studies, involving 17,719,495 pregnant persons and 389 pregnant animals, respectively) were included. Most studies (94%) were conducted in high-income countries and were cohort studies (51%). Less than 15% of studies were classified as high risk of bias. We identified nine COVID-19 vaccine studies, two preclinical studies, and seven involving 309,164 pregnant persons, mostly exposed to mRNA vaccines. Among non-COVID-19 vaccines, the most frequent exposures were to the AS03 adjuvant (23 studies) and aluminum-based adjuvants (31 clinical and five preclinical studies).A meta-analysis of the studies that adjusted for potential confounders and compared exposure to maternal COVID-19 vaccines or adjuvanted non-COVID-19 vaccines with no exposure showed no association with adverse outcomes, regardless of the vaccine or the trimester of vaccination. Proportional meta-analyses of uncontrolled studies or arms assessing pregnancy and safety outcomes of COVID-19 vaccines or adjuvanted non-COVID-19 vaccines (with AS03 or aluminum) estimated the ranges for each of the following outcomes: hypertensive disorders 237-398%;antenatal bleeding 037-044%;gestational diabetes mellitus 263-774%;spontaneous abortion/miscarriage 497-1198%;stillbirth 006-020%;fetal death 082-136%;fetal growth restriction 049-089%;preterm birth 552-561%;low birth weight 373-684%;small for gestational age 684-1198%;congenital malformations 232-497%;neonatal infections 324-723%;neonatal encephalopathy 023%;newborn respiratory distress syndrome 123-182%;and neonatal death 007-043%. Medically attended adverse events (339%) and serious adverse events (1231%) were only available for aluminum-based adjuvant exposure. Neither pregnancy outcomes nor reactogenicity exceeded the expected rates. The only exception was postpartum hemorrhage after COVID-19 vaccination (1040%;95% CI: 649-1510%), reported by two studies;however, the comparison with non-exposed pregnant persons in one study found non-statistically significant differences (adjusted OR 109;CI 95% 056 to 212). Interpretation: We found no safety concerns for currently administered COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy. Further experimental and real-world evidence should expand these findings that reinforce current recommendations about vaccinating pregnant persons with approved COVID-19 vaccines.

We hypothesized that the nature of penetrating injury differs significantly by gender and that these injuries in women are associated with important psychosocial and environmental factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS A level 1 urban trauma center registry was queried for all patients with penetrating injuries from 2002-2010. Patient and injury variables (demographics and mechanism of injury) were abstracted and compared between genders; additional social and psychiatric histories and perpetrator information were collected from the records of admitted female patients. RESULTS Injured women were more likely to be Caucasian, suffer stab wounds instead of gunshot wounds, and present with a higher blood alcohol level than men. Compared with women with gunshot wounds, those with stab wounds were three times more likely to report a psychiatric or intimate partner violence history. Women with self-inflicted injuries had a significantly greater incidence of prior penetrating injury and psychiatric and criminal history. Male perpetrators outnumbered female perpetrators; patients frequently not only knew their perpetrator but also were their intimate partners. Intimate partner violence and random cross-fire incidents each accounted for about a quarter of injuries observed. CONCLUSIONS Penetrating injuries in women represent a nonnegligible subset of injuries seen in urban trauma centers. Psychiatric and social risk factors for violence play important roles in these cases, particularly when self-infliction is suspected. Resources allocated for urban violence prevention should proportionately reflect the particular patterns of violence observed in injured women.","output":"Penetrating trauma in urban women: patterns of injury and violence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pro-apoptotic BAK and BAX are activated by BH3-only proteins to permeabilise the outer mitochondrial membrane.

METHODS All patients treated with EVT (intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT), mechanical thrombectomy (MT) or both, or an attempt at intervention) for acute stroke at UHNS, Stoke-on-Trent, UK, were entered into a prospective register. Baseline demographic and clinical data, the National Institutes for Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), imaging results including Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score, and complications were recorded. Mortality, and modified Rankin score (mRS) were assessed at 90 days. RESULTS From December 2009 to January 2013 106 patients (mean age 64 years, median baseline NIHSS 18) were treated with EVT (thrombectomy  IAT 83%, IAT alone 13%, neither 4%). Seventy-eight per cent of occlusions were in the anterior circulation. Intravenous bridging thrombolysis was performed in 81%. Revascularization was successful (TICI 2b/3) in 84%. The median time from stroke onset to the end of the procedure was 6 h 03 min. A good outcome (mRS  2) at 90 days was achieved in 48% with a mortality of 15%. Fatal or nonfatal symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) within 10 days occurred in 9%. The median length of stay was 14 days (31% discharged home  7 days).

Abstract The Covid-19 pandemic is profoundly changing the organization of healthcare access. This is particularly so for peritoneal neoplastic diseases, for which curative treatment mobilizes substantial personnel, operating room and intensive care resources. The BIG-RENAPE and RENAPE groups have made tentative proposals for prioritizing care provision. A tightening of the usual selection criteria is needed for curative care: young patients with few or no comorbidities and limited peritoneal extension. It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions for which cytoreduction surgery with or without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the gold-standard treatment, and for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be a temporary or long-term alternative: pseudomyxoma peritonei, resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas, peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin if they are resectable and unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after up to 12 courses, first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable or in interval surgery after at most six courses of systemic chemotherapy. Addition of HIPEC must be discussed case by case in an expert center. The prioritization of indications must consider local conditions and the phase of the epidemic to allow optimal peri-operative care.","output":"Prise en charge des tumeurs primitives et mtastatiques du pritoine en priode de pandmie CoViD-19 Pistes de rflexion et de priorisation du groupe RENAPE et BIG-RENAPE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Despite the implementation of many preventive and control systems developed by governments, the spread of COVID-19 and its resulting infection rate are alarmingly increasing from time to time all over the world. In Ethiopia, public places visited by large numbers of people where preventive and control measures are poorly practiced are considered to be potentially contributing to the spread of the disease. Food and drink establishments are among the highly susceptible public establishments visited by large numbers of people who interact among themselves and with employees. Hence, this study aimed to measure the compliance with COVID-19 preventive and control measures among food and drink establishments in the selected towns of Bench-Sheko and West-Omo Zones in Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among food and drink establishments in selected towns of Bench-Sheko and West-Omo zones from May 15, 2020 to June 15, 2020. A census of all 324 food and drink establishments found in the study area was conducted, and data were obtained from managers of the establishments through face-to-face interviews. Data were entered in to Epidata manager and exported to SPSS version 24.0 for analysis. Percentage compliance score was computed to describe the level of compliance. Ethical approval was obtained from Mizan-Tepi University Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from every participant. RESULTS: The overall compliance level with COVID-19 preventive and control measures was 55.5%. The majority (89%) of the food and drink establishments had functional hand washing facilities at the main entrance gate. Less than half of the food and drink establishments had posted written materials promoting hand washing, arranged tables and chairs in a manner that they accommodate not more than four people at once and at least 2 meters apart, carry out daily cleaning and disinfection of frequented touched surfaces, and provided education or training for their workers about COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The overall compliance level with COVID-19 preventive and control measures among food and drink establishments was very poor. Thus, it is highly recommended that the federal government of Ethiopia, the federal ministry of health, and local health authorities consider a move towards more solid, strict, and comprehensive compulsory measures, including fines that can lead up to the closure of non-compliant establishments.","output":"Compliance with COVID-19 Preventive and Control Measures among Food and Drink Establishments in Bench-Sheko and West-Omo Zones, Ethiopia, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although numerous studies have reported the protective effect of nut consumption on cardiovascular risk, evidence for the role of peanuts in maintaining cardiometabolic health is inconclusive. Presented here are the results from the ARISTOTLE study, a parallel randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of regular peanut intake on anthropometric, biochemical, and clinical measurements. The 63 healthy subjects that completed the study consumed their habitual diet plus either: a) 25 g/day of skin roasted peanuts (SRP, n = 21), b) two tablespoons (32 g)/day of peanut butter (PB, n = 23) or c) two tablespoons (32 g)/day of a control butter based on peanut oil (CB, n = 19) for 6 months. In addition, a meta-analysis of clinical trials, including data from the ARISTOTLE study, was carried out to update the evidence for the effects of consuming peanuts, including high-oleic peanuts, and peanut butter on healthy subjects and those at high cardiometabolic risk. After a systematic search on PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Scopus databases up to July 2021, 11 studies were found to meet the eligibility criteria. In the ARISTOTLE study, lower total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratios were found in the SRP group compared to the CB group (p = 0.019 and p = 0.008). The meta-analysis of clinical trials revealed that peanut consumption is associated with a decrease in triglycerides (MD: ?0.13; 95% CI, ?0.20 to ?0.07; p < 0.0001) and that healthy consumers had lower total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratios compared to the control groups (MD: ?0.40; 95% CI, ?0.71 to ?0.09; p = 0.01 and MD: ?0.19; 95% CI, ?0.36 to ?0.01; p = 0.03, respectively). However, individuals at high cardiometabolic risk experienced an increase in body weight after the peanut interventions (MD: 0.97; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.41; p < 0.0001), although not in body fat or body mass index. According to the dose-response analyses, body weight increased slightly with higher doses of peanuts.

Urgent clinical review is recommended at NEWS2 5. This policy is recognised as requiring ongoing evaluation. We assessed NEWS2 acquisition, alerting at key thresholds and patient outcomes, to understand how response recommendations would affect clinical resource allocation. SETTING Adult acute hospital in England. DESIGN Retrospective observational cohort study. PARTICIPANTS 100 362 consecutive admissions between November 2018 and July 2019. OUTCOME Death or admission to intensive care unit within 24 hours of a score. METHODS NEWS2 were assembled as single scores from consecutive 24-hour time frames, (the first NEWS2 termed 'Index-NEWS2'), or as all scores from the admission (termed All-NEWS2). Scores were excluded when a patient was in intensive care, in the presence of a decision not to attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or on day 1 of elective admission. RESULTS A mean of 4.5 NEWS2 were acquired per patient per day. The outcome rate following an Index-NEWS2 was 0.22/100 patient-days. The sensitivity of outcome prediction at Index-NEWS2 5=0.46, and number needed to evaluate (NNE)=52. At this threshold, a mean of 37.6 alerts/100 patient-days would be generated, occurring in 12.3% of patients on any single day. Threshold changes to increase sensitivity by 0.1, would result in a twofold increase in alert rate and 1.5-fold increase in NNE. Overall, NEWS2 classification performance was significantly worse on Index-scores than All-scores (c-statistic=0.78 vs 0.85; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The combination of low event-rate, high alert-rate and low sensitivity, in patients for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, means that at current NEWS2 thresholds, resource demand would be sufficient to meaningfully compete with other pathways to clinical evaluation. In analyses that epitomise in-patient screening, NEWS2 performance suggests a need for re-evaluation of current response recommendations in this population.","output":"Evaluation of NEWS2 response thresholds in a retrospective observational study from a UK acute hospital."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by an RNA virus prone to mutations.

The model is theoretically analyzed and sufficient conditions for the stability of its equilibria are derived. In addition to the disease-free and endemic equilibria, the model also has single-strain 1 and strain 2 endemic equilibria.

Early warning in the travel origins is crucial to prevent the disease from spreading. However, many travel origins have delays in reporting the disease outbreak. Under this circumstance, those exported cases (travelers tested positive outside their travel origins) became valuable data for detecting the disease outbreaks. Methods: We estimated some key indicators (the exponential growth rate, the doubling time, and the basic reproduction number) using the exported cases in the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic of four travel origins, Wuhan (China), U.S., Italy, and Iran. We compared the estimates from the exported cases to the ones from domestic data, and quantitatively evaluated how different features in the exported cases influenced the estimation. We used hypothesis testing to determine if an indicator has exceeded a certain threshold.Findings: We found that the dates that the exported cases rang an alarm about the disease outbreak were all before or shortly after some emergency measures were taken in the travel origins. If the assumed epidemic start date was relatively accurate and the traveler samples were representative of the general population, the indicators estimated from the exported cases were consistent with the domestic data. We provided the minimum number of exported cases to determine whether the epidemic growth rate was above a certain level. Flexible scenarios were provided in a Shiny App. Interpretation: Rapid detection of a disease outbreak is crucial for government intervention and raising public awareness.

Thus the drug has markedly altered the subcellular distribution of the glycoproteins so that they accumulate in the internal smooth membranes but are virtually absent in the plasma membrane. These glycoproteins that accumulated in intracellular membranes have a cytoplasmic domain susceptible to protease digestion and thus are transmembranous. Under such conditions, the behavior of M protein, which plays a crucial role in virus assembly (Y. Nagai et al., 1976, Virology 69, 523C538), has been analyzed. It has been found that the M protein can neither associate with the internal membranes nor bind to the plasma membrane. Thus no virus budding has been observed, either at the plasma membranes or at internal membranes. These results substantiate the view that the interaction between M and glycoproteins is of great importance for virus assembly and suggest further that this interaction is possible only when the glycoproteins have been incorporated into the plasma membrane.","output":"Inhibition of the assembly of Newcastle disease virus by monensin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increased utilization of metrology resources and expanded application of its approaches in the development of internationally agreed upon measurements can lay the basis for regulatory harmonization, support reproducible research, and advance scientific understanding, especially of dietary supplements and herbal medicines.

The AirAnswers(R) device uses electro-kinetic flow to sample air at high rates and capture bio-aerosols on grounded electrodes in assayable form. Cartridges were removed from the devices and immediately conveyed to the Inspirotec facility in North Chicago, where assays were performed. Biomarkers determined were for allergens and molds previously described for this system. Testing for a new marker, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was also included. The method was validated by determination of capture efficiency with reference to an impinger sampler in a Class III controlled environment chamber. Average capture efficiency for triplicate runs was 14%. One SARS-CoV-2 positive sample as found at the registration area, which was physically separate from the main exhibit area. Cat allergen Fel d 1was found in four of the locations, dog allergen Can f 1 at two. The airborne biomarker of mold proliferation, (1[->]3)-{beta}-D-Glucan, was above the assay range in all locations.

Mathematical models that represented how contact tracing and follow-up may control Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) transmissions were developed for evaluating different infection control interventions, estimating likely number of infections as well as facilitating understanding of their likely epidemiology. We reviewed mathematical models for contact tracing and follow-up control measures of SARS and MERS transmission. Model characteristics, epidemiological parameters and intervention parameters used in the mathematical models from seven studies were summarized. A major concern identified in future epidemics is whether public health administrators can collect all the required data for building epidemiological models in a short period of time during the early phase of an outbreak. Also, currently available models do not explicitly model constrained resources. We urge for closed-loop communication between public health administrators and modelling researchers to come up with guidelines to delineate the collection of the required data in the midst of an outbreak and the inclusion of additional logistical details in future similar models.","output":"Epidemic Models of Contact Tracing: Systematic Review of Transmission Studies of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aims Retrospective studies have shown that angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are associated with a reduced risk of complications and mortality in persons with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, we aimed to examine the efficacy of ramipril, an ACE-inhibitor, in preventing ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and/or mortality while also minimizing the risk of transmission and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Methods RAMIC is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, allocation-concealed, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy of treatment with ramipril 2.5 mg orally daily compared to placebo for 14 days. The study population includes adult patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to a hospital or assessed in an emergency department or ambulatory clinic. Key exclusion criteria include ICU admission or need for mechanical ventilation at screening, use of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor-II blocker within 7 days, glomerular filtration rate < 40 mL/min or a systolic blood pressure (BP) < 100 mmHg or diastolic BP < 65 mmHg. Patients are randomized 2:1 to receive ramipril (2.5 mg) or placebo daily. Informed consent and study visits occur virtually to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and preserve PPE. The primary composite endpoint of ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation and death are adjudicated virtually. Conclusions RAMIC is designed to assess the efficacy of treatment with ramipril for 14 days to decrease ICU admission, mechanical ventilator use and mortality in patients with COVID-19 and leverages virtual study visits and endpoint adjudication to mitigate risk of infection and to preserve PPE (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04366050).","output":"RAMIC: Design of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of ramipril in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As chloroquine (CHQ) is part of the Dutch Centre for Infectious Disease Control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) experimental treatment guideline, pediatric dosing guidelines are needed.

METHODS: Overall, 690 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited between 1 January and 18 March 2020 from hospitals in Honghu and Nanchang; finally, 442 patients were assessed. Data were categorised into the training and test sets to develop and validate the model, respectively. FINDINGS: A predictive HNC-LL (Hypertension, Neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, Lymphocyte count, Lactate dehydrogenase) score was established using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The HNC-LL score accurately predicted disease severity in the Honghu training cohort (area under the curve [AUC]=0.861, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.800C0.922; P<0.001); Honghu internal validation cohort (AUC=0.871, 95% CI: 0.769C0.972; P<0.001); and Nanchang external validation cohort (AUC=0.826, 95% CI: 0.746C0.907; P<0.001) and outperformed other models, including CURB-65 (confusion, uraemia, respiratory rate, BP, age 65 years) score model, MuLBSTA (multilobular infiltration, hypo-lymphocytosis, bacterial coinfection, smoking history, hypertension, and age) score model, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio model. The clinical significance of HNC-LL in accurately predicting the risk of future development of severe COVID-19 was confirmed. INTERPRETATION: We developed an accurate tool for predicting disease severity among COVID-19 patients. This model can potentially be used to identify patients at risks of developing severe disease in the early stage and therefore guide treatment decisions.

The aetiology of the disease has been reported to be multifactorial and both sporadic cases and nosocomial outbreaks have occurred. In this report, we review 17 epidemics of NEC reported in the literature between 1973 and 1999. The number of confirmed cases ranged from 1 to 32 with an average of 10.5 confirmed cases. On average, 16.15% of cases required surgery (range 0C66.6%). The average mortality rate was 6.25% (range 0C87.5%). The mean age at disease onset was 9.5 days (range 6.6C29 days). Most of the infants had low birth weight (median weight 1,395 g; range 1,112C2,788 g, calculated on the reported mean weights). The main risk factors associated with NEC were: low birth weight, low gestational age, low Apgar score, perinatal complications, hyaline membrane disease, and umbilical catheterisation. The bacteria involved often included Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae type 3305573. The causative role of Clostridia in NEC is controversial. With regard to viral agents, coronarovirus, rotavirus and enterovirus, such as echovirus type 22, were isolated during some of the epidemics. The recommended control measures for NEC epidemics are those used for epidemics of other orofaecally transmitted infections.

However, it is contraindicated in patients with previous abdominal surgery, because of a higher risk of enteric injury, technical difficulties associated with adhesions, and longer operative times. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and clinical outcomes of LAG in patients who had previously undergone gastrectomy for gastric cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between June 2008 and May 2012, we performed laparoscopic gastrectomies in 17 patients with remnant stomach cancer who had previously undergone open gastrectomy (10 patients) or LAG (7 patients) for early gastric cancer. We performed laparoscopic distal gastrectomies with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy in 10 patients, and laparoscopic total gastrectomies in 7 patients. RESULTS None of the patients required conversion to open surgery or intraoperative transfusion. One patient with postoperative bleeding received a transfusion of 4 U of blood. There were 2 cases of serious postoperative complications: 1 internal herniation and 1 anastomosis leakage. One patient experienced tractitis at the trocar site. All patients had tumor-free resection margins, and there were no mortalities. CONCLUSION LAG is a safe and realistic treatment for patients who have previously undergone gastrectomy, although it may be associated with an increased need for adhesiolysis and longer surgery times.","output":"Laparoscopic gastrectomy in patients with previous gastrectomy for gastric cancer: a report of 17 cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a type of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that was identified in December 2019.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid therapy in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and China Science and Technology Journal (VIP) databases were searched for studies. Data on clinical improvement, mortality, virus clearance time, adverse events (AEs), utilization of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization, and hospital stay were extracted by two authors independently. Study quality was assessed by the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (cohort studies). The pooled data were meta-analyzed using a random effects model, and the quality of evidence was rated using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Eleven cohort studies (corticosteroid group vs control group), two retrospective cohort studies (without control group), and seven case studies were identified. A total of 2840 patients were included. Compared with the control treatments, corticosteroid therapy was associated with clinical recovery (RR = 1.30, 95% CI [0.98, 1.72]) and a significantly shortened length of ICU hospitalization (RR = ?6.50; 95% CI [?7.63 to ?5.37]), but it did not affect the mortality ((RR = 1.59; 95% CI [0.69C3.66], I(2) = 93.5%), utilization of mechanical ventilation (RR = 0.35; 95% CI [0.10, 1.18]), duration of symptoms (WMD = 1.69; 95% CI [?0.24 to 3.62]) or virus clearance time (RR = 1.01; 95% CI [?0.91 to 2.92], I(2) = 57%) in COVID-19 patients.

Methods: This prospective cohort analysis took place at a London NHS Trust. 5076 secondary care healthcare staff participated in LFD testing from 18 November 2020 - 21 January 2021. Staff members submitted results and symptoms via an online portal twice weekly. Individuals with positive LFD results were invited for confirmatory SARS CoV-2 PCR testing. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the LFD was measured. Secondary outcome measures included time from LFD result to PCR test and staff symptom profiles. Results: 284/5076 individuals reported a valid positive LFD result, and a paired PCR result was obtained in 259/284 (91?2%). 244 were PCR positive yielding a PPV of 94?21% (244/259, 95% CI 90?73% to 96?43%). 204/259 (78?8%) staff members had the PCR within 36 hours of the LFD test. Symptom profiles were confirmed for 132/244 staff members (54?1%) with positive PCR results (true positives) and 13/15 (86?6%) with negative PCR results (false positives). 91/132 true positives (68?9%) were symptomatic at the time of LFD testing: 65/91 (71?4%) had symptoms meeting the PHE case definition of COVID-19, whilst 26/91 (28?6%) had atypical symptoms. 18/41 (43?9%) staff members who were asymptomatic at the time of positive LFD developed symptoms in the subsequent four days. 9/13 (76?9%) false positives were asymptomatic, 1/13 (7?7%) had atypical symptoms and 3/13 (23?1%) had symptoms matching the PHE case definition. Conclusions: The PPV of the Innova LFD is high when used amongst hospital staff during periods of high prevalence of COVID-19, yet we find frequent use by symptomatic staff rather than as a purely asymptomatic screening tool.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective study using COVID-19 mortality data from USA Facts linked to data from the US Census Bureau, the Health Resources & Services Administration Area Health Resources file, and the US Census Bureau. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate the association between the total county COVID-19 deaths during consecutive 30-day intervals and the proportion of non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanic residents after adjusting for resident demographics, comorbidity burden, rurality, social determinants of health, and health care resources. RESULTS: In April, counties (n=179) with >40% Blacks had 6-fold higher death rates than counties (n=1521) with <2% Blacks [incident rate ratio (IRR)=6.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.29C13.2, P<0.001]. These counties had higher death rates until October, but were no different than referent counties in November. In April, death rates in counties with >40% Hispanic residents were similar to death rates in counties with <2% Hispanic residents.

Germany is currently facing the so-called third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is exacerbated by emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mutants with increased virus transmission and severe courses of disease. Rising numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections translate into an increasing number of severe COVID-19 cases requiring intensive care, which interacts with limited structural and personnel resources for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 critically ill patients. Therefore, prioritization and triage for critically ill patients with allocation of intensive care capacities becomes necessary, as with all situations with higher strain on capacities. Both strategies are meaningful forms of organization and are not to be equated with a collapse of medical care. Cardiovascular comorbidities and cardiac involvement in COVID-19 are of particular importance for disease severity and the clinical course. In addition to the medical care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections due to the pandemic, other patients with acute sometimes life-threatening diseases must also continue to receive high-quality treatment.

The aim of the study was to assess the impact of the schools lockdown on the three existing digital gaps, access, cognitive and school, from the teachers and the families perspectives. METHOD. 9567 Spanish citizens, 3700 teachers and 5867 parents, agreed to participate. The study followed an ex post facto research design within a questionnaire quantitative methodology. A snowball non-probabilistic sampling was used to recruit participants. Data collection was performed virtually from April 15th to May 8th, 2020. RESULTS. They uncovered an access gap that teachers blame on a deficient internet connection and not enough resources at home, but families do not share it and point to telecommuting as the main limitation. DISCUSSION. There is a clear cognitive gap acknowledged by teachers and families and a school gap that teachers blame on insufficient resources provided by the administration and the schools, and an insufficient experience on on-line education. In conclusion, the confinement caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light a digital gap that many believe overcame or at least minimized. However, the cognitive and the school gaps need actions.","output":"La brecha digital destapada por la pandemia del coronavirus: una investigacin sobre profesorado y familias"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Most COVID-19-related deaths have occurred in older persons with comorbidities. Specific patterns of comorbidities related to COVID-19 deaths have not been investigated. METHODS: A random sample of 6085 individuals in Italy who died in-hospital with confirmed COVID-19 between February and December 2020 were included. Observed to expected (O/E) ratios of disease pairs were computed and logistic regression models were used to determine the association between disease pairs with O/E values  1.5. RESULTS: Six pairs of diseases exhibited O/E values  1.5 and statistically significant higher odds of co-occurrence in the crude and adjusted analyses: (1) ischemic heart disease and atrial fibrillation, (2) atrial fibrillation and heart failure, (3) atrial fibrillation and stroke, (4) heart failure and COPD, (5) stroke and dementia, and (6) type 2 diabetes and obesity. CONCLUSION: In those deceased in-hospital due to COVID-19 in Italy, disease combinations defined by multiple cardio-respiratory, metabolic, and neuropsychiatric diseases occur more frequently than expected. This finding indicates a need to investigate the possible role of these clinical profiles in the chain of events that lead to death in individuals who have contracted SARS-CoV-2.

Much of the dialogue around testing has concentrated on how countries can scale up capacity, but the uncertainty in testing has not received nearly as much attention beyond asking if a test is accurate enough to be used. Even for highly accurate tests, false positives and false negatives will accumulate as mass testing strategies are employed under pressure, and these misdiagnoses could have major implications on the ability of governments to suppress the virus. The present analysis uses a modified SIR model to understand the implication and magnitude of misdiagnosis in the context of ending lockdown measures. The results indicate that increased testing capacity alone will not provide a solution to lockdown measures. The progression of the epidemic and peak infections is shown to depend heavily on test characteristics, test targeting, and prevalence of the infection. Antibody based immunity passports are rejected as a solution to ending lockdown, as they can put the population at risk if poorly targeted. Similarly, mass screening for active viral infection may only be beneficial if it can be sufficiently well targeted, otherwise reliance on this approach for protection of the population can again put them at risk. A well targeted active viral test combined with a slow release rate is a viable strategy for continuous suppression of the virus.","output":"Is no test is better than a bad test?

It was aimed to test this hypothesis, and the study was carried out to examine pandemic measures the effect of on the nutritional, depression and stress conditions of people with obesity. Methods: The individuals who participated in the study were people with obesity who received follow-up dietary therapy in a private hospital. Three separate scales were applied to the individuals, which measured the desire to overeating request, depression status and stress-fighting status. Results: This study was conducted on 368 individuals. Women had lower values of BMI (28.57+/-3.89 kg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) than men (30.64+/-2.87 kg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). When the scores of the excessive eating request scale mean scores before and during the pandemic were examined, it was seen that the scores of the individuals increased during the pandemic. In the multivariate regression model, it was seen that the increase of stress and BMI increased the FCQ score (p&lt;0.001). Multiple regression models were created by taking into account the criteria that caused the score increase. Each variable can predict the FCQ score separately. The predictor significance order of variants on FCQ score beta values is as follows: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (beta=0.774), before pandemic FCQ (beta=0.601), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (beta=-0.268), before pandemic BMI&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; (beta=-0.223), during pandemic BMI&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; (beta=0.073), and age (beta=-0.013).

Thus, we aimed to assess its impact on health care provision, fear of infection, adherence to medical treatment, and compliance with preventative instructions in children and adolescents with IBD. METHODS: A cross-sectional telephonic survey using a Likert scale-based questionnaire was conducted among all pediatric patients with IBD from a single tertiary medical center. RESULTS: A total of 244 pediatric patients with IBD were included in the study, reporting a high rate of fear of severe COVID-19 infection due to IBD or IBD medications (198, 81.1%). Most of the patients obeyed the Ministry of Health instructions (228, 93.4%), while almost 50% took additional protective measures including avoidance of school and complete lockdown. Concerns regarding the attendance of regular clinics (116, 47.5%) and emergency room in case of IBD exacerbation (178, 73%) were frequently reported. Only 7 patients (2.9%) changed or discontinued their IBD treatment due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We noted several distinct features of the COVID-19 pandemic effect on pediatric patients with IBD including a high rate of fear of severe COVID-19 infection, fear of attending necessary medical facilities, and high rate of avoidance of social activities. IMPACT: Pediatric patients with IBD have a high rate of fear of severe COVID-19 infection, fear of attending necessary medical facilities, and a high rate of avoidance of social activities.

Therapeutic approaches need to be underpinned by sound biological rationale. We evaluated whether serum levels of a range of proposed coronavirus disease 2019 therapeutic targets discriminated between patients with mild or severe disease. DESIGN: A search of ClinicalTrials.gov identified coronavirus disease 2019 immunological drug targets. We subsequently conducted a retrospective observational cohort study investigating the association of serum biomarkers within the first 5 days of hospital admission relating to putative therapeutic biomarkers with illness severity and outcome. SETTING: University College London, a tertiary academic medical center in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were recruited, 44 (51%) with mild disease and 42 (49%) with severe disease. We measured levels of 10 cytokines/signaling proteins related to the most common therapeutic targets (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-2a, interferon-, interferon-, interleukin-1, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, interleukin-6, interleukin-7, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-), immunoglobulin G antibodies directed against either coronavirus disease 2019 spike protein or nucleocapsid protein, and neutralization titers of antibodies. Four-hundred seventy-seven randomized trials, including 168 different therapies against 83 different pathways, were identified. Six of the 10 markers (interleukin-6, interleukin-7, interleukin-8, interferon-2a, interferon-, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) discriminated between patients with mild and severe disease, although most were similar or only modestly raised above that seen in healthy volunteers. A similar proportion of patients with mild or severe disease had detectable spike protein or nucleocapsid protein immunoglobulin G antibodies with equivalent levels between groups. Neutralization titers were higher among patients with severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: Some therapeutic and prognostic biomarkers may be useful in identifying coronavirus disease 2019 patients who may benefit from specific immunomodulatory therapies, particularly interleukin-6. However, biomarker absolute values often did not discriminate between patients with mild and severe disease or death, implying that these immunomodulatory treatments may be of limited benefit.","output":"Defining Potential Therapeutic Targets in Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of a Single-Center Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Depression has been a common mental health problem during the COVID-19 epidemic. From a network perspective, depression can be conceptualized as the result of mutual interactions among individual symptoms, an approach that may elucidate the structure and mechanisms underlying this disorder. This study aimed to examine the structure of depression among residents in Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, in the later stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A total of 2,515 participants were recruited from the community via snowball sampling. The Patient Health Questionnaire was used to assess self-reported depressive symptoms with the QuestionnaireStar program. The network structure and relevant centrality indices of depression were examined in this sample. Results: Network analysis revealed Fatigue, Sad mood, Guilt and Motor disturbances as the most central symptoms, while Suicide and Sleep problems had the lowest centrality. No significant differences were found between women and men regarding network structure (maximum difference = 0.11, p = 0.44) and global strength (global strength difference = 0.04; female vs. male: 3.78 vs. 3.83, p = 0.51), a finding that suggests there are no gender differences in the structure or centrality of depressive symptoms. Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional study design, causal relationships between these depressive symptoms or dynamic changes in networks over time could not be established.

There is still great uncertainty whether these IMIDT patients are more susceptible to COVID-19 than controls, and/or should be advised to avoid taking their immunosuppressive treatment. Objectives: To evaluate whether patients with IMIDT are more at risk for CLS than controls. Methods: The IENIMINI study is a prospective cohort study in patients with IMIDT and controls (healthy or no IMIDT) who were identified based on the registration database of the Leiden University Medical Center. Over time, participants registered COVID-like symptoms (CLS) as they occurred, and filled in additional questionnaires. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were done to identify variables associated with having CLS. Results: Of the 8670 individuals approached, 2110 with IMIDT and 1067 controls agreed to participate. In March and April, 454 (22%) of IMIDT patients and 242 (23%) of controls recorded to have CLS, mostly mild with a median (IQR) duration of seven (3-14) days in the IMIDT group and six days (4-11) in the control group. Eleven (5%) of the IMIDT patients with immunosuppressive medication (imed), 6 (3%) of IMIDTs without imed and 2 (1%) of controls were hospitalized with CLS (p=0.04). In May and June, fewer episodes overall were recorded. Being female (OR 1.45 95%CI 1.15;1.82), having a lung disease (OR 1.50 95%CI 1.20;1.88) and wearing a face mask (OR 1.42 95%CI 1.13-1.77) were independently associated with a higher risk, while higher age (OR 0.96 95%CI 0.96;0.97) and having an IMIDT with immunosuppressive medication use (OR 0.68 95%CI 0.51;0.91) were independently associated with a lower risk (see Table 1). Similar results were found after data imputation. Conclusion: Between March and July 2020, IMIDT patients, whether or not taking imeds, did not show an increased risk of reported COVID-like symptoms compared to controls.

There is limited information regarding postoperative surveillance and survivorship care in the Australian context. This study investigated patterns of colorectal cancer surveillance at a large tertiary institution. METHODS: A retrospective review of hospital records was conducted for all patients treated with curative surgery between January 2012 and June 2017. Provision of clinical surveillance, colonoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) within 24 months postoperatively were recorded. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to evaluate time-to-surveillance review and associated investigations. RESULTS: A total of 675 patients were included in the study. Median time to first postoperative clinical review was 20 days (95% confidence interval (CI), 18-21) with only 31% of patients having their first postoperative clinic review within 2 weeks. Median time to first CEA was 100 days (95% CI, 92-109), with 47% of patients having their CEA checked within the first 3 months, increasing to 68% at 6 months. Median time to first follow-up CT scan was 262 days (95% CI, 242-278) and for colonoscopy, 560 days (95% CI, 477-625). Poor uptake of surveillance testing was more prevalent in patients from older age groups, those with multiple comorbidities, and higher stage cancers. CONCLUSION: Colorectal cancer surveillance is multi-disciplinary and involves several parallel processes, many of which lead to inconsistent follow-up.

When a polymeric melt is cooled, the inhomogeneous distribution of temperature causes spatially varying volumetric shrinkage resulting in the generation of residual stresses. Shrinkage is incorporated into the framework by introducing an isotropic volumetric expansion/contraction in the kinematics of the body. We show that the parameter for shrinkage also appears in the systematically derived rate-type constitutive relation for the stress. The solidification of the melt around the glass transition temperature is emulated by drastically increasing the viscosity of the melt. In order to illustrate the usefulness and efficacy of the derived constitutive relation, we consider four ribbons of polymeric melt stacked on each other such as those extruded using a flat nozzle: each layer laid instantaneously and allowed to cool for one second before another layer is laid on it. Each layer cools, shrinks and warps until a new layer is laid, at which time the heat from the newly laid layer flows and heats up the bottom layers. The residual stresses of the existing and newly laid layers readjust to satisfy equilibrium. Such mechanical and thermal interactions amongst layers result in a complex distribution of residual stresses. The plane strain approximation predicts nearly equibiaxial tensile stress conditions in the core region of the solidified part, implying that a pre-existing crack in that region is likely to propagate and cause failure of the part during service. The free-end of the interface between the first and the second layer is subjected to the largest magnitude of combined shear and tension in the plane with a propensity for delamination.","output":"A Thermodynamic Framework for Additive Manufacturing, using Amorphous Polymers, Capable of Predicting Residual Stress, Warpage and Shrinkage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Little is known about how COVID-19-related social distancing has affected illegal drug use.

Methods: Individuals were recruited online and screened for eligibility throughout April and May 2020. We surveyed 128 eligible adults and queried, retrospectively, whether their drug use behavior had changed during COVID-19-related social distancing. Results: Most participants reporting past-three-month use reported decreased frequency of use during COVID-19-related social distancing. Specifically, 78.6% reduced frequency of use of cocaine, 71.1% reduced frequency of use of ecstasy/MDMA/Molly, and 68.0% reduced frequency of use of LSD. Although some participants reported increased frequency of use of cocaine (7.1%), ecstasy (7.9%), or LSD (12.0%), 35.0% reported increased frequency of cannabis use.

This has necessitated for the invention of protocols compliant with social distancing policies to efficiently tackle the current needs. Our aim is to describe a novel remote imaging technique, which helped us continue our research with widefield swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (WF SS-OCTA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: As a part of this cross-sectional observational study from August 2020 to September 2020 at Massachusetts Eye and Ear (MEE), we used our institute approved remote desktop, outside of MEE, to gain full access to the on-site WF SS-OCTA device in the imaging room for the purpose of remote imaging. With only the patient being in the imaging room, effective communication was established via video conferencing on an encrypted tablet computer device for the entire procedure. RESULTS: We imaged four patients with various retinal pathologies, aged 32C69 years. All images obtained were of high quality and signal strength (median score 9/10 for both) and all patients reported a highly satisfactory, comfortable, and safe experience amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: This novel method is better for remote imaging compared to the previously described techniques as it is time and cost effective, requires limited resources without compromising the image quality or patient satisfaction and adheres to the various guidelines for infection control, most importantly social distancing.

The amount of aortic wall calcification (AWC) can be estimated on low-dose chest CT. We suggest quantification of AWC on the low-dose chest CT, which is initially performed for the diagnosis of COVID-19, to screen for patients at risk of severe COVID-19. METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients (46 in center 1, 24 in center 2) with parallel low-dose chest CT and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were included in our multi-center, multi-vendor study. The outcome was rated moderate (no hospitalization, hospitalization) and severe (ICU, tracheal intubation, death), the latter implying a requirement for intensive care treatment. The amount of AWC was quantified with the CT vendor's software. RESULTS: Of 70 included patients, 38 developed a moderate, and 32 a severe COVID-19. The average volume of AWC was significantly higher throughout the subgroup with severe COVID-19, when compared to moderate cases (771.7 mm3 (Q1 = 49.8 mm3, Q3 = 3065.5 mm3) vs. 0 mm3 (Q1 = 0 mm3, Q3 = 57.3 mm3)). Within multivariate regression analysis, including AWC, patient age and sex, as well as a cardiovascular comorbidity score, the volume of AWC was the only significant regressor for severe COVID-19 (p = 0.004). For AWC > 3000 mm3, the logistic regression predicts risk for a severe progression of 0.78. If there are no visually detectable AWC risk for severe progression is 0.13, only.

Using computational fluid dynamics, we evaluated the hemodynamic patterns of VFAs after stent-only treatment (SOT) and monitored hemodynamic changes in the side branches. METHODS Between September 2014 and December 2015, we enrolled 10 consecutive patients with VFAs who underwent SOT. Successful aneurysm reconstruction is defined as perfect reconstruction of the parent artery and complete or nearly complete occlusion of the aneurysm. Otherwise, the reconstruction was considered unsuccessful. After SOT, we used computational fluid dynamics to assess hemodynamic changes in aneurysmal velocity, wall shear stress, and relative residual time (RRT) as well as velocity in side branches. RESULTS Ten patients were studied. At follow-up after initial treatment, 7 of the 10 reconstructions were successful. Compared with the 3 unsuccessful reconstructions, successful reconstructions showed a significantly greater increase in the mean RRT (1185.1% vs. 204.8%; P = 0.030) and a greater reduction in mean velocity (44.5% vs. 34.7%; P = 0.053) and wall shear stress (49.2% vs. 27.9%; P = 0.087).

Here, we focus on geographic disparities in incidence within Portugal for three age groups of women (30-49; 50-69; 70-84 years). METHODS: Age-period-cohort (APC) models are widely used in cancer surveillance, and these models have recently been extended to allow spatially-varying effects. We apply novel spatial APC models to estimate relative risk and age-adjusted temporal trends at the district level for the 20 districts in Portugal. Our model allows us to report on country-wide trends, but also to investigate geographic disparities between districts and trends within districts. RESULTS: Age-adjusted breast cancer incidence was increasing over 1998-2011 for all three age groups and in every district in Portugal. However, we detect spatially-structured between-district heterogeneity in relative risk and age-adjusted trends (Net Drifts) for each of the three age groups, which is most pronounced in the highly-screened (50-69yo) and late-onset (70-84yo) groups of women. CONCLUSIONS: We present evidence of disparities in breast cancer incidence at a more granular geographic level than previously reported.

Calculated for the different FIT brands only, the sensitivities for CRC were 81.6%-100%; specificities 65.7%-79.5%; positive predictive values 4.7%-8.1%; and negative predictive values 99.5%-100%. Calculated for the finding of either a positive FIT or anaemia, the sensitivities increased to 88.9-100%. Adding thrombocytosis did not further increase the diagnostic performance. CONCLUSION Qualitative FITs requested in primary care seem to be useful as rule-in tests for referral when CRC is suspected. A negative FIT and no anaemia indicate a low risk of CRC.","output":"Diagnosing colorectal cancer in primary care: cohort study in Sweden of qualitative faecal immunochemical tests, haemoglobin levels, and platelet counts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Long-term complications of COVID-19 in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients are unknown. Recent studies have described short term outcomes of COVID19 infection post allogeneic (allo) and autologous (auto) HCT. In this study we provide long term follow-up of the outcomes of COVID19 infection in allo and auto HCT recipients. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of adult patients who have received allo or auto HCT and were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between March-December 2020. We summarized patient characteristics, laboratory and treatment data related to COVID-19 infection in these patients. Results: In this study, we provide long-term follow-up of over 7 months. Fifteen patients were identified for inclusion (allo n = 12, auto n = 3). Median follow-up was 7.8 months (range 1.9-10.7) for surviving patients. Median age at COVID-19 diagnosis was 55 years (range 24-77). Most patients were &gt; 1 year out from transplant (allo n = 10, auto n = 1, 73%). Two patients (allo n = 1, auto n = 1, 13%) had undergone transplant within the preceding month. Most allo patients (n = 11, 73%) had received myeloablative conditioning. At the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, 9 allo patients (75%) were on immunosuppression (IS) (n = 7 for chronic graftversus-host-disease (GVHD);n = 2 for GVHD prophylaxis). Eleven patients (73%) required hospitalization (allo n = 9, auto n = 2). Per the National Institutes of Health definitions of COVID-19 illness severity, 3 patients had critical disease (allo n = 2, auto n = 1, 20%), 5 severe (allo n = 5, 33%), 3 moderate (allo n = 2, auto n = 1, 20%), and 4 mild (allo n = 3, auto n = 1, 27%). All patients with chronic GVHD required hospitalization. Two patients died (allo n = 1, auto n = 1, 13%)-both had critical COVID-19 infections, were &gt; 65 years old, &gt; 3 years out from transplant, and had significant comorbidities. The allo patient was receiving prednisone &lt; 1 mg/kg for chronic lung GVHD at COVID-19 diagnosis. Two allo patients developed either acute GVHD or chronic GVHD exacerbation within 3 months of their infection. One patient developed biopsy-proven acute GVHD (max grade III) 3 weeks after her infection and another patient developed a severe exacerbation of chronic GVHD within 3 months-both continue to require multi-modal IS. The remaining 7 patients with chronic GVHD have been maintained on either stable or tapered IS. Conclusions: Given the effect of COVID-19 infection, its impact on HCT recipients is important to define. The majority of HCT patients who contracted moderate-critical COVID-19 infections in our study were either on IS or had significant comorbidities. Our observational data points to the importance of long-term follow-up in HCT patients. Future studies are needed to delineate whether there is a relationship between COVID-19 infection and GVHD development or exacerbation. The role of vaccination in HCT recipients remains to be explored.","output":"Long-term follow-up of adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients diagnosed with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Family-centered care (FCC) has become the normative practice in Neonatal ICUs across North America.

Vitamin D supplementation is involved in muscle recovery after damage as a consequence of either pathology or after high-intensity exercise. In this context, the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of vitamin D on muscle fitness in elderly patients in the recovery phase after SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection. Materials and Methods: This pilot study was conducted at the Soria Norte Health Center. The study consisted of a double-blind trial with two groups of men (placebo and vitamin D-supplemented) (n = 15/group). Treatment with vitamin D (cholecalciferol: 2000 IU/day) and placebo was carried out for 6 weeks. Circulating hematological and biochemical parameters (total protein, glucose, vitamin D, urea, uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase/glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, alanine aminotransferase/glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase, gamma-glutamyl transferase and myoglobin) and the hormones cortisol and testosterone were determined. As for respiratory function tests, FEV1 and respiratory flow were also studied. For physical fitness tests, the six-minute walk test (6MWT) was used. Results: After vitamin D supplementation, we observed that serum creatine kinase levels returned to optimal values. This change suggests a protective role of vitamin D against muscle catabolism compared to placebo. In terms of physical test results, we observed only slight non-significant improvements, although patients reported feeling better. Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation produces decreases in indicators of muscle damage, which may ultimately contribute to improving the health status and quality of life of patients who have suffered from COVID-19, during the recovery process.","output":"Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Muscle Status in Old Patients Recovering from COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a life-threatening condition requiring life-long glucocorticoid (GC) substitution therapy, as well as stress adaptation to prevent adrenal crises.

Coronaviruses are important causes of respiratory tract infections, ranging from mild to severe depending on the viral strain. This study evaluated the role of PMN during a non-fatal pulmonary coronavirus infection in the natural host. Rat coronavirus (RCoV) causes respiratory disease in adult rats, characterized by an early PMN response, viral replication and inflammatory lesions in the lungs, mild weight loss and effective resolution of infection. To determine their role during RCoV infection, PMN were depleted and the effects on disease progression, viral replication, inflammatory response and lung pathology were analysed. Compared with RCoV infection in control animals, PMN-depleted rats had worsened disease with weight loss, clinical signs, mortality and prolonged pulmonary viral replication. PMN-depleted animals had fewer macrophages and lymphocytes in the respiratory tract, corresponding to lower chemokine levels. Combined with in vitro experiments showing that PMN express cytokines and chemokines in response to RCoV-infected alveolar epithelial cells, these findings support a role for PMN in eliciting an inflammatory response to RCoV infection. Despite their critical role in the protection from severe disease, the presence of PMN was correlated with haemorrhagic lesions, epithelial barrier permeability and cellular inflammation in the lungs. This study demonstrated that while PMN are required for an effective antiviral response, they also contribute to lung pathology during RCoV infection.","output":"Neutrophils are needed for an effective immune response against pulmonary rat coronavirus infection, but also contribute to pathology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rise in cases of Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS).

If attentional resources are shared between modalities, processing of task-irrelevant auditory information should become attenuated when attentional capacity is expended by visual demands. According to the early-filter model, top-down attenuation of auditory responses is possible at various stages of the auditory pathway through multiple recurrent loops. Furthermore, the adaptive filtering model of selective attention suggests that filtering occurs early when concurrent visual tasks are demanding (e.g., high load) and late when tasks are easy (e.g., low load). To test these models, this study examined the effects of three levels of visual load on auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) at three modulation frequencies. Subjects performed a visual task with no, low, and high visual load while ignoring task-irrelevant sounds. The auditory stimuli were 500-Hz tones amplitude-modulated at 20, 40, or 80 Hz to target different processing stages of the auditory pathway. Results from bayesian analyses suggest that ASSRs are unaffected by visual load. These findings imply that attentional resources are modality specific and that the attentional filter of auditory processing does not vary with visual task demands.","output":"Visual load effects on the auditory steady-state responses to 20-, 40-, and 80-Hz amplitude-modulated tones."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in an unprecedented public health challenge worldwide. Despite urgent and extensive global efforts, the existing evidence is inconclusive regarding the medications used for the treatment of COVID-19. Purpose: To generate an up-to-date evidence for the clinical safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without azithromycin (AZ) among patients treated for COVID-19. Data Source. PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, LITCOVID, Web of Science, SCOPUS, BioRxiv, Embase, MedRxiv, and Wiley online library were searched from 2019/12/30 to 2020/05/23. Study Selection. Three investigators assessed the quality of the studies. Data Extraction. Data about study characteristics, effect estimates, and the quality of the studies were extracted by two independent reviewers and cross-checked by the third reviewer. Data Synthesis. The data of 6,782 (HCQ group, 3623; HCQ + AZ group, 1,020; control group, 2139) participants were included. HCQ was compared with standard care for virologic efficacy, disease progression, mortality, and adverse effects. HCQ was also compared with HCQ + AZ for QTc prolongation, admission to the intensive care unit, and mortality. The study found HCQ did not alter the rate of virologic cure (OR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.39-1.56) and the risk of mortality (OR = 1.26; 95% CI: 0.66-2.39). The pooled prevalence for mortality was 5.8% (95% CI: 0.9%-10.8%). Moreover, HCQ did not impact disease progression (OR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.36-2.29) but resulted in a higher risk of adverse effects (OR = 2.35; 95% CI: 1.15-4.8). HCQ was also compared against HCQ + AZ, and no difference was observed in QTc prolongation above 500 ms (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 0.54-2.28), admission to the intensive care unit (OR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.52-1.63), and mortality (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.55-1.43). However, in the analysis of single-arm studies, about 11.2% (95% CI: 7.0%-15.5%) of patients have developed an absolute increase of QTc greater than 500 ms, and 4.1% (95% CI: 1.1%-7.1%) of patients discontinued their medication. Conclusion: This meta-analysis and systematic review, which included a limited number of poorly designed studies of patients with COVID-19, revealed HCQ is intolerable, unsafe, and not efficacious. Similarly, HCQ + AZ combination was not different from HCQ alone in curbing mortality and ICU admission.","output":"The Outcome of Hydroxychloroquine in Patients Treated for COVID-19: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Recent randomized controlled trials have shown no benefit for transfusion to a hemoglobin >10 g/dL compared with lower hemoglobin thresholds in the perioperative period, even among older adults. Nevertheless, physicians may choose to transfuse older adults more liberally than younger adults. It is unclear whether older patients have higher odds than younger patients of being transfused in the perioperative period. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the odds of transfusion are higher in older patients than in younger patients in the perioperative period. METHODS We conducted this retrospective observational cohort study at a tertiary care academic medical center. We included adults who had undergone a surgical procedure as an inpatient at our institution from January 2010 to February 2012. The primary analysis compared the odds of transfusion for patients >65 years old with the odds of transfusion in younger patients based on multilevel multivariable logistic regression analyses including adjustment for comorbidities, surgical service, lowest in-hospital hemoglobin value, gender, and estimated surgical blood loss and accounted for clustering by the surgeon and procedure. RESULTS We included 20,930 patients in this analysis. In multilevel models adjusted for comorbidities, surgical service, estimated surgical blood loss, and lowest in-hospital hemoglobin value, with surgeon and procedure as random effects, patients > 65 years old had 62% greater odds (odds ratio, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.40-1.88; P < 0.0001) of being transfused than did younger patients. When patients were stratified by lowest in-hospital hemoglobin (7.00-7.99, 8.00-8.99, 9.00-9.99, and 10.00 g/dL), the odds of transfusion generally increased with each additional decade of age in every stratum, except for that containing patients in whom the lowest in-hospital hemoglobin did not decrease below 10 g/dL. When the odds of transfusion were compared between younger and older patients, significant differences were observed among surgical services (P = 0.02) but not among anesthesia specialty divisions (P = 0.9). CONCLUSIONS Older adults have greater odds of receiving red blood cell transfusion in the perioperative period than do younger patients, despite the lack of evidence supporting higher hemoglobin triggers in elderly patients.

The study concentrated on three distinct anatomical compartments (whole body, gastrointestinal tract, and body without gastrointestinal tract), each of which was examined separately.

The parent model detected the presence of high levels of disorder at the outer shell in viruses, for which vaccines are not available. Another model found correlations between inner shell disorder and viral virulence. A third model was able to positively correlate the levels of respiratory transmission of coronaviruses (CoVs). These models are linked together by the fact that they have uncovered two novel immune evading strategies employed by the various viruses. The first involve the use of highly disordered \\"shape-shifting\\" outer shell to prevent antibodies from binding tightly to the virus thus leading to vaccine failure. The second usually involves a more disordered inner shell that provides for more efficient binding in the rapid replication of viral particles before any host immune response. This \\"Trojan horse\\" immune evasion often backfires on the virus, when the viral load becomes too great at a vital organ, which leads to death of the host. Just as such virulence entails the viral load to exceed at a vital organ, a minimal viral load in the saliva/mucus is necessary for respiratory transmission to be feasible. As for the SARS-CoV-2, no high levels of disorder can be detected at the outer shell membrane (M) protein, but some evidence of correlation between virulence and inner shell (nucleocapsid, N) disorder has been observed. This suggests that not only the development of vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, unlike HIV, HSV and HCV, is feasible but its attenuated vaccine strain can either be found in nature or generated by genetically modifying N.","output":"Feasibility of the vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses using the shell disorder analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake in resistant populations, such as Republicans, focus groups suggest that it is best to de-politicize the issue by sharing five facts from a public health expert.

In such an emergency situation, striking the right balance between urgency and acceptable safety and efficacy evidence is challenging. Furthermore, other relevant issues need to be more comprehensively addressed, including cost-effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and real-world data on effectiveness and safety. Currently the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved for use four vaccines against COVID-19. Data on their efficacy and safety will continue to be collected beyond licensure and submitted to EMA, but the need for a more complete assessment, which includes contextual and societal considerations (e.g. impact on population health, population's demand, attitudes and behaviours, ethical considerations) and economic analysis, is unquestionable to support national decision-maker processes. In this kind of holistic approach, the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) could be the answer in order to support the allocation of resources into different COVID-19 vaccines and to make it possible a timely and equitable access to vaccination. As also stated in the HTAi Position Paper on HTA's Critical Role in the (Early) Assessment of (potential) Vaccines to prevent the spread of COVID-19 globally, the following issues should be carefully tackled: 1) affordability, sustainability and distributional effects; 2) cost-effectiveness considerations; 3) fostering HTA collaborations; 4) need for early, adaptive and living HTA.

This study aimed to identify data sources in the region, potentially suitable for vaccine safety surveillance. METHODS Nineteen countries targeted for database reporting were identified using published country lists and review articles. Surveillance capacity was assessed using two surveys: a 9-item introductory survey and a 51-item full survey. Survey questions related to database characteristics, covariate and health outcome variables, vaccine exposure characteristics, access and governance, and dataset linkage capability. Other questions collated research/regulatory applications of the data and local publications detailing database use for research. RESULTS Eleven databases containing vaccine-specific information were identified across 8 countries. Databases were largely national in coverage (8/11, 73%), encompassed all ages (9/11, 82%) with population size from 1.4 to 52 million persons. Vaccine exposure information varied particularly for standardized vaccine codes (5/11, 46%), brand (7/11, 64%) and manufacturer (5/11, 46%). Outcome data were integrated with vaccine data in 6 (55%) databases and available via linkage in 5 (46%) databases. Data approval processes varied impacting on timeliness of data access.

Using easy-to-apply questionnaires and scales (often by telephone interviewing), several studies evaluated samples of COVID-19 inpatients from 4 weeks to several months after discharge. However, studies conducting systematic multidisciplinary assessments of PASC manifestations are scarce, with thorough in-person objective evaluations restricted to modestly sized subsamples presenting greatest disease severity. METHODS AND ANALYSES: We will conduct a prospective observational study of surviving individuals (above 18 years of age) from a cohort of over 3000 subjects with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were treated as inpatients at the largest academic health centre in Sao Paulo, Brazil (Hospital das Clnicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de S?o Paulo). All eligible subjects will be consecutively invited to undergo a 1C2-day series of multidisciplinary assessments at 2 time-points, respectively, at 6C9 months and 12C15 months after discharge. Assessment schedules will include detailed multidomain questionnaires applied by medical research staff, self-report scales, objective evaluations of cardiopulmonary functioning, physical functionality and olfactory status, standardised neurological, psychiatric and cognitive examinations, as well as diagnostic laboratory, muscle ultrasound and chest imaging exams. Remaining material from blood tests will be incorporated by a local biobank for use in future investigations on inflammatory markers, genomics, transcriptomics, peptidomics and metabolomics.

Abdominal pain (AP) without nausea and vomiting is one of the most common. To date, its role and prognostic value in patients with COVID-19 is still debated. Therefore, we performed a retrospective analysis of 2184 individuals admitted to hospital due to COVID-19. We divided the patients into four groups according to presented symptoms: dyspnea, n = 871 (39.9%);AP, n = 97 (4.4%);AP with dyspnea together, n = 50 (2.3%);and patients without dyspnea and AP, n = 1166 (53.4%). The patients with AP showed tendency to be younger than these with dyspnea, but without AP (63.0 [38.0C70.0] vs. 65.0 [52.0C74.0] years, p = 0.061), and they were more often females as compared to patients with dyspnea (57.7% vs. 44.6%, p = 0.013, for females). Patients with AP as a separate sign of COVID-19 significantly less often developed pneumonia as compared to individuals with dyspnea or with dyspnea and AP together (p < 0.0001).

Psychosocial stress also affects HRV and could be one of several confounders for cardiac AN. The present work investigated the impact of psychosocial stress on HRV in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and assessed the use of salivary cortisol as a biomarker for psychosocial stress in this context. METHODS A total of 167 individuals 6-60 years old (113 with T1DM and 54 healthy controls) underwent 24-hr ECG recordings with HRV analysis. Salivary cortisol was sampled thrice during the registration day. Perceived psychosocial stress along with other factors of possible importance for the interpretation of HRV was documented in a diary. RESULTS Heart rate variability (high-frequency power during sleep) was reduced (p < .05) with older age, longer diabetes duration, higher mean glucose levels, physical inactivity, and perceived psychosocial stress. Salivary cortisol levels in the evening were increased (p < .05) in women in ovulation phase, in individuals with preceding hypoglycemia or with hyperglycemia. The amplitude of salivary cortisol was reduced (p < .05) with the presence of perceived psychosocial stress, but only in adult healthy controls, not in individuals with diabetes. CONCLUSION Psychosocial stress might be a confounder for reduced HRV when diagnosing cardiac AN in T1DM. Salivary cortisol is, however, not a useful biomarker for psychosocial stress in diabetes since the physiological stress of both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia seems to overrule the effect of psychosocial stress on cortisol.","output":"Assessing heart rate variability in type 1 diabetes mellitus-Psychosocial stress a possible confounder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The host nucleocytoplasmic trafficking system is often hijacked by viruses to accomplish their replication and to suppress the host immune response.

Early in SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Argentinean Biobank of Infectious Diseases (BBEI) initiated the COVID19 collection and started its characterization. Methods: Blood samples from subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection either admitted to health institutions or outpatients, were enrolled. Highly exposed seronegative individuals, were also enrolled. Longitudinal samples were obtained in a subset of donors, including persons who donated plasma for therapeutic purposes (plasma donors). SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG levels, IgG titers and IgG viral neutralization capacity were determined. Findings: Out of 825 donors, 57.1% were females and median age was 41 years (IQR 32-53 years). Donors were segregated as acute or convalescent donors, and mild versus moderate/severe disease donors. Seventy-eight percent showed seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Specific IgM and IgG showed comparable positivity rates in acute donors. IgM detectability rate declined in convalescent donors while IgG detectability remained elevated in early (74,8%) and late (83%) convalescent donors. Among donors with follow-up samples, IgG levels seemed to decline more rapidly in plasma donors. IgG levels were higher with age, disease severity, number of symptoms, and was more durable in moderate/severe disease donors. Levels and titers of anti-spike/RBD IgG strongly correlated with neutralization activity against WT virus.

For example, bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (BMP) is involved in the pathogenesis of lysosomal storage diseases, and polyphosphoinositides (PPI) play critical roles in cellular signaling and functions. Phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a structural isomer of BMP, mediates lipid-protein and lipid-lipid interactions, and inhibits platelet activating factor and phosphatidylcholine transferring. However, due to their low abundance, the analysis of these phospholipids from biological samples is technically challenging. Therefore, the cellular function and metabolism of these phospholipids are still elusive. This chapter overviews a novel method of shotgun lipidomics after methylation with trimethylsilyl-diazomethane (TMS-D) for accurate and comprehensive analysis of these phospholipid species in biological samples. Firstly, a modified Bligh and Dyer procedure is performed to extract tissue lipids for PPI analysis, whereas modified methyl-tert-butylether (MTBE) extraction and modified Folch extraction methods are described to extract tissue lipids for PPI analysis. Secondly, TMS-D methylation is performed to derivatize PG/BMP and PPI, respectively. Then, we described the shotgun lipidomics strategies that can be used as cost-effective and relatively high-throughput methods to determine BMP, PG, and PPI species and isomers with different phosphate position(s) and fatty acyl chains. The described method of shotgun lipidomics after methylation achieves feasible and reliable quantitative analysis of low-abundance lipid classes. The application of this novel method should enable us to reveal the metabolism and functions of these phospholipids in healthy and disease states.","output":"Quantitative Analysis of Polyphosphoinositide, Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, and Phosphatidylglycerol Species by Shotgun Lipidomics After Methylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Covid-19 disease is the most important issue in the world today that affects all aspects of life in a society.

Methods: We examined data from 65,067 U.S.-based users of the G6 rtCGM System (Dexcom, Inc., San Diego, CA) who had uploaded data before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Users associated with three counties that included the cities of Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York or with five regions designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were compared. Public data were used to associate regions with prepandemic and intrapandemic glycemic parameters, COVID-19 mortality, and median household income. Results: Compared with an 8-week prepandemic interval before stay-at-home orders (January 6, 2020, to March 1, 2020), overall mean (standard deviation) TIR improved from 59.0 (20.1)% to 61.0 (20.4)% during the early pandemic period (April 20, 2020 to June 14, 2020, P < 0.001). TIR improvements were noted in all three counties and in all five CDC-designated regions. Higher COVID-19 mortality was associated with higher proportions of individuals experiencing TIR improvements of &#8805;5 percentage points. Users in economically wealthier zip codes had higher pre- and intrapandemic TIR values and greater relative improvements in TIR. TIR and pandemic-related improvements in TIR varied across CDC-designated regions. Conclusions: Population-level rtCGM data may be used to monitor changes in glycemic control with temporal and geographic specificity. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with improvements in TIR, which were not evenly distributed across the United States.","output":"Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic and Its Impact on Time in Range"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent literature emphasizes how the specific stressors of the COVID-19 outbreak affect the general population and frontline professionals, including those conducting support or backup activities in health units, which can lead to vicarious traumatization. Vicarious traumatization has been used to describe negative emotional reactions in mental health professionals who assist or treat victims of traumatic events. Thus, the aim of this article is to report the actions used in the face of the psychological demands of professionals in a hospital, who were not on the frontline of COVID-19. We collected their sociodemographic information and checked the psychological impact using the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21), which was followed by a psychoeducational program (topics related to COVID-19 control and prevention), and individual psychological care for the most severe cases. A total of 118 professionals participated in this study; they were between 20 and 67 years old. Mild to moderate anxiety was observed in 36.5% of the medical teams, 83.3% of the administrative staff, and 65.7% of general service workers, while stress symptoms were observed in 80.2%, 83.3%, and 59.9%, respectively. Depressive symptoms (35.3%) were more frequent in general service workers. The medical teams reported the benefits of primary psychological care, while the other professionals demanded more institutional support services related to the prevention and use of personal protective equipment. This study highlights relevant psychological demands that have repercussions on the daily lives of professionals. The psychoeducational program was considered positive regarding clarification actions. However, it was not perceived as effective in reducing fear, which may result from vicarious traumatization and requires other intervention modalities.

ObjectiveTo quantify the extent to which educational attainment and occupation explain racial/ethnic inequities in COVID-19 mortality. DesignObservational cohort. SettingCalifornia. ParticipantsCalifornians aged 18-65 years. MeasurementsWe linked all COVID-19-confirmed deaths in California through February 12, 2021 (N=14,783), to population estimates within strata defined by race/ethnicity, sex, age, USA nativity, region of residence, education, and occupation. We characterized occupations using measures related to COVID-19 exposure including essential sector, telework-ability, and wages. Using sex-stratified regressions, we predicted COVID-19 mortality by race/ethnicity if all races/ethnicities had the same education and occupation distribution as White people and if all people held the safest educational/occupational positions. ResultsCOVID-19 mortality per 100,000 ranged from 15 for White and Asian females to 139 for Latinx males. Accounting for differences in age, nativity, and region, if all races/ethnicities had the education and occupation distribution of Whites, COVID-19 mortality would be reduced for Latinx males (-22%) and females (-23%), and Black males (-1%) and females (-8%), but increased for Asian males (+22%) and females (+23%). Additionally, if all individuals had the COVID-19 mortality associated with the safest educational and occupational position (Bachelors degree, non-essential, telework, highest wage quintile), there would have been 57% fewer COVID-19 deaths. ConclusionEducational and occupational disadvantage are important risk factors for COVID-19 mortality across all racial/ethnic groups, especially Latinx individuals. Eliminating avoidable excess risk associated with low-education, essential, on-site, and low-wage jobs may reduce COVID-19 mortality and inequities, but is unlikely to be sufficient to achieve equity.","output":"Contributions of occupation characteristics and educational attainment to racial/ethnic inequities in COVID-19 mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unlike the six basic emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust and surprise, modelling and predicting dimensional affect in terms of valence (positivity - negativity) and arousal (intensity) has proven to be more flexible, applicable and useful for naturalistic and real-world settings.

In a few weeks, it progressed rapidly into a global pandemic which resulted in an overwhelming burden on health care systems, medical resources and staff. Spine surgeons as health care providers are no exception. In this study, we try to highlight the impact of the crisis on spine surgeons in terms of knowledge, attitude, practice and socioeconomic burden. METHODS: This was global, multicentric cross-sectional study on 781 spine surgeons that utilized an Internet-based validated questionnaire to evaluate knowledge about COVID-19, availability of personal protective equipment, future perceptions, effect of this crisis on practice and psychological distress. Univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictors for the degree of COVID-19 effect on practice. RESULTS: Overall, 20.2%, 52% and 27.8% of the participants were affected minimally, intermediately and hugely by COVID-19, respectively. Older ages ( = 0.33, 95% CI 0.11C0.56), orthopedic spine surgeons ( = 0.30, 95% CI 0.01C0.61) and those who work in the private sector ( = 0.05, 95% CI 0.19C0.61) were the most affected by COVID-19. Those who work in university hospitals ( = ? 0.36, 95% CI 0.00 to ? 0.71) were affected the least.

The overall prevalence of gastrointestinal helminths was 57.2% (95% confidence interval 41.3C71.9%) and observed helminths of the gastrointestinal tract were recorded: Ancylostoma caninum (33%), Toxocara canis (29%), Dipylidium caninum (6%), Capillaria spp. (3%), Trichuris vulpis (1.66%). It is important to point out that young dogs were significantly infected more frequently (p  0.1) than non-sterilized females and the higher occurrence of nematode infection occurred at the new arrival of stray dogs, in the third collection. With impact on public health, the higher prevalence (p  0.1) of T. canis in young dogs suggests the existence of real risk for human infection and demonstrate the necessity for a parasite control programme reinforcement at the municipal dog shelter.","output":"Epidemiological survey on intestinal helminths of stray dogs in Guimar?es, Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We examined whether existing licensed pharmacotherapies could reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: An open-label parallel randomized controlled trial was performed among healthy migrant workers quarantined in a large multi-storey dormitory in Singapore. Forty clusters (each defined as individual floors of the dormitory) were randomly assigned to receive a 42-day prophylaxis regimen of either oral hydroxychloroquine (400 mg once, followed by 200 mg/day), oral ivermectin (12 mg once), povidone-iodine throat spray (3 times/day, 270 g/day), oral zinc (80 mg/day)/vitamin C (500 mg/day) combination, or oral vitamin C, 500 mg/day. The primary outcome was laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as shown by either: (1) a positive serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day 42, or (2) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at any time between baseline and day 42. RESULTS: A total of 3037 asymptomatic participants (mean age, 33.0 years; all men) who were seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline were included in the primary analysis.

Aims We evaluated the prevalence of anxiety, depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a HCW population in the United Kingdom (UK), to identify subgroups most at risk. Methods An electronic survey was conducted between the 05/06/2020 and 31/07/2020 of all hospital HCW in the West Midlands, UK using clinically validated questionnaires: Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Univariate analyses and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the strengths in associations. Results There were 2638 eligible participants who completed the survey (female: 79.5%, median age: 42 [IQR: 32-51] years). The prevalence rates of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD were 34.3%, 31.2% and 24.5% respectively. In adjusted analysis a history of mental health conditions was associated with clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio 2.3 [95% CI 1.9-2.7]; p<0.001), depression (2.5 [2.1-3.0]; p<0.001) and PTSD (2.1 [1.7-2.5]; p<0.001). The availability of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), wellbeing support and lower exposure to moral dilemmas at work demonstrated significant negative associations with former symptoms (p[]0.001). Conclusions We report a high prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD in hospital HCW following the initial Covid-19 pandemic peak in the UK. Those with a history of mental health conditions were most at risk. Adequate PPE availability, access to wellbeing support and reduced exposure to moral dilemmas may protect hospital HCW from mental health symptoms.","output":"Mental health symptoms in a cohort of hospital healthcare workers following the first peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of meteorological and air quality factors in moderating the transmission of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and severity of COVID\\\\19 is a critical topic as an opportunity for targeted intervention and relevant public health messaging.

The low economic cost in comparison to high-field (HF-MRI) scanners and the ease of maintenance make this type of scanner the best choice for nonmedical purposes. However, LF-MRI scanners produce low-quality images, which encourages the identification of optimization procedures to generate the best possible images. In this paper, optimization of the image acquisition procedure for an LF-MRI scanner is presented, and predictive models are developed. The MRI acquisition procedure was optimized to determine the physicochemical characteristics of pork loin in a nondestructive way using MRI, feature extraction algorithms and data processing methods. The most critical parameters (relaxation times, repetition time, and echo time) of the LF-MRI scanner were optimized, presenting a procedure that could be easily reproduced in other environments or for other purposes. In addition, two feature extraction algorithms (gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and one point fractal texture algorithm (OPFTA)) were evaluated. The optimization procedure was validated by using several evaluation metrics, achieving reliable and accurate results (r > 0.85; weighted absolute percentage error (WAPE) lower than 0.1%; root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) lower than 0.1%; true standard deviation (TSTD) lower than 2; and mean absolute error (MAE) lower than 2).

Methods This was a mixed methods study (qualitative interviews and standardized surveys) with a diverse sample of 39 adults with SCI and their caregivers from four rehabilitation hospitals in the United States, including one Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital. Cluster analysis was used to explore whether distinct profiles of caregivers could be identified, and it was used in conjunction with qualitative data to explore patterns in well-being. Measures of well-being included leisure time satisfaction, social integration, anxiety, depression, physical health complaints, caregiver burden, and quality of life. Results The importance of individual and extra-individual resources, namely coping and social support, emerged from early qualitative analyses and guided subsequent mixed methods examination of the data. A cluster analysis yielded three caregiver profiles: (1) effective problem solvers with moderate satisfaction with social support, (2) mixed problem solvers with stronger negative orientations and mixed satisfaction with social support, and (3) low endorsers overall.

Methods: CoronaVac was given to HCWs in Hospital das Clinicas on 18-21 January, 2021 (epi week 3) (22,402 HCWs), and on 14-16 February, 2021 (epi week 7) (21,652 HCWs). Weekly cases of symptomatic COVID-19 were evaluated. Using the period from 2020 epi week 24 through 2021 epi week 2 (before vaccination), a Poisson regression was fit to model the HCWs with COVID-19 of the hospital, and the officially reported cases in the city of Sao Paulo.

The imminent need for masks has led many governments to produce them, including surgical masks with elastic loops or masks with side cuts at the ears. Among those on the market, surgical masks with elastic loops are the ones most chosen by parents for their children. These elastics cause constant compression on the skin and, consequently, on the cartilage of the auricle, leading to erythematous and painful lesions of the retroauricular skin when the masks are used for many hours a day. Pre-adolescent children have undeveloped auricular cartilage with less resistance to deformation; prolonged pressure from the elastic loops of the mask at the hollow or, even worse, at the anthelix level can influence the correct growth and angulation of the outer ear. In fact, unlike when using conservative methods for the treatment of protruding ears, this prolonged pressure can increase the cephaloauricular angle of the outer auricle.

We aimed to assess the more recent nationwide seroprevalence in the general population in India. METHODS: We did a second household serosurvey among individuals aged 10 years or older in the same 700 villages or wards within 70 districts in India that were included in the first serosurvey. Individuals aged younger than 10 years and households that did not respond at the time of survey were excluded. Participants were interviewed to collect information on sociodemographics, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, exposure history to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and history of COVID-19 illness. 3-5 mL of venous blood was collected from each participant and blood samples were tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Seroprevalence was estimated after applying the sampling weights and adjusting for clustering and assay characteristics. We randomly selected one adult serum sample from each household to compare the seroprevalence among adults between the two serosurveys. FINDINGS: Between Aug 18 and Sept 20, 2020, we enrolled and collected serum samples from 29a082 individuals from 15a613 households. The weighted and adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in individuals aged 10 years or older was 66% (95% CI 58-74). Among 15a084 randomly selected adults (one per household), the weighted and adjusted seroprevalence was 71% (62-82). Seroprevalence was similar across age groups, sexes, and occupations.

Currently, there are more than 49,000 species distributed almost all over the world.

Neprilysins are metalloendopeptidases whose presence has already been described in animal venoms, however, its function has not yet been elucidated. Our results showed for the first time one non-bacterial neprilysin which can cleave casein and suggest that its role in envenomation is to degrade the extracellular matrix, facilitating the access of other toxins to their targets, as well as digestive fluids. Moreover, this discovery contributes to increasing the knowledge about little-studied species, since the Ajur_Neprilysin is the second neprilysin found in the venom from a mygalomorph spider.","output":"Presence of a neprilysin on Avicularia juruensis (Mygalomorphae: Theraphosidae) venom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Detection of epidemics is a critical issue in epidemiology of infectious diseases which enable healthcare system to better control it. This study is devoted to investigating the 5-year trend in influenza and severe acute respiratory infection cases in Iran. The epidemics were also detected using the hidden Markov model (HMM) and Serfling model. STUDY DESIGN: In this study, we used SARI data reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) FluNet web-based tool from August 2011 to August 2016. METHODS: SARI data in Iran from August 2011 to August 2016 were used. We applied the HMM and Serfling model for indicating the two epidemic and non-epidemic phases. The registered outbreak activity recorded on the WHO website was used as the gold standard. The coefficient of determination was reported to compare the goodness of fit of the models. RESULTS: Serfling models modified by 30% and 35% of the data had a sensitivity of 91.67% and 95.83%, while for 15%, 20% and 25% were 70.83%, 79.17% and 83.33%, respectively. Sensitivity of HMM and autoregressive HMM (AHMM) was 66.67% and 92.86%. All fitted models have a specificity of over 96%. The R2 for HMM and AHMM was calculated 0.73 and 0.85, respectively, showing better fitness of these models, while R2 was around 50% for different types of Serfling models. CONCLUSIONS: Both modified Serfling and HMM were acceptable models in determining the epidemic points for the detection of weekly SARI. The AHMM had better fitness, higher detection power and more accurate detection of the incidence of epidemics than Serfling model and high sensitivity and specificity. In addition to AHMM, Serfling models with 30% and 35% modification can be used to detect epidemics due to approximately the same accuracy but the simplicity of the calculations.","output":"Detection of influenza epidemics using hidden Markov and Serfling approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The healthcare system has been placed under an enormous burden by the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. In addition to the challenge of providing sufficient care for COVID-19 patients, there is also a need to ensure adequate care for non-COVID-19 patients. We investigated neurosurgical care in a university hospital during the pandemic. We examined the second wave of the pandemic from 1 October 2020 to 15 March 2021 in this retrospective single-center study and compared it to a pre-pandemic period from 1 October 2019 to 15 March 2020. Any neurosurgical intervention, along with patient- and treatment-dependent factors, were recorded. We also examined perioperative complications and unplanned readmissions. A statistical comparison of the study groups was performed. We treated 535 patients with a total of 602 neurosurgical surgeries during the pandemic. This compares to 602 patients with 717 surgeries during the pre-pandemic period. There were 67 fewer patients (reduction to 88.87%) admitted and 115 fewer surgeries (reduction to 83.96%) performed, which were essentially highly elective procedures, such as cervical spinal stenosis, intracranial neurinomas, and peripheral nerve lesions. Regarding complication rates and unplanned readmissions, there was no significant difference between the COVID-19 pandemic and the non-pandemic patient group. Operative capacities were slightly reduced to 88% due to the pandemic. Nevertheless, comprehensive emergency and elective care was guaranteed in our university hospital.

Improving yield and yield-related traits are key goals in wheat breeding program. The integration of accumulated wheat genetic resources provides an opportunity to uncover important genomic regions and candidate genes that affect wheat yield. Here, a comprehensive meta-QTL analysis was conducted on 2230 QTL of yield-related traits obtained from 119 QTL studies. These QTL were refined into 145 meta-QTL (MQTL), and 89 MQTL were verified by GWAS with different natural populations. The average confidence interval (CI) of these MQTL was 2.92 times less than that of the initial QTL. Furthermore, 76 core MQTL regions with a physical distance less than 25 Mb were detected. Based on the homology analysis and expression patterns, 237 candidate genes in the MQTL involved in photoperiod response, grain development, multiple plant growth regulator pathways, carbon and nitrogen metabolism and spike and flower organ development were determined. A novel candidate gene TaKAO-4A was confirmed to be significantly associated with grain size, and a CAPS marker was developed based on its dominant haplotype. In summary, this study clarified a method based on the integration of meta-QTL, GWAS and homology comparison to reveal the genomic regions and candidate genes that affect important yield-related traits in wheat. This work will help to lay a foundation for the identification, transfer and aggregation of these important QTL or candidate genes in wheat high-yield breeding.","output":"Large-scale integration of meta-QTL and genome-wide association study discovers the genomic regions and candidate genes for yield and yield-related traits in bread wheat."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection to be a pandemic disease. SARS-CoV2 was first identified in China and, despite the restrictive measures adopted, the epidemic has spread globally, becoming a pandemic in a very short time. Though there is growing knowledge of the SARS-CoV2 infection and its clinical manifestations, an effective cure to limit its acute symptoms and its severe complications has not yet been found. Given the worldwide health and economic emergency issues accompanying this pandemic, there is an absolute urgency to identify effective treatments and reduce the post infection outcomes. In this context, phosphodiesterases (PDEs), evolutionarily conserved cyclic nucleotide (cAMP/cGMP) hydrolyzing enzymes, could emerge as new potential targets. Given their extended distribution and modulating role in nearly all organs and cellular environments, a large number of drugs (PDE inhibitors) have been developed to control the specific functions of each PDE family. These PDE inhibitors have already been used in the treatment of pathologies that show clinical signs and symptoms completely or partially overlapping with post-COVID-19 conditions (e.g., thrombosis, inflammation, fibrosis), while new PDE-selective or pan-selective inhibitors are currently under study. This review discusses the state of the art of the different pathologies currently treated with phosphodiesterase inhibitors, highlighting the numerous similarities with the disorders linked to SARS-CoV2 infection, to support the hypothesis that PDE inhibitors, alone or in combination with other drugs, could be beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors: Could They Be Beneficial for the Treatment of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Long Covid remains a relatively new phenomenon with emerging understanding.

Methods Secondary analysis was used to describe and re-interpret the pattern of persistent symptoms by IgG seropositivity and self reported Long Covid in the SAPRIS-SERO survey. Participants in the cross-sectional analysis were 26823 individuals from the French population based CONSTANCES cohort, included between 2012 and 2019, who took part in the nested SAPRIS and SAPRIS-SERO surveys. Between May and November 2020, the Euroimmun enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect anti SARS CoV 2 antibodies. Surveyed online between December 2020 and January 2021, participants self reported previous COVID 19 infection and physical symptoms during the previous four weeks that were new since March 2020, and had persisted for at least eight weeks. Results There was similarity of prevalence over the majority of symptoms in those self reporting COVID-19 infection, regardless of blood test result. Persistent symptoms significantly associated with self reported COVID 19 infection and common in both groups include respiratory tract symptoms and a group of symptoms that might be related to chronic fatigue, malaise or postural issues. Seropositivity for IgG antibodies did not predict symptoms independently of self reported Long Covid, except for anosmia.

Moreover, the precise role of SARS-CoV-2 in the pathophysiology of the nasopharyngeal tract (NT) is still unfathomable. Therefore, we used the machine learning methods to analyze 22 RNA-seq datasets from COVID-19 patients (n=8), recovered individuals (n=7), and healthy individuals (n=7) to find disease-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In comparison to healthy controls, we found 1960 and 153 DEG signatures in COVID-19 patients and recovered individuals, respectively. We compared dysregulated DEGs to detect critical pathways and gene ontology (GO) connected to COVID-19 comorbidities. In COVID-19 patients, the DEG- miRNA and DEG-transcription factors (TFs) interactions network analysis revealed that E2F1, MAX, EGR1, YY1, and SRF were the most highly expressed TFs, whereas hsa-miR-19b, hsa-miR-495, hsa-miR-340, hsa-miR-101, and hsa-miR-19a were the overexpressed miRNAs. Three chemical agents (Valproic Acid, Alfatoxin B1, and Cyclosporine) were abundant in COVID-19 patients and recovered individuals. Mental retardation, mental deficit, intellectual disability, muscle hypotonia, micrognathism, and cleft palate were the significant diseases associated with COVID-19 by sharing DEGs. Finally, we detected DEGs impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection and mediated by TFs and miRNA expression, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to various comorbidities. These pathogenetic findings can provide some crucial insights into the complex interplay between COVID-19 and the recovery stage and support its importance in the therapeutic development strategy to combat against COVID-19 pandemic. IMPORTANCEDespite it has now been over two years since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many crucial questions about SARS-CoV-2 infection and the different COVID-19 symptoms it causes remain unresolved. An intriguing question about COVID-19 is how SARS-CoV-2 interplays with the host during infection and how SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause so many disease symptoms. Our analysis of three different datasets (COVID-19, recovered, and healthy) revealed significantly higher DEGs in COVID-19 patients than recovered humans and healthy controls. Some of these DEGs were found to be co-expressed in both COVID-19 patients. They recovered humans supporting the notion that DEGs level is directly correlated with the viral load, disease progression, and different comorbidities. The protein-protein interaction consisting of 24 nodes and 72 edges recognized eight hub-nodes as potential hub-proteins (i.e., RPL4, RPS4X, RPL19, RPS12, RPL19, EIF3E, MT-CYB, and MT-ATP6). Protein-chemical interaction analysis identified three chemical agents (e.g., Valproic Acid, Alfatoxin B1, and Cyclosporine) enriched in COVID-19 patients and recovered individuals.

Thus, this study aims to examine the relationship between EM and the performance of Egyptian banks. Furthermore, building upon environmental contingency theory, this study examined the moderating role of ET on the relationship between EM and the performance of banks in Egypt. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected during the period March-June 2020 using a sample of 358 employees working in 20 banks in Egypt. Online surveys and self-administered questionnaires were used to collect the required data during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypotheses were tested through structural equation modeling using SPSS 25.

Results also showed that ET and technological turbulence positively moderates this relationship, i.e. this relationship is more robust in highly turbulent business environments than in more stable environments. Practical implications This study provides useful managerial and practical implications. Fruitful insights can be communicated to bank managers in Egypt on the importance of EM and its implications for performance. With an increased understanding of EM, bank managers will come to understand that EM is critical for the sustainability and development of their banks.

A better understanding of the timing and patterns in stimulant co-use among PWUO based on mentions of these substances on social media can help inform prevention programs, policy, and future research directions. This study examines stimulant co-mention trends among PWUO/PTMOUD on social media over multiple years. METHODS: We collected publicly available data from 14 forums on Reddit (subreddits) that focused on prescription and illicit opioids, and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Collected data ranged from 2011 to 2020, and we also collected timelines comprising past posts from a sample of Reddit users (Redditors) on these forums. We applied natural language processing to generate lexical variants of all included prescription and illicit opioids and stimulants and detect mentions of them on the chosen subreddits. Finally, we analyzed and described trends and patterns in co-mentions. RESULTS: Posts collected for 13,812 Redditors showed that 12,306 (89.1%) mentioned at least 1 opioid, opioid-related medication, or stimulant. Analyses revealed that the number and proportion of Redditors mentioning both opioids and/or opioid-related medications and stimulants steadily increased over time. Relative rates of co-mentions by the same Redditor of heroin and methamphetamine, the substances most commonly co-mentioned, decreased in recent years, while co-mentions of both fentanyl and MOUD with methamphetamine increased. CONCLUSION: Our analyses reflect increasing mentions of stimulants, particularly methamphetamine, among PWUO/PTMOUD, which closely resembles the growth in overdose deaths involving both opioids and stimulants. These findings are consistent with recent reports suggesting increasing stimulant use among people receiving treatment for opioid use disorder. These data offer insights on emerging trends in the overdose epidemic and underscore the importance of scaling efforts to address co-occurring opioid and stimulant use including harm reduction and comprehensive healthcare access spanning mental-health services and substance use disorder treatment.

PARTICIPANTS Patients with fractured orbits (n = 265) presenting to a level 1 trauma centre between August 2015 and January 2018. METHODS Key elements of ophthalmic assessment, including visual acuity, SCH (0-360), anterior- and posterior-segment examination, Hertel exophthalmometry, and ocular pathology, were recorded. Simple logistic regression assessed for association between SCH severity and ocular pathology. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95% CI. RESULTS Among the 265 fractured orbits, 158 (59.6%) presented with no SCH, and 107 (40.4%) had some degree of SCH. Ocular pathology was noted in 24 fractured orbits (9%). Most common pathologies included entrapment (22.2%), hyphema (16.7%), traumatic optic neuropathy (8.3%), and commotio retinae (8.3%). Simple logistic regression revealed a higher incidence of ocular pathology with increasing severity of SCH from 0-360 (OR = 1.004; 95% CI 1.001-1.007; p = 0.0085).

Five of seven (71.4%) of critically ill patients were African-American (n = 3) or Hispanic (n = 2). Critical illness was associated with older age (p = 0.017), longer duration of symptoms (p = 0.036), and lower oxygen saturation on presentation (p = 0.016); with more thrombocytopenia (p = 0.015); higher C-reactive protein (p = 0.031); and lower WBC count (p = 0.039). Duration of mechanical ventilation averaged 14.1 days. One patient died. CONCLUSIONS: Severe, protracted coronavirus disease 2019 is seen in pediatric patients, including those without significant comorbidities. We observed a greater proportion of hospitalized children requiring mechanical ventilation than has been reported to date. Older children, African-American or Hispanic children, and males may be at risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 requiring hospitalization. Hypoxia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated C-reactive protein may be useful markers of critical illness. Data regarding optimal management and therapies for pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 are urgently needed.","output":"Clinical Features of Critical Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by abnormalities of differentiation and growth of primary hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the blood and bone marrow. In many studies, miR-625-5p has been shown to inhibit downstream pathways from affecting the metastasis and invasion of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) signaling pathway. It has been proved that the expression of miR-625-5p decreases in AML cell lines. This study aimed to investigate the effect of miR-625-5p upregulation on the invasion of KG1 ell line in vitro. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we investigated the impact of upregulation of miR-625-5p on invasion via the ILK/AKT pathway in the KG1 cell line. After transfection using the viral method, the cellular invasion was assessed by invasion assay and the levels of miR-625-5p genes and protein were evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting. Moreover, CXCR4 level was assessed by flow cytometry. Results: The invasion significantly reduced in MiR-625-5p-transfected KG1 cells (P<0.01) that was concomitant with remarkably decreasing in the expression levels of ILK, NF-B, and COX2 genes compare with the control group (P<0.01). Incontrast, MMP9, AP1, and AKT significantly increased (P<0.01, P<0.001 and P<0.01, respectively) and GSK3? did not change significantly in MiR-625-5p-transfected KG1 cells. The protein level of NF-B decreased (P<0.01) and MMP9 increased, however it was not significant. Moreoever, the expression of CXCR4 was significantly lower (P<0.01) in comparison with the control group. Conclusion: miR-625-5p leads to a reduction in cell invasion in the AML cell line through ILK pathway. Therefore, it could be a breakthrough in future AML-related research. However, further studies are needed to support this argument.","output":"Upregulation of hsa-miR-625-5p Inhibits Invasion of Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cancer Cells through ILK/AKT Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, an attempt is made to analyze the semantic and pragmatic potential of emoji signs that explicate the \\"covid\\" meaning.

MethodsThe retrospective, observational cohort study included 154 adults hospitalized between February and August, 2020 with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 with National Early Warning Score2 (NEWS2) < 7 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels [] 140 mg/L on the day of the start of the therapy or observation. Patients were divided into the following groups: I) 4 mg baricitinib, 1 or 2 times a day for an average of 5 days (n = 38); II) 120 mg netakimab, one dose (n = 48); III) 400 mg tocilizumab, one dose (n = 34), IV) SOC: hydroxychloroquine, antiviral, antibacterial, anticoagulant, and dexamethasone (n = 34). FindingsCRP levels significantly decreased after 72 h in the tocilizumab (p = 1 x 10-5) and netakimab (p = 8 x 10-4) groups and remained low after 120 h. The effect was stronger with tocilizumab compared to other groups (p = 0.028). A significant decrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels was observed 72 h after netakimab therapy (p = 0.029). NEWS2 scores significantly improved 72 h after tocilizumab (p = 6.8 x 10-5) and netakimab (p = 0.01) therapy, and 120 h after the start of tocilizumab (p = 8.6 x 10-5), netakimab (p = 0.001), or baricitinib (p = 4.6 x 10-4) therapy, but not in the SOC group. Blood neutrophil counts (p = 6.4 x 10-4) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (p = 0.006) significantly increased 72 h after netakimab therapy and remained high after 120 h. The percentage of patients discharged 5-7 days after the start of therapy was higher in the tocilizumab (44.1%) and netakimab (41.7%) groups than in the baricitinib (31.6%) and SOC (23.5%) groups. Compared to SOC (3/34, 8.8%), mortality was lower in netakimab (0/48, 0%, RR=0.1 (95% CI: 0.0054 to 1.91)), tocilizumab (0/34, 0%, RR=0.14 (95% CI: 0.0077 to 2.67)), and baricitinib (1/38, 2.6%, RR=0.3 (95% CI: 0.033 to 2.73)) groups. InterpretationIn hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, anti-IL-17A or anti-IL-6R therapy were superior or comparable to the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, and all three were superior to SOC. Whereas previous studies did not demonstrate significant benefit of anti-IL-17A therapy for severe COVID-19, our data suggest that such therapy could be a rational choice for mild-to-moderate disease, considering the generally high safety profile of IL-17A blockers. The significant increase in blood neutrophil counts in the netakimab group may reflect efflux of neutrophils from inflamed tissues. We therefore hypothesize that neutrophil count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio could serve as markers of therapeutic efficiency for IL-17A-blocking antibodies in the context of active inflammation.","output":"Tocilizumab, netakimab, and baricitinib in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A COVID-19 pandemic is a rare event that distorted the lives of many civilians worldwide stemming from what is commonly referred to as the new-normal regarding communal standards and the way we live and work.

The rapid pivot to telemedicine and virtual care provided immediate and longer term benefits; however, such rapid-cycle development also created risks. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand the sociotechnical aspects of the rapid-cycle development of seven different COVID-19 virtual care tools, and to identify enablers, barriers, and risks at three health services in Victoria, Australia. METHODS: A qualitative, embedded, multiple case study design was adopted. Researchers from three health services collaborated with university researchers who were independent from those health services to gather and analyze structured interview data from key people involved in either clinical or technical aspects of designing and deploying seven different virtual care tools. RESULTS: The overall objectives of each health service reflected the international requirements for managing large numbers of patients safely but remotely and for protecting staff. However, the governance, digital maturity, and specific use cases at each institution shaped the methodology and specific outcomes required. Dependence on key individuals and their domain knowledge within an existing governance framework generally enabled rapid deployment, but sometimes posed barriers. Existing relationships with technical service developers enabled strong solutions, which in some cases were highly scalable. Conventional project methodologies such as steering committees, scope, budget control, tight functional specification, consumer engagement and codesign, universal accessibility, and postimplementation evaluation were ignored almost universally in this environment. CONCLUSIONS: These three health services took a variety of approaches to the rapid-cycle development of virtual care tools to meet their urgent needs for triaging and remote monitoring during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their experiences provided insights into many social and technical barriers and enablers to the development of virtual care tools. If these are addressed proactively, they will improve clinical governance and technical management of future virtual care. Some changes can be made within individual health services, while others entail health system policy reforms. Enhancing the environment for virtual care tool design and implementation now will yield returns not only during future health emergencies but also in many more routine care settings.","output":"The Rapid Development of Virtual Care Tools in Response to COVID-19: Case Studies in Three Australian Health Services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this project was to explore methods for adapting images originally created for the analog stereoscope to use in contemporary virtual reality headsets.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in drastic changes in human behavior which happened to synchronize with the CPV season in Central Texas, providing a unique opportunity with which to assess whether these society-level behavioral changes result in appreciable changes in CPV patient populations in the largest CPV treatment facility in Texas. In this work, we examine the population of CPV-infected patients at a large, dedicated CPV treatment clinic in Texas (having treated more than 5000 CPV-positive dogs in the last decade) and demonstrate that societalCbehavioral changes due to COVID-19 were associated with a drastic reduction in CPV infections. This reduction occurred precisely when CPV season would typically begin, during the period immediately following state-wide reopening of business and facilities, resulting in a change in the typical CPV season when compared with previous years.

OBJECTIVE: This case study describes the steps and methods employed in the conduction of a remote online health hackathon centered on challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to deliver a clear implementation road map for other organizations to follow. METHODS: This 4-day hackathon was conducted in April 2020, based on six COVID-19-related challenges defined by frontline clinicians and researchers from various disciplines. An online survey was structured to assess: (1) individual experience satisfaction, (2) level of interprofessional skills exchange, (3) maturity of the projects realized, and (4) overall quality of the event. At the end of the event, participants were invited to take part in an online survey with 17 (+5 optional) items, including multiple-choice and open-ended questions that assessed their experience regarding the remote nature of the event and their individual project, interprofessional skills exchange, and their confidence in working on a digital health project before and after the hackathon. Mentors, who guided the participants through the event, also provided feedback to the organizers through an online survey. RESULTS: A total of 48 participants and 52 mentors based in 8 different countries participated and developed 14 projects. A total of 75 mentorship video sessions were held. Participants reported increased confidence in starting a digital health venture or a research project after successfully participating in the hackathon, and stated that they were likely to continue working on their projects.

applying policies such as social distancing, disease testing, contact tracing, home isolation, emergency hospitalization, and travel prevention to reduce infection rates Based on modeling studies conducted in Imperial College, increasing levels of interventions could slow the spread of disease and infection We ran the model with six different percentages of social distancing while keeping the other parameters constant The results show that social distancing affects the spread of COVID-19 significantly, in turn decreasing the spread of disease and infection rates when implemented at higher levels We also validated these results by using the behavior space tool with ten experiments with varying social distancing levels We conclude that applying and increasing social distancing policy

strategies were tested over a 160-day period, analyzed for their effects on intensive care unit (ICU) demand and death rate, and compared with Swedish data for April 2020 RESULTS: Swedish mortality rates are intermediate between rates for European countries that quickly imposed stringent public health controls and those for countries that acted later Models most closely reproducing reported mortality data suggest that large portions of the population voluntarily self-isolate Swedish ICU use rates remained lower than predicted, but a large fraction of deaths occurred in non-ICU patients This suggests that patient prognosis was considered in ICU admission, reducing healthcare load at a cost of decreased survival in patients not admitted CONCLUSIONS: The Swedish COVID-19 strategy has

The results show that the survival rate for dental pulp was 100% for Life Kerr AC, 92% for TheraCal LC, and 83.87% for Calcimol LC, without significant differences. Apparently, self-setting calcium hydroxide material provided better dental pulp response than the two light-cured materials, regardless of their composition, that is, either calcium -hydroxide or calcium silicate-based. We will need a significant number of long-term clinical studies with the highest levels of evidence to determine the most adequate biomaterials for vital pulp therapies.","output":"Dental Pulp Response to Different Types of Calcium-Based Materials Applied in Deep Carious Lesion TreatmentA Clinical Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the current era of big data, it is critical to address peoples demand for health literacy. At present, the traditional mode of communicating scientific health knowledge and information technology is interchangeable, resulting in the emergence of a new mode of communicating health literacy. To publicize health education and health literacy in a targeted way, to meet the publics needs, and to understand how the publics demand for subjects, contents, and forms of health literacy service has changed in the era of COVID-19, the investigation of publics demand for health information and health literacy was conducted. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the differences in demand for health literacy service providers, contents, channels, forms, and facilities among Chinese citizens with different genders, ages, education levels, economic conditions, and living environments, and to provide reasonable recommendations for developing public health literacy. METHODS: Questionnaire Star was used to conduct a large sample of random online surveys. In Wuhan, Hubei Province, 2184 questionnaires were issued, 8 invalid questionnaires were eliminated, and 2176 were recovered, with an effective rate of 99.6%. IBM SPSS Statistics 20 was utilized to analyze the survey data. RESULTS: (1) In health literacy service providers selected by the public, the proportion of government departments or government collaboration with other institutions exceeded 73%, indicating that health literacy services are public goods; (2) access to health literacy services was lower in township areas than in urban areas (P < 0.001, 3) internet media and communicating with acquaintances, which have the highest popularity rate, were also the two channels that were least trusted by the public; and (4) the differences in contents and service channels of health literacy among residents with different genders, ages, education levels, economic status, and living environments were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: (1) It is recommended to establish an integrated health literacy service model with multi-center supply. Government departments, medical institutions, and media should cooperate effectively to provide health literacy services. (2) The government should pay attention to the fairness of health education and strengthen the supply of health literacy services in township areas. (3) It is critical to strengthen the publics ability to discriminate network information and pay attention to scientific thinking cultivation. (4) Health literacy service providers must focus on the differences between public demands and improve the connotation of health literacy services.

Initial strategy focused on vaccinating the elderly to prevent hospitalizations and deaths. With vaccines becoming available to the broader population, we aimed to determine the optimal strategy to enable the safe lifting of NPIs while avoiding virus resurgence. MethodsWe developed a compartmental deterministic SEIR model to simulate the lifting of NPIs under different vaccination rollout scenarios. Using case and vaccination data from Toronto, Canada between December 28, 2020 and May 19, 2021, we estimated transmission throughout past stages of NPI escalation/relaxation to compare the impact of lifting NPIs on different dates on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, given varying degrees of vaccine coverages by 20-year age groups, accounting for waning immunity. ResultsWe found that, once coverage among the elderly is high enough (80% with at least one dose), the main age groups to target are 20-39 and 40-59 years, whereby first-dose coverage of at least 70% by mid-June 2021 is needed to minimize the possibility of resurgence if NPIs are to be lifted in the summer. While a resurgence was observed for every scenario of NPI lifting, we also found that under an optimistic vaccination coverage (70% by mid-June, postponing reopening from August 2021 to September 2021can reduce case counts and severe outcomes by roughly 80% by December 31, 2021. ConclusionsOur results suggest that focusing the vaccination strategy on the working-age population can curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, even with high vaccination coverage in adults, lifting NPIs to pre-pandemic levels is not advisable since a resurgence is expected to occur, especially with earlier reopening.","output":"Mathematical modeling of vaccination rollout and NPIs lifting on COVID-19 transmission with VOC: a case study in Toronto, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Access to clean drinking water is a fundamental human right.

As a result, many Native American households remain without access to clean drinking water or adequate sanitation. Recent actions by the Biden Administration and Congress are bringing the necessary attention and financial resources to make real, tangible progress toward providing universal access to clean water for all Americans. Through bipartisan efforts, Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which included substantial funding for the Indian Health Service and Tribal funding within the Environmental Protection Agency, which can be used for drinking water projects for Tribal communities. For the first time in history, this funding will enable the federal government to more fully deliver on its responsibilities to provide basic drinking water service to Tribes.

However, the spatiotemporal variations and risk determinants of COVID-19 in typical labor export regions of China remain unclear. Understanding the geographical distribution of the disease and the socio-economic factors affecting its transmission is critical for disease prevention and control. METHODS: A total of 2152 COVID-19 cases were reported from January 21 to February 24, 2020 across the 34 cities in Henan and Anhui. A Bayesian spatiotemporal hierarchy model was used to detect the spatiotemporal variations of the risk posed by COVID-19, and the GeoDetector q statistic was used to evaluate the determinant power of the potential influence factors. RESULTS: The risk posed by COVID-19 showed geographical spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Temporally, there was an outbreak period and control period. Spatially, there were high-risk regions and low-risk regions. The high-risk regions were mainly in the southwest areas adjacent to Hubei and cities that served as economic and traffic hubs, while the low-risk regions were mainly in western Henan and eastern Anhui, far away from the epicenter. The accessibility, local economic conditions, and medical infrastructure of Wuhan in Hubei province all played an important role in the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission. The results indicated that the q statistics of the per capita GDP and the proportion of primary industry GDP were 0.47 and 0.47, respectively. The q statistic of the population flow from Wuhan was 0.33. In particular, the results showed that the q statistics for the interaction effects between population density and urbanization, population flow from Wuhan, per capita GDP, and the number of doctors were all greater than 0.8. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the labor export regions of China. The high-risk regions were mainly located in areas adjacent to the epicenter as well as in big cities that served as traffic hubs. Population access to the epicenter, as well as local economic and medical conditions, played an important role in the interactive effects of the disease transmission.

Patients who remained hospitalized were followed through May 1, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Renal replacement therapy included at least one session of dialysis, continued venovenous hemofiltration, or peritoneal dialysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline characteristics, laboratory markers, 30-day in-hospital outcomes, ventilator days, and survival to discharge were included. Multivariate predictors for mortality and need for renal replacement therapy were identified. A total of 330 patients were included in this analysis and were most commonly greater than or equal to 70 years (40%), male (61%), Black or African American (41%), and Hispanic or Latino (38%). Renal replacement therapy was required in 101 patients (29%), most commonly among Blacks or African Americans (50%). Elevated D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with renal replacement therapy, compared with the nondialysis cohort. Overall, 243 patients (74%) died and 56 (17%) were discharged from the hospital, of which 9 (3%) required renal replacement therapy. Male sex (odds ratio, 2.0; 1.1-3.5; p = 0.020), Black race (odds ratio, 1.8; 1.0-3.1; p = 0.453), and history of hypertension (odds ratio, 2.7; 1.3-5.4; p = 0.005) were predictors for requiring renal replacement therapy. Risk factors for in-hospital mortality included age greater than or equal to 60 years (odds ratio, 6.2; 3.0-13.0; p < 0.0001), male sex (odds ratio, 3.0; 1.4-6.4; p = 0.004), and body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m (odds ratio, 2.1; 1.0-4.4; p = 0.039).

The role of rapid-rate NSVT (RR-NSVT) documented by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in DCM patients has not been fully explored. This study aimed to determine the relationship between RR-NSVT and the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTAs) in DCM patients with ICD. METHODS: From December 2000 to December 2017, 136 DCM patients received ICD or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation for primary or secondary prevention of VTAs. Based on the occurrence of documented RR-NSVT, patients were classified into RR-NSVT (-) or RR-NSVT (+) groups. RESULT: During the median follow-up of 4.5 years, 50.0% (68/136) of patients experienced &#8805; 1 episode, and 25.0% (34/136) of patients experienced &#8805; 3 episodes of RR-NSVT. Event-free survival for VTAs was significantly higher in the RR-NSVT (-) group whereas those for heart failure admission and cardiovascular mortality were comparable between groups. In the multivariate cox regression analysis, any RR-NSVT showed a positive association with the occurrence of VTAs (HR: 5.087; 95% CI: 2.374-10.900; p<0.001). In RR-NSVT (+) patients, a cluster (&#8805; 3 times/6 months) and frequent pattern (&#8805; 3 runs/day) of RR-NSVT were observed in 42.6% (29/68) and 30.9% (21/68) of patients, respectively, who showed further increased incidence of VTAs.

Although the introduction of drugs targeting B-Raf has provided significant advances in cancer treatment, responses to ATP-competitive inhibitors remain limited, mainly due to selectivity issues, side effects, narrow therapeutic windows, and the insurgence of drug resistance. Impressive research efforts have been made so far towards the identification of novel ATP-competitive modulators with improved efficacy against cancers driven by mutant Raf monomers and dimers, some of them showing good promises.

A proactive solution that may minimize this risk is to regraft that donor site using otherwise discarded skin graft remnants. METHODS A prospective, nonrandomized, consecutive study was designed to compare the time to healing of the commonly used anterior thigh STSG donor site in patients who had routine dressings (n = 113) versus those with comorbidities known to adversely affect wound healing and had planned regrafting (n = 204). Those comorbidities included age (65 years), diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, chronic renal disease, and chronic steroid use. RESULTS The average number of comorbidities in the regrafted subgroup versus those not regrafted was 1.41 and 0.31, respectively. This was considered to be a significant difference (P < 0.0001) confirming the validity in predicting patients at risk for adverse donor-site healing that would benefit by regrafting. The mean time required for donor-site reepithelialization of those regrafted was 17.2 days compared with 17.8 days for those not regrafted (P = 0.2395), which was not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS Regrafting the STSG donor site of patients with known comorbidities, that is, those expected to have delayed healing in general, had a mean time to reepithelialization comparable with conventionally treated individuals.

Three main reasons for the new stagnation of Russian foreign investment expansion are identified: 1) the strengthening of \\"sanctions war\\" with the West after the election of Vladimir Putin for the 4th presidential term;2) the slowdown in the global economy in 2018-2019 against the background of relatively low prices for hydrocarbons and other raw materials exported from Russia;and 3) the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. These factors resulted in a reduction of both outward foreign direct investment stocks by Russian MNEs (partially due to revaluation of their assets after the collapse of the ruble rate), and a decrease in investments of wealthy Russians in foreign real estate as well as pseudo-foreign investment because of the regular attempts to conduct de-offshorization.

Although the impact of COVID-19 on African populations has been relatively light, it is feared that redirecting focus and prioritization of health systems to fight COVID-19 may have an impact on access to non-COVID-19 diseases. We applied age-based COVID-19 mortality data from China to the population structures of Uganda and non-African countries with previously established outbreaks, comparing theoretical mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost. We then predicted the impact of possible scenarios of the COVID-19 public health response on morbidity and mortality for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and maternal health in Uganda. Based on population age structure alone, Uganda is predicted to have a relatively low COVID-19 burden compared with an equivalent transmission in comparison countries, with 12% of the mortality and 19% of the lost DALYs predicted for an equivalent transmission in Italy. By contrast, scenarios of the impact of the public health response on malaria and HIV/AIDS predict additional disease burdens outweighing that predicted from extensive SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Emerging disease data from Uganda suggest that such deterioration may already be occurring. The results predict a relatively low COVID-19 impact on Uganda associated with its young population, with a high risk of negative impact on non-COVID-19 disease burden from a prolonged lockdown response. This may reverse hard-won gains in addressing fundamental vulnerabilities in women and children's health, and underlines the importance of tailoring COVID-19 responses according to population structure and local disease vulnerabilities.","output":"Predicting the Impact of COVID-19 and the Potential Impact of the Public Health Response on Disease Burden in Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It is crucial for medical decision-making and vaccination strategies to collect information on sustainability of immune responses after infection or vaccination, and how long-lasting antibodies against SARS-COV-2 could provide a humoral and protective immunity, preventing reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 or its variants. The aim of this study is to present a novel method to quantitatively measure and monitor the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody profiles over time. Methods: Two collections of serum samples were used in this study: A collection from 20 naturally-infected subjects (follow-ups to 1 year) and a collection from 83 subjects vaccinated with one or two doses of Pfizer BioNtech vaccine (BNT162b2/BNT162b2) (follow-ups to 6 months). The Multi-SARS-CoV-2 assay, a multiparameter serology test, developed for the serological confirmation of past-infections was used to determine the reactivity of six different SARS-CoV-2 antigens. For each patient sample, 3 dilutions (1/50, 1/400 and 1/3200) were defined as an optimal set over the six antigens and their respective linear ranges, allowing accurate quantitation of the corresponding six specific antibodies. Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling was applied to convert intensity readings from 3 determined dilutions to a single quantification value for each antibody. Results: Median half-life for the 20 naturally infected vs 74 vaccinated subjects (two doses) was respectively 120 vs 50 days for RBD, 127 vs 53 days for S1 and 187 vs 86 days for S2 antibodies. Respectively, 90% of the antibody concentration wanes after 158 vs 398 days for RBD, 171 vs 420 days for S1, and 225 vs 620 days for S2 after the second vaccine shot. Conclusion: The newly proposed method, based on a series of a limited number of dilutions, can convert a conventional qualitative assay into a quantitative assay. This conversion helps define the sustainability of specific immune responses against each relevant viral antigen and can help in defining the protection characteristics after an infection or a vaccination.","output":"A novel assessment method for COVID-19 humoral immunity duration using serial measurements in naturally-infected and vaccinated subjects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Implantation of meshes in a contaminated environment can be complicated by mesh infection and adhesion formation.

Mesh infection, intra-abdominal abscess formation, adhesion formation, incorporation and shrinkage were evaluated after 28 and 90 days. Histological examination with haematoxylin and eosin and picrosirius red staining was performed. RESULTS No mesh infections occurred in Sepramesh(?) , Omyramesh(?) and Strattice(?) . One mesh infection occurred in Parietene(?) and Parietene Composite(?) . Significantly more mesh infections were found in C-Qur(?) (15 of 16; P  0006) and Dualmesh(?) (7 of 15; P  0035). Sepramesh(?) showed a significant increase in adhesion coverage from 125 per cent at 28 days to 600 per cent at 90 days (P = 0010). At 90 days there was no significant difference between median adhesion coverage of Parietene Composite(?) (350 per cent), Omyramesh(?) (425 per cent), Sepramesh(?) (600 per cent) and Parietene(?)

The aim of this study is to investigate the relation between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) change after NAC and histological response and oncological outcomes in patients with esophageal cancer. METHODS This study enrolled 209 patients who underwent NAC and thoracic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer as the primary treatment between 2000 and 2019 in our department. Several predictors of survival including NLR change, which was calculated as post-NAC NLR/pre-NAC NLR, were investigated. We used classification and regression tree (CART) analysis to determine the optimal cutoff values of NLR change for the prediction of histological response. RESULTS The best cutoff value of NLR change was 0.55 using the CART analysis. Then we divided all patients into two groups; the patients with NLR change below the cutoff were allocated to the NLR reduction group (n = 53), whereas the patients with NLR change above the cutoff were allocated to the no-NLR reduction group (n = 156). NLR change was identified as a significant predictor for histological responder (odds ratio 3.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.69-8.58; p = 0.001) and recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio 0.55; 95% CI 0.33-0.89; p = 0.015) in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION The present study demonstrated that NLR change is associated with both histological response to and oncological outcomes of NAC for patients with esophageal cancer.

Being actively engaged in fighting against COVID-19 exposes nurses to a high risk of being infected but can also have a serious impact on their mental health, as they are faced with excessive workload and emotional burden in many front-line operating contexts. Purpose: The aim of the study is to analyze how risk factors such as perceived impact, preparedness to the pandemic, and worries were associated with mental health outcomes (crying, rumination and stress) in nurses. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was performed via an online questionnaire survey. Participants included 894 registered nurses from Italy. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. Multiple binary logistic regression was carried out to analyze the relationship between risk factors and health outcomes. Results: Increased job stress was related to higher levels of rumination about the pandemic (OR = 4.04, p < 0.001), job demand (OR = 2.00, p < 0.001), impact on job role (OR = 2.56, p < 0.001), watching coworkers crying at work (OR = 1.50, p < 0.05), non-work-related concerns (OR = 2.28, p < 0.001), and fear of getting infected (OR = 2.05, p < 0.001). Job stress (OR = 2.52, p < 0.01), rumination (OR = 2.28, p < 0.001), and watching colleagues crying (OR = 7.92, p < 0.001) were associated with crying at work. Rumination was associated with caring for patients who died of COVID-19 (OR = 1.54, p < 0.05), job demand (OR = 1.70, p < 0.01), watching colleagues crying (OR = 1.81, p < 0.001), non-work-related worries (OR = 1.57, p < 0.05), and fear of getting infected (OR = 2.02, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The psychological impact that this pandemic may cause in the medium/long term could be greater than the economical one.

First, images were scored visually. Second, region of interest (ROI) based quantitative measurements of CT attenuation were performed in the inferior vena cava (IVC), portal vein and in four TIPS locations. Minimum, maximum and average Hounsfield unit (HU) values were used as absolute and relative quantitative features. We analyzed the features with univariate testing. RESULTS: Subjective scores identified in-TIPS thrombosis in contrast-enhanced scans with an accuracy of 0.667 C 0.833.

METHODS Content validation was completed using a four-phase modified Delphi Method. During Phase I, a Professional Education Committee subgroup proposed domains and items, which were rated by the APOS Fellows and Board via online survey. During Phase II, Fellows completed a second, revised survey. Phase III incorporated early career members. Developmental and diversity items were integrated into each domain. In Phase IV, a larger group of subject matter experts were surveyed, with feedback incorporated. Validation across phases involved average rating thresholds, intraclass correlations, and final percent agreement. RESULTS The Delphi Method supported 12 content domains: Cancer Basics, Psychosocial Oncology, Professional Development, Ethics, Emotional/Psychological Concerns, Sexuality and Relationship Concerns, Spiritual/Religious Concerns, Healthcare Communication and Decision Making, Social/Practical Problems, Caregiver Concerns, Cognitive Concerns, Physical Symptoms and Psychosocial Assessment/Treatment.

AIM To review the existing data of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT for the diagnosis of bone metastases in prostate cancer. METHODS Systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature. RESULTS Among 1858 papers in the original search, 37 papers were included in the analysis (six case reports and 31 case series). The vast majority of the studies were low-level evidence studies. Most studies presented data on detection rates without a reference standard. All but two studies were of a retrospective nature. Several cohort studies showed bone metastasis in 5-60% of patients with prostate cancer, including in patients with very low-PSA values. For primary staging, 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT outperformed bone scans, while the superiority of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT compared with bone scans with respect to biochemical recurrence and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains to be demonstrated. CONCLUSION 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT has shown to be a promising technique for use in prostate cancer. 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT shows more lesions than bone scans, but data on diagnostic performance are very limited and indicate improved diagnostic performance in primary staging but not in mCRPC.

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe-PMC for published studies and pre-prints that reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and/or IgA antibodies for serosurveys of the general community from 1 Jan to 12 Aug 2020. RESULTS: Of the 2199 studies identified, 170 were assessed for full text and 17 studies representing 15 regions and 118,297 subjects were includable. The seroprevalence proportions in 8 studies ranged between 1%-10%, with 5 studies under 1%, and 4 over 10%-from the notably hard-hit regions of Gangelt, Germany; Northwest Iran; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Stockholm, Sweden.

A critical evaluation of this approach is imperative to optimize this paradigm shift in research. ObjectiveTo assess design and implementation factors required to maximize enrollment and retention in a fully remote, longitudinal COVID-19 testing study. DesignFully remote longitudinal study launched in October 2020 and ongoing; Study data reported through July 2021. SettingBrigham and Womens Hospital, Boston MA ParticipantsAdults, 18 years or older, within 45 miles of Boston, MA. InterventionMonthly and \\"on-demand\\" at-home SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and antibody testing using nasal swab and dried blood spot self-collection kits and electronic surveys to assess symptoms and risk factors for COVID-19. Main OutcomesEnrollment, retention, and lessons learned. ResultsBetween October 2020 and January 2021, we enrolled 10,289 participants reflective of Massachusetts census data. Mean age was 47 years (range 18-93), 5855 (56.9%) were assigned female sex at birth, 7181(69.8%) reported being White non-Hispanic, 952 (9.3%) Hispanic/Latinx, 925 (9.0%) Black, 889 (8.6%) Asian, and 342 (3.3%) other and/or more than one race. Lower initial enrollment among Black and Hispanic/Latinx individuals required an adaptive approach, leveraging connections to the medical system, coupled with community partnerships to ensure a representative cohort. Longitudinal retention was higher among participants who were White non-Hispanic, older, working remotely, and with lower socioeconomic vulnerability. Considerable infrastructure, including a dedicated participant support team and robust technology platforms was required to reduce barriers to enrollment, promote retention, ensure scientific rigor, improve data quality, and enable an adaptive study design to increase real-world accessibility. ConclusionsThe decentralization of clinical trials through remote models offers tremendous potential to engage representative cohorts, scale biomedical research, and promote accessibility by reducing barriers common in traditional trial design. Our model highlights the critical role that hospital-community partnerships play in remote recruitment, and the work still needed to ensure representative enrollment. Barriers and burdens within remote trials may be experienced disproportionately across demographic groups. To maximize engagement and retention, researchers should prioritize intensive participant support, investment in technologic infrastructure and an adaptive approach to maximize engagement and retention.

Age-related changes in multiple aspects of the adaptive immune response to influenza have been well-documented including a decline in antibody responses to influenza vaccination and changes in the cell-mediated response associated with immune senescence. This review will focus on T cell responses to influenza and influenza vaccination in older adults, and how increasing frailty or coexistence of multiple (2) chronic conditions contributes to the loss of vaccine effectiveness for the prevention of hospitalization. Further, dysregulation of the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators contributes to a decline in the generation of an effective CD8 T cell response needed to clear influenza virus from the lungs. Current influenza vaccines provide only a weak stimulus to this arm of the adaptive immune response and rely on re-stimulation of CD8 T cell memory related to prior exposure to influenza virus.

Some tertiary centers were designated as COVID-only hospitals, making it difficult for existing childhood cancer patients to continue their treatment at those centres. The need for shared care in childhood cancer was perceived by Cankids and its partnering childhood cancer-treating centers in North and East India. AIM: We aim to show how Cankids upscaled its shared care model to ensure that COVID designated hospitals connected with other hospitals who have to continue to provide care to childhood cancer patients in the pandemic and thus ensured the continuation of treatment for these patients. METHODS AND RESULT: The need assessment of the beneficiaries was done in discussion with the hospital of origin and destination hospital. The need for shared care was also discussed with the families and consent was taken before shifting their children. Cankids with the help of advisors identified cases of high risk that need immediate attention, proactive regular monitoring, and help in care planning with the perspective and recommendation of the multiple providers. The shared care unit came forward with reasonable and discounted packages for treatment. There was a total of five hospitals requiring shared care, and 55 children were supported from April to November 2020. The median age was 8 years and their hospital of origin are in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Delhi. The expenditure on the treatment of the 55 patients was INR 61 61 636 ($ 84 843), with a median of INR 41765 (IQR 19491-174 129) on each patient. Total 291 trips for the transport were arranged and all the patients combined stayed 174 days at Cankids accommodation facility.

Nascent DNA at the regressed arms of these reversed forks is protected by RAD51 and the tumor suppressors BRCA1/2, and when this function is compromised, stalled forks undergo pathological MRE11-dependent degradation, leading to chromosomal instability. However, the mechanisms regulating MRE11 functions at reversed forks are currently unclear. Here, we identify the MRE11-binding protein MRNIP as a novel fork protection factor that directly binds to MRE11 and specifically represses its exonuclease activity. The loss of MRNIP results in impaired replication fork progression, MRE11 exonuclease-dependent degradation of reversed forks, persistence of underreplicated genomic regions, chemosensitivity, and chromosome instability. Our findings identify MRNIP as a novel regulator of MRE11 at reversed forks and provide evidence that regulation of specific MRE11 nuclease activities ensures protection of nascent DNA and thereby genome integrity.","output":"MRNIP is a replication fork protection factor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Since March 2020, when COVID-19 pandemic broke out, the world's healthcare systems' main concern has been fighting the pandemic.

However, a minority suffers from critical disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: To identify individuals at risk of critical COVID-19, the relevance of a seroreactivity against seasonal human coronaviruses was analyzed. METHODS: We conducted a multi-center non-interventional study comprising 296 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections from four tertiary care referral centers in Germany and France. The ICU group comprised more males, whereas the outpatient group contained a higher percentage of females. For each patient, the serum or plasma sample obtained closest after symptom onset was examined by immunoblot regarding IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein (NP) of HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1. RESULTS: Median age was 60 years (range 18-96). Patients with critical disease (n=106) had significantly lower levels of anti-HCoV OC43 nucleocapsid protein (NP)-specific antibodies compared to other COVID-19 inpatients (p=0.007). In multivariate analysis (adjusted for age, sex and BMI), OC43 negative inpatients had an increased risk of critical disease (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.68 [95% CI 1.09 - 7.05]), higher than the risk by increased age or BMI, and lower than the risk by male sex. A risk stratification based on sex and OC43 serostatus was derived from this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prior infections with seasonal human coronaviruses can protect against a severe course of COVID-19. Therefore, anti-OC43 antibodies should be measured for COVID-19 inpatients and considered as part of the risk assessment for each patient. Hence, we expect individuals tested negative for anti-OC43 antibodies to particularly benefit from vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, especially with other risk factors prevailing.","output":"Lack of antibodies against seasonal coronavirus OC43 nucleocapsid protein identifies patients at risk of critical COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of mask and face shield has been established as one of the main preventive measures for the control of COVID 19 spread.

Professional organizations have provided guidance for practitioners, but real-world examples of the consults and responsibilities cardiac electrophysiologists face during a surge of COVID-19 patients is lacking. METHODS: In this observational case series we report on 29 consecutive inpatient electrophysiology consultations at a major academic medical center in New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, during a 2 week period from March 30-April 12, 2020, when 80% of hospital beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients, and the New York City metropolitan area accounted for 10% of COVID-19 cases worldwide. RESULTS: Reasons for consultation included: Atrial tachyarrhythmia (31%), cardiac implantable electronic device management (28%), bradycardia (14%), QTc prolongation (10%), ventricular arrhythmia (7%), post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement conduction abnormality (3.5%), ventricular pre-excitation (3.5%), and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (3.5%). Twenty-four patients (86%) were positive for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab. All elective procedures were canceled, and only one urgent device implantation was performed. Thirteen patients (45%) required in-person evaluation and the remainder were managed remotely.

This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of contemporary animal models of cardiac arrest. METHODS Using a comprehensive research strategy, we searched PubMed and EMBASE from March 8, 2011 to March 8, 2016 for cardiac arrest animal models. Two investigators reviewed titles and abstracts for full text inclusion from which data were extracted according to pre-defined definitions. RESULTS Search criteria yielded 1741 unique titles and abstracts of which 490 full articles were included. The most common animals used were pigs (52%) followed by rats (35%) and mice (6%). Studies favored males (52%) over females (16%); 17% of studies included both sexes, while 14% omitted to report on sex. The most common methods for induction of cardiac arrest were either electrically-induced ventricular fibrillation (54%), asphyxia (25%), or potassium (8%). The median no-flow time was 8min (quartiles: 5, 8, range: 0-37min). The majority of studies used adrenaline during resuscitation (64%), while bicarbonate (17%), vasopressin (8%) and other drugs were used less prevalently. In 53% of the studies, the post-cardiac arrest observation time was 24h. Neurological function was an outcome in 48% of studies while 43% included assessment of a cardiac outcome.

We compared the differences in the risk of COVID-19 related death between ethnic groups in the first and second waves the of COVID-19 pandemic in England. We also investigated whether the factors explaining differences in COVID-19 death between ethnic groups changed between the two waves. Methods: Using data from the Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset on individuals aged 30-100 years living in private households, we conducted an observational cohort study to examine differences in the risk of death involving COVID-19 between ethnic groups in the first wave (from 24th January 2020 until 31st August 2020) and second wave (from 1st September to 28th December 2020). We estimated age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) in the two waves stratified by ethnic groups and sex. We also estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for ethnic-minority groups compared with the White British population, adjusted for geographical factors, socio-demographic characteristics, and pre-pandemic health conditions. Results: The study population included over 28.9 million individuals aged 30-100 years living in private households. In the first wave, all ethnic minority groups had a higher risk of COVID-19 related death compared to the White British population. In the second wave, the risk of COVID-19 death remained elevated for people from Pakistani (ASMR: 339.9 [95% CI: 303.7 - 376.2] and 166.8 [141.7 - 191.9] deaths per 100,000 population in men and women) and Bangladeshi (318.7 [247.4 - 390.1] and 127.1 [91.1 - 171.3] in men and women)background but not for people from Black ethnic groups. Adjustment for geographical factors explained a large proportion of the differences in COVID-19 mortality in the first wave but not in the second wave. Despite an attenuation of the elevated risk of COVID-19 mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and health status, the risk was substantially higher in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background in both the first and the second waves. Conclusion: Between the first and second waves of the pandemic, the reduction in the difference in COVID-19 mortality between people from Black ethnic background and people from the White British group shows that ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality can be addressed.

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the use of a scoring system for standardized triage of elective CV procedures. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients scheduled for elective CV procedures that were prioritized ad hoc to be either performed or deferred when New Jersey state orders limited the performance of elective procedures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients in both groups were scored using our proposed CV medically necessary, time-sensitive (MeNTS) procedure scorecard, designed to stratify procedures based on a composite measure of hospital resource utilization, risk of COVID-19 exposure, and time sensitivity. RESULTS: A total of 109 scheduled elective procedures were either deferred (n = 58) or performed (n = 51). The median and mean cumulative CV MeNTS scores for the group of performed cases were significantly lower than for the deferred group (26 (interquartile range (IQR) 22-31) vs. 33 (IQR 28-39), p < .001, and 26.4 (SE 0.34) vs. 32.9 (SE 0.35), p < .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The CV MeNTS procedure score was able to stratify elective cases that were either performed or deferred using an ad hoc strategy.

However, these associations vary significantly across zip codes with predominantly Black, Hispanic or white populations. For instance, high grocery store access has a significantly larger association with higher fruit and vegetable consumption in zip codes with predominantly Hispanic populations (7.4% difference) and Black populations (10.2% difference) in contrast to zip codes with predominantly white populations (1.7% difference).

We assessed the impact of COVID-19 on migrants in these settings. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of policy documents and national surveillance data to identify COVID-19 outbreaks and estimate incidence among migrants residing in these camps (26th Feb - 15th Nov 2020). Incidence proportion (IP) of COVID-19 confirmed cases was calculated for three population groups (migrant populations in RICs, migrant populations in RSs, and the general population in Greece) during three time periods (first wave, second wave, and overall across the 9-month period). RESULTS: 25 outbreaks were identified in migrant reception facilities, with 6 (85.7%) of 7 RICs and 18 (56.3%) of 32 RSs reporting at least one outbreak during the study period. The overall 9-month COVID-19 IP among refugee and asylum seeker populations residing in RSs on the Greek mainland was 1,758 cases per 100,000 population; in RICs the incidence was 2,052 cases per 100,000 population. Compared to the general population the risk of COVID-19 infection among migrants in reception facilities was 2.5 to 3 times higher; the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection was higher among migrant populations in RSs on the Greek mainland (IP ratio: 2.45; 95% CI: 2.25-2.68) but higher still among migrant populations in RICs in the Greek islands and the land border with Turkey (IP ratio: 2.86; 95% CI: 2.64-3.10), where living conditions are particularly poor. CONCLUSIONS: We identified high levels of COVID-19 transmission among migrants in reception facilities in Greece, with immediate implications for policy and practice to ensure refugee and asylum seeker populations are included in national response plans to reduce transmission, alongside ensuring their inclusion in plans for COVID-19 vaccine roll out.

At moderate rate, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are evolving which might have contributed to viral genome variability, transmission, replication efficiency and virulence in different regions of the world. The present study elucidated the mutational landscape in SARS-CoV-2 genome among the African population, which may have contributed to the virulence, pathogenicity and transmission observed in the region. Multiple sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (356 viral protein sequences) was performed using ClustalX version 2.1 and phylogenetic tree was built using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) X software. ORF1ab polyprotein, spike glycoprotein, ORF3, ORF8 and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein were observed as mutational hotspots in the African population and may be of keen interest in the adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. While, there is conservation in the envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10. The accumulation of moderate mutations (though slowly) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome as revealed in our study, could be a promising strategy to develop drugs or vaccines with respect to the viral conserved domains and host cellular proteins and/or receptors involved in viral invasion and replication to avoid a new viral wave due to drug resistance and vaccine evasion.","output":"Mutational Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Genome in African Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale The respiratory tract constitutes an elaborated line of defense based on a unique cellular ecosystem. Single-cell profiling methods enable the investigation of cell population distributions and transcriptional changes along the airways. Methods We have explored cellular heterogeneity of the human airway epithelium in 10 healthy living volunteers by single-cell RNA profiling. 77,969 cells were collected by bronchoscopy at 35 distinct locations, from the nose to the 12th division of the airway tree. Results The resulting atlas is composed of a high percentage of epithelial cells (89.1%), but also immune (6.2%) and stromal (4.7%) cells with peculiar cellular proportions in different sites of the airways. It reveals differential gene expression between identical cell types (suprabasal, secretory, and multiciliated cells) from the nose (MUC4, PI3, SIX3) and tracheobronchial (SCGB1A1, TFF3) airways. By contrast, cell-type specific gene expression was stable across all tracheobronchial samples. Our atlas improves the description of ionocytes, pulmonary neuro-endocrine (PNEC) and brush cells, which are likely derived from a common population of precursor cells. We also report a population of KRT13 positive cells with a high percentage of dividing cells which are reminiscent of hillock cells previously described in mouse. Conclusions Robust characterization of this unprecedented large single-cell cohort establishes an important resource for future investigations. The precise description of the continuum existing from nasal epithelium to successive divisions of lung airways and the stable gene expression profile of these regions better defines conditions under which relevant tracheobronchial proxies of human respiratory diseases can be developed.","output":"A single-cell atlas of the human healthy airways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic poses a huge threat internationally; however, the role of the host immune system in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not well understood. METHODS: Cytokine and chemokine levels and characterisation of immune cell subsets from 20 COVID-19 cases after hospital admission (17 critically ill and 3 severe patients) and 16 convalescent patients were determined using a multiplex immunoassay and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: IP-10, MCP-1, MIG, IL-6, and IL-10 levels were significantly higher in acute severe/critically ill patients with COVID-19, whereas were normal in patients who had reached convalescence. CD8 T cells in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients expressed high levels of cytotoxic granules (granzyme B and perforin)and was hyperactivated as evidenced by the high proportions of CD38. Furthermore, the cytotoxic potential of natural killer (NK) cells, and the frequencies of myeloid dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells was reduced in patients with severe and critical COVID-19; however, these dysregulations were found to be restored in convalescent phases. CONCLUSION: Thus, elicitation of the hyperactive cytokine-mediated inflammatory response, dysregulation of CD8 T and NK cells, and deficiency of host myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs, may contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies.","output":"Immunological and inflammatory profiles during acute and convalescent phases of severe/ critically ill COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccines are considered promising agents in the control of the pandemic.

We also review the benefits and risks of the vaccines approved in the European Union and provide recommendations. A review of the literature was performed using Medline/PubMed electronic database as well as institutional and pharmaco-vigilance official reports. Our findings show that vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia has been suggested as a very rare AE associated with viral vector vaccines. Unusual thrombotic events combined with moderate-to-severe thrombocytopenia were reported mainly in women under 60 years of age. As safety signals emerged, Vaxzevria and Janssens COVID-19 vaccine campaigns have been paused while investigations proceed. On the other hand, the number of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism reports have not increased. Post-marketing surveillance indicated that mRNA vaccines are safe and should continue to be used. The thrombotic events report rate is not increased in people over 60 years. As they are at greater risk for COVID-19 complications and death, no vaccine restrictions are recommended in this group. Risk factors for vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia should be established so that evidence-based decisions can be made.

Second, although the supervised machine learning method performs best for sugarcane mapping, the combined use of both classification methods improves sugarcane mapping precision at the cost of worsening sugarcane recall and missing some actual sugarcane area. Third, machine learning image classification using high-resolution satellite imagery showed significant potential for sugarcane mapping.

We developed and evaluated an interactive web tool providing transparent and reliable information on the benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: The most recent scientific data at the time of the study were implemented into an interactive web tool offering individualized information on the risks of COVID-19 infection-related events versus vaccination-related serious adverse events. The tool was evaluated during a before-and-after impact study nested in ComPaRe, a French e-cohort of adult patients with chronic conditions. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients intending to receive vaccination after using the tool, among those not intending to receive it at baseline. RESULTS: Between January 8 and 14, 2021, we enrolled 3152 patients in the study [mean age 55.2 (SD: 16.9), 52.9% women and 63% with  2 chronic conditions]. Before consulting the tool, 961 (30.5%) refused to be vaccinated until further data on efficacy/safety was obtained and 239 (7.5%) outright refused vaccination. Among these 1200 patients, 96 (8.0%, number needed to treat: 12.5) changed their mind after consulting the tool and would subsequently accept vaccination.

Through the joint efforts of ministries, mass media, social networks and volunteer movements, an unprecedented social mobilization of the population was achieved. Strict implementation of the entire set of measures aimed at fighting the epidemic allowed to take it under strict control at the third stage and practically eliminate the epidemic after 2,5 months.

Several taxonomies of uncertainty have been developed, but mainly focus on decisions in clinical settings. Our goal was to develop a holistic model of uncertainty that can be applied to both clinical as well as public and global health scenarios. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus and Google scholar in March 2021 for literature reviews, qualitative studies and case studies related to classifications or models of uncertainty in healthcare. Empirical articles were assessed for study limitations using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist. We synthesised the literature using a thematic analysis and developed a dynamic multilevel model of uncertainty. We sought patient input to assess relatability of the model and applied it to two case examples. RESULTS: We screened 4125 studies and included 15 empirical studies, 13 literature reviews and 5 case studies. We identified 77 codes and organised these into 26 descriptive and 11 analytical themes of uncertainty. The themes identified are global, public health, healthcare system, clinical, ethical, relational, personal, knowledge exchange, epistemic, aleatoric and parameter uncertainty. The themes were included in a model, which captures the macro, meso and microlevels and the inter-relatedness of uncertainty. We successfully piloted the model on one public health example and an environmental topic. The main limitations are that the research input into our model predominantly came from North America and Europe, and that we have not yet tested the model in a real-life setting. CONCLUSION: We developed a model that can comprehensively capture uncertainty in public and global health scenarios. It builds on models that focus solely on clinical settings by including social and political contexts and emphasising the dynamic interplay between different areas of uncertainty.","output":"Developing an integrated multilevel model of uncertainty in health care: a qualitative systematic review and thematic synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic brought the dual crises of disease and the containment policies designed to mitigate it.

We aimed to systematically review the evidence for the duration of protection of COVID-19 vaccines against various clinical outcomes, and to assess changes in the rates of breakthrough infection caused by the delta variant with increasing time since vaccination. METHODS: This study was designed as a systematic review and meta-regression. We did a systematic review of preprint and peer-reviewed published article databases from June 17, 2021, to Dec 2, 2021. Randomised controlled trials of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and observational studies of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness were eligible. Studies with vaccine efficacy or effectiveness estimates at discrete time intervals of people who had received full vaccination and that met predefined screening criteria underwent full-text review. We used random-effects meta-regression to estimate the average change in vaccine efficacy or effectiveness 1C6 months after full vaccination. FINDINGS: Of 13 744 studies screened, 310 underwent full-text review, and 18 studies were included (all studies were carried out before the omicron variant began to circulate widely). Risk of bias, established using the risk of bias 2 tool for randomised controlled trials or the risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions tool was low for three studies, moderate for eight studies, and serious for seven studies. We included 78 vaccine-specific vaccine efficacy or effectiveness evaluations (PfizerCBioNTech-Comirnaty, n=38; Moderna-mRNA-1273, n=23; Janssen-Ad26.COV2.S, n=9; and AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria, n=8). On average, vaccine efficacy or effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased from 1 month to 6 months after full vaccination by 210 percentage points (95% CI 139C298) among people of all ages and 207 percentage points (102C366) among older people (as defined by each study, who were at least 50 years old). For symptomatic COVID-19 disease, vaccine efficacy or effectiveness decreased by 249 percentage points (95% CI 134C416) in people of all ages and 320 percentage points (110C690) in older people. For severe COVID-19 disease, vaccine efficacy or effectiveness decreased by 100 percentage points (95% CI 61C154) in people of all ages and 95 percentage points (57C146) in older people. Most (81%) vaccine efficacy or effectiveness estimates against severe disease remained greater than 70% over time.

By contrast, vaccine efficacy or effectiveness against infection and symptomatic disease decreased approximately 20C30 percentage points by 6 months. The decrease in vaccine efficacy or effectiveness is likely caused by, at least in part, waning immunity, although an effect of bias cannot be ruled out.

The epithelialCmesenchymal transition (EMT) is now a universal explanation for the mechanisms of tumor metastasis. -chimeric protein (-chimaerin, CHN1) plays an important role in the regulation of signal transduction and development. However, the molecular regulatory relationships between CHN1 and CC progression in relation to EMT have not yet been identified. METHODS: The expression of CHN1 in CC tissues, adjacent tissues, and lymph node metastases from CC patients was detected by immunohistochemistry. Upregulation and knockdown of CHN1 were achieved by transfection of CC cells. The effect of CHN1 on cell proliferation was determined by CCK-8 and plate clone formation assays. Changes in migration and invasion capabilities were evaluated using scratch migration and transwell invasion assays. The effect of CHN1 overexpression and interference on xenograft tumor growth was determined by tumor weight and pathological analyses. The expression of EMT-related mRNAs was measured by qRT-PCR in transfected CC cells. EMT-related proteins and Akt/GSK-3/Snail signaling pathway-related proteins were also evaluated by western blotting. RESULTS: CHN1 was overexpressed in CC tissues and was associated with lymph node metastasis and low survival in CC patients. Overexpression of CHN1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in CC cells. In contrast, silencing of CHN1 inhibited these phenomena. Overexpression of CHN1 promoted tumor formation in an in vivo xenograft tumor mouse model, with increased tumor volumes and weights. In addition, CHN1 induced the expression of EMT-related transcription factors, accompanied by the decreased expression of epithelial markers and increased expression of mesenchymal markers. The Akt/GSK-3/Snail signaling pathway was activated by overexpression of CHN1 in vitro, and activation of this pathway was inhibited by the signaling pathway inhibitor LY294002. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CHN1 promotes the development and progression of cervical carcinoma via the Akt/GSK-3/Snail pathway by inducing EMT.

The aim of this study was to research the COVID-19 risks due to the occupational exposure of HCW and the clinical characteristics of the affected. Material and Methods: In this retrospective study, HCW, employed by The mraniye Research and Training Hospital, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between 20th March 2020 to 20th May 2020 were analysed. Results: A total of 128 (3.8%) HCW were diagnosed with COVID-19. Most of the infected HCW were medical staff (34%), nurses (24%), physicians (22%) and staff with no patient contact (20%). Fifty-six percent of the infected HCW were working in COVID-19 wards and out-patient clinics. Twenty-nine percent acquired the infection in hospital from an index patient and 32% of them from an infected HCW. The highest transmission was during the sharing of the same environment (53%) like offices. Thirteen per cent of the HCW took the virus during examination or treatment, 31% of the individuals were unaware of the transmission. The number of the infected HCW was higher during the beginning of the outbreak in Turkey. The symptomatic cases were more (88%) than the asymptomatic cases (12%). A total of 28 (22%) HCW were hospitalised and only 4% of the cases were severe. Conclusion: The asymptomatic COVID-19 carrying HCW are to be considered as the source of the spread of the disease among their colleagues. Stricter measures should be implemented to prevent in-hospital transmission. ? 2021 by Trkiye Klinikleri.","output":"Transmission and Clinical Characteristic of COVID-19 in Healthcare Workers: Cross-sectional Study: Turkiye Klinkeri Journal of Medical Sciences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Population growth, the impacts of climate change, and the need for greater water security have made the reuse of wastewater, including potable use, increasingly desirable. As interest in potable reuse of wastewater increases, a variety of processes have been proposed for advanced water treatment following conventional wastewater treatment. In all cases, the operation and performance of advanced water treatment facilities (AWTFs) is improved when the treated wastewater feed is of the highest quality that can be achieved and the advanced water treatment (AWT) processes are operated at a constant flow. One proven method of optimizing the performance of wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs) is constant flow operation with no extraneous return flows other than internal process recycle flows, such as return settled solids. A number of approaches can be used to achieve constant flow including flow equalization, divided treatment trains, and satellite treatment. The ways in which constant flow wastewater treatment benefits both WWTFs as well as the AWTFs are considered with special emphasis on the ability to achieve predictable log removal credits (LRCs) for specific microorganisms. Actual performance data from constant flow WWTFs are used to illustrate how LRCs are determined. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Constant flow WWTFs should be considered to produce the highest quality secondary effluent for AWT. Flow equalization, divided treatment trains, and satellite treatment can be used to achieve constant flow to optimize wastewater treatment in small and medium size WWTFs. Flow equalization can be used to maximize the amount of wastewater that can be recovered for potable reuse. Important benefits of constant flow for wastewater treatment facilities include economic and operational savings, stable and predictable treatment performance, energy savings, ability to optimize performance for the removal of specific constituents, and the ability to assign pathogen log removal credits (LRCs). Important benefits of constant flow and optimized WWT for AWTFs include economic and operational savings; less pretreatment needed, including energy and chemical usage; elimination of the need to cycle treatment processes; and added factor of safety with respect to the required pathogen LRCs. In large WWTFs, constant flow for AWTFs will typically be achieved by effluent diversion; depending on the effluent quality additional pretreatment may be needed. The design and implementation of WWTFs and AWTFs for potable reuse should be integrated for optimal performance and protection of public health.","output":"Rationale for constant flow to optimize wastewater treatment and advanced water treatment performance for potable reuse applications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in a rapid expansion of telehealth services in hepatology. However, known racial and socioeconomic disparities in internet access potentially translate into barriers for the use of telehealth, particularly video technology. The specific aim of this study was to determine if disparities in race or socioeconomic status exist among patients utilizing telehealth visits during COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients evaluated in hepatology clinics at Duke University Health System. Visit attempts from a pre-COVID baseline period (January 1, 2020 through February 29, 2020; n = 3328) were compared to COVID period (April 1, 2020 through May 30, 2020; n = 3771). RESULTS: On multinomial regression modeling, increasing age was associated with higher odds of a phone or incomplete visit (canceled, no-show, or rescheduled after May 30,2020), and non-Hispanic Black race was associated with nearly twice the odds of completing a phone visit instead of video visit, compared to non-Hispanic White patients. Compared to private insurance, Medicaid and Medicare were associated with increased odds of completing a telephone visit, and Medicaid was associated with increased odds of incomplete visits. Being single or previously married (separated, divorced, widowed) was associated with increased odds of completing a phone compared to video visit compared to being married.

In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic approach to schedule PPE orders among healthcare facilities. In this PPE game, each independent healthcare facility optimises its own storage utilisation in order to keep its PPE cost at a minimum. Such a model can reduce peak demand considerably when applied to a variable PPE consumption profile. Experiments conducted for NHS England regions using actual data confirm that the challenge of securing PPE supply during disasters such as COVID-19 can be eased if proper stock management procedures are adopted. These procedures can include early stockpiling, increasing storage capacities and implementing measures that can prolong the time period between successive infection waves, such as social distancing measures. Simulation results suggest that the provision of PPE dedicated storage space can be a viable solution to avoid straining PPE supply chains in case a second wave of COVID-19 infections occurs.","output":"Game theory to enhance stock management of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a major public health emergency worldwide with over 118.27-million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 2.62-million deaths recorded, as of March 12, 2021. Although this disease primarily targets lungs, damages in other organs, such as heart, kidney, liver, and testis, may occur. Testis is the cornerstone of male reproduction, while reproductive health is the most valuable resource for continuity of the human race. Given the unique nature of SARS-CoV-2, the mechanisms of its impact on the testes have yet to be fully explored. Notably, coronaviruses have been found to invade target cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which can be found in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, urinary tract, and reproductive organs, such as testes. Coronavirus studies have suggested that testes might be a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The first etiopathogenic concept proposed by current hypotheses indicates that the virus can invade testes through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Next, the activated inflammatory response in the testes, disease-associated fever, and COVID-19 medications might be implicated in testicular alterations. Although evidence regarding the presence of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA in semen remains controversial, this emphasizes the need for researchers to pay closer attention to sexually transmitted diseases and male fertility after recovering from COVID-19.

With fellowship interviews beginning in April 2020, there was minimal time to adapt. Each program rapidly developed its own platform, expectations, materials, and process for interviews, and applicants were exposed to a wide array of variability in the process - all while under the stress of interviewing for fellowship positions. AIMS The aim of this survey-based study was to obtain input from applicants to help guide program decisions about \\"best practice\\" for the future for both pediatric anesthesiology and other graduate medical education matches. METHODS A 28-question survey was developed utilizing Qualtrics. An anonymous link was sent to all pediatric anesthesiology program directors for distribution of the survey link to all recently matched applicants. Incoming fellows who were accepted outside of the match process were also invited to respond. RESULTS 50 respondents completed the survey, for a response rate of 30% based on the 167 matched fellowship positions nationwide (50/167). A majority of the respondents reported they felt virtual interviews allowed them to learn the following things equally as well compared with a traditional interview about fellowship programs: salary and benefits, available academic opportunities, available clinical opportunities, clinical schedule of the fellowship, mentorship opportunities, clinical experience and training of the fellowship, and expected work-life balance during fellowship. Respondents report that the most important factors in making their rank list were perceived goodness of fit, desired geographic location, and perception of program leadership. Additionally, respondents ranked the types of information and interactions that they found most helpful to make decisions. All respondents reported the benefit of cost savings compared to a traditional application cycle, with the most commonly reported estimated savings being $3,000-$5,000 per respondent. CONCLUSIONS These results allow recommendations for \\"best practices\\" for virtual interviews to include programs providing an electronic packet of information prior to the interview day, providing dedicated time for applicants to interact with current fellows, providing applicants an understanding of the city/region of the location of the program, and offering a completely optional post-interview visit, when possible. Based on the results of this survey, we recommend that programs continue to offer virtual interviews as a penalty-free option for applicants, even when in-person interviews may be feasible.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the 2020 Pediatric Anesthesiology Fellowship Application Cycle: A Survey of Applicants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in San Diego, California, the Infectious Disease Division at the University of California San Diego established a COVID-19 Clinic dedicated solely to managing patients safely in their homes This strategy was developed in response to: i) concerns regarding transmission of infection in the healthcare setting, ii) avoiding overwhelming the healthcare system with COVID-19 patients, iii) providing patients with expedited access to specialists, and iv) reducing the burden on the emergency department and urgent care Methods: The COVID-19 clinic staff is comprised of a dedicated nurse, administrative assistant, and four infectious diseases (ID) physicians who aim to see patients within 24 hours of referral via virtual clinics 5 days a week An ID physician initially assesses each patient in a direct telemedicine visit and answers their questions, assesses disease severity, provides both symptom management and emotional support, and education about self-isolation and transmission-based precautions The patients are then triaged to daily nursing phone calls and follow up visits as needed Results: Over a period of 12 weeks (March 27 to June 16, 2020), the clinic has seen 179 patients To assess the impact of the clinic, patients are asked to complete a 6-point verbal patients satisfaction survey after their visit Of the 133 patients who have completed the survey to date, the vast majority reported high satisfaction with their encounters with the COVID-19 physician, with a mean score of 4 8 or higher on all six questions (on a scale of 1 to 5) When asked Did you feel comfortable talking to your COVID-19 ID physician? on a scale of 1 to 5, the average score was 4 9 When asked Did the physician do a good job answering your questions? the average was 4 9 Patients reported feeling safer after talking with their physician (mean score 4 8), and felt better educated on how to self-quarantine at home (mean score 4 85) and when to seek care from an emergency room, urgent care or hospital (mean score 4 83) Conclusion: The UCSD COVID-19 Clinic demonstrates how telemedicine can be utilized in response to a public health crisis by creating a virtual clinic to provide ID care for patients in their homes","output":"Using telemedicine to provide virtual care for COVID-19 patients at home"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Rapid vaccination is the only way to fight against COVID-19.Vaccine hesitancy is the major barrier against this strategy. The main objective of this cross-sectional study was to analyze COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in the general population of West Bengal (India), as well as to investigate the factors that were independently associated with people's desire to receive the vaccine. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed by email, Whatsapp, and other social media platforms, and the responses were analyzed using the SPSS (Version 20) software. RESULTS: We conducted a web-based survey in West Bengal, India (N = 803), and accumulated information on individuals' desire to adopt vaccine against COVID-19, views about the virus's effectiveness, and many knowledge-based socio-demographic factors that potentially impact the overall vaccination efforts.

In most of its application areas, M&S is applied in several broad thematic policy-oriented topics: predicting human movement, humanitarian logistics, communicable diseases, healthcare, policing, and economics. More recently, there has been increased use of M&S in predicting human movement and health impacts resulting from climate change. Computer modeling has benefits for both policy and theoretical advancements in the field.M&S is often associated as a predictive tool that appeals to policymakers and planners. But M&S has many other significant benefits. For policymakers and planners, M&S provides a simulated environment to explore what-if scenarios. These scenarios can be adjusted to reflect different assumptions and conditions in the field. M&S can provide a means for translating interpretivist research findingsthemselves rich in descriptions of actors, relationships, and dynamicsinto visual artifacts that can communicate results to policymakers. It also can help to test the assumptions of theoretical findings, explore generalizability to other cases and conditions, and inform future data collection efforts.On the other hand, because models can take a long time to construct and test, they cannot provide rapid insights about evolving situations to inform decision-making at the onset of a new emergency. Data dashboards, the staple of modern humanitarian operations, are better for identifying emergent needs and tracking efforts. However, modeling what we know from one situation allows us to use those insights in systematic and strategic ways to improve operations for the future.M&S can also provide researchers with an additional tool that allows improved integration of multiple data types and sources. These data, assumptions, and theoretical constructs can be linked together in a complex, nonlinear, dynamic system that can then be set in motion to see if the simulated world reveals phenomena that are witnessed in the real world. But interdisciplinary communication and collaboration is hard and finding modelers who value interpretivist research can be even harder. M&S is not a silver bullet but provides a unique approach that incorporates dynamics and is becoming increasingly accessible to policymakers, practitioners, and academics, including those without computer programing experience.For policy, it is important to invest the time and resources to develop simulation modelsfrom simple to complexthat help when planning for the evolution of events, or for the next event. Models of current refugee situations should inform where to concentrate efforts to advance durable solutions and how to plan for potential scenarios of return to countries of origin. Policymakers must recognize the long-term value of modeling what we know now to use later. Researchers of migration should become familiar with M&S paradigms so they can become part of the model design, development, and testing phasesat least part of the conversation. Better integration of migration scholars in design and development has the potential to strengthen models for policymaking, but perhaps more importantly, to strengthen the field by serving as an extra tool for testing theories, assumptions, and generalizability of findings to other locations and situations.","output":"Modeling and Simulation as a Bridge to Advance Practical and Theoretical Insights About Forced Migration Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mucormycosis or black fungus infection is a less common disease but highly fatal infection, infecting the immunocompromised individuals.

The central domain of the nucleocapsid protein contains several arginine/serine (RS) dipeptides, the biological significance of which has not been well investigated. In the present study, we demonstrate that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid protein is phosphorylated primarily within the RS\\\\rich region in cells and by SR protein kinase 1 in vitro. The nucleocapsid protein could suppress translation and its RS motif is essential for such an activity. Moreover, phosphorylation of the RS motif could modulate the translation inhibitory activity of the nucleocapsid protein. We further found that RS motif phosphorylation did not significantly affect RNA binding of the nucleocapsid protein but impaired its multimerization ability. We observed that the nucleocapsid protein could translocate to cytoplasmic stress granules in response to cellular stress. Deletion or mutations of the RS motif enhanced stress granule localization of the nucleocapsid protein, whereas overexpression of SR protein kinase 1 inhibited nucleocapsid protein localization to stress granules. The nucleocapsid protein lacking the RS motif formed high\\\\order RNP complexes, which may also account for its enhanced stress granule localization. Taken together, phosphorylation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome\\\\CoV nucleocapsid protein modulates its activity in translation control and also interferes with its oligomerization and aggregation in stress granules.","output":"Phosphorylation of the arginine/serine dipeptide\\\\rich motif of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid protein modulates its multimerization, translation inhibitory activity and cellular localization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: High resolution melting (HRM) analysis is a rapid and correct method for identification of species, such as, microorganism, bacteria, yeast, virus, etc. HRM data are produced using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and unique for each species. Analysis of the HRM data is important for several applications, such as, for detection of diseases (e.g., influenza, zika virus, SARS-Cov-2 and Covid-19 diseases) in health, for identification of spoiled foods in food industry, for analysis of crime scene evidence in forensic investigation, etc. However, the characteristics of the HRM data can change due to the experimental conditions or instrumental settings. In addition, it becomes laborious and time-consuming process as the number of samples increases. Because of these reasons, the analysis and classification of the HRM data become challenging for species which have similar characteristics. METHODS: To improve the classification accuracy of HRM data, we propose to use image (visual) representation of HRM data, which we call HRM images, that are generated using recurrence plots, and propose convolutional neural network (CNN) based models for classifying HRM images. In this study, two different types of recurrence plots are generated, which are black-white recurrence plots (BW-RP) and gray scale recurrence plots (GS-RP) and four different CNN models are proposed for classifying HRM data. RESULTS: The classification performance of the proposed methods are evaluated based on average classification accuracy and F1 score, specificity, recall, and precision values for each yeast species. When BW-RP representation of HRM data is used as input to the CNN models, the best classification accuracy of 95.2% is obtained. The classification accuracies of CNN models for melting curve and GS-RP data representations of HRM data are 90.13% and 86.13%, respectively. The classification accuracy of support vector machines (SVM) model that take melting curve representation of HRM data is 86.53%. Moreover, when BW-RP representation of HRM data is used as input to the CNN models, the F1 score, specificity, recall and precision values are the highest for almost all of species. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results show that using BW-RP representation of HRM data improved the classification accuracy of HRM data and CNN models that take these images as input outperformed CNN models that take melting curve and GS-RP representations of HRM data as inputs and SVM model that take melting curve representation of HRM data as input.","output":"Convolutional neural network analysis of recurrence plots for high resolution melting classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) with major spike protein mutations has raised concern over potential neutralization escape and breakthrough infections among vaccinated and previously SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2\\\\infected subjects.

A few months after the assay was released to our patients, some materials, reagents, and equipment became in short supply. Alternative protocols were necessary in order to avoid stopping testing to the population. However, the suitability of these alternatives needs to be validated before their use. Here, we investigated if saliva is a reliable alternative specimen to nasopharyngeal swabs; if 0.45% saline is a reliable alternative to guanidine hydrochloride as a collection viral transport media; the stability of SARS-COV-2 in guanidine hydrochloride and in 0.45% saline for 10 and 50 days at room temperature; and if the primers/probe concentration and thermocycling times could be reduced so as to overcome the short supply of these reagents and equipment, without a significant loss of the assay performance. We found that saliva is not an appropriated specimen for our method-nasopharyngeal swabs perform better. Saline (0.45%) and guanidine hydrochloride have a similar SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic capability as tube additives. Reliable SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection can be performed after sample storage for 10 days at room temperature (18-23 C) in both 0.45% saline and guanidine hydrochloride. Using synthetic RNA, and decreasing the concentration of primers by five-fold and probes by 2.5-fold, changed the assay limit of detection (LOD) from 7.2 copies/reaction to 23.7 copies/reaction and the subsequent reducing of thermocycling times changed the assay LOD from 23.7 copies/reaction to 44.2 copies/reaction.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of 200 patients who expired due to complications of COVID-19. Patients were included in this study if they had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and expired during their admission. Data were collected on patients who expired between March 17 and April 16, 2020. RESULTS: A vast majority of patients were Black Americans (89%) with no history of international travel who had more than one comorbidity (81%), with the most common comorbidities being hypertension (845%), diabetes mellitus (575%), and obesity (415%). Fifty-five percent of our patient population had three or more comorbidities. Among patients with available data, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin values were elevated above normal limits at admission.

The patients data of endoscopic diagnosis and treatment during the same period in 2019 were used as a control group, to compare the differences in the number of diagnosis and treatment and the detection rate of gastrointestinal diseases in the two groups. At the same time, patients and related staff were followed up for the situation of new infection. RESULTS: During the epidemic, our endoscopy center conducted a total of 1,808 cases of endoscopic operations and 5,903 cases in the control group. The amount of endoscopic work during the epidemic period was 30.63% in the same period last year. During the epidemic, 26 patients underwent endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)/endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) treatment, 26 patients underwent ERCP, and 18 patients underwent gastrointestinal stent implantation. In the control group, 273 patients underwent EMR/ESD, 17 underwent ERCP, and 16 underwent gastrointestinal stenting. During COVID-19, compared with the same period last year, the detection rates of peptic ulcer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, and rectal cancer were significantly higher ((2) = 4.482, P = 0.034; (2) = 5.223, P = 0.006; (2) = 2.329, P = 0.041; (2) = 8.755, P = 0.003; and (2) = 5.136, P = 0.023).

Norepinephrine infusion is increasingly used for prevention of post-SA hypotension; however, its effects as compared to the traditional phenylephrine infusion remain unclear. This study aimed to compare the effects of phenylephrine and norepinephrine administered as continuous infusion during elective CD on maternal hemodynamic parameters and maternal and fetal outcomes. METHODS This prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled study included 238 consecutive term parturients who underwent CD from February 2019 to October 2019. They were randomized to receive continuous infusion of 0.25 g/kg/min phenylephrine, 0.05 g/kg/min norepinephrine, or placebo. Hemodynamic monitoring was performed at 10 time points using LiDCOrapid. We analyzed umbilical vein (UV), umbilical artery (UA), and peripheral vein (PV) blood gas indexes and recorded intraoperative complications. RESULTS In phenylephrine group, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) remain during the whole operation. Compared to the control group, phenylephrine, but not norepinephrine, significantly increased the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to counteract the SA-induced vasodilatation, 3 min following norepinephrine/phenylephrine/LR administration (T4): 957.4  590.3 vs 590.1  273.7 (P < 0.000001); 5 min following norepinephrine/phenylephrine/LR administration (T5): 1104  468.0 vs 789.4  376.2 (P = 0.000002). at the time of incision (T6): 1084  524.8 vs 825.2  428.6 (P = 0.000188). Parturients in the phenylephrine group had significantly lower UV (1.91  0.43) (P = 0.0003) and UA (2.05  0.61) (P = 0.0038) lactate level compared to controls. Moreover, the UV pH value was higher in the phenylephrine than in the control group7.37  0.03(P = 0.0013). Parturients had lower incidence of nausea, tachycardia, hypotension in phenylephrine group.

In this report, we determined the steady-state kinetic parameters for 5'-monophosphorylation of ribavirin and viramidine by adenosine kinase. The apparent Km for ribavirin is 540 microM, and k(cat) is 1.8 min-1. Its catalytic efficiency of 3.3 x 10(-3) min-1 . microM-1 is 1,200-fold lower than that of adenosine. In contrast to the common belief that ribavirin is exclusively phosphorylated by adenosine kinase, cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II was found to catalyze ribavirin phosphorylation in vitro. The reaction is optimally stimulated by the physiological concentration of ATP or 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. In phosphate-buffered saline plus ATP and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, the apparent Km for ribavirin is 88 microM, and k(cat) is 4.0 min-1. These findings suggest that cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II may be involved in ribavirin phosphorylation in vivo. Like ribavirin, viramidine was found to be phosphorylated by either adenosine kinase or cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II, albeit with a much lower activity. The catalytic efficiency for viramidine phosphorylation is 10- to 330-fold lower than that of ribavirin, suggesting that other nucleoside kinase(s) may be involved in viramidine phosphorylation in vivo. Both ribavirin and viramidine are not phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase and uridine-cytidine kinase. The coincidence of presence of high concentrated 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes suggests that cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II could play an important role in phosphorylating ribavirin and contribute to anabolism of ribavirin triphosphate in erythrocytes.

METHODS: MVPA and sedentary time was assessed using a hip-worn ActiGraph model wGT3x-BT tri-axial accelerometer across a 7-day period in adolescents with IDD and one of their parents. Pearson and point-biserial correlations were calculated to inspect the associations of PA (MVPA, sedentary time) with intrapersonal factors (demographic characteristic, BMI, waist circumference, motor ability, muscle strength, grip strength, cardiovascular fitness and self-efficacy for PA), interpersonal factors (parent demographics, parent BMI, parent MVPA and sedentary time, family social support for PA, parent barriers and support for PA, parent's beliefs/attitudes towards PA and number of siblings), and environmental factors (meteorologic season and COVID-19). Ordinary least squares regression was used to estimate the unique contributions of key factors to PA after controlling for participants' age, sex, race, waist circumference and total wear time. RESULTS: Ninety-two adolescents (15.5  3.0 years old, 21.7% non-White, 6.5% Hispanic, 56.5% female) provided valid accelerometer data.

Designing and monitoring interventions to slow and stop the spread of the virus require knowledge of how many people have been and are currently infected, where they live, and how they interact. The first step is an accurate assessment of the population prevalence of past infections. There are very few population-representative prevalence studies of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and only two states in the United States-Indiana and Connecticut-have reported probability-based sample surveys that characterize statewide prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. One of the difficulties is the fact that tests to detect and characterize SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus antibodies are new, are not well characterized, and generally function poorly. During July 2020, a survey representing all adults in the state of Ohio in the United States collected serum samples and information on protective behavior related to SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several features of the survey make it difficult to estimate past prevalence: 1) a low response rate; 2) a very low number of positive cases; and 3) the fact that multiple poor-quality serological tests were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We describe a Bayesian approach for analyzing the biomarker data that simultaneously addresses these challenges and characterizes the potential effect of selective response. The model does not require survey sample weights; accounts for multiple imperfect antibody test results; and characterizes uncertainty related to the sample survey and the multiple imperfect, potentially correlated tests.","output":"Estimating seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Ohio: A Bayesian multilevel poststratification approach with multiple diagnostic tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we analyze the impact of corporate purpose on performance through a new dataset, developed by BERA Brand Management, based on consumer perceptions of corporate purpose for 13 different attributes across over 200 brands. Our paper also reviews the state of play in the debate on corporate purpose and draws on the results of a survey of CEOs of large-cap US companies.Our paper finds that companies associated with high-purpose outperformed on common measures of financial performance, valuation, and value creation:- Average valuation multiples for high-purpose brands are over four times EBITDA higher than that of low-purpose brands.- High-purpose brands demonstrate a nearly 20 percentage point advantage in annualized total shareholder returns over low-purpose brands.- High-purpose brands double their market value over four times faster than low-purpose brands.During Covid-19 the gap between top and bottom quartile performers increased. Companies with the best purpose scores generally moved up and into the top quartile of total shareholder return performance, suggesting that the capital markets expected companies with stronger corporate purpose to maintain a stronger connection to their consumers and deliver more resilient financial performance. These results suggest that operating with strong corporate purpose is good for shareholders, as well as stakeholders more generally.

Demographic information and chest CT imaging features were collected. The average age in the whole study group was 46.9  11.1 years, with 18 males and 15 females. Patients in the positive RT-PCR test group were more likely to have a fever than patients in the negative RT-PCR test group (85.7% vs 50%, P < .05). Lesions in the positive group were more likely to be located in the peripheral area than lesions in the negative group (83.6% vs 68.2%, P < .05). Regarding the appearance of 216 lesions, ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with consolidation (43.2%) was the most common appearance in the negative group, followed by pure GGOs (31.8%), while in the positive group, pure GGOs (32%) and GGOs with interlobular septal thickening (32.8%) were both most frequent, and the difference between them was evident (P < .05). For the follow-up analysis, the largest short-axis of a lesion was smaller upon follow-up (median size 13.6 mm vs 14 mm), albeit by a smaller margin. Pure GGOs decreased in frequency, from 31.3% to 21.3%, while consolidation increased in frequency, from 7.5% to 12.5%.

This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Auxora, a novel, intravenously administered CRAC channel inhibitor, in adults with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS A randomized, controlled, open-label study of Auxora was conducted in adults with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive three doses of once-daily Auxora versus standard of care (SOC) alone. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of Auxora. Following FDA guidance, study enrollment was halted early to allow for transition to a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study. RESULTS In total, 17 patients with severe and three with critical COVID-19 pneumonia were randomized to Auxora and nine with severe and one with critical COVID-19 pneumonia to SOC. Similar proportions of patients receiving Auxora and SOC experienced  1 adverse event (75% versus 80%, respectively). Fewer patients receiving Auxora experienced serious adverse events versus SOC (30% versus 50%, respectively). Two patients (10%) receiving Auxora and two (20%) receiving SOC died during the 30 days after randomization. Among patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the median time to recovery with Auxora was 5 days versus 12 days with SOC; the recovery rate ratio was 1.87 (95% CI, 0.72, 4.89). Invasive mechanical ventilation was needed in 18% of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving Auxora versus 50% receiving SOC (absolute risk reduction = 32%; 95% CI, - 0.07, 0.71). Outcomes measured by an 8-point ordinal scale were significantly improved for patients receiving Auxora, especially for patients with a baseline PaO2/FiO2 = 101-200. CONCLUSIONS Auxora demonstrated a favorable safety profile in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia and improved outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These results, however, are limited by the open-label study design and small patient population resulting from the early cessation of enrollment in response to regulatory guidance. The impact of Auxora on respiratory complications in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia will be further assessed in a planned randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study.

Estimates of the impact of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission are critical for decision making in this and future outbreaks. We here aim to assess the impact of these NPIs on disease transmission by estimating changes in the basic reproduction number (R0) at national and cantonal levels in relation to the timing of these NPIs. We estimated the time-varying R0 nationally and in eleven cantons by fitting a stochastic transmission model explicitly simulating within-hospital dynamics. We used individual-level data from more than 1000 hospitalised patients in Switzerland and public daily reports of hospitalisations and deaths. We estimated the national R0 to be 2.8 (95% confidence interval 2.1&ndash;3.8) at the beginning of the epidemic. Starting from around 7 March, we found a strong reduction in time-varying R0 with a 86% median decrease (95% quantile range [QR] 79&ndash;90%) to a value of 0.40 (95% QR 0.3&ndash;0.58) in the period of 29 March to 5 April. At the cantonal level, R0 decreased over the course of the epidemic between 53% and 92%. Reductions in time-varying R0 were synchronous with changes in mobility patterns as estimated through smartphone activity, which started before the official implementation of NPIs. We inferred that most of the reduction of transmission is attributable to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity, the latter accounting for only about 4% of the total reduction in effective transmission. As Switzerland considers relaxing some of the restrictions of social mixing, current estimates of time-varying R0 well below one are promising. However, as of 24 April 2020, at least 96% (95% QR 95.7&ndash;96.4%) of the Swiss population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. These results warrant a cautious relaxation of social distance practices and close monitoring of changes in both the basic and effective reproduction numbers.","output":"Assessing the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several systems are available for the expression of foreign gene sequences inEscherichia coli.

(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04602520). SETTING: 3 acute care medical units in a tertiary care hospital from 16 March to 1 July 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 45 dying patients, 45 family members, and 45 clinicians. INTERVENTION: During the pandemic, clinicians continued an existing practice of collating personal information about dying patients and \\"what matters most,\\" eliciting wishes, and implementing acts of compassion. MEASUREMENTS: Themes from semistructured clinician interviews that were summarized with representative quotations. RESULTS: Many barriers to end-of-life care arose because of infection control practices that mandated visiting restrictions and personal protective equipment, with attendant practical and psychological consequences. During hospitalization, family visits inside or outside the patient's room were possible for 36 patients (80.0%); 13 patients (28.9%) had virtual visits with a relative or friend. At the time of death, 20 patients (44.4%) had a family member at the bedside. Clinicians endeavored to prevent unmarked deaths by adopting advocacy roles to \\"fill the gap\\" of absent family and by initiating new and established ways to connect patients and relatives. LIMITATION: Absence of clinician symptom or wellness metrics; a single-center design.

These compounds are known as process contaminants of the roasting process and exhibit some harmful effects. In order to evaluate the exposure to these compounds in coffee, it is necessary to know the levels of contamination as well as consumption habits. The degree of consumers loyalty to specific coffee brands could also be an important driver affecting the level of exposure. This research aimed to evaluate the levels of consumption and the degree of loyalty to coffee brands available in Belgian markets, as well as the factors affecting the choice and the consumption of coffee products and coffee brands. Data were collected in Belgium through an online survey. The results show that for the 1930 participants, 87% reported daily coffee consumption and 13% never or occasionally consumed coffee. The global median coffee consumption was 3 cups per day, and the median for individual daily consumers only was 4 cups per day. The level of consumption of ground coffee was about twice higher than coffee beans, followed by instant coffee and relatively very low consumption of coffee substitutes. In total, 78% of participants reported brand loyalty but to different degrees. Two coffee brands sold in Belgian regions were listed together by more than 20% of the survey participants. The most frequent criteria for selecting a specific coffee brand were taste and price, followed by tradition and habit.

Using data collected from doctors and nurses before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine the relationship between intensity of involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic response and emotional exhaustion and depression, as well as the moderating effects of prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact. Data was collected at three time points (T1 and T2 prepandemic, and T3 during COVID-19), with prosocial motivation and controls collected at T1/T2 and predictors and outcomes collected during the pandemic. We find that intensity of involvement does associate with emotional exhaustion at work and that higher prosocial motivation exacerbates this relationship. Supplemental analyses suggest that the exposure to self-dimension of involvement is positively associated with emotional exhaustion and depression. Understanding the roles of prosocial motivation and prosocial impact in managing regulatory resources has important ramifications for health care workers on the frontlines of health crises responses, as these resources are necessary to manage the associated trauma.

Among 28 studies, the overall pooled median duration of RNA shedding from respiratory sources was 18.4 days (95% CI, 15.5-21.3; I2 = 98.87%; P < .01). When stratified by disease severity, the pooled median duration of viral RNA shedding from respiratory sources was 19.8 days (95% CI, 16.2-23.5; I2 = 96.42%; P < .01) among severely ill patients and 17.2 days (95% CI, 14.0-20.5; I2 = 95.64%; P < .01) in mild-to-moderate illness. Viral RNA was detected up to 92 days after symptom onset. Viable virus was isolated by culture from -6 to 20 days relative to symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-COV-2 RNA shedding can be prolonged, yet high heterogeneity exists. Detection of viral RNA may not correlate with infectivity since available viral culture data suggests shorter durations of shedding of viable virus. Additional data are needed to determine the duration of shedding of viable virus and the implications for risk of transmission.","output":"Understanding viral shedding of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): Review of current literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Controversial results on remdesivir efficacy have been reported.

DESIGN Prospective before-and-after study with a follow up duration of four months, from May to August 2019. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Two operating rooms of an Orthopaedic and a Neurosurgical ward in a 780-bed university hospital in the District of Foggia, Italy (about 600,000 inhabitants). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES According to the hygienic standards proposed by the Italian Workers Compensation Authority (ISPESL), the total and the average bacterial load and the presence of six pathogens were evaluated between pre- and post- PX-UV use combined with routine manual cleaning. RESULTS The PX-UV system was applied at five distinct time points: t1: start of the experiment, t2: after 28 days, t3: after 13 days, t4: after 7 days, and t5: after 8 days (t2-t5: 28 days in total). About 16-min of PX-UV cycle showed significant reduction in the level of environmental contamination by decreasing the mean colony count by 87.5%, compliant with the standard (5< X 15 CFU per plat). Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii that had been isolated in some of the samplings before PX-UV were no longer detected after t1, t2 and t5 treatments. Before PX-UV, the mean colony count was similar between t1 and t2 (p>0.05); after t3 and t4 treatments, it was lower before t5 in both the Orthopaedic and Neurosurgical operating rooms (= -97% and -75%, respectively; p<0,01). CONCLUSIONS Implication for practice: PX-UV could supplement the standard cleaning process in reducing the microbial burden in the operating rooms and potentially achieving lower healthcare-associated surgical site infections rates.","output":"[Evaluation of a pulsed xenon ultraviolet light- emitting no-touch, portable device for disinfection of surfaces in operating rooms in the Policlinico University Hospital of Foggia, Italy, 2019.

We describe a case of a previously healthy male with COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation who developed WCS.Case: A 47-year-old previously healthy male was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia requiring high-flow nasal cannula. On hospital day 11, he was intubated and placed on lung protective ventilation for moderate ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 192). On ventilator day (VD) 2 a fentanyl infusion was started. After 36 hours, hypoxemia improved but plateau pressures were consistently &lt;30 cm H2O necessitating a decrease to 4 cc/kg after minimizing dead space within the ventilator circuit. A trial of airway pressure release ventilation worsened hypercarbia and bronchoscopy did not reveal mucous plugging, airway collapse, or purulent secretions. Worsening lung compliance (PPlat 50 on 4 cc/kg) without change in oxygenation raised suspicion for WCS, so fentanyl was discontinued. Within one hour, plateau pressures nadired at 16 and the ventilator was changed to pressure support. The patient was successfully extubated on VD 10.Discussion: Differentiating low lung compliance in classical ARDS from disproportionately compliant hypoxemia in COVID-19-induced ARDS is an ongoing point of research in the thoracic community.6-9 The novelty of this paradigm allows potential to overlook less common, if not rare, complications such as fentanyl-induced WCS. Our patient's poor compliance despite relatively quick improvement in oxygenation countered available evidence on COVID-19 lung physiology, prompting suspicion for an alternative explanation for his poor ventilation. With descriptions of WCS limited to case reports we found that onset and severity of initial signs (contraction of the chest wall, diaphragm, and abdominal and laryngeal muscles2) can be masked in mechanically ventilated patients. Inadequate ventilation can be interpreted as manifestations of high airway and alveolar pressure making it difficult to differentiate it from classical ARDS and ultimately increasing ventilator use duration. To our knowledge, this is the first report of WCS in a patient with COVID-19 associated ARDS. It demonstrates that when mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients receiving fentanyl have poor lung compliance and oxygenation improves disproportionately faster than ventilation, WCS should be considered.","output":"Fentanyl-induced wooden chest syndrome masquerading as severe respiratory distress syndrome in covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the late 2020s, less than 1 year into the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines were introduced on a worldwide scale, with a significant positive impact on the consequences of the disease for several high-risk population groups. In the case of most bacterial or viral respiratory infections, pregnant women are at increased risk of complications, however, neither pregnant nor breastfeeding women were included in the first round of randomized clinical trials evaluating the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, because of safety and ethical concerns.

Initially, the pharmacological assessment was performed to study the drug-likeness properties of the phytochemicals for their safe human administration. Suitable compounds were subjected to molecular docking to screen strongly binding phytochemicals with HR1 while the stability of ligand binding was analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations. Quantum computation-based density functional theory (DFT) analysis was constituted to analyze the reactivity of these compounds with the receptor. Through analysis, 108 phytochemicals passed the pharmacological assessment and upon docking of these 108 phytochemicals, 36 were screened passing a threshold of -8.5 kcal/mol. After analyzing stability and reactivity, 5 phytochemicals, i.e., SilybinC, Isopomiferin, Lycopene, SilydianinB, and Silydianin are identified as novel and potent candidates for the inhibition of HR1 domain in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Several and often interconnected factors, both abiotic and biotic, determine the persistence of these viruses released in the environment, which can last from a few seconds to several years. Moreover, viruses in the environment are able to travel short to very long distances, especially in the air or in water. SUMMARY: Although well described now, the role of these environments as intermediaries or as reservoirs in virus transmission has been extensively studied and debated in the last century. The majority of these discoveries, such as the pioneer work on bacteria transmission, the progressive discoveries of viruses, as well as the persistence of the influenza virus in the air varying along with droplet sizes, or the role of water in the transmission of poliovirus, have contributed to the improvement of public health. Recent outbreaks of human coronavirus, influenza virus, and Ebola virus have also demonstrated the contemporaneity of these research studies and the need to study virus persistence in the environment.

Fischer 344 and Wistar Lewis rats were more resistant to inoculation at 2 and 5 days of age and completely resistant by 10 days of age. In contrast, Wistar Furth rats which were very susceptible at both 2 and 5 days of age remained susceptible until 21 days of age. Intracerebral challenge of an F1 cross between Wistar Furth and Wistar Lewis rats at 10 days of age indicated that resistance to JHMV infection is dominant. Cyclophosphamide treatment 28 days after intracerebral inoculation exacerbated an inapparent infection, leading to paralysis in eight of nine and death in six of nine Wistar Furth test rats. In such immunosuppressed animals, grey- and white-matter lesions were noted throughout the central nervous system, in contrast to the purely demyelinating lesions noted previously. Since rats, unlike mice, were not susceptible to disease after intracerebral injection with the serorelated viscerotropic strain MHV-3, we wished to extend our understanding of the neurological disease process elicited by the two viruses in rodents. For this reason, various mouse strains, including some with recognized immunodeficiencies, were challenged by different routes of inoculation. Intraperitoneal infection of nude and beige mice with JHMV indicated that lack of natural killer cell functions does not markedly enhance the susceptibility to virus, whereas T-cell activity appears to be essential for resisting infection. JHMV and MHV-3 replication in peritoneal macrophages from highly resistant A/J mice was reduced in comparison with that noted in macrophages from susceptible C57BL6/J mice. An initial intraperitoneal inoculation of JHMV was able to protect C57BL6/J mice against fatal intracerebral challenge within 3 days, whereas A/J mice remained susceptible beyond day 3. The protective effect did not appear to result from increased levels of circulating interferon, preceded elevation in serum JHMV-neutralizing antibody titers, and persisted for at least several weeks after intraperitoneal inoculation. Based on the combined studies described here and on previous work by us and others, it appears that the factors influencing the outcome of coronavirus disease in rodents are age at inoculation, route of challenge, genetic constitution of the virus and host, and competence of the immune system, particularly cellular immunity involving T-cells.","output":"In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating disease: endogenous factors influencing demyelinating disease caused by mouse hepatitis virus in rats and mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Visceral leishmaniasis is a protozoan disease associated with high fatality rate in developing countries. Although the drug pipeline is constantly improving, available treatments are costly and live-threatening side effects are not uncommon. Moreover, an approved vaccine against human leishmaniasis does not exist yet. Using whole antigens from Leishmania donovani promastigotes (LdAg), we investigated the protective potential of a novel adjuvant-free vaccine strategy. Immunization of mice with LdAg via the intradermal or the intranasal route prior to infection decreases the parasitic burden in primary affected internal organs, including the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Interestingly, the intranasal route is more efficient than the intradermal route, leading to better parasite clearance and remarkable induction of adaptive immune cells, notably the helper and cytotoxic T cells. In vitro restimulation experiments with Leishmania antigens led to significant IFN- secretion by splenocytes; therefore, exemplifying specificity of the adaptive immune response. To improve mucosal delivery and the immunogenic aspects of our vaccine strategy, we used polysaccharide-based nanoparticles (NP) that carry the antigens. The NP-LdAg formulation is remarkably taken up by dendritic cells and induces their maturation in vitro, as revealed by the increased expression of CD80, CD86 and MHC II. Intranasal immunization with NP-LdAg does not improve the parasite clearance in our experimental timeline; however, it does increase the percentage of effector and memory T helper cells in the spleen, suggesting a potential induction of long-term memory.

METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (registration #ChiCTR1900025018) of patients with IHD scheduled to undergo non-cardiac surgery at Shenzhen Peoples Hospital (Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China) between June 2014 and September 2015, randomized to 60 mg TMZ or placebo 12 h before surgery. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of in-hospital cardiovascular events. The secondary endpoints were myocardial ischaemia on five-lead electrocardiogram (cECG), cardiac troponin I (cTnI) elevation, cardiac death, acute coronary events, heart failure, and arrhythmia requiring treatments. RESULTS: Compared with the placebo group, the TMZ group showed a lower occurrence of in-hospital cardiovascular events (primary endpoint, 20.0% vs. 37.5%, P = 0.02), myocardial ischaemia (15.0% vs. 32.5%, P < 0.01), cTnI elevation (2.5% vs. 10%, P < 0.01), acute coronary events (10.0% vs. 20.0%, P < 0.05), heart failure (0% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.05), and arrhythmia requiring treatment (17.5% vs. 35.0%, P < 0.05).

Thus, understanding the mutational imposed resistance mechanisms remains of utmost importance in the quest to reduce the TB burden. Herein, effects of 11 high confidence mutations in the KatG structure and residue network communication patterns were determined using extensive computational approaches. Combined traditional post-molecular dynamics analysis and comparative essential dynamics revealed that the mutant proteins have significant loop flexibility around the heme binding pocket and enhanced asymmetric protomer behavior with respect to wild-type (WT) protein. Heme contact analysis between WT and mutant proteins identified a reduction to no contact between heme and residue His270, a covalent bond vital for the heme-enabled KatG catalytic activity. Betweenness centrality calculations showed large hub ensembles with new hubs especially around the binding cavity and expanded to the dimerization domain via interface in the mutant systems, providing possible compensatory allosteric communication paths for the active site as a result of the mutations which may destabilize the heme binding pocket and the loops in its vicinity. Additionally, an interesting observation came from Eigencentrality hubs, most of which are located in the C-terminal domain, indicating relevance of the domain in the protease functionality.

Resources to teach this skill are limited and infrequently developed in partnership with the obstetrical population. In collaboration with maternity care experts and individuals with recent breastfeeding experience, we designed a one-page toolkit that describes the process of BMHE and includes step-by-step instructions and images to illustrate the technique. This study aimed to evaluate the readability, clarity of content, layout, and informational value of this BMHE toolkit. METHODS: Individuals who intended to breastfeed, were currently breastfeeding, or had recently breastfed were electronically surveyed and completed a two-part survey that consisted of radio, multi-select, Likert scale, and open-ended questions. Part one captured sociodemographic factors, obstetrical history, and breastfeeding practices. Part two collected feedback on the BMHE toolkit. Participants were recruited electronically through social media and posters were circulated in antenatal and postnatal care settings in Ottawa, Canada between November 2020 and February 2021.

The survey for the 2020 and 2021 match applicants was completed by 25 and 68 applicants, respectively, for a response rate of 6.1% and 21.9%. There was a significant difference in the average number of completed virtual subinternships between applicants that did and did not successfully match into plastic surgery (1.48 versus 0.36, P = 0.01). The rate of students matching at their home institution was the highest in 2021 at 26% compared to 2020 (18%) and 2019 (15%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that applicants were more likely to match at programs with which they had established previous connections, including home institutions. Applicants also had a higher likelihood to match if they completed a virtual subinternship during the 2021 match. Learning points can be applied to the upcoming application cycle to improve the overall experience.","output":"Staying Close to Home: The Effects of COVID-19 on the Plastic Surgery Residency Match"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It is hypothesized that different levels of hormones especially serum testosterone level could explain the sex differences between men and women on the susceptibility and case fatality rate of COVID-19. However, traditional observational studies that support this hypothesis could not effectively establish the causal effects. Objective: Utilizing recently published genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) on serum Testosterone level and on COVID-19 related phenotypes, we sought to assess the causality through Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses. We further applied a suite of statistical genomics methods to further explore the biological mechanisms. Results: We found that testosterone level is significantly associated with Covid-19 critical illness. All six MR methods yielded significant associations. There is no significant association between Testosterone and COVID-19 respiratory failure or COVID-19 susceptibility. Conclusion: Based on the GWAS currently available, we provide support for a causal role of Testosterone on COVID-19 critical illness. Nevertheless, we recognize that the COVID-19 susceptibility GWAS effort is still ongoing and there is no such strong locus as CCR5 for HIV discovered for COVID-19.","output":"Genetically determined serum testosterone level and Covid-19 illness level: A mendelian randomization study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the UK, there exists an important \\"action gap\\" between Government advice on measures necessary to counter the threat of COVID-19, and the behavior of a significant minority of the population. There are several reasons for this disconnect, including lack of message potency (i.e., credibility and congruence), inflexible/habitual behavior patterns, prevailing beliefs (i.e., vulnerability to, and seriousness of COVID-19), and individuals valuing personal concerns above general public health. For official messages to be effective and advice adhered to, strong, coherent \\"strategic narratives\\" are required. This article, using a psychological perspective, critically examined prevailing COVID-19 UK Government announcements during the lockdown (23/03/2020) and initial easing phase (10/05/2020). Specifically, it focused on important communication inconsistencies, and identified factors that may facilitate and create barriers to the adoption of essential public health directives. This included deliberation of factors that enhanced source impact, diminished the influence of message content, and the negative consequences of contrary information. Accordingly, this article proposes a framework for providing a unifying strategic narrative on COVID-19, one that helps to maximize the impact of key messages and promote effective behavior change. This framework places an emphasis on engaging the full range of actors and considers ways of reducing the efficacy of false information. The article provides recommendations that will potentially improve the reception of government policy and suggests how strategic narratives can harness the drivers of behavioral change needed to meet challenges such as COVID-19.","output":"Bridging the Gap Between UK Government Strategic Narratives and Public Opinion/Behavior: Lessons From COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder and a common cause of infertility among women that is associated with low-grade inflammation. Therefore, the current randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to assess the effects of green cardamom supplementation on the serum level of inflammatory markers and their gene expression among obese women with PCOS. METHODS: We included 194 obese women with PCOS and administered low-calorie diet to all of them. These subjects were randomly divided into two groups including the intervention group with 3 g/day green cardamom (n = 99) and the placebo group (n = 95). Anthropometric indices, androgen hormones, and inflammatory factors [tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP)] were assessed before and after the 4-month intervention. TNF-, IL-6, and CRP gene expression levels were measured using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. RESULTS: Anthropometric indices were improved in both studied groups (P < 0.001). Among androgen hormones, luteinizing hormone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone were significantly decreased (P < 0.001), and follicle-stimulating hormone was significantly increased (P < 0.001) in the green cardamom group. Our findings showed that TNF-, IL-6, and CRP serum levels were significantly decreased after the intervention with green cardamom plus low-calorie diet (P < 0.001). In addition, the expression levels of TNF- and CRP genes were significantly decreased in the intervention group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study supports the beneficial anti-inflammatory effect of green cardamom on the inflammatory state in PCOS women. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I: randomized clinical trial.

Like other beta coronaviruses, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 encodes some non-structural proteins (NSPs), playing crucial roles in viral transcription and replication. NSPs likely have essential roles in viral pathogenesis by manipulating many cellular processes. We performed a sequence-based analysis of NSPs to get insights into their intrinsic disorders, and their functions in viral replication were annotated and discussed in detail. Here, we provide newer insights into the structurally disordered regions of SARS-CoV-2 NSPs. Our analysis reveals that the SARS-CoV-2 proteome has a chunk of the disordered region that might be responsible for increasing its virulence. In addition, mutations in these regions are presumably responsible for drug and vaccine resistance. These findings suggested that the structurally disordered regions of SARS-CoV-2 NSPs might be invulnerable in COVID-19.","output":"Identification of intrinsically disorder regions in non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2: New insights into drug and vaccine resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), early identification of patients with a high risk of mortality can significantly improve triage, bed allocation, timely management, and possibly, outcome.

This requires patients to have an understanding of their overall health. Increased frailty diminishes the potential functional recovery after both transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).

A pilot nurse clinic was undertaken to assess individualised risk using geriatric assessment tools, provide education and explore patients GOC. Method: Patients &gt;75 years of age due for a planned valve surveillance echocardiogram were reviewed. Symptoms and important medical history were obtained. An Essential Frailty Test (EFT) was undertaken, with more detailed assessments where indicated. Principles from Serious Illness Conversation guided patient discussion, exploring patients understanding, goals and priorities for care. Patients discharged from echo surveillance were discussed with a cardiologist. Results: 29 patients were enrolled, with mean age, 78.59  12 years. 10 continued echo surveillance, 15 elected withdrawal from surveillance as unlikely to consider intervention. This was due to overall health or GOC determined that they would rather discharge and reassess with GP if they became symptomatic, as quality of life was their focus, not mortality. 4 of these patients demonstrated new significant cognitive impairment.

The purpose of this study was to determine if, and to what extent, radiofrequency energy couples to other common laparoscopic instruments and to describe practical steps that can minimize the magnitude of antenna coupling. METHODS In a laparoscopic simulator, monopolar radiofrequency energy was delivered to an L-hook. The tips of standard, nonelectrical laparoscopic instruments (either an unlit 10 mm telescope or a 5 mm grasper) were placed adjacent to bovine liver tissue and were never in contact with the active electrode. Thermal imaging quantified the change in tissue temperature nearest the tip of the telescope or grasper at the end of a 5 s activation of the active electrode. RESULTS A 5 s activation (30 watts, coagulation mode, 4 cm separation between instruments) increased tissue temperature compared with baseline adjacent to the grasper tip (2.2  2.2 C; p = 0.013) and telescope tip (38.2  8.0 C; p < 0.001). The laparoscopic telescope tip increased tissue temperature more than the laparoscopic grasper tip (p < 0.001). Lowering the generator power from 30 to 15 Watts decreased the heat generated at the telescope tip (38.2  8.0 vs. 13.5  7.5 C; p < 0.001). Complete separation of the camera/light cords and the active electrode cord decreased the heat generated near the telescope tip compared with parallel bundling of the cords (38.2  8.0 vs. 15.7  11.6 C; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Commonly used laparoscopic instruments couple monopolar radiofrequency energy without direct contact with the active electrode, a phenomenon that results in heat transfer from a nonelectrically active instrument tip to adjacent tissue. Practical steps to minimize heat transfer resulting from antenna coupling include reducing the monopolar generator power setting and avoiding of parallel bundling of the telescope and active electrode cords.","output":"Radiofrequency energy antenna coupling to common laparoscopic instruments: practical implications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Person Recognition based on Gait Model (PRGM) and motion features is are indeed a challenging and novel task due to their usages and to the critical issues of human pose variation, human body occlusion, camera view variation, etc. In this project, a deep convolution neural network (CNN) was modified and adapted for person recognition with Image Augmentation (IA) technique depending on gait features. Adaptation aims to get best values for CNN parameters to get best CNN model. In Addition to the CNN parameters Adaptation, the design of CNN model itself was adapted to get best model structure; Adaptation in the design was affected the type, the number of layers in CNN and normalization between them.

These measures have been reported to have a negative effect on physical activity (PA). Studies of PA during the pandemic have primarily used self-reported data. The single academic study that used tracked data did not report on demographics. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore patterns of smartphone-tracked activity before, during, and immediately after lockdown in the United Kingdom, and examine differences by sociodemographic characteristics and prior levels of PA. METHODS: Tracked longitudinal weekly minutes of PA were captured using the BetterPoints smartphone app between January and June 2020. Data were plotted by week, demographics, and activity levels at baseline. Nonparametric tests of difference were used to assess mean and median weekly minutes of activity at significant points before and during the lockdown, and as the lockdown was eased. Changes over time by demographics (age, gender, Index of Multiple Deprivation, baseline activity levels) were examined using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). RESULTS: There were 5395 users with a mean age of 41 years (SD 12) and 61% (n=3274) were female. At baseline, 26% (n=1422) of users were inactive, 23% (n=1240) were fairly active, and 51% (n=2733) were active. There was a relatively even spread across deprivation deciles (31% [n=1693] in the least deprived deciles and 23% in the most [n=1261]). We found significant changes in PA from the week before the first case of COVID-19 was announced (baseline) to the week that social distancing restrictions were relaxed (Friedman test: &#967;22=2331, P<.001). By the first full week of lockdown, the median change in PA was 57 minutes less than baseline. This represents a 37% reduction in weekly minutes of PA. Overall, 63% of people decreased their level of activity between baseline and the first week of COVID-19 restrictions. Younger people showed more PA before lockdown but the least PA after lockdown. In contrast, those aged >65 years appeared to remain more active throughout and increased their activity levels as soon as lockdown was eased. Levels of PA among those classed as active at baseline showed a larger drop compared with those considered to be fairly active or inactive. Socioeconomic group and gender did not appear to be associated with changes in PA. CONCLUSIONS: Our tracked PA data suggests a significant drop in PA during the United Kingdom's COVID-19 lockdown. Significant differences by age group and prior PA levels suggests that the government's response to COVID-19 needs to be sensitive to these individual differences and the government should react accordingly. Specifically, it should consider the impact on younger age groups, encourage everyone to increase their PA, and not assume that people will recover prior levels of PA on their own.","output":"Physical Activity Behavior Before, During, and After COVID-19 Restrictions: Longitudinal Smartphone-Tracking Study of Adults in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Passive antibody therapy has been used to immunize vulnerable people against infectious agents.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENT This study used survey data collected among a purposive sample of 703 community-dwelling Chinese Americans aged 55 years or older living in the metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Arizona, from 2013 to 2017. The average age of participants was 73.1 (SD = 8.7) and 64.2% were female. Dementia literacy was measured by dementia knowledge (knowledge about Alzheimer's disease and related dementia) and dementia beliefs (biased attitude toward dementia). Dementia worry was measured by assessing participants' fear toward and concerns of developing dementia. RESULTS Regression analyses found dementia knowledge decreased (p < 0.05) and dementia beliefs remained unchanged (p > 0.05) from 2013 to 2017 among participants. Dementia worry only increased among those who lived alone. Significant correlates of dementia worry included low formal education level, depressive symptoms, and family conflict. CONCLUSIONS Public health education targeting older Chinese Americans should aim to enhance dementia knowledge and to rectify their biased attitudes toward dementia. Psychosocial education or counseling should be available to older Chinese Americans who present dementia worry, particularly for those who live alone. More studies using diverse study designs, such as a longitudinal design, are needed to examine change in dementia literacy and worry among this population.","output":"Dementia literacy and worry among older Chinese Americans in Arizona: a comparison between 2013 and 2017."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy is a complex, contested social phenomenon and existing research highlights the multifaceted role of trust in strengthening vaccine confidence. However, understanding public engagement with vaccination through the lens of (mis)trust requires more contextual evidence on trusts qualitative determinants. This includes expanding the geographic focus beyond current studies focus on High Income Countries. Furthermore, obstacles remain in effectively integrating social science findings in the design of vaccine deployment strategies, and in ensuring that those who implement interventions and are affected by them are directly involved in producing knowledge about vaccination challenges. METHODS: We piloted a community-led ethnographic approach, training Community Health Workers (CHWs) in Kambia District, Sierra Leone, in qualitative social science methods. Methods included participant observation, participatory power mapping and rumour tracking, focus group discussions and key stakeholder interviews. CHWs, with the support of public health officials and professional social scientists, conducted research on vaccination challenges, analysed data, tested new community engagement strategies based on their findings and elicited local perspectives on these approaches. RESULTS: Our findings on vaccine confidence in five border communities highlighted three key themes: the impact of prior experiences with the health system on (mis)trust; relevance of livelihood strategies and power dynamics for vaccine uptake and access; and the contextual nature of knowledge around vaccines. Across these themes, we show how expressions of trust centered on social proximity, reliability and respect and the role of structural issues affecting both vaccine access and confidence. The pilot also highlighted the value and practical challenges to meaningfully co-designed research. CONCLUSION: There is scope for broader application of a community-led ethnographic approach will help redesign programming that is responsive to local knowledge and experience. Involving communities and low-cadre service providers in generating knowledge and solutions can strengthen relationships and sustain dialogue to bolster vaccine confidence.","output":"Bringing the social into vaccination research: Community-led ethnography and trust-building in immunization programs in Sierra Leone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Melanoma is one of the most common cancers, with an increasing incidence worldwide.

Public holidays for outbreak control could provide a critical time window for a rapid rollout of social distancing and other control measures at a large population scale. The objective of our study was to explore the impact of the timing and duration of outbreak-control holidays on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic spread during the early stage in China. We developed a compartment model to simulate the dynamic transmission of COVID-19 in China starting from January 2020. We projected and compared epidemic trajectories with and without an outbreak-control holiday that started during the Chinese Lunar New Year. We considered multiple scenarios of the outbreak-control holiday with different durations and starting times, and under different assumptions about viral transmission rates. We estimated the delays in days to reach certain thresholds of infections under different scenarios. Our results show that the outbreak-control holiday in China likely stalled the spread of COVID-19 for several days. The base case outbreak-control holiday (21 d for Hubei province and 10 days for all other provinces) delayed the time to reach 100 000 confirmed infections by 7.54 d. A longer outbreak-control holiday would have had stronger effects. A nationwide outbreak-control holiday of 21 d would have delayed the time to 100 000 confirmed infections by nearly 10 d. Furthermore, we find that outbreak-control holidays that start earlier in the course of a new epidemic are more effective in stalling epidemic spread than later holidays and that additional control measures during the holidays can boost the holiday effect. In conclusion, an outbreak-control holiday can likely effectively delay the transmission of epidemics that spread through social contacts. The temporary delay in the epidemic trajectory buys time, which scientists can use to discover transmission routes and identify effective public health interventions and which governments can use to build physical infrastructure, organize medical supplies, and deploy human resources for long-term epidemic mitigation and control efforts.","output":"Buying time for an effective epidemic response: The impact of a public holiday for outbreak control on COVID-19 epidemic spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Occupational safety and health (OSH) have a remarkable impact on the sustainability of firms and organizations. However, the sustainability perspective has often focused primarily on environmental and economic concerns, leaving key social and workplace aspects, such as OSH, underemphasized. The link between all these aspects is particularly relevant in agriculture. METHOD In the present study we analyzed the paths by which the worker's age, participation in safety training, and previous history of accidents and near misses can influence the adoption of safety behaviors in agriculture through the mediation of attitudes towards safety and perceived behavioral control. Three hundred and ten Italian agricultural operators were administered an ad-hoc questionnaire. RESULTS Having attended safety training courses, having been exposed to previous accidents and near misses, and age showed a positive association with the adoption of on-farm safety behaviors, through the mediation of perceived behavioral control. In more detail, participation in training courses and age showed a positive association with perceived behavioral control, while the previous history of accidents and near misses showed a negative association with behavioral control. In turn, perceived behavioral control was positively associated with the adoption of safety behaviors. CONCLUSIONS The present study focused on the chain of events leading to the adoption of on-farm safety behaviors, which can prevent an accidents, pointing out the more critical variables and the level at which they intervene, identifying possible areas of targeted interventions. Practical applications: Implications for the development of targeted interventions may deal with: (a) training activities increasing farm operators' sense of control over their safety, (b) older farmers involvement in mentoring initiatives, and (c) systematic recording and use of previous history of accidents and near misses as inputs for training activities to discuss their implications for on-farm safety.","output":"Promoting farming sustainability: The effects of age, training, history of accidents and social-psychological variables on the adoption of on-farm safety behaviors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Healthcare disparities are well documented across multiple subspecialties in orthopaedics. The widespread implementation of telemedicine risks worsening these disparities if not carefully executed, despite original assumptions that telemedicine improves overall access to care. Telemedicine also poses unique challenges such as potential language or technological barriers that may alter previously described patterns in orthopaedic disparities. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES Are the proportions of patients who use telemedicine across orthopaedic services different among (1) racial and ethnic minorities, (2) non-English speakers, and (3) patients insured through Medicaid during a 10-week period after the implementation of telemedicine in our healthcare system compared with in-person visits during a similar time period in 2019? METHODS This was a retrospective comparative study using electronic medical record data to compare new patients establishing orthopaedic care via outpatient telemedicine at two academic urban medical centers between March 2020 and May 2020 with new orthopaedic patients during the same 10-week period in 2019. A total of 11,056 patients were included for analysis, with 1760 in the virtual group and 9296 in the control group. Unadjusted analyses demonstrated patients in the virtual group were younger (median age 57 years versus 59 years; p < 0.001), but there were no differences with regard to gender (56% female versus 56% female; p = 0.66). We used self-reported race or ethnicity as our primary independent variable, with primary language and insurance status considered secondarily. Unadjusted and multivariable adjusted analyses were performed for our primary and secondary predictors using logistic regression. We also assessed interactions between race or ethnicity, primary language, and insurance type. RESULTS After adjusting for age, gender, subspecialty, insurance, and median household income, we found that Hispanic (odds ratio 0.59 [95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.91]; p = 0.02) and Asian patients were less likely (OR 0.73 [95% CI 0.53 to 0.99]; p = 0.04) to be seen through telemedicine than people of other races and ethnicities, as were speakers of languages other than English or Spanish (OR 0.34 [95% CI 0.18 to 0.65]; p = 0.001) and those insured through Medicaid (OR 0.83 [95% CI 0.69 to 0.98]; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION Despite initial promises that telemedicine would help to bridge gaps in healthcare, our results demonstrate disparities in orthopaedic telemedicine use based on race or ethnicity, language, and insurance type. The telemedicine group was slightly younger, which we do not believe undermines the findings. As healthcare moves toward increased telemedicine use, we suggest several approaches to ensure that patients of certain racial, ethnic, or language groups do not experience disparate barriers to care. These might include individual patient- or provider-level approaches like expanded telemedicine schedules to accommodate weekends and evenings, institutional investment in culturally conscious outreach materials such as advertisements on community transport systems, or government-level provisions such as reimbursement for telephone-only encounters.

In Chile, three species of non-domestic native canids are present, and due to the growing concern about their interaction with humans and domestic animals, it is of utmost relevance to determine the role of these animals in the epidemiology of brucellosis and leptospirosis. This study aimed to detect the exposure to B. abortus, B. canis, and pathogenic Leptospira by serologic, bacteriologic, and molecular techniques in native foxes from rehabilitation and exhibition centers in Central Chile. Forty-six blood samples were obtained from culpeo and grey foxes, detecting exposure to B. canis and L. Javanica in 10.9% and 7.7%, respectively. Exposure was not registered by culture and qPCR in any of the sampled animals. Our results show for the first time in Chile exposure to B. canis in native foxes, highlighting the need to establish integrated surveillance programs to better evaluate the role of wild animals in the epidemiology of emerging zoonotic pathogens that may affect One Health. ABSTRACT: Brucella abortus, B. canis, and pathogenic Leptospira are zoonotic pathogens that infect humans, as well as domestic and wild animals. In wild canids, they may affect their fertility and reproduction, threatening their conservation. Wild canids play a crucial role in the environment as meso- and top-predators and environmental sentinels for zoonotic pathogens. In Chile, three species of wild canids are present, and due to changes in land use and environmental dynamics, it is of utmost relevance to determine the role of these species in the epidemiology of brucellosis and leptospirosis. This study aimed to detect the exposure to B. abortus, B. canis, and pathogenic Leptospira by serologic, bacteriologic, and molecular techniques in native foxes from rehabilitation and exhibition centers in Central Chile. Forty-six blood samples were obtained from Lycalopex culpaeus and L. griseus, detecting 10.9% of seropositivity to B. canis and 7.7% to L. Javanica. No seropositivity was seen for B. abortus. Exposure was not registered by culture and qPCR in any of the sampled animals. Our findings are the first register of exposure to any Brucella species in wild canids in Chile and highlight the need to establish surveillance programs of these emerging pathogens.","output":"Survey of Zoonotic Bacterial Pathogens in Native Foxes in Central Chile: First Record of Brucella canis Exposure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) around the world is a tragic and shocking event that demonstrates the unpreparedness of humans to develop quick diagnostic platforms for novel infectious diseases In fact, statistical reports of diagnostic tools show that their accuracy, specificity and sensitivity in the detection of COVID-face challenges that can be eliminated by using nanoparticles (NPs) In this study, we aimed to present an overview on the most important way to diagnose different kinds of viruses followed by the introduction of nanobiosensors Afterward, some methods of coronavirus detection such as imaging, laboratory and kit-based diagnostic tests are surveyed Furthermore, nucleic acids/protein- and-immunoglobulin (Ig)-based nanobiosensors for the COVID-19 detection infection are reviewed Finally, current challenges and future perspective for the development of diagnostic or monitoring technologies in the control of COVID-19 are discussed to persuade the scientists in advancing their technologies beyond imagination In conclusion, it can be deduced that as rapid COVID-19 detection infection can play a vital role in disease control and treatment, this review may be of great help for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak by providing some necessary information for the development of portable, accurate, selectable and simple nanobiosensors","output":"Rapid diagnostics of coronavirus disease 2019 in early stages using nanobiosensors: challenges and opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as an acute respiratory illness leading to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.

PURPOSE Hospitalization affords an opportunity to reduce smoking, but fewer than half of patients who smoke receive evidence-based cessation treatment during inpatient stays. This study evaluated a pharmacist-led, electronic health record (EHR)-facilitated opt-out smoking cessation intervention designed to address this need. METHODS Analyses of EHR records for adult patients who smoked in the past 30 days admitted to an academic medical center in the upper Midwest were conducted using the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. The reach of a pharmacist-led, EHR-facilitated protocol for smoking cessation treatment was assessed by comparing patients' receipt of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and tobacco quitline referral before and after implementation.  2 tests, t tests, and multiple logistic regression models were used to compare reach across patient demographic groups to assess treatment disparities and the representativeness of reach. Adoption of the program by hospital services was also assessed. RESULTS Of the 70 hospital services invited to implement the program, 88.6% adopted it and 78.6% had eligible admissions. Treatment reach increased as rates of delivering NRT rose from 43.6% of eligible patients before implementation to 50.4% after implementation (P < 0.0001) and quitline referral rates rose from 0.9% to 11.9% (P < 0.0001). Representativeness of reach by sex and ethnicity improved after implementation, although disparities by race and age persisted after adjustment for demographics, insurance, and primary diagnosis. Pharmacists addressed tobacco use for eligible patients in 62.5% of cases after protocol implementation. CONCLUSION Smoking cessation treatment reach and representativeness of reach improved after implementation of a proactive, pharmacist-led, EHR-facilitated opt-out smoking cessation treatment protocol in adult inpatient services.","output":"Can inpatient pharmacists move the needle on smoking cessation?

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The retrospective cohort study included adult HCWs in a single healthcare system from March 9 to June 3, 2020. METHODS: Participants' SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results and demographics were de-identified and extracted from an established occupational health, COVID-19 database at the healthcare system. HCWs from each particular job grouping had been categorized into frontline/non-frontline workers. Incidence rate ratio (IRR) and odds ratio were used to compare subgroups after excluding HCWs involved in early infection clusters before universal masking. A sensitivity analysis was performed comparing jobs with the greatest potential occupational risks with others. RESULTS: 152 out of 5177 (2.94%) HCWs were diagnosed with COVID-19. Affected HCWs resided in areas with higher community attack rates (median: 1755.2 vs. 1412.4 cases per 100,000, P<0.001)(multivariate-adjusted IRR: 1.89, 95%CI: 1.03-3.44 comparing 5th to 1st quintile of community rates).

One of the key barriers has been the complex relationship between the perceived return on investment for the investor and the resulting value to patients and caregivers. Those actors who pay for technologies do not always see an appreciable return for themselves, while those actors who must apply the technology to generate value are not always incentivized to do so. This misalignment across health system payers and administrators, clinicians and patients must be better understood and addressed to help accelerate digital health. This paper will examine this challenge through the clinician experience, using empirical case examples from Canada to illustrate opportunities for change. While many factors may influence digital health adoption, this paper specifically aims to explore the shifts in the balance of the perceived value of implementing digital health tools, vs. the efforts required to adopt them. It will explore two contrasting case examples: clinical adoption of EMRs in Canada from 2009 to 2015, and clinical adoption of virtual care technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2021. In 2006, Canada lagged peer countries significantly in the adoption of electronic medical records (EMR) in community-based care. Financial support and cooperation of multiple levels of government and clinical stakeholders were required to address the misaligned incentives, which led to significant uptake by care providers. The rapid adoption of virtual care in Canada in response to the pandemic provides another relevant example of the importance of alignment among the factors of clinical workflows, clinical appropriateness, technology integration and payment models. Experts have highlighted the need for standardization, regulation, and clear policy to ensure sustainable, high quality virtual care that complements in-person care. In both cases, the costs and effort of adopting new technologies outweighed direct clinician value, requiring change initiatives to catalyze progress. This imbalance could be unique to these examples in Canada, and may not be globally generalizable to the adoption of all digital health tools. However, how change efforts can be tailored to adjust to a rapidly evolving health care workforce, spanning diverse jurisdictions and stakeholder groups will be critical to the sustainability of virtual care adoption. Furthermore, what key elements must be considered to guide change initiatives for successful implementation, designed to influence change while adding value for patients, clinicians and Canada's health care systems?

In this paper we examine evidence for seasonality and immunity to laboratory-confirmed seasonal coronavirus (HCoV) from a prospective cohort study in England. Methods: In this analysis of the Flu Watch cohort, we examine seasonal trends for PCR-confirmed coronavirus infections (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E) in all participants during winter seasons (2006-2007, 2007-2008, 2008-2009) and during the first wave of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (May-Sep 2009). We also included data from the pandemic and post-pandemic winter seasons (2009-2010 and 2010-2011) to identify individuals with two confirmed HCoV infections and examine evidence for immunity against homologous reinfection. Results: We tested 1,104 swabs taken during respiratory illness and detected HCoV in 199 during the first four seasons. The rate of confirmed HCoV infection across all seasons was 390 (95% CI 338-448) per 100,000 person-weeks; highest in the Nov-Mar 2008/9 season at 674 (95%CI 537-835) per 100,000 person-weeks.

COVID-19 most related glomerular disease to date seems to be collapsing glomerulopathy, mostly in young Afroamerican patients with APOL1 gene risk alleles. However, in our population, predominant in elderly Caucasian patients, most biopsied pathology since the beginning of the pandemic has been IgA nephritis or Sch?nlein-Henoch purpura. Since the description of the first case of this entity after SARS-CoV-2 infection by our research group, three more cases have arisen, which are described in the following article. In contrast to the rest of IgA vasculitis cases reported, our patients presented more renal function deterioration and all of them required immunosupresive therapy. Moreover, some showed incomplete recovery of renal function. This case series strengthens the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be another trigger of this pathology.","output":"Vasculitis ig a con nefritis (prpura de sch?nlein-henoch) tras covid-19: una serie de casos y revisin de la literatura"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We performed a meta-analysis to determine safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in persons with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

Methods Eighteen studies of VITT after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or Ad26.COV2.S vaccine administration were reviewed from PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science. The meta-analysis estimated the summary effects and between-study heterogeneity regarding the incidence, manifestations, sites of thrombosis, diagnostic findings, and clinical outcomes. Results The incidence of total venous thrombosis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was 28 (95% CI 12-52, I2=100%) per 100,000 doses administered. Of 664 patients in quantitative analysis (10 studies), the mean age of VITT patients was 45.6 years (95% CI 43.8-47.4, I2=57%), with a female predominance (70%). Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary thromboembolism (PE), and splanchnic vein thrombosis occurred in 54%, 36%, 19% of VITT patients, respectively. The pooled incidence rate of cerebral venous thrombosis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (23 per 100,000 person-years) was higher than the pre-pandemic rate (0.9 per 100,000 person-years). Intracranial haemorrhage and extracranial thrombosis accompanied 47% and 33% of all CVT patients, respectively. The antiplatelet factor 4 (anti-PF4) antibody positivity rate was 91% (95% CI 88-94, I2=0%) and the overall mortality was 32% (95% CI 24-41, I2=69%), and no significant difference was observed between heparin- and non-heparin-based anticoagulation treatments (risk ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.47-1.50, I2=0%). Conclusions VITT patients after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination most frequently presented with CVT following DVT/PE and splanchnic vein thrombosis, and about one-third of patients had a fatal outcome. This meta-analysis should provide a better understanding of VITT and assist clinicians in identifying VITT early to improve outcomes and optimize management.","output":"Thrombosis patterns and clinical outcome of COVID-19 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans who experience a primary dengue virus (DENV) infection develop antibodies that preferentially neutralize the homologous serotype responsible for infection.

Initial evidence suggests that women and men experience increased anger and aggression during COVID-19 lockdowns. Not surprisingly, media reports and initial empirical evidence highlight an increased risk for domestic violence (DV) during the pandemic. Nonetheless, a systematic review of studies utilizing participants' reports of potential changes in DV prevalence and severity during the pandemic as compared to pre-pandemic times is needed. OBJECTIVE: To examine empirical, peer-reviewed studies, pertaining to the potential change in prevalence and severity of different types of DV during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported by study participants. DATA SOURCES: Electronic EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL searches were conducted for the period between 2020 and January 5, 2022. References of eligible studies were integrated by using a snowballing technique. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 22 primary, empirical, peer-reviewed studies published in English or German were included. RESULTS: Of the 22 studies, 19 were cross-sectional whereas 3 included both pre-pandemic and during pandemic assessments. Data synthesis indicates that severity of all types of DV as well as the prevalence of psychological/emotional and sexual DV increased for a significant number of victims in the general population during the pandemic. Evidence for changes in prevalence regarding economic/financial, physical, and overall DV remains inconclusive. There was considerable between-study variation in reported prevalence depending on region, sample size, assessment time, and measure. CONCLUSIONS: Data synthesis partly supports the previously documented increase in DV. Governmental measures should consider the availability of easily accessible, anonymous resources.

The pandemic has shown that there is still a delay in the early response to disease outbreaks and needs a method for unknown disease outbreak detection. The study's objective is to establish a new medical knowledge representation and reasoning model, and use the model to explore the feasibility of unknown disease outbreak detection. Methods: The study defined abnormal values with diagnostic significances from clinical data as the Features, and defined the Features as the antecedents of inference rules to match with knowledge bases, achieved in detecting known or emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Meanwhile, the study built a syndromic surveillance base to capture the target cases' Features to improve the reliability and fault-tolerant ability of the system. Results: The study combined the method with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and early COVID-19 outbreaks as empirical studies. The results showed that with suitable surveillance guidelines, the method proposed in this study was capable to detect outbreaks of SARS, MERS, and early COVID-19 pandemics. The quick matching accuracies of confirmed infection cases were 89.1, 26.3-98%, and 82%, and the syndromic surveillance base would capture the Features of the remaining cases to ensure the overall detection accuracies. Based on the early COVID-19 data in Wuhan, this study estimated that the median time of the early COVID-19 cases from illness onset to local authorities' responses could be reduced to 7.0-10.0 days. Conclusions: This study offers a new solution to transfer traditional medical knowledge into structured data and form diagnosis rules, enables the representation of doctors' logistic thinking and the knowledge transmission among different users.

Although the bases of such changes are not fully understood, ultrastructural alterations in key brain areas are likely contributing factors. Recently we reported that aging-related anxiety in male Wistar rats is associated with ultrastructural changes in the central nucleus of amygdala, an area that plays important role in emotional regulation. In this study we evaluated the cognitive performance of adolescent, adult and aged male Wistar rats in multi-branch maze (MBM) as well as in Morris water maze (MWM). We also performed ultrastructural analysis of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, an area intimately involved in cognitive function. The behavioral data indicate significant impairments in few indices of cognitive functions in both tests in aged rats compared to other two age groups. Concomitantly, total number of presynaptic vesicles as well as total number of vesicles in the resting pool were significantly lower, whereas postsynaptic mitochondrial area was significantly higher in aged rats compared to other age groups. No significant differences in presynaptic terminal area or postsynaptic mitochondrial number were detected between the 3 age groups.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the impact of high compared with low intraoperative blood pressure targets on postoperative morbidity and mortality in adults undergoing cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Our primary objective was to inform the design of a future large RCT. SOURCE We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and CENTRAL for RCTs comparing high with low intraoperative blood pressure targets in adult patients undergoing any cardiac surgical procedure on CPB. We screened reference lists, grey literature, and conference proceedings. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We included eight RCTs (N =1,116 participants); all examined the effect of blood pressure management only during the CPB. Trial definitions of high compared with low blood pressure varied and, in some, there was a discrepancy between the target and achieved mean arterial pressure. We observed no difference in delirium, cognitive decline, stroke, acute kidney injury, or mortality between high and low blood pressure targets (very-low to low quality evidence). Higher blood pressure targets may have increased the risk of requiring a blood transfusion (three trials; n = 456 participants; relative risk, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.9; P = 0.01; moderate quality evidence) but this finding was based on a small number of trials. CONCLUSION Individual trial definitions of high and low blood pressure targets varied, limiting inferences. The effect of high (compared with low) blood pressure targets on other morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery remains unclear because of limitations with the body of existing evidence.

METHODS: Clinical trials have been searched and reviewed; 23 repurposed drugs and drug combinations and nine candidate vaccines have been assessed regarding the availability of relevant data in paediatrics and pregnant women and to evaluate expected or unanticipated risk. RESULTS: Thirteen of the repurposed drugs or drug combinations are indicated for use in paediatrics in some age category albeit for indications other than COVID-19; 10 of these are indicated for use in pregnant women. Even in cases where these drugs are indicated in the populations, source data from which safety and or dosing could be extrapolated for use in COVID-19 is sparse. Vaccine trials are ongoing and generally exclude pregnant women; only in a few instances have paediatric subgroups been planned for enrolment. Data from individual case studies and RWD may suggest that subpopulations of both paediatric patients and pregnant women may be more at risk, particularly those in an increased inflammatory state.

Little is known on how these interventions were affected by COVID-19. Methods: This concurrent multimethodological study incorporated two independent components: qualitative descriptive semistructured interviews with public school administrators and quantitative descriptive cross-sectional needs assessment survey of public school personnel. Results: Three themes were identified from interviews with school administrators (N = 28): changes in school-based interventions addressing PA and healthy eating behaviors, changes in academic delivery affecting PA and healthy eating behaviors, and needs of school administrators. From the survey (N = 1311), 635 (48.4%) participants indicated that schools' abilities to address PA and healthy eating behaviors were negatively impacted by COVID-19.

However, mechanistic details of SARS-CoV-2-induced MODs are unclear. Here, we have investigated the role of pancreatic secretory proteins to mechanistically link COVID-19 with MODs using single-cell transcriptome analysis. Secretory proteins were identified using the Human Protein Atlas. Gene ontology, pathway, and disease enrichment analyses were used to highlight the role of upregulated pancreatic secretory proteins (secretome). We show that SARS-CoV-2 infection shifts the expression profile of pancreatic endocrine cells to acinar and ductal cell-specific profiles, resulting in increased expression of acinar and ductal cell-specific genes. Among all the secretory proteins, the upregulated expression of IL1B, AGT, ALB, SPP1, CRP, SERPINA1, C3, TFRC, TNFSF10, and MIF was mainly associated with disease of diverse organs. Extensive literature and experimental evidence are used to validate the association of the upregulated pancreatic secretome with the coagulation cascade, complement activation, renin-angiotensinogen system dysregulation, endothelial cell injury and thrombosis, immune system dysregulation, and fibrosis. Our finding suggests the influence of an upregulated secretome on multi-organ systems such as nervous, cardiovascular, immune, digestive, and urogenital systems. Our study provides evidence that an upregulated pancreatic secretome is a possible cause of SARS-CoV-2-induced MODs.

This review explores some major evolutionary aspects arising from the discovery of these endogenous viral elements (EVEs). In particular, the reasons for the bias toward EVEs derived from negative-sense RNA viruses are considered, as well as what they tell us about the long-term arms races between hosts and viruses, characterized by episodes of selection and counter-selection.

METHODS We retrospectively collected the clinical and imaging data of 96 patients in Yunnan Province, China, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 22 and March 15, 2020. Based on disease severity, the COVID-19 patients were classified into four types: mild (n=15), moderate (n=59), severe (n=19), and critical (n=3). Based on hospital stay and number of computed tomography (CT) scans, the clinical/disease course was divided into four stages, including stage 1 (days 0-4), stage 2 (days 5-9), stage 3 (days 10-14), and stage 4 (days 15-19). The HRCT findings, CT value, and lesion volume were analyzed for each stage and compared among the four stages of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS CT findings were negative over the four stages for all mild COVID-19 patients. More lesions were found in the peripheral lung fields than in peripheral + central fields (P<0.05), and the number of negative patients in stage 4 were more than those in stages 1-3 (P<0.05). The left and right lower lobe were the most frequently affected lobes (P<0.05). In moderate patients, round ground glass opacities (GGOs) decreased from stage 1 to stage 4; partial consolidation peaked in stage 2 and then decreased in stages 3-4; fibrous stripes and subpleural lines increased from stage 1 and peaked in stage 4. Partial consolidation and consolidation were more common in severe patients than in moderate patients over the disease course (P<0.05). Critical patients showed significant partial consolidation and consolidation; The CT value, lesion volume and lesion volume percentage significantly decreased from stages 1-2 to stage 4 (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The dynamic changes in lung HRCT images are clinically related to the disease course of COVID-19.","output":"Dynamic changes in chest CT findings of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in different disease stages: a multicenter study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NEW FINDINGS What is the central question of this study? In order to discern information about testing modalities when assessing neuroplastic responses to squat resistance training, the present study investigated whether corticospinal and intracortical function was different between a joint-angle-matched isometric squat and isometric knee extension. What is the main finding and its importance? The present data show poor agreement of corticospinal and intracortical function between the isometric squat and isometric knee extension. The data reinforce the notion that task specificity is of the utmost importance for assessing neuroplasticity. ABSTRACT It has been suggested that task-specific changes in neurophysiological function (neuroplasticity) should be assessed using testing modalities that replicate the characteristics of the intervention. The squat is a commonly prescribed resistance exercise that has been shown to elicit changes in CNS function. However, previous studies have assessed squat-induced neuroplasticity using isometric knee extension, potentially confounding the results. The aim of the present study was to assess the agreement between corticospinal and intracortical activity relating to the knee extensors during isometric knee extension compared with an isometric squat task. Eleven males completed a neurophysiological assessment in an isometric squat (IS) and knee-extension (KE) task matched for joint angles (hip, knee and ankle). Single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation was delivered during isometric contractions at a range of intensities to assess short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI) and corticospinal excitability. Group mean values for SICI (70  14 versus 63  12% of unconditioned motor evoked potential during IS and KE, respectively) and corticospinal excitability (mean differences 2-5% of the maximal compound muscle action potential at 25, 50, 75 and 100% maximal voluntary contraction between the IS and KE) were not different between the two tasks (P > 0.05) in the vastus lateralis. However, limits of agreement were wide, with poor-to-moderate average intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) (SICI, ICC3,1 = 0.15; corticospinal excitability, average ICC3,1 range = 0.0-0.63), indicating disparate corticospinal and intracortical activity between the IS and KE. These data highlight the importance of task specificity when assessing the modulation of corticospinal excitability and SICI in response to interventions resulting in neuroplastic changes.","output":"Motor cortical and corticospinal function differ during an isometric squat compared with isometric knee extension."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Recent national events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and protests of racial inequities, have drawn attention to the role of physicians in advocating for improvements in the social, economic, and political factors that affect health. Characterizing the current state of advocacy training in U.S. medical schools may help set expectations for physician advocacy and predict future curricular needs. METHOD Using the members school directory provided by the Association of American Medical Colleges, the authors compiled a list of 154 MD-granting medical schools in the United States in 2019-2020. They used multiple search strategies to identify online course catalogues and advocacy-related curricula using variations of the terms \\"advocacy,\\" \\"policy,\\" \\"equity,\\" and \\"social determinants of health.\\" They used an iterative process to generate a preliminary coding schema and to code all course descriptions, conducting content analysis to describe the structure of courses and topics covered. RESULTS Of 134 medical schools with any online course catalogue available, 103 (76.9%) offered at least one advocacy course. Required courses were typically survey courses focused on general content in health policy, population health, or public health/epidemiology, whereas elective courses were more likely to focus specifically on advocacy skills building and to feature field experiences. Of 352 advocacy-specific courses, 93 (26.4%) concentrated on a specific population (e.g., children or persons with low socioeconomic status). Few courses (n = 8) focused on racial/ethnic minorities and racial inequities. CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest that while most U.S. medical schools offer at least one advocacy course, the majority are elective rather than required, and the structure and content of advocacy-related courses vary substantially. Given the urgency to address social, economic, and political factors affecting health and health equity, this study provides an important and timely overview of the prevalence and content of advocacy curricula at U.S. medical schools.","output":"Prevalence and Characteristics of Advocacy Curricula in U.S. Medical Schools."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Patients with thoracic malignancies are at increased risk for mortality from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and large number of intertwined prognostic variables have been identified so far. Methods Capitalizing data from the TERAVOLT registry, a global study created with the aim of describing the impact of COVID-19 in patients with thoracic malignancies, we used a clustering approach, a fast-backward step-down selection procedure and a tree-based model to screen and optimize a broad panel of demographics, clinical COVID-19 and cancer characteristics. Results As of April 15, 2021, 1491 consecutive evaluable patients from 18 countries were included in the analysis. With a mean observation period of 42 days, 361 events were reported with an all-cause case fatality rate of 24.2%. The clustering procedure screened approximately 73 covariates in 13 clusters. A further multivariable logistic regression for the association between clusters and death was performed, resulting in five clusters significantly associated with the outcome. The fast-backward step-down selection then identified seven major determinants of death ECOG-PS (OR 2.47 1.87-3.26), neutrophil count (OR 2.46 1.76-3.44), serum procalcitonin (OR 2.37 1.64-3.43), development of pneumonia (OR 1.95 1.48-2.58), c-reactive protein (CRP) (OR 1.90 1.43-2.51), tumor stage at COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 1.97 1.46-2.66) and age (OR 1.71 1.29-2.26). The ROC analysis for death of the selected model confirmed its diagnostic ability (AUC 0.78; 95%CI: 0.75 C 0.81). The nomogram was able to classify the COVID-19 mortality in an interval ranging from 8% to 90% and the tree-based model recognized ECOG-PS, neutrophil count and CRP as the major determinants of prognosis. Conclusion From 73 variables analyzed, seven major determinants of death have been identified. Poor ECOG-PS demonstrated the strongest association with poor outcome from COVID-19.

This variant is associated with increased transmissibility compared to the Alpha variant that was previously dominant. To understand ongoing transmission and interventions, a key question is whether the Delta variant generation time (the time between infections in infector- infectee pairs) is typically shorter-i.e., transmissions are happening more quickly-or whether infected individuals simply generate more infections. MethodsWe analysed transmission data from a UK Health Security Agency household study. By fitting a mathematical transmission model to the data, we estimated the generation times for the Alpha and Delta variants. ResultsThe mean intrinsic generation time (the generation time if there had been a constant supply of susceptibles throughout infection) was shorter for the Delta variant (4{middle dot}6 days, 95% CrI 4{middle dot}0-5{middle dot}4 days) than the Alpha variant (5{middle dot}5 days, 95% CrI 4{middle dot}6-6{middle dot}4 days), although within uncertainty ranges. However, there was a larger difference in the realised mean household generation time between the Delta (3{middle dot}2 days, 95% CrI 2{middle dot}4-4{middle dot}2 days) and Alpha (4{middle dot}5 days, 95% CrI 3{middle dot}7-5{middle dot}4 days) variants. This is because higher transmissibility led to faster susceptible depletion in households, in addition to the reduced intrinsic generation time. ConclusionsThe Delta variant transmits more quickly than previously circulating variants. This has implications for interventions such as contact tracing, testing and isolation, which are less effective if the virus is transmitted quickly. Epidemiological models of interventions should be updated to include the shorter generation time of the Delta variant.","output":"Generation time of the Alpha and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has changed the provision of medical services worldwide. We assessed the impact of the pandemic on the oncological patients' visits to a tertiary cancer centre. METHODS We analysed registrations from the administrative data system of in- and outpatients in all of the departments of the Cluj-Napoca Oncology Institute, during March-October 2020, and compared to the same 7-month period of the previous year. RESULTS The decrease during March-October 2020 was 40.2% for new referrals overall (with the most significant drop in April, of 80%), 52.5% for medical oncology inpatients, 39% for paediatric oncology department inpatients, 69% for radiotherapy inpatients, 34.9% for surgical interventions and 31% decrease of issued pathology reports. The decrease was less important for outpatients: only 10% for medical oncology outpatient department, 33% for radiotherapy and 27% for breast cancer unit outpatients. Imaging investigations were only slightly influenced by the pandemic (reduction of 5% for MRI scans, 19% for mammograms,whereas performed CT scans were even more after the outbreak of COVID-19).

Both the general ability of the rtRPA reaction to occur while in contact with the cured 3D printing materials as well as the residual autofluorescence and fluorescence drift in dependence on post curing of the materials is characterized. We 3D printed monolithic rtRPA microreactors and subjected the devices to different post curing protocols. Residual autofluorescence and drift, as well as rtRPA kinetics, were then measured in a custom-made mobile temperature-controlled fluorescence reader (mTFR). Furthermore, we investigated the effects of storage on the devices over a 30-day period. Finally, we present the single- and duplex rtRPA detection of both the organism-specific Klebsiella haemolysin (khe) gene and the New Delhi metallo--lactamase 1 (bla(NDM-1)) gene from Klebsiella pneumoniae. Results: No combination of 3D printing resin and post curing protocol completely inhibited the rtRPA reaction. The autofluorescence and fluorescence drift measured were found to be highly dependent on printing material and wavelength. Storage had the effect of decreasing the autofluorescence of the investigated materials. Both khe and bla(NDM-1) were successfully detected by single- and duplex-rtRPA inside monolithic rtRPA microreactors printed from NextDent Ortho Clear (NXOC). The reaction kinetics were found to be close to those observed for rtRPA performed in a microcentrifuge tube without the need for mixing during amplification. Singleplex assays for both khe and bla(NDM-1) achieved a limit of detection of 2.5  10(1) DNA copies while the duplex assay achieved 2.5  10(1) DNA copies for khe and 2.5  10(2) DNA copies for bla(NDM-1).

The aim of this study is to describe the management and results of the respective fracture types and different injury characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study performs a retrospective data analysis of 100 consecutive patients with a fracture of the proximal radius treated in a single high-volume pediatric trauma center. RESULTS: One hundred patients [mean age 7.5 years (1-15)] were documented with a fracture of the proximal radius between 3/2011 and 12/2019. The gender distribution was 62 girls and 38 boys. Twenty-seven patients had concomitant injuries. Conservative treatment was performed in 63 patients (Judet I = 27; II = 30; III = 6; Mason I = 2) using an above-the-elbow cast for 21 days (6-35). Surgical treatment was performed in 37 patients (Judet II = 3; III = 22; IV = 5; V = 7) using elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN). Open reduction was necessary in five cases, and additional immobilization was performed in 32 cases. Six complications occurred: loss of implant stability (n = 2), healing in malalignment, pseudarthrosis, radioulnar synostosis, and a persisting hypoesthesia at the thumb. As a result, two ESIN osteosynthesis were revised, and one radial head resection was performed. Loss of movement was seen in 11% of cases, overall Mayo elbow performance index (MEPI) was 99.8 (90-100), and none of the patients experienced negative impacts on activities of daily life. CONCLUSIONS: Proximal radial fractures occur predominately without dislocation. Good results are obtained with conservative treatment throughout. In cases with displacement exceeding growth-related correction, ESIN is the undisputed treatment of choice.

More than ever, valid, transparent, and intuitive summaries of the treatment effects, including efficacy and harm, are needed. In recently published and ongoing randomized comparative trials evaluating treatments for COVID-19, time to a positive outcome, such as recovery or improvement, has repeatedly been used as either the primary or key secondary end point. Because patients may die before recovery or improvement, data analysis of this end point faces a competing risk problem. Commonly used survival analysis techniques, such as the Kaplan-Meier method, often are not appropriate for such situations. Moreover, almost all trials have quantified treatment effects by using the hazard ratio, which is difficult to interpret for a positive event, especially in the presence of competing risks. Using 2 recent trials evaluating treatments (remdesivir and convalescent plasma) for COVID-19 as examples, a valid, well-established yet underused procedure is presented for estimating the cumulative recovery or improvement rate curve across the study period.

There is a need to bridge the growing literature on learning and extinction mechanisms of gambling behavior, with account tracking studies using real-life gambling data. In this study, we describe the development and validation of the Frescati Online Research Casino (FORC): a simulated online casino where games, visual themes, outcome sizes, probabilities, and other variables of interest can be experimentally manipulated to conduct behavioral analytic studies and evaluate the efficacy of responsible gambling tools. Methods: FORC features an initial survey for self-reporting of gambling and gambling problems, along with several games resembling regular real-life casino games, designed to allow Pavlovian and instrumental learning. FORC was developed with maximum flexibility in mind, allowing detailed experiment specification by setting parameters using an online interface, including the display of messages. To allow convenient and rapid data collection from diverse samples, FORC is independently hosted yet integrated with the popular crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk through a reimbursement key mechanism. To validate the survey data quality and game mechanics of FORC, n = 101 participants were recruited, who answered an questionnaire on gambling habits and problems, then played both slot machine and card-draw type games. Questionnaire and trial-by-trial behavioral data were analyzed using standard psychometric tests, and outcome distribution modeling. Results: The expected associations among variables in the introductory questionnaire were found along with good psychometric properties, suggestive of good quality data. Only 6% of participants provided seemingly poor behavioral data. Game mechanics worked as intended: gambling outcomes showed the expected pattern of random sampling with replacement and were normally distributed around the set percentages, while balances developed according to the set return to player rate. Conclusions: FORC appears to be a valid paradigm for simulating online gambling and for collecting survey and behavioral data, offering a valuable compromise between stringent experimental paradigms with lower external validity, and real-world gambling account tracking data with lower internal validity.","output":"Studying Gambling Behaviors and Responsible Gambling Tools in a Simulated Online Casino Integrated With Amazon Mechanical Turk: Development and Initial Validation of Survey Data and Platform Mechanics of the Frescati Online Research Casino"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy (SLC) is touted as an improved approach to minimally invasive surgery, although no data currently exist regarding the acquisition of this technique. The aim of this study was to evaluate resident performance and outcomes in patients undergoing SLC performed by residents vs. staff colorectal surgeons. A retrospective case-control study was conducted, including 220 patients who underwent elective surgical intervention with multiport laparoscopic colectomy (MLC, n=141) or SLC (n=79) for colon cancer over a 24-month period at Yao Municipal Hospital (Yao, Japan). Data on patient demographics, operative data, oncological outcomes and short-term outcomes were evaluated for statistical significance. To investigate issues regarding the surgical procedures, the entire operation was recorded on video for all patients and was divided into 6 procedures, with each procedure measured in seconds. Senior-level residents were able to safely perform MLC under appropriate experienced supervision. For SLC, 1 case required conversion to an open procedure. No case required additional trocar placement. The mean operative times were similar for the staff and resident groups for total colon cancer (192.5 and 217.5 min, respectively; P=0.88), whereas the operative times of the staff group for right-sided colon cancer were significantly longer, and the operative times of the resident group for left-sided colon cancer were significantly longer. In addition, the overall perioperative outcomes, including blood loss, number of harvested lymph nodes, length of the surgical margin and complications, were similar between the two groups. When video recordings were evaluated by dividing the surgical process for the right colon into 4 procedures and that for the left colon into 6 procedures, the results demonstrated that the residents required more time to close the mesenteric margin for the left colon compared with the staff performing the same procedure (3,470.11,258.5 vs. 5,218.62,341.2 sec; P=0.01). Therefore, senior-level residents were able to safely perform SLC under appropriate experienced supervision. For the left colon, the main challenge for the residents appeared to be the closure of the mesenteric margin.

Chest radiograph (CXR) has been playing a crucial role in COVID-19 patient triaging, diagnosing and monitoring, particularly in the United States. Considering the mixed and unspecific signals in CXR, an image retrieval model of CXR that provides both similar images and associated clinical information can be more clinically meaningful than a direct image diagnostic model. In this work we develop a novel CXR image retrieval model based on deep metric learning. Unlike traditional diagnostic models which aim at learning the direct mapping from images to labels, the proposed model aims at learning the optimized embedding space of images, where images with the same labels and similar contents are pulled together. The proposed model utilizes multi-similarity loss with hard-mining sampling strategy and attention mechanism to learn the optimized embedding space, and provides similar images, the visualizations of disease-related attention maps and useful clinical information to assist clinical decisions. The model is trained and validated on an international multi-site COVID-19 dataset collected from 3 different sources. Experimental results of COVID-19 image retrieval and diagnosis tasks show that the proposed model can serve as a robust solution for CXR analysis and patient management for COVID-19. The model is also tested on its transferability on a different clinical decision support task for COVID-19, where the pre-trained model is applied to extract image features from a new dataset without any further training. The extracted features are then combined with COVID-19 patient's vitals, lab tests and medical histories to predict the possibility of airway intubation in 72 hours, which is strongly associated with patient prognosis, and is crucial for patient care and hospital resource planning. These results demonstrate our deep metric learning based image retrieval model is highly efficient in the CXR retrieval, diagnosis and prognosis, and thus has great clinical value for the treatment and management of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Deep metric learning-based image retrieval system for chest radiograph and its clinical applications in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Triclocarban (TCC), a broad-spectrum lipophilic antimicrobial agent, is a diarylurea derivative that has been used for more than 60 years as a major ingredient of toys, clothing, food packaging materials, food industry floors, medical supplies and especially of personal care products, such as soaps, toothpaste and shampoo.

Some rotaviruses and coronaviruses antagonize the OAS/RNase L pathway through the activity of an encoded 2H phosphoesterase domain that cleaves 2-5A. These viral 2H phosphoesterases are phylogenetically related to the cellular A kinase anchoring protein 7 (AKAP7) and share a core structure and an active site that contains two well-defined H(S/T) (where  is a hydrophobic residue) motifs, but their mechanism of substrate binding is unknown. Here, we report the structures of a viral 2H phosphoesterase, the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the group A rotavirus (RVA) VP3 protein, both alone and in complex with 2-5A. The domain forms a compact fold, with a concave -sheet that contains the catalytic cleft, but it lacks two -helical regions and two -strands observed in AKAP7 and other 2H phosphoesterases. The cocrystal structure shows significant conformational changes in the R loop upon ligand binding. Bioinformatics and biochemical analyses reveal that conserved residues and residues required for catalytic activity and substrate binding comprise the catalytic motifs and a region on one side of the binding cleft. We demonstrate that the VP3 CTD of group B rotavirus, but not that of group G, cleaves 2-5A. These findings suggest that the VP3 CTD is a streamlined version of a 2H phosphoesterase with a ligand-binding mechanism that is shared among 2H phosphodiesterases that cleave 2-5A. IMPORTANCE The C-terminal domain (CTD) of rotavirus VP3 is a 2H phosphoesterase that cleaves 2'-5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A), potent activators of an important innate cellular antiviral pathway. 2H phosphoesterase superfamily proteins contain two conserved catalytic motifs and a proposed core structure. Here, we present structures of a viral 2H phosphoesterase, the rotavirus VP3 CTD, alone and in complex with its substrate, 2-5A. The domain lacks two -helical regions and -strands present in other 2H phosphoesterases. A loop of the protein undergoes significant structural changes upon substrate binding. Together with our bioinformatics and biochemical findings, the crystal structures suggest that the RVA VP3 CTD domain is a streamlined version of a cellular enzyme that shares a ligand-binding mechanism with other 2H phosphodiesterases that cleave 2-5A but differs from those of 2H phosphodiesterases that cleave other substrates. These findings may aid in the future design of antivirals targeting viral phosphodiesterases with cleavage specificity for 2-5A.","output":"Structural basis for 2'-5'-oligoadenylate binding and enzyme activity of a viral RNase L antagonist."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The structured data collected by the Internet of Things can be encrypted for protecting the user's privacy. Range query can be used to get the expected data with some specific attributes among the encrypted data, that is, given the upper and lower limits $(x, y)$ of a certain attribute, the range query will get all the records whose corresponding attribute values are in $(x, y)$. However, in the structured encryption scheme with range query, there is a certain amount of information leakage, which will lead to the so-called inference attacks, i.e., the attacker can obtain the user's attribute values. To hide attribute values and their relationship, this article transformed the problem of the numerical comparison between two attribute values into the problem of the intersection of two sets. By using the Bloom filter, the elements in the attribute value collection are recorded and determined whether the intersection of the two sets is empty. This ensures that our scheme effectively resists inference attacks. Besides, by multiplying the endpoints of the range interval by a large number, we gave an improved scheme to hide the user's search pattern. In the query process, our scheme will not leak the upper and lower limits of the range value and will not leak the relationship between the attribute value and the range interval. This will prevent the attacker from inducing the relationship of attribute values by multiple range queries. Finally, we conducted a simulation evaluation of the scheme by using the published novel coronavirus pneumonia data, and the results show that our scheme has a better performance than the existing schemes.","output":"Leakage-Suppressed Range Query Scheme for Structured Data in IoT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The authors examined the acceptability and feasibility of telehealth services shortly after their rapid introduction into a community behavioral health agency as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Individuals receiving services during May 8-18, 2020, from behavioral health programs that had introduced telehealth in March 2020, were invited to participate in a survey regarding their perceptions of the telehealth services. Ordinal logistic regressions were used to test for differences in survey responses in three ways: between program types, between the 2020 sample and a 2018 sample, and between individuals reported by staff to be distressed or not distressed by the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Of 1,482 survey respondents, >80% reported that their ability to connect to staff, receive support, and get an appointment was at least as great as before the pandemic. Among 80% of respondents indicating interest in continuing remote services after the pandemic ended, 83% preferred a mix of remote and face-to-face services. From February 2020 to April 2020, total service utilization remained stable for treatment, outreach, and housing programs. In addition, mental health-related hospital utilization did not increase. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that telehealth, including telephone-based services, is an acceptable and even preferred service delivery mode for clients with severe mental illness. Continued investigation into the optimal dosing of face-to-face versus remote services in various settings is needed to inform service practice during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Telehealth Acceptability and Feasibility Among People Served in a Community Behavioral Health System During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Case investigation (CI) and contact tracing (CT) are key to containing the COVID-19 pandemic. Widespread community transmission necessitates a large, diverse workforce with specialized knowledge and skills. The University of California, San Francisco and Los Angeles partnered with the California Department of Public Health to rapidly mobilize and train a CI/CT workforce. In April through August 2020, a team of public health practitioners and health educators constructed a training program to enable learners from diverse backgrounds to quickly acquire the competencies necessary to function effectively as CIs and CTs. Between April 27 and May 5, the team undertook a curriculum design sprint by performing a needs assessment, determining relevant goals and objectives, and developing content. The initial four-day curriculum consisted of 13 hours of synchronous live web meetings and 7 hours of asynchronous, self-directed study. Educational content emphasized the principles of COVID-19 exposure, infectious period, isolation and quarantine guidelines and the importance of prevention and control interventions. A priority was equipping learners with skills in rapport building and health coaching through facilitated web-based small group skill development sessions. The training was piloted among 31 learners and subsequently expanded to an average weekly audience of 520 persons statewide starting May 7, reaching 7,499 unique enrollees by August 31. Capacity to scale and sustain the training program was afforded by the UCLA Extension Canvas learning management system. Repeated iteration of content and format was undertaken based on feedback from learners, facilitators, and public health and community-based partners. It is feasible to rapidly train and deploy a large workforce to perform CI and CT. Interactive skills-based training with opportunity for practice and feedback are essential to develop independent, high-performing CIs and CTs.

Seroprevalence is crucial for estimating quantities such as the infection fatality ratio, proportion of asymptomatic cases, and differences in infection rates across population subgroups. However, serologic assays are prone to false positives and negatives, and non-probability sampling methods may induce selection bias. In this paper, we consider nonparametric and parametric seroprevalence estimators that address both challenges by leveraging validation data and assuming equal probabilities of sample inclusion within covariate-defined strata. Both estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, and consistent variance estimators are derived. Simulation studies are presented comparing the finite sample performance of the estimators over a range of assay characteristics and sampling scenarios.

OBJECTIVES To identify predictors of adverse outcomes in patients hospitalised for exacerbation of COPD. METHODS A prospective, observational study was conducted in patients admitted for exacerbation of COPD. Demographic and clinical parameters were evaluated, including different multidimensional prognostic scores. Adverse outcomes included the following: death during hospitalisation or 1-month follow-up, intensive care unit admission, invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospitalisation (>11 days) and COPD-related emergency visit or readmission within 1 month after discharge. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. RESULTS Of 155 patients included, an adverse outcome occurred in 69 (45%). Patients with an adverse outcome had lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (p = 0.004) and more frequent exacerbations (p = 0.011), more frequently used oxygen at home (p = 0.042) and presented with lower pH (p < 0.001), lower ratio of arterial oxygen pressure to the fraction of inspired oxygen (p = 0.006), higher arterial carbon dioxide pressure (p < 0.001) and a worse score on several prognostic indices at admission. Independent predictors of adverse outcome were exacerbation of COPD in the previous year [odds ratio 3.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-9.9; p = 0.004], hypercapnia (odds ratio 9.4, 95% CI 3.7-23.6; p < 0.001) and hypoxaemia (odds ratio 4.3, 95% CI 1.5-12.6; p = 0.008). In the presence of all three characteristics, the probability of an adverse outcome was 95%, while hypercapnia was the strongest prognostic factor with a risk of 54%. CONCLUSIONS Patients with previous exacerbation of COPD, hypercapnia and hypoxaemia had the highest risk of an unfavourable evolution.

They are at the basis of an inference mechanism that has been recognized as a suitable tool for classification and has led to a variety of analogical classifiers in the last decade. Given an object D to be classified, the basic idea of such classifiers is to look for triples of examples (A, B, C), in the learning set, that form an analogical proportion with D, on a maximum set of attributes. In the context of classification, objects A, B, C and D are assumed to be represented by vectors of feature values. Analogical inference relies on the fact that if a proportion [Formula: see text] is valid, one of the four components of the proportion can be computed from the three others. Based on this principle, analogical classifiers have a cubic complexity due to the search for all possible triples in a learning set to make a single prediction. A special case of analogical proportions involving only three items A, B and C are called continuous analogical proportions and are of the form A is to B as B is to C (hence denoted [Formula: see text]). In this paper, we develop a new classification algorithm based on continuous analogical proportions and applied to numerical features. Focusing on pairs rather than triples, the proposed classifier enables us to compute an unknown midpoint item B given a pair of items (A, C).

While there is a profound knowledge base regarding the sedimentation of rigid solid particles, the fundamental principles of sedimentation dynamics of elastic spheres in bounded fluids are not well understood. This especially applies to nonheavy spheres, whose density is close to that of the surrounding medium and which therefore show extended inertial effects upon acceleration. Here, we present model experiments of the sedimentation dynamics of deformable, nonheavy spheres in the presence of walls. Despite the deformations of the particles being small, the particle dynamics of elastic spheres differed fundamentally from that of rigid spheres. Initially, the sedimentation of elastic spheres is comparable with the sedimentation of rigid spheres. From a characteristic onset position of about 10R, deformability effects kick in and a second acceleration appears. Finally, the deformable spheres reach a terminal sedimentation velocity. The softer the spheres are (in terms of Young's elastic modulus), the higher the terminal velocity is. In the present setup, a terminal velocity up to 9% higher than the velocity for comparable rigid spheres was reached.

No proven treatment for SARS-CoV-2 was available at that time, especially for severe COVID-19-induced ARDS. We determined whether the infusion of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) would help to improve pulmonary function and overall outcome in patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS. We offered MSC infusion as an extended indication to all critically ill COVID-19 patients with a Horovitz index <100. We treated 5 out of 23 patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS with an infusion of MSCs. One million MSCs/kg body weight was infused over 30 minutes, and the process was repeated in 3 patients twice and in 2 patients 3 times. RESULT: Four out of 5 MSC-treated patients compared to 50% of control patients (9 out of 18) received ECMO support (80%). The MSC group showed a higher Murray score on admission than control patients, reflecting more severe pulmonary compromise (3.5  0.2 versus 2.8  0.3). MSC infusion was safe and well tolerated. The MSC group had a significantly higher Horovitz score on discharge than the control group. Compared to controls, patients with MSC treatment showed a significantly lower Murray score upon discharge than controls. In the MSC group, 4 out of 5 patients (80%) survived to discharge and exhibited good pulmonary function, whereas only 8 out of 18 patients (45%) in the control group survived to discharge. CONCLUSION: MSC infusion is a safe treatment for COVID-19 ARDS that improves pulmonary function and overall outcome in this patient population.","output":"Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy for Severe COVID-19 ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza A virus (IAV) continuously causes epidemics and claims numerous lives every year. The available treatment options are insufficient and the limited pertinence of animal models for human IAV infections is hampering the development of new therapeutics. Bioprinted tissue models support studying pathogenic mechanisms and pathogen-host interactions in a human micro tissue environment. Here, we describe a human lung model, which consisted of a bioprinted base of primary human lung fibroblasts together with monocytic THP-1 cells, on top of which alveolar epithelial A549 cells were printed. Cells were embedded in a hydrogel consisting of alginate, gelatin and collagen. These constructs were kept in long-term culture for 35 days and their viability, expression of specific cell markers and general rheological parameters were analyzed. When the models were challenged with a combination of the bacterial toxins LPS and ATP, a release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-8 was observed, confirming that the model can generate an immune response. In virus inhibition assays with the bioprinted lung model, the replication of a seasonal IAV strain was restricted by treatment with an antiviral agent in a dose-dependent manner. The printed lung construct provides an alveolar model to investigate pulmonary pathogenic biology and to support development of new therapeutics not only for IAV, but also for other viruses.","output":"Bioprinted Multi-Cell Type Lung Model for the Study of Viral Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, the authors describe a new method for assessing the impact of emerging infections on global trade flows. When one compares notifications to the World Trade Organization (WTO) of the emergency measures taken to control certain animal and plant diseases with the trade values of certain products from the United Nation's Commodity Trade Statistics Database (Comtrade) (identified through the World Customs Organization's harmonised system of tariff product codes [HS]), it is possible to estimate the extent to which trade has been diverted from the affected economies. The authors study in detail the example of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). When member countries of the WTO change their import policies towards the goods of a trading partner, as the result of an emerging disease such as BSE, they must file notifications of such changes through the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Committee of the WTO. To quantify the impact of BSE on trade, the authors compared these notifications against Comtrade statistics, using the HS 1996 tariff code variable. (The HS 1996 tariff codes allow the tracking and recording of the volumes of exports and imports, in quantity and value, between any two member countries between 1998 and 2000 in the database.) The authors then used this linked dataset to describe the dollar impact of the BSE-related notifications filed in 2000 on the trade flow of imports. The results of this study suggest that economies affected by BSE notifications saw a decline of US$5.6 billion from hypothetical projections in designated products. At the same time, unaffected economies saw an increase of US$1.5 billion from hypothetical projections in the same products. Thus, it may be concluded that import restrictions to control the spread of emergent spongiform encephalopathy infection had a significant effect on trade flows. These results also emphasise the interconnectedness of global trade: trade restrictions for some economies may enhance trade opportunities for others. Further studies using these methods are warranted.","output":"A new method for assessing the impact of emerging infections on global trade."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extubation of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a high risk procedure for both patients and staff.

We assessed the association between 30-day mortality and past-year physician (0, 1-4, 5-9, 10-19, 20) and hospital (<10, 10-19, 20-39, 40) CAS volumes and past-year hospital coronary and peripheral stenting volumes (<200, 200-399, 400-849, 850) among beneficiaries at least 66 years of age. Unadjusted 30-day mortality risk was 1.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-2.0) for 19 724 patients undergoing CAS by 2045 physicians in 729 hospitals. Median past-year CAS volume was 9 (interquartile range, 4-19) for physicians and 23 (interquartile range, 12-41) for hospitals. Compared to physicians performing 20 CAS in the past year, lower CAS volumes were associated with higher adjusted risks of 30-day morality (P value for trend < 0.05): 1.4 (95% CI, 0.9-2.3) for 0 past-year CAS, 1.3 (95% CI, 0.9-1.8) for 1 to 4, 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8-1.6) for 5 to 9, and 0.9 (95% CI, 0.7-1.4) for 10 to 19.

We aimed to describe the associations of health indicators with the national CFRs of COVID-19. METHODS: We identified health indicators for each country potentially associated with the national CFRs of COVID-19. We extracted data for 18 variables from international administrative data sources for 34 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We excluded the collinear variables and examined the 16 variables in multivariable analysis. A dynamic web-based model was developed to analyse and display the associations for the CFRs of COVID-19. We followed the Guideline for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). RESULTS: In multivariable analysis, the variables significantly associated with the increased CFRs were percent of obesity in ages >18 years ( = 3.26, 95% CI = [1.20, 5.33], p = 0.003), tuberculosis incidence ( = 3.15, 95% CI = [1.09, 5.22], p = 0.004), duration (days) since first death due to COVID-19 ( = 2.89, 95% CI = [0.83, 4.96], p = 0.008), median age ( = 2.83, 95% CI = [0.76, 4.89], p = 0.009).

We implemented a study of the feasibility and efficacy of face masks and hand hygiene to reduce influenza transmission among Hong Kong household members. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of households (composed of at least 3 members) where an index subject presented with influenza-like-illness of <48 hours duration. After influenza was confirmed in an index case by the QuickVue Influenza A+B rapid test, the household of the index subject was randomized to 1) control or 2) surgical face masks or 3) hand hygiene. Households were visited within 36 hours, and 3, 6 and 9 days later. Nose and throat swabs were collected from index subjects and all household contacts at each home visit and tested by viral culture. The primary outcome measure was laboratory culture confirmed influenza in a household contact; the secondary outcome was clinically diagnosed influenza (by self-reported symptoms). We randomized 198 households and completed follow up home visits in 128; the index cases in 122 of those households had laboratory-confirmed influenza. There were 21 household contacts with laboratory confirmed influenza corresponding to a secondary attack ratio of 6%. Clinical secondary attack ratios varied from 5% to 18% depending on case definitions. The laboratory-based or clinical secondary attack ratios did not significantly differ across the intervention arms. Adherence to interventions was variable. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The secondary attack ratios were lower than anticipated, and lower than reported in other countries, perhaps due to differing patterns of susceptibility, lack of significant antigenic drift in circulating influenza virus strains recently, and/or issues related to the symptomatic recruitment design.

METHODS A COVID-19 outbreak among staff members of a major German children's and women's hospital was followed by massive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and provided the opportunity to study symptoms, chains of infection and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses (IgG and IgA) by ELISA. Study participants were classified as COVID-19 cases, and persons with close, moderate or no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical setting, respectively. RESULTS Out of 201 study participants, 31 were COVID-19 cases. While most study participants experienced many symptoms indicative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, anosmia and coughing were remarkably more frequent in COVID-19 cases.

Mainly, this is attributed to the fear of the possible side effects and complications. Moreover, inaccurate knowledge disseminated through the media/social media especially by those who lack proper expertise adds confusion and more fear that affects the vaccination decision. For such reasons, it is essential to find strategies to increase the acceptability of vaccines and to enhance confidence in the vaccination process.

Acute pneumonia was evident in animals 24 hpi. Spp lentivirus was mainly found in LDLR(+) macrophages and pneumocytes in the lungs, but not in MARC1(+) macrophages. IL6, IL10, CD80 and PPAR\\\\ were quickly upregulated in response to infection of Spp lentivirus in the lungs in vivo as well as in macrophage\\\\like RAW264.7 cells in vitro. We further confirmed that forced expression of the Spike protein in RAW264.7 cells could significantly increase the mRNA levels of the same panel of inflammatory factors.

The practice of worship during the Covid-19 pandemic shifted in patterns and choices of kyai schools of thought after the MUI fatwa, which issued regulation regarding the temporary abolition of Friday, Eid prayers, tarawih, and the use of masks, hand sanitizers, and social distance (distanced rows) in the congregation of 5 daily prayers and religious activities in the mosque. This diversity is interesting to explore because these various conceptions of the acts of worship give negative impacts on intra-religious harmony. There are signs of socio-religious conflict, distrust of certain community leaders, symptoms of disharmony, disbelief in other parties in the public sphere, and social media. This socio-religious dialectical context is encountered by the kyai, leaders and communities on the northern coast of Central Java, especially in Pati Regency and Semarang City. This is qualitative research using multi-disciplinary methods regarding normative analysis of Islamic law and socio-anthropology. Data was collected through interviews with kyai and community leaders, observation and documentation. Data validation was carried out through triangulation, as well as descriptive-qualitative analysis, through reduction, data presentation, and drawing conclusions. The findings of this study are as follows: First, the dynamics of a new conception of fiqh as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic amid various MUI and government policies through the implementation of health protocol. Second, four typical new conceptions of fiqh were found for kyai and the public during a pandemic. The diversity of this community typology can be seen from their worship behavior and religious actions. Typical of the first group is 'normative' whose written texts are understood in literal sence about the pandemic jurisprudence and are very strict about implementing health protocol. The second is the 'moderate group' who is flexible in conceptualizing the fiqh of pandemic and carrying out health protocol. Third, there are 'liberative-ignore' groups who are liberal in understanding fiqh during the pandemic, and they do not pay much attention to the health protocol. Typical of the fourth group, the 'skeptics' who do not believe in the presence of the covid-19 pandemic, even among this group there are those who think that covid is just a power politics engineering. ? 2021 Samarah.

Methods: A follow-up survey was conducted six weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 antibody test. The follow-up survey included 4500 people with a positive result and 4039 with a negative result. Reported changes in behaviour were assessed using difference-in-differences models. A nested interview study was conducted with 40 people to explore how they thought through their behavioural decisions. Results: While respondents reduced their protective behaviours over the six weeks, we did not find evidence that positive test results changed participant behaviour trajectories in relation to the number of contacts the respondents had, for leaving the house to go to work, or for leaving the house to socialise in a personal place. The qualitative findings supported these results. Most people did not think that they had changed their behaviours because of their test results, however they did allude to some changes in their attitudes and perceptions around risk, susceptibility, and potential severity of symptoms. Conclusions: : We found limited evidence that knowing your antibody status leads to behaviour change in the context of a research study. While this finding should not be generalised to widespread self-testing in other contexts, it is reassuring given the importance of large prevalence studies, and the practicalities of doing these at scale using self-testing with lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA).","output":"Behavioural responses to SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in England: REACT-2 study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Persistent coughs are a major symptom of respiratory-related diseases.

Case reports of hospitalized patients suggest that COVID-19 prominently affects the cardiovascular system, but the overall impact remains unknown. Objective: To evaluate the presence of myocardial injury in unselected patients recently recovered from COVID-19 illness. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective observational cohort study, 100 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 illness were identified from the University Hospital Frankfurt COVID-19 Registry between April and June 2020. Exposure: Recent recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on swab test of the upper respiratory tract. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic characteristics, cardiac blood markers, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging were obtained. Comparisons were made with age-matched and sex-matched control groups of healthy volunteers (n = 50) and risk factor-matched patients (n = 57). Results: Of the 100 included patients, 53 (53%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 49 (14) years. The median (IQR) time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and CMR was 71 (64-92) days. Of the 100 patients recently recovered from COVID-19, 67 (67%) recovered at home, while 33 (33%) required hospitalization. At the time of CMR, high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) was detectable (greater than 3 pg/mL) in 71 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 (71%) and significantly elevated (greater than 13.9 pg/mL) in 5 patients (5%). Compared with healthy controls and risk factor-matched controls, patients recently recovered from COVID-19 had lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher left ventricle volumes, and raised native T1 and T2. A total of 78 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 (78%) had abnormal CMR findings, including raised myocardial native T1 (n = 73), raised myocardial native T2 (n = 60), myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (n = 32), or pericardial enhancement (n = 22). There was a small but significant difference between patients who recovered at home vs in the hospital for native T1 mapping (median [IQR], 1119 [1092-1150] ms vs 1141 [1121-1175] ms; P = .008) and hsTnT (4.2 [3.0-5.9] pg/dL vs 6.3 [3.4-7.9] pg/dL; P = .002) but not for native T2 mapping. None of these measures were correlated with time from COVID-19 diagnosis (native T1: r = 0.07; P = .47; native T2: r = 0.14; P = .15; hsTnT: r = -0.07; P = .50). High-sensitivity troponin T was significantly correlated with native T1 mapping (r = 0.33; P < .001) and native T2 mapping (r = 0.18; P = .01). Endomyocardial biopsy in patients with severe findings revealed active lymphocytic inflammation. Native T1 and T2 were the measures with the best discriminatory ability to detect COVID-19-related myocardial pathology. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of a cohort of German patients recently recovered from COVID-19 infection, CMR revealed cardiac involvement in 78 patients (78%) and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%), independent of preexisting conditions, severity and overall course of the acute illness, and time from the original diagnosis.

The World Health Organization (WHO) announced in a press conference on January 29, 2020 that the death rate of COVID-19 was 2% on the case fatality rate (CFR). It was underestimated assuming no lag days from symptom onset to deaths while many CFR formulas have been proposed, the estimation on Bays theorem is worthy of interpretation. Hence, it is hypothesized that the over-loaded burdens of treating patients and capacities to contain the outbreak (LSBHRS) may increase the CFR. METHODS: We downloaded COVID-19 outbreak numbers from January 21 to February 14, 2020, in countries/regions on a daily basis from Github that contains information on confirmed cases in >30 Chinese locations and other countries/regions. The pros and cons were compared among the 5 formula of CFR, including [A] deaths/confirmed; [B] deaths/(deathsa+arecovered); [C] deaths/(cases x days ago); [D] Bayes estimation based on [A] and the outbreak (LSBHRS) in each country/region; and [E] Bayes estimation based on [C] deaths/(cases x days ago). The coefficients of variance (CVa=athe ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) were applied to measure the relative variability for each CFR. A dashboard was developed for daily display of the CFR across each region. RESULTS: The Bayes based on (A)[D] has the lowest CV (=0.10) followed by the deaths/confirmed (=0.11) [A], deaths/(deathsa+arecoveries) (=0.42) [B], Bayes based on (C) (=0.49) [E], and deaths/(cases x days ago) (=0.59) [C]. All final CFRs will be equal using the formula (from, A to E). A dashboard was developed for the daily reporting of the CFR. The CFR (3.7%) greater than the prior CFR of 2.2% was evident in LSBHRS, increasing the CFR. A dashboard was created to present the CFRs on COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We suggest examining both trends of the Bayes based on both deaths/(cases 7 days ago) and deaths/confirmed cases as a reference to the final CFR. An app developed for displaying the provisional CFR with the 2 CFR trends can improve the underestimated CFR reported by WHO and media.","output":"The computation of case fatality rate for novel coronavirus (COVID-19) based on Bayes theorem: An observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O Neospora caninum  um protozorio filogeneticamente relacionado a vrios coccdeos de importancia em medicina veterinria e humana, alm de ser um parasita intracelular obrigatrio capaz de causar abortamentos em bovinos e paralisia neuromuscular em c?es.

The consequence on clinical practice is that, when lacking results from a randomized trial, medical personnel is left without guidance on what seems to be effective in a real-world scenario. This article showcases a pragmatic methodology to obtain preliminary estimation of treatment effect from observational studies. Our approach was tested on the estimation of treatment effect of the proning maneuver on oxygenation levels, on a cohort of COVID-19 Intensive Care patients. We modeled our study design on a recent RCT for proning (the PROSEVA trial). Linear regression, propensity score models such as blocking and DR-IPW, BART and two versions of Counterfactual Regression were employed to provide estimates on observational data comprising first wave COVID-19 ICU patient data from 25 Dutch hospitals. 6371 data points, from 745 mechanically ventilated patients, were included in the study. Estimates for the early effect of proning -- P/F ratio from 2 to 8 hours after proning -- ranged between 14.54 and 20.11 mm Hg depending on the model. Estimates for the late effect of proning -- oxygenation from 12 to 24 hours after proning -- ranged between 13.53 and 15.26 mm Hg. All confidence interval being strictly above zero indicated that the effect of proning on oxygenation for COVID-19 patient was positive and comparable in magnitude to the effect on non COVID-19 patients. These results provide further evidence on the effectiveness of proning on the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This study, along with the accompanying open-source code, provides a blueprint for treatment effect estimation in scenarios where RCT data is lacking.

We study the dependence on the location of the initial seed for the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible epidemic dynamics in continuous time on networks. We first derive analytical predictions for the dependence on the initial node of three indicators of spreading influence (probability to originate an infinite outbreak, average duration and size of finite outbreaks) and compare them with numerical simulations on random uncorrelated networks, finding a very good agreement.

A key principle of the Global Fund is country ownership in accessing funding through engagement of in-country stakeholders, including key and vulnerable populations, communities, and civil society. Research documenting whether diverse stakeholders are actually engaged and on how stakeholder engagement affects processes and outcomes of grant applications is limited. OBJECTIVE: To examine representation during the 2017 Global Fund application process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Uganda and the benefits and drawbacks of partnership to the process. METHODS: We developed a mixed-methods social network survey to measure network structure and assess perceptions of how working together in partnership with other individuals/organizations affected perceived effectiveness, efficiency, and country ownership of the application process. Surveys were administered from December 2017CMay 2018, initially to a set of central actors, followed by any individuals named during the surveys (up to 10) as collaborators. Network analyses were conducted using R. FINDINGS: Collaborators spanning many organizations and expertise areas contributed to the 2017 applications (DRC: 152 nodes, 237 ties; Uganda: 118 nodes, 241 ties). Participation from NGOs and civil society representatives was relatively strong, with most of their ties being to different organization types, Uganda (63%), and DRC (67%), highlighting their collaborative efforts across the network. Overall, the perceived benefits of partnership were high, including very strong ratings for effectiveness in both countries. Perceived drawbacks of partnership were minimal; however, less than half of respondents thought partnership helped reduce transaction costs or financial costs, suggesting an inclusive and participatory process may come with short-term efficiency tradeoffs.

They are clinically validated and thus represent a true alternative to classical immunoglobulin formats. In contrast to immunoglobulins, they are built from solenoid protein domains comprising an N-terminal capping repeat, one or more internal repeats and a C-terminal capping repeat. By using in silico analysis and a rationally guided Ala-Scan, we identified position 17 of the N-terminal capping repeat to play a key role for the overall protein thermostability. The melting temperature of a DARPin domain with a single full-consensus internal repeat was increased by about 8C to 10C when the original Asp17 was replaced by Leu, Val, Ile, Met, Ala or Thr, as shown by high-temperature unfolding experiments at equilibrium. We then transferred the Asp17Leu mutation to various backgrounds, including different N- and C-terminal capping repeats and clinically validated DARPin domains, such as the VEGF-binding ankyrin repeat domain of abicipar pegol. In all cases, the proteins remained monomeric and showed improvements in the thermostability of about 8C to 16C. Thus, the replacement of Asp17 seems to be generically applicable to this drug class. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the Asp17Leu mutation reduces electrostatic repulsion and improves van-der-Waals packing, rendering the DARPin domain less flexible and more stable. Interestingly, such a beneficial Asp17Leu mutation is present in the N-terminal caps of three of the five DARPin domains of ensovibep, a SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor currently in clinical development. This mutation is likely responsible, at least in part, for the very high melting temperature (>90C) of this promising anti-Covid-19 drug.

In particular, two classification systems have been proposed: clinical classification, comprising primary (P-CIS), concomitant (C-CIS), and secondary (S-CIS) disease, and pathological classification, comprising P-CIS, cTa-CIS, and cT1-CIS. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of both classifications on BCG response, recurrence-free survival (RFS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 386 patients with bladder CIS, with or without associated cTa/cT1 disease, treated with BCG instillations between 2008 and 2015. Patients were stratified according to the two classification systems. Cox multivariate regression models were used to assess the impact of these subtypes on BCG response, RFS, PFS, OS, and CSS. We also performed a cumulative meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 70.5 months. According to the clinical classification, 34 (8.8%) patients had P-CIS, 81 (21%) S-CIS, and 271 (70.2%) C-CIS. The pathological classification showed 34 (8.8%) patients to have P-CIS, 190 (49.2%) cTa-CIS, and 162 (42%) cT1-CIS. In the overall cohort, BCG response was reported in 296 (76.7%); 159 (41.2%) had recurrence, 55 (14.2%) had progression, and 67 (17.4%) underwent radical cystectomy. Death from any cause was recorded in 135 (35%) and death from urothelial carcinoma in 38 (9.9%). Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that neither clinical classification nor pathological classification is an independent predictive factor for BCG response, RFS, PFS, OS, or CSS after adjusting for confounders. In the pooled meta-analysis, two studies and the present series were included for evidence synthesis, recruiting a total of 941 patients. We found no statistically significant difference across the groups for both classifications with respect to BCG response, RFS, PFS, and CSS.

RESULTS: Among 200 patients with available data, urine protein-creatinine ratio at admission was &#8805;1 g/g for 84 (42%), although kidney function was normal in most patients, with a median serum creatinine of 0.94 mg/dl (interquartile range, 0.75-1.21). Median urine albumin-creatinine ratio was 110 mg/g (interquartile range, 50-410), with a urine albumin-protein ratio <50% in 92% of patients. Urine retinol binding protein concentrations, available for 85 patients, were &#8805;0.03 mg/mmol in 62% of patients. Urine protein-creatinine ratio &#8805;1 g/g was associated with initiation of dialysis (odds ratio, 4.87; 95% confidence interval, 2.03 to 13.0; P<0.001), admission to the intensive care unit (odds ratio, 3.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.93 to 6.71; P<0.001), and death (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.90 to 6.54; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Proteinuria is very frequent among patients admitted for COVID-19 and may precede AKI. Low levels of albuminuria suggest a predominant tubular origin, confirmed by the elevated levels of urine retinol binding protein. Urine protein-creatinine ratio &#8805;1 g/g at admission is strongly associated with poor kidney and patient outcome.","output":"Proteinuria and Clinical Outcomes in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Single-Center Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter illustrates many different scenarios of emergencies in pediatric ENT in question and answer format.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the prevalence of known risk factors associated with mortality due to COVID-19 for persons who have had a non-fatal overdose during 2015-2017 in comparison to persons who have not had an overdose. METHODS: Data were extracted from the BC Provincial Overdose Cohort which includes a 20 % random sample of BC residents and persons who have had a non-fatal overdose in BC from January 2015 to December 2017. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare risk factors by overdose history. RESULTS: Persons who had a non-fatal overdose were significantly more likely to have three (chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease) of the four known chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19 compared to persons who did not have a previous non-fatal overdose event. CONCLUSION: Persons who had an overdose were more likely to have several chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19. The increased likelihood of having these risk factors is reflective of the social and health inequities experienced by persons who have a history of overdose.","output":"Overdose and risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) merupakan penyakit menular yang disebabkan oleh Coronavirus versi baru yang ditemukan pada akhir 2019 lalu.

We performed a meta-analysis to understand the survival and associated complications in pediatric cancer patients as well as their hospitalization, intensive care, and ventilation care (supplemental oxygen/endotracheal intubation) needs. METHODS: A systematic search was performed using MEDLINE, TRIP Database, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO), The Cochrane Library, Wiley, LILACS, and Google Scholar. Additionally, a search using the snowball method was performed in Nature, New England Journal of Medicine, Science, JAMA, ELSEVIER editorial, Oxford University Press, The Lancet, and MedRxiv. Searches were conducted until July 18, 2020. A total of 191 cancer patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were integrated from 15 eligible studies. In a sub-analysis, patients were stratified into two groups: hematological cancer and solid tumors. Outcome measures were overall survival, risk of hospitalized or needing intensive care, and need for ventilatory support in any modality. The random effects statistical analysis was performed with Cochrans chi square test. The odds ratio (OR) and heterogeneity were calculated using the I(2) test. RESULTS: The overall survival was 99.4%. There were no statistically significant differences in the risk of hospitalization between hematological malignancies and solid tumors (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48C18.3; OR = 2.94). The risk of being admitted to the intensive care unit was also not different between hematological malignancies and other tumors (95% CI 0.35C5.81; OR = 1.42). No differences were found for the need of ventilatory support (95% CI 0.14C3.35; OR = 0.68). Although all the studies were cross-sectional, the mortality of these patients was 0.6% at the time of analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In the analyzed literature, survival in the studied group of patients with COVID-19 was very high.

At present, the law of COVID-19 spread in cities is not clear. Cities have long been difficult areas for epidemic prevention and control because of the high population density, high mobility of people, and high frequency of contacts. This paper analyzed case information for 417 patients with COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China. The nearest neighbor index method, kernel density method, and the standard deviation ellipse method were used to analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics of the COVID-19 spread in Shenzhen. The factors influencing that spread were then explored using the multiple linear regression method. The results show that: (1) The development of COVID-19 epidemic situation in Shenzhen occurred in three stages. The patients showed significant hysteresis from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization and then to diagnosis. Prior to 27 January, there was a relatively long time interval between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization for COVID-19; the interval decreased thereafter. (2) The epidemic site (the place where the patient stays during the onset of the disease) showed an agglomeration in space. The degree of agglomeration constantly increased across the three time nodes of 31 January, 14 February, and 22 February. The epidemic sites formed a \\"core area\\" in terms of spatial distribution and spread along the \\"northwest-southeast\\" direction of the city.

METHOD A study sample of around 870 miles of rural two-lane roadways with extensive crash, traffic and roadway information was used in this investigation. To understand the effect of low traffic exposure in estimating the EB expected number of crashes, the contributions of both the observed and the HSM predicted number of crashes were analyzed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The study found that, on low-volume roads, the predicted number of crashes is the major contributor in estimating the EB expected number of crashes. The study also found a large discrepancy between the observed and the predicted number of crashes using the HSM procedures calibrated for the state of Oregon, which could partly be attributed to the unique attributes of low-volume roads that are different from the rest of the network. However, the expected number of crashes for the study sample using the HSM EB method was reasonably close to the observed number of crashes over the 10-year study period. Practical Applications: Based on the findings, it can still be very effective to use network screening methods that rely primarily on risk factors for low-volume road networks. This is especially applicable in situations where accurate and reliable crash data are not available.","output":"Empirical Bayes application on low-volume roads: Oregon case study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The boiling of beer wort with hops results in the formation of a hot trub, a sediment consisting mainly of water-insoluble tannin and protein conglomerates and hop residue.

In presented study, an analysis of the rheological properties of industrial hot trub was carried out. Samples varied with regard to the quantities of unmalted barley (0%, 35%, and 45%) and worts extract (12.5, 14.1, 16.1, and 18.2 Plato) in the recipe. The rheology of each type of sludge was determined using a hysteresis loop at four different temperatures. The results showed the shear-thinning and thixotropic properties of the hot trub. It was found that, regardless of the raw material and extract used, all samples exhibited the same rheological properties, but with different values. It was also proved that both raw material composition and temperature affected the hot trubs rheology.

However, it is unknown whether genetic predisposition to VTE is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis following vaccination. METHODSUsing data from the UK Biobank, which contains in-depth genotyping data and linked vaccination and health outcomes information, we generated a polygenic risk score (PRS) using 299 genetic variants identified from a previous large genome-wide association study. We prospectively assessed associations between PRS and incident VTE after first and the second-dose vaccination separately. We conducted sensitivity analyses stratified by vaccine type (adenovirus- and mRNA-based) and using two historical unvaccinated cohorts. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) for PRS-VTE associations using Cox models. RESULTSOf 359,310 individuals receiving one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, 160,327 (44.6%) were males, and the mean age at the vaccination date was 69.05 (standard deviation [SD] 8.04) years. After 28- and 90-days follow-up, 88 and 299 individuals developed VTE respectively, equivalent to an incidence rate of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70 to 1.08) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.04) per 100,000 person-days. The PRS was significantly associated with a higher risk of VTE (HR per 1 SD increase in PRS, 1.41 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.73) in 28 days and 1.36 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.52) in 90 days). Similar associations were found after stratification by vaccine type, in the two-dose cohort and across the historical unvaccinated cohorts. CONCLUSIONSThe genetic determinants of post-Covid-19-vaccination VTE are similar to those seen in historical data. This suggests that, at the population level, post-vaccine VTE has similar aetiology to conventional VTE. Additionally, the observed PRS-VTE associations were equivalent for adenovirus- and mRNA-based vaccines.","output":"Genetic risk and incident venous thromboembolism in middle-aged and older adults following 1 Covid-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A method to amplify long genomic regions (up to 12.3 kb) from pestiviruses in one RT-PCR is described. The difficulty in designing conserved Pestivirus primers for the amplification of genomes from highly divergent isolates simply by means of overlapping segments is demonstrated using new bioinformatic tools. An alternative procedure consisting of optimizing the length of the genomic cDNA fragments and their subsequent amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a limited set of specific primers is described. The amplification of long DNA fragments from a variety of sources, including genomic, mitochondrial, and viral DNAs as well as cDNA produced by reverse transcription (RT) has been achieved using this methodology, known as long distance PCR. In the case of viruses, it is necessary to obtain viral particles from infected cells prior to RT procedures. This work provides improvements in four steps of long distance RT-PCR (L-RT-PCR): (i) preparation of a viral stock, (ii) preparation of template RNA, (iii) reverse transcription and (iv) amplification of the cDNA by LD-PCR.

Over the past decade, we have made important advances in understanding the development of SITBs and effective interventions. However, there are still major gaps of knowledge in our understanding of how to prevent suicide. Researchers have recently called for more studies focusing particularly on the pathway from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior. However, we caution against prioritizing only a part of the suicide risk continuum (e.g., the transition from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior) while minimizing research focusing on earlier developmental points of the pathway to suicide (e.g., the first development of suicidal ideation). We emphasize that childhood and adolescence represent a critical opportunity to intervene and prevent SITBs by altering developmental trajectories toward persistent and escalating SITBs over time. We advocate for integrating a developmental psychopathology perspective into future youth suicide research that focuses on how and when risk for SITBs first emerges and develops across childhood into emerging adulthood. This research is critical for informing interventions aimed at bending developmental pathways away from all SITBs. Here, we describe the need for future research that integrates key developmental psychopathology principles on 1) the identification of the continuum from developmentally typical to atypical as SITBs first emerge and develop, particularly among young children in early to middle childhood, 2) the way in which expressions of and risk for SITBs change across development, 3) how SITBs dynamically move along a continuum from typical to atypical over time, and 4) suicide prevention efforts.

The last few years have brought many clinically significant new data on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and management of SAT. Several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles were demonstrated not only to increase the risk of SAT, but also to correlate with SAT clinical course and determine the risk of recurrence. The world-wide epidemic of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has provided new observations that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be a potent SAT-triggering factor, and that the clinical course of SAT in patients affected by COVID-19 is different from a typical one.

Since social media data come from users' minds, worthy candidates for this challenge are cognitive networks, models of cognition giving structure to mental conceptual associations. This work outlines how cognitive network science can open new, quantitative ways for understanding cognition through online media like: (i) reconstructing how users semantically and emotionally frame events with contextual knowledge unavailable to machine learning, (ii) investigating conceptual salience/prominence through knowledge structure in social discourse; (iii) studying users' personality traits like openness-to-experience, curiosity, and creativity through language in posts; (iv) bridging cognitive/emotional content and social dynamics via multilayer networks comparing the mindsets of influencers and followers. These advancements combine cognitive-, network- and computer science to understand cognitive mechanisms in both digital and real-world settings but come with limitations concerning representativeness, individual variability, and data integration.

In this study, 3,454 students (aged 15C25 years) were surveyed to understand students' perceived social support-coping modes while investigating the demographic characteristics and mental health status of subclasses of different modes. We found that (1) in the two subgroups of students with extremely low and low levels of perceived social support, the source of students' perceived social support did not have a clear orientation; in the two subgroups with moderate and high levels of perceived social support, the most perceived emotional support was from family and friends, while the least perceived support was companionship from teachers, classmates, and relatives, and problems related to the dependability of friends and communication with family. (2) The degree of social support perceived by students is directly proportional to the coping tendency, i.e., as the degree of perceived social support increases, the proportion of students adopting active coping strategies increases while that of students adopting negative coping strategies decreases; thus, we concluded that high levels of emotional support from family and friends can increase students' tendency of adopting positive strategies to cope with difficulties, while problems related to the dependability of friends and communication with family decrease students' tendency of adopting positive coping strategies. (3) Gender had a significant impact on the extremely low and low levels of perceived social support-negative coping tendencies; these subgroups accounted for 34.6% of the total students.

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 13 adult long COVID patients who complained for at least one persistent symptom for >30 days after infection recovery. A group of 26 melanoma patients with negative PET/CT matched for sex/age was used as controls (2:1 control to case ratio). Qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of whole-body images was performed. Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney tests were applied to test differences between the two groups. Voxel-based analysis was performed to compare brain metabolism in cases and controls. Cases were further grouped according to prevalent symptoms and analysed accordingly. RESULTS: In 4/13 long COVID patients, CT images showed lung abnormalities presenting mild [18F]FDG uptake. Many healthy organs/parenchyma SUVs and SUV ratios significantly differed between the two groups (p &#8804; 0.05). Long COVID patients exhibited brain hypometabolism in the right parahippocampal gyrus and thalamus (uncorrected p < 0.001 at voxel level). Specific area(s) of hypometabolism characterised patients with persistent anosmia/ageusia, fatigue, and vascular uptake (uncorrected p < 0.005 at voxel level). CONCLUSION: [18F]FDG PET/CT acknowledged the multi-organ nature of long COVID, supporting the hypothesis of underlying systemic inflammation.

A report from Johns Hopkins University revealed that many millions of people have been infected and millions of them lost their lives due to the virus. PURPOSE: To assess the implementation of COVID-19 prevention mechanisms and to describe the impact of COVID-19 on people's mental health in Asella town. METHODS: Descriptive survey research design was used. Two hundred and eleven randomly selected participants involved for the study. Data gathered by using PHQ-9 depressive symptom and STAI-s anxiety scales. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent sample t-test and one-way ANOVA with post hoc comparison. RESULTS: The finding revealed that 14 and 5.2% of the participants reported sometimes and occasionally wearing a mask regardless of the presence or absence of symptom. About 6.2% and 10.9% of the participants reported occasionally and never for the item avoidance of sharing utensils during meals. Half (49.3%) and 37% of the participants reported somewhat worried and very worried, respectively for concern about other family members getting COVID-19 infection. About 8.5% (M=22.64, SD=1.93) and 10 (4.7%, M=16, SD=1.42) of the participants qualify in the criteria of severe depressive symptoms and moderate-severe depressive symptoms, respectively. Conversely, 11.84% (M=52.76, SD=3.9) qualify in the criterion for severe anxiety. The independent sample t-test result revealed that there was statistically significant difference among males and females for anxiety mean score. However, there was no statistically significant difference among males and females for depressive symptom mean score. Regarding mental health across different age categories, the ANOVA with post hoc analysis revealed that there was statistically significant difference for state anxiety mean score among younger and older participants but not for depressive symptom mean score. CONCLUSION: Generally, there is gap in the prevention of COVID-19. In addition, there is an elevated level of depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak of COVID-19 that needs urgent psychological intervention.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Epidemic on Mental Health Among Residents of Assela Town"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With recent advances in sequencing technology it has become affordable and practical to sequence genomes to very high depth-of-coverage, allowing researchers to discover low-frequency variants in the genome.

This is manifested, in particular, by interferons' (IFNs) deficiency at the beginning of the disease followed by hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The virus causes a decrease in IFN types I (/?) and III () levels; changes in IFN type II (?3) are less studied. In this regard, it is relevant to assess the functional bioactive IFN (interferon status) in COVID-19. The aim of the study was to assess the antiviral potential of the body by testing the biologically active IFNs in COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used biological serum samples of COVID-19 patients taken in the acute phase (110 patients on the 1-5 days of the disease) and during rehabilitation (47 patients during 1-3 months after the disease onset). Assessment of interferon status was performed according to the technique developed by the authors and described earlier. RESULTS: The IFN status of patients with COVID-19 in the acute period and in the phase of post-infection rehabilitation was studied D2during the observation period. It was found that SARS-CoV-2 causes a pronounced inhibition of biological activity of IFN types I and II compared to the reference values by more than 20 and 7 times, respectively. During the post-COVID period, incomplete recovery of the IFN system activity was registered, which proceeded very slowly. No cases of reaching physiological indicators of interferon status were identified during the observation period. CONCLUSION: The obtained data on deficiency of the functional biologically active IFN confirm the hypothesis about the predominant role of impaired IFN production of different types in the immunopathogenesis of the novel coronavirus infection.","output":"[Biological activity of interferons in the novel coronavirus infection COVID-19]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On Dec 30, 2019, Li Wenliang sent a message to a group of fellow doctors warning them about a possible outbreak of an illness that resembled severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, where he worked Li returned to work after signing the statement and contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), apparently from a patient In the wake of Li's death, the Wuhan municipal government issued a statement offering condolences to Li's family as did the National Health Commission [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Lancet is the property of Lancet and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Li Wenliang"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tremendous progress in the identification, isolation and expansion of stem cells has allowed their application in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, and their use as advanced in vitro models.

However, solid substrates currently used for the culture of adherent cells are poorly adapted for such applications, owing to their difficult processing from cell products, relatively high costs and their typical reliance on difficult to recycle plastics and microplastics. In this work, we show that bioemulsions formed of microdroplets stabilised by protein nanosheets displaying strong interfacial mechanics are well-suited for the scale up of adherent stem cells such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). We demonstrate that, over multiple passages (up to passage 10), MSCs retain comparable phenotypes when cultured on such bioemulsions, solid microcarriers (Synthemax II) and classic 2D tissue culture polystyrene. Phenotyping (cell proliferation, morphometry, flow cytometry and differentiation assays) of MSCs cultured for multiple passages on these systems indicate that, although stemness is lost at late passages when cultured on these different substrates, stem cell phenotypes remained comparable between different culture conditions, at any given passage. Hence our study validates the use of bioemulsions for the long term expansion of adherent stem cells and paves the way to the design of novel 3D bioreactors based on microdroplet microcarriers.","output":"Long term expansion profile of mesenchymal stromal cells at protein nanosheet-stabilised bioemulsions for next generation cell culture microcarriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) remain a widespread public health concern causing severe implications in both developed and developing countries.

SARS-CoV-2 infection is produced by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme, which among other sites is highly expressed in the endothelial cells of the blood vessels, pericytes and the heart, as well as in renal podocytes and proximal tubular epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are interconnected by risk factors association with an increased incidence of the disease and by determining de novo cardiac complications. At the same time, COVID-19 disease can lead to acute kidney injury directly, or due to sepsis, multi-organ failure and shock. Therefore, the pre-existence of both CVD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is linked with a higher risk of severe disease and worse prognosis. Methods: The main aim of this study is to assess the CV risk in a CKD (stage 3 to 5), dialysis and kidney transplanted population, following SARS-CoV-2 infection, with focus on the endothelial dysfunction as compared to a control group of matched patients. By using clinical evaluation, flow-mediated dilatation, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, intima-media thickness, echocardiographic parameters, lung ultrasound, bioimpedance spectroscopy and a series of novel biomarkers, the investigators will determine the long-term impact of this disease on CV and renal outcomes.

The nation's transportation infrastructure was built at the expense of Black communities and has contributed to and sustained the underdevelopment of Black America, often making it difficult for Black people to take advantage of society's opportunities.11 The benefits and burdens of our transportation system-highways, roads, bridges, sidewalks, and public transit-have been planned, developed, and sustained to pull resources from Black communities that are subsequently deployed and invested to the benefit of predominantly white communities and their residents.12 We continue to see the effects of underdevelopment. Part II briefly explains and explores Manning Marable's theory of underdevelopment.19 Part III applies Marable's theory to transportation policy in the United States, connecting his theory of underdevelopment to a history of transportation policies that destroyed, isolated, and segregated Black communities, leading to the underdevelopment of those communities and their residents.20 Part IV proposes a way forward.21 Despite the wide-ranging impact that transportation decisions have on civil rights and racial equity concerns, transportation policy has not been widely embraced as a pressing civil rights concern.22 Finally, Part V concludes.23 This Essay argues that moving forward, advocates must harness the power of civil rights laws to dismantle systems and structures of racial inequality and the discrimination at the intersection of race, class, and place.24 To do so, advocates must re-envision these laws as tools for community equity.25 II.

However, it has become increasingly clear that PKR is involved in multiple pathways that promote inflammation in response to stress activation, both dependent on and independent of its cellular protein activator PACT. In this review, we discuss the signaling pathways that contribute to the initiation of inflammation, including Toll-like receptor, interferon, and RIG-I-like receptor signaling, as well as inflammasome activation.

Revealing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and control efficiency is important for containing the spread of the virus. METHODS: By using a logistic growth model, we estimated the transmission parameters of COVID-19 in China and six other countries (Republic of Korea, Iran, Italy, Spain, France and Germany). The transmission parameters represent the maximum daily increase rate in the early stages of the epidemic and the control efficiency under human intervention. The control efficiency was determined by the significant decrease of the daily increase rate in time and cumulative cases. RESULTS: We found the daily increase rate of cumulative cases of COVID-19 decreased significantly in both time and cumulative cases in all countries, but the decreasing trend was not further reduced in other countries except for China and Republic of Korea.

There is increasing evidence to suggest Vitamin D deficiency may increase individuals risk of COVID-19 infection and susceptibility. We aimed to determine the relationship between severity of vitamin D deficiency and sufficiency and COVID-19 infection within healthcare workers. MethodsThe study included an observational cohort of healthcare workers who isolated due to COVID-19 symptoms from 12th to 22nd May 2020, from the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT). This was part of the COVID-19 convalescent immunity study (COCO). Data collected included SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion status, serum 25(OH)D3 levels as well as age, body mass index (BMI), sex, ethnicity, job role, and co-morbidities. Participants were grouped into four vitamin D (VD) categories. 1) Severe VD deficiency (VD <30 nmol/L); 2) VD deficiency (30 nmol/L [] VD <50 nmol/L); 3) VD insufficiency (50 nmol/L [] VD <75 nmol/L); 4) VD sufficiency (VD []75 nmol/L). ResultsWhen VD levels were compared against COVID-19 seropositivity rate, a U-shaped curve was identified in the total population. This trend repeated when split into subgroups of age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, and co-morbidity status. Significant difference was identified in the COVID-19 seropositivity rate between VD groups between multiple VD groups in the total population, males, females, BAME, BMI<30 (kg/m2), 0 and +1 comorbidities; the majority of which were differences when the severely VD deficient category were compared to the other group. A significantly larger proportion of those within the Black, Asian, minority ethnic (BAME) group (vs. white ethnicity) were severely vitamin D deficient (P <0.00001). A significantly higher proportion of the 0-comorbidity subgroup were vitamin D deficient in comparison to the 1+ comorbidity subgroup (P = 0.046). ConclusionsFurther investigation of the U-shaped curves is required to determine whether high VD levels can have a detrimental effect on susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. Future randomised clinical trials of VD supplementation could potentially identify optimal VD levels. This would allow for targeted therapeutic treatment for those at-risk such as in the BAME group.","output":"Vitamin D Status: A U-shaped relationship for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in UK healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 first emerged in the human population in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and in a matter of months, spread across the globe resulting in the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic and substantial economic fallout.

RESULTS: 716 doctors responded effectively with a response rate of 60.1%, and 664 were included in the final analysis. Overall, 51.4% (341/664) of clinicians reported more than a 60% reduction of the regular workload and surgeons declared the highest proportion of workload reduction. 92.5% (614/664) of the respondents have been using online medical consultation to substitute for the face-to-face visits. Adaptive adjustment for the treatment strategy for HCC was made, including the recommendations of noninvasive and minimally invasive treatments such as transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for early and intermediate stage. Targeted therapy has been the mainstay for advanced stage and also as a bridge therapy for resectable HCC.

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the clonality and ancestral sources of Australian SARS-CoV-2 isolates using phylogenetic methods. Methods: We retrieved 1,346 complete genomes from Australia along with 153 genomes from other countries from the GISAID and NCBI nucleotide databases as of the 14th May 2020. A representative dataset of 270 Australian and international sequences were resulted from performance of nucleotide redundancy reduction by CD-HIT. We then constructed a median-joining network by Network 10.1.0.0, and phylogenies by IQ-Tree, BEAST and FastTree. The Bayesian statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis (S-DIVA) and Bayesian interference for discrete areas (BayArea) built in RASP were used to reconstruct ancestral ranges over the phylogenetic trees. Results: Two major clusters, from Europe and from Asia, were observed on the network of 183 haplotypes with distinct nucleotide variations. Analysis of ancestral area reconstruction over the phylogenies indicated most Australian SARS-CoV-2 sequences were disseminated from Europe and East Asia-Southeast Asia.

VitaminC, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous. The potential effect of vitaminC in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection. Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies. Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves.

The efficiency of these novel devices in detecting different biomolecular analytes in a real-time, highly precise, specific, and label-free manner has been validated by numerous research studies. Considerable progress has been attained in designing FET devices, especially for biomedical diagnosis and cell-based assays in the past few decades. The exceptional electronic properties, compactness, and scalability of these novel tools are very desirable for designing rapid, label-free, and mass detection of biomolecules. With the incorporation of nanotechnology, the performance of biosensors based on FET boosts significantly, particularly, employment of nanomaterials such as graphene, metal nanoparticles, single and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, nanorods, and nanowires.

We investigate these questions proposing an augmented epidemiological model with an age-structured model, with the population divided into susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected and asymptomatic (A), hospitalized (H), infected and symptomatic (I), and recovered individuals (R), to simulate COVID-19 dissemination. The simulations were carried out using six combinations of four types of isolation policies (work restrictions, isolation of the elderly, community distancing and school closures) and four representative fictitious countries generated over alternative demographic transition stage patterns (aged developed, developed, developing and least developed countries). We concluded that the basic reproduction number depends on the age profile and the contact patterns. The aged developed country had the lowest basic reproduction number ($R0=1.74$) due to the low contact rate among individuals, followed by the least developed country ($R0=2.00$), the developing country ($R0=2.43$) and the developed country ($R0=2.64$). Because of these differences in the basic reproduction numbers, the same intervention policies had higher efficiencies in the aged and least developed countries. Of all intervention policies, the reduction in work contacts and community distancing were the ones which produced the highest decrease in the $R0$ value, prevalence, maximum hospitalization demand and fatality rate. The isolation of the elderly was more effective in the developed and aged developed countries.

Moreover, empirical investigations demonstrated that traditional text clustering methods produce unsatisfactory results in terms of non-contextualized vector space representations because that neglect the semantic relationship between biomedical texts. Recently, pre-trained language models have emerged as successful in a wide range of natural language processing applications. In this paper, we propose the Gaussian Mixture Model-based efficient clustering framework that incorporates substantially pre-trained (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining) BioBERT domain-specific language representations to enhance the clustering accuracy.

Together, our findings suggest that wearing facemasks with a cultural symbol that relates to solidarity can be a vehicle for shaping people's personality impressions of others. Applied directions for the activation of people's social identities via facemask selection to promote collective resilience in the Covid-19 pandemic are discussed.","output":"Can culture beat Covid-19?

A total of 26,831 ORF5 PRRSV-2 sequences from 34 production systems were included in this analysis. Within group mean genetic distance (i.e. mean proportion of nucleotide differences within ORF5) per year according to herd type was calculated for all PRRSV-2 sequences. The percent nucleotide difference between each sequence and the ORF5 sequences from four commercially available PRRSV-2 vaccines (Ingelvac PRRS MLV, Ingelvac PRRS ATP, Fostera PRRS, and Prevacent PRRS) within the same lineage over time was used to classify sequences in wild-type or vaccine-like. The mean ORF5 genetic distance fluctuated from 0.09 to 0.13, being generally smaller in years in which there was a relative higher frequency of dominant lineage. Vaccine-like sequences comprised about one fourth of sequences obtained through routine monitoring of PRRS. We found that lineage 5 sequences were mostly Ingelvac PRRS MLV-like. Lineage 8 sequences up to 2011 were 62.9% Ingelvac PRRS ATP-like while the remaining were wild-type viruses. From 2012 onwards, 51.9% of lineage 8 sequences were Ingelvac PRRS ATP-like, 45.0% were Fostera PRRS-like, and only 3.2% were wild-type. For lineage 1 sequences, 0.1% and 1.7% of the sequences were Prevacent PRRS-like in 2009C2018 and 2019, respectively. These results suggest that repeated introductions of vaccine-like viruses through use of modified live vaccines might decrease within-lineage viral diversity as vaccine-like strains become more prevalent.

We demonstrate that we can robustly detect mutations at 0.1% fractional representation. This represents accurate detection of one mutant per every 1000 wild-type alleles. To achieve this sensitive level of mutation detection, we integrate a high accuracy indexing strategy and reference replication for estimating sequencing error variance. We employ a statistical model to estimate the error rate at each position of the reference and to quantify the fraction of variant base in the sample. Our method is highly specific (99%) and sensitive (100%) when applied to a known 0.1% sample fraction admixture of two synthetic DNA samples to validate our method.

Here, we characterize the impact of the pandemic on social and health behaviors of rural and urban cancer patients. Methods: N=1,326 adult cancer patients, who visited HCI in the last 4 years and enrolled in either Total Cancer Care or Precision Exercise Prescription studies, completed a COVID-19 survey. The survey was administered between Aug and Sept 2020 and included questions on demographic and clinical information as well as employment status, health behaviors, and COVID-19 prevention measures. Results: The mean age was 61 (19-92) years, with 54% female, 97% non-Hispanic White, 80% stage I-III, 42% employed full or part-time, 25% living in rural counties, and 85% reporting good to excellent overall health. Cancer patients in rural compared to urban counties were more likely to be older (rural=63 vs. urban=60 years;p=0.01), retired or not employed (rural=63% vs. urban=56%;p=0.04), not have health insurance coverage (rural=4% vs. urban=2%;p=0.01), and have ever smoked (rural=35% vs. urban=24%;p=0.001). However, urban patients reported somewhat to a lot of change in their daily lives more frequently than rural patients (urban=86% vs. rural=77%;p<0.001), but there were no differences in change in social interaction or feeling lonely between populations. Changes in health behaviors namely exercise habits due to the pandemic were more common in patients residing in urban vs. rural counties (urban=51% vs. rural=39%;p<0.001), with more urban patients either exercising less (urban=23% vs. rural=17%) or more frequently (urban=12% vs. rural=8%);however, there were no significant differences with respect to changes in alcohol consumption between these groups. In terms of prevention measures, urban patients compared to rural patients were more likely to use face masks fairly or very often (urban=94% vs. rural=83%;p<0.001) and also felt they were more likely to contract a COVID-19 infection (22% vs. 14%;p=0.003), but there were no differences for other risk mitigation behaviors, such as hand sanitizer use. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic had disparate effects on cancer patients living in rural and urban counties. Rural patients were more likely to have risk factors associated with poor health outcomes, such as not having health insurance coverage and having a history of smoking. However, urban patients were more likely to experience larger changes in their daily lives and exercise habits. Urban patients were more likely to follow preventive measures (e.g., wearing face masks) and felt they were at a greater risk of contracting the virus.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the PubMed database for all single-patient case reports of confirmed COVID-19 published from Jan. 1 to Apr. 24, 2020. All included case reports were assessed for adherence to the CARE (Case Report) 31-item checklist, which was used to create a composite COR score. The primary outcome was the mean COR score assessed by 2 independent raters. Secondary outcomes included whether there was a change in overall COR score with certain publication factors (e.g., publication date) and whether there was a linear relation between COR and citation count and between COR scores and social media attention. RESULTS: Our search identified 196 studies that were published in 114 unique journals. We found that the overall mean COR score was 54.4%. No one case report included all of the 31 CARE checklist items. There was no significant correlation between COR with either citation count or social media attention.

One year later, the direct and indirect burden of the COVID-19 pandemic become more visible. In this context, there is concern about the allocation of medical resources and medical treatment of other diseases than COVID-19. Particularly, patients with chronic diseases need constant medical and pharmacological treatment. Therefore, we evaluated a large cohort of patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) regarding postponed medical appointments and their possibilities to receive medical treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 559 patients with ACHD (mean age 37.32  11.98; 47% female). Clinical characteristics, answers to questionnaires concerning lifestyle, psychological well-being, addictive behavior and adherence were related to postponed medical appointments and limited access to medical care. RESULTS: One hundred and nine patients (19.5%) reported problems getting necessary medical treatment or visiting a physician. Higher anxiety levels (p = 0.004) emerged as the main factor associated with medical undertreatment. The main risk factors for postponement of least one medical appointment (n = 91) were higher depression (p = 0.013) and anxiety (p = 0.05) symptoms as well as female sex (p  0.0001) and documented arrhythmias (p = 0.007) indicating a particular risk group of cardiovascular complications. In contrast, frequent physical activity identified patients at lower risk. CONCLUSION: In ACHD anxiety and depressive symptoms handicap patients to receive medical care. Postponement of medical appointments additionally relates to female sex and documented arrhythmias. The latter indicates that patients at high risk of adverse cardiac outcome avoid routine medical care. Our data may lead policy makers to develop strategies for the provision of medical services to particular vulnerable patient groups, and to optimize management of both future pandemics and daily routine.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Medical Supply in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus global pandemic has spread faster and more severely than experts had anticipated.

Introduction Better understanding the psychological consequences of an injury and its influence on behavior changes and the implementation of a prevention program seems relevant for injury management (treatment and prevention). Thus, the objective of this present study was (1) to analyze the perception of injury by athletes, and (2) to analyze their influence on the realization of injury prevention measures. Methods We conducted a national retrospective quantitative observational study to collect the feelings of competitive athletes licensed to the French Athletics Federation with respect to their injury history, their perception of the injury and the injury prevention programs, through a computer survey sent to athletes in spring 2020. Results In all, 7712 responses from athletes were included in this analysis, including 37% women and 63% men, aged 37.914.8 years (18 to 87 years), ranging from international to departmental level, covering all disciplines of athletics. Seventy percent of athletes had never completed an injury prevention program in their career, while 30% felt they had partially or fully completed one. Ninety percent of the athletes had had at least one injury since starting athletics. Athletes reported that an injury created sadness, frustration, disgust, and a worry about getting hurt in one place. They were aware that poor management of an injury could lead to a recurrence or a new injury. Athletes with a history of injury performed significantly more injury prevention program than those with no injury history. Athletes with previous injury believed in the effectiveness of injury prevention programs more than those without. On the other hand, there was no difference in the perception of the interest of preventive measures such as a healthy lifestyle, listening to your body, pain and fatigue between athletes with and without a history of injuries. Conclusion We have reported that an injury can have significant psychological consequences on the athlete. These repercussions are important to consider in the overall management of injuries, e.g. in the treatment, return to the field and prevention of injuries.","output":"tude sur la perception des blessures par les athltes et leurs influences sur la ralisation de mesures de prvention des blessures en athltisme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Most rapidly evolving gene families are involved in immune responses and reproduction, two biological functions which have been assigned to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family. To gain insights into evolutionary forces shaping the CEA gene family we have analysed this gene family in 27 mammalian species including monotreme and marsupial lineages. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis provided convincing evidence that the primordial CEA gene family in mammals consisted of five genes, including the immune inhibitory receptor-encoding CEACAM1 (CEA-related cell adhesion molecule) ancestor. Our analysis of the substitution rates within the nucleotide sequence which codes for the ligand binding domain of CEACAM1 indicates that the selection for diversification is, perhaps, a consequence of the exploitation of CEACAM1 by a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens as their cellular receptor. Depending on the extent of the amplification of an ancestral CEACAM1, the number of CEACAM1-related genes varies considerably between mammalian species from less than five in lagomorphs to more than 100 in bats. In most analysed species, ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) or ITAM-like motif-containing proteins exist which contain Ig-V-like, ligand binding domains closely related to that of CEACAM1. Human CEACAM3 is one such protein which can function as a CEACAM1 decoy receptor in granulocytes by mediating the uptake and destruction of specific bacterial pathogens via its ITAM-like motif. The close relationship between CEACAM1 and its ITAM-encoding relatives appears to be maintained by gene conversion and reciprocal recombination. Surprisingly, secreted CEACAMs resembling immunomodulatory CEACAM1-related trophoblast-specific pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) found in humans and rodents evolved only in a limited set of mammals. The appearance of PSG-like genes correlates with invasive trophoblast growth in these species. CONCLUSIONS: These phylogenetic studies provide evidence that pathogen/host coevolution and a possible participation in fetal-maternal conflict processes led to a highly species-specific diversity of mammalian CEA gene families.","output":"Coevolution of activating and inhibitory receptors within mammalian carcinoembryonic antigen families"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stress index is a useful indicator in mechanical ventilation to assess improper ventilation settings.

BACKGROUND: The pandemic of COVID\\\\19 has significantly depleted health care resources, leading to increased burden of nursing care and staffing and exacerbating the crisis in health care facilities. Currently, how to effectively plan and schedule nursing staffing in the pandemic still remains unknown. METHODS: From 14 July 2020 to 8 September 2020, 62 nursing directors of designated hospitals in mainland China were invited to participate in a cross\\\\sectional online survey for their perceptions of nursing human\\\\resource allocation during the pandemic of COVID\\\\19. RESULTS: A total of 55 valid questionnaires were collected, showing that 96.36% of the hospitals had emergency nursing organizations and management systems during the pandemic, 96.36% had well\\\\established scheduling principles for nursing human resources and 54.55% of hospitals had human\\\\resource scheduling platforms. All the hospitals had trained emergency nursing staff in infection control (55, 100%), work process (51, 92.73%) and emergency skills (50, 90.91%). Most of the participants were satisfied with the nursing staffing deployments at their institutions (52, 94.55%). However, more than two thirds of them believed that their human\\\\resource deployment plans need further improvements (39, 70.91%). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the designated hospitals investigated had established emergency nursing organizations, and management systems, and related regulations for the epidemic. However, the contents mentioned above still need to be further standardized. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The surge of patients in the epidemic was considerable challenge for the emergency capacity of hospitals. In the future, we should pay more attention to the following aspects: building emergency nursing staffing platforms, increasing emergency human\\\\resource reserves, establishing reliable communication channels for emergency response teams, improving the rules and regulations of emergency human\\\\resource management, offering more training and drills for emergency\\\\related knowledge and skills and giving more focus on bio\\\\psycho\\\\social wellbeing of nurses.","output":"Perspectives of nursing directors on emergency nurse deployment during the pandemic of COVID\\\\19: A nationwide cross\\\\sectional survey in mainland China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the deadly COVID-19 disease caused by Coronavirus has drawn the attention of researchers and policy makers to interrogate the utility of institu","output":"Prospects and Challenges for Traditional Leaders in Combating COVID-19 Pandemic in Rural Zimbabwe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to reveal the negative psychological aspects of using animals by scientists and to determine whether the emotional tensions and stress are associated with performing experiments on animals All 150 participants of the study conduct experiments on animals in their work Computer-assisted web interviewing, was used to collect the data Correlation matrices for factorial analysis of main component loads and cluster analysis have been calculated as grouping methods revealed two different categories of researchers, which were mostly distinguished by acceptance and aversion to animal testing and animal welfare The main findings demonstrated, that there is a group of respondents who feel discomfort when performing experiments on animals Especially young people involved in animal testing, feel remorse, emotional tension and helplessness","output":"Negative psychological aspects of working with experimental animals in scientific research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data sources Self-developed survey.

Among disorders emerging in the aftermath of a disaster, depression is the second most common. Aim: The current study was aimed to estimate the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) at two-time points in individuals who have been hospitalized for the treatment of COVID 19. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was carried out from May 2020 to October 2020 at a tertiary care center among patients discharged after recovery from novel coronavirus (COVID 19). A diagnostic clinical interview was conducted to diagnose MDD, and its severity in patients who had recovered from COVID 19 using 'Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)' at the time of discharge and 1 month after their discharge from the hospital. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were used for the analysis, P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 440 participants participated in the study. Out of them, 30.90% of participants met the criteria for MDD at the time of discharge and 19.5% at 1 month post-discharge. Participants who stayed for more than 14 days, were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and those with co-morbid medical illness had a higher prevalence of MDD. Conclusion: High prevalence of MDD was observed at the time of discharge among hospitalized participants.

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with K(d) of 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitory potency with K(d) < 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), could be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

Trace element concentrations along with additional biomarkers were determined in serum or plasma and associated to disease severity and outcome. An insufficient Se and/or Zn status upon hospital admission was associated with a higher mortality rate and a more severe disease course in the entire study group, especially in the senior population. In comparison to healthy European adults, the patients displayed strongly depressed total Se (mean  SD: 59.2  20.6 vs. 84.4  23.4 g L(?1)) and SELENOP (mean  SD: 2.2  1.9 vs. 4.3  1.0 mg L(?1)) concentrations at hospital admission.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Until September 2020, 3140 kidney and 667 liver transplants have been performed in our centers. We evaluated 38 kidney transplants and 9 liver transplants procedures performed during the pandemic (March 1 to September 2, 2020). Recipient and donor candidates were screened for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction and thoracic computed tomography. All recipients had routine immunosuppressive protocol. During hospitalization at our COVID-19-free transplant facility, we restricted the interactions during multidisciplinary rounds. RESULTS During the pandemic, 38 kidney transplants with an average length of hospital stay of 8.1 days were performed. Mean serum creatinine values of recipients were 0.91, 0.86, and 0.74 mg/dL on postoperative days 7, 30, and 90, respectively. During the pandemic, 9 living donor liver transplants (1 adult, 8 pediatric) were performed with an average length of hospital stay of 17.1 days. Mean serum total bilirubin levels were 0.9, 0.5, and 0.4 mg/dL on postoperative days 7, 30, and 90, respectively.

SETTINGS: The review was not limited by time of publication or setting in which the studies conducted. PARTICIPANTS: HIV-exposed infants were participants. RESULTS: Database search and review of reference lists yielded 923 unique titles, out of which 16 studies involving 13,822 HIV exposed infants (HEI) were eligible for inclusion in the review. Included studies were published between 2014 and 2019 from Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, South Africa, Zambia, and India. Of the 16 included studies, nine (experimental) and seven (observational) studies included had low to moderate risk of bias. The studies evaluated eHealth services (n = 6), service improvement (n = 4), service integration (n = 2), behavioral interventions (n = 3), and male partner involvement (n = 1). Overall, there was no evidence that any of the evaluated interventions, including eHealth, health systems improvements, integration of EID, conditional cash transfer, mother-to-mother support, or partner (male) involvement, was effective in increasing uptake of EID at 4C8 weeks of age. There was also no evidence that any intervention was effective in increasing HIV-infected infants identification at 4C8 weeks of age. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence to support the hypothesis that interventions implemented to increase uptake of EID were effective at 4C8 weeks of life. Further research is required to identify effective interventions that increase early infant diagnosis of HIV at 4C8 weeks of age.

Dogs and coyotes are definitive hosts of N. caninum and several species of domestic and wild animals are intermediate hosts. Dogs can become infected by the ingestion of tissues containing cysts and then excrete oocysts. It is not yet known whether sporulated oocysts are able to induce a patent infection in dogs, i.e. a shedding of N. caninum oocysts in feces. The objective of this study was to experimentally examine the infection of dogs by sporulated oocysts. The oocysts used in the experiment were obtained by feeding dogs with brain of buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) positive for anti-N. caninum antibodies by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT 200). Oocysts shed by these dogs were confirmed to be N. caninum by molecular methods and by bioassay in gerbils, and sporulated N. caninum oocysts were used for the oral infection of four dogs. The dogs were 8 weeks old and negative for antibodies to N. caninum and Toxoplasma gondii. Dogs 1 and 4 received an inoculum of 10,000 sporulated oocysts each; dog 2 an inoculum of 5000 sporulated oocysts and dog 3 received 1000 sporulated oocysts of N. caninum. The total feces excreted by these dogs were collected and examined daily for a period of 30 days. No oocysts were found in their feces. The dogs were monitored monthly for a 6-month period to observe a possible seroconversion and when this occurred the animals were eliminated from the experiment. Dogs 1 and 4 seroconverted 1 month after the infection with titer, in the IFAT, of 1600 and 800, respectively; the other two dogs presented no seroconvertion during the 6-month period. Dogs 1 and 2 were euthanized 180 days after infection and were examined for the detection of N. caninum in tissues (brain, muscle, lymph node, liver, lung, heart and bone marrow) by immunohistochemistry and PCR with negative results in both techniques. Bioassay in gerbils with brain of these dogs was also performed and again the results were negative. In conclusion, dogs infected with sporulated oocysts of N. caninum were not able to shed oocysts in feces.

Then, we discuss the dynamics of the deterministic model and for the global positive solution of the stochastic model, present the existence and uniqueness. Further, explore a few conditions for the termination and persistence of the infection. Then derive the basic reproduction number that determines the extinction and the persistence of the disease (infection). When the noise is huge or little, the numerical results appear that the COVID19 vanishes from the individuals on the chance that the reproduction number is less than one;though control the epidemic illnesses in the event that reproduction number is greater than one.

The epigenetic machinery has aroused considerable interest in the last decades, and much evidence has demonstrated that this type of modification could regulate the early stages of viral infection. Recently it was reported that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) influences SARS-CoV-2 replication, although its role remains to be further investigated. The knockdown of enzymes involved in the m6A pathway could represent an optimal strategy to deepen the epigenetic mechanism. In the present study, we blocked the catalytic activity of the fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) by using the selective inhibitor rhein. We observed a strong broad-spectrum reduction of infectivity caused by various coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

D-dimer elevation is particularly frequent, and values higher than 1g/mL have been associated with disease severity and in-hospital mortality. Previous retrospective studies found a high pulmonary embolism (PE) prevalence, however, it should be highlighted that diagnoses were only completed when PE was clinically suspected. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Single-center prospective cohort study. Between April 6(th) and April 17(th) 2020, consecutive confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with D-dimer >1 g/mL underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) to investigate the presence and magnitude of PE. Demographic and laboratory data, comorbidities, CTPA scores, administered treatments, and, clinical outcomes were analysed and compared between patients with and without PE. RESULTS: Thirty consecutive patients (11 women) were included. PE was diagnosed in 15 patients (50%). In patients with PE, emboli were located mainly in segmental arteries (86%) and bilaterally (60%). Patients with PE were significantly older (median age 67.0 (IQR 63.0C73.0) vs. 57.0 (IQR 48.0C69.0) years, p = .048) and did not differ in sex or risk factors for thromboembolic disease from the non-PE group. D-dimer, platelet count, and, C reactive protein values were significantly higher among PE patients. D-dimer values correlated with the radiologic magnitude of PE (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and D-dimer values higher than 1 g/mL presented a high prevalence of PE, regardless of clinical suspicion. We consider that these findings could contribute to improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, by initiating anticoagulant therapy when a PE is found.","output":"Prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and high D-dimer values: A prospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Terminal complement amplification is hypothesized to be a key contributor to the clinical manifestations of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Ravulizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to complement protein C5 and inhibits terminal complement activation, is being evaluated as a treatment for COVID-19-related severe pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in an ongoing phase 3 randomized controlled trial (ALXN1210-COV-305). To address the overactivation of terminal complement in severe COVID-19 compared to the diseases in which ravulizumab is currently approved, a modified dosing regimen was adopted. This analysis evaluates preliminary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data to confirm the modified dosing regimen. METHODS: Weight-based ravulizumab doses were administered on days 1, 5, 10, and 15. Serum levels of ravulizumab and free C5 were measured before and after administration of ravulizumab and any time on day 22. Free C5 levels < 0.5 g/mL indicate complete C5 inhibition. The pharmacokinetic target was defined as ravulizumab concentrations at the end of the dosing interval > 175 g/mL, the concentration above which C5 is completely inhibited. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included in this evaluation. At baseline, mean C5 concentration was 240  67 g/mL. In all patients and at all individual timepoints after the first dose was administered, ravulizumab concentrations remained > 175 g/mL and free C5 concentrations remained < 0.5 g/mL. CONCLUSION: High levels of baseline C5 observed in patients with severe COVID-19 contribute to the growing body of evidence that suggests this disease is marked by amplification of terminal complement activation. Data from this preliminary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic evaluation of 22 patients with severe COVID-19 show that the modified ravulizumab dosing regimen achieved immediate and complete terminal complement inhibition, which can be sustained for up to 22 days. These data support the continued use of this dosage regimen in the ongoing phase 3 study.

Earlier study reported that dry eye, blurred vision, foreign body sensation, tearing, itching, conjunctival secretion, conjunctival congestion, ocular pain, and photophobia are among the ocular symptoms that could be found in COVID-19 patients. However, there are only a few reports available regarding corneal involvement in this disease. Here we report a case of keratoconjunctivitis as the only symptom of COVID-19 infection. CASE DESCRIPTION A 27-year-old man who worked as an obstetrics and gynecology resident came to the outpatient clinic with the chief complaints of eye discomfort, foreign body sensation, conjunctival hyperemia, lacrimation, and photophobia in his right eye for the past 3 weeks. Fluorescence test showed a small corneal lesion. The patient was then diagnosed with keratoconjunctivitis. A week after the treatment, all symptoms were resolved. A month later, the patient came to the emergency room with the same eye complaints but with a more severe pain. The fluorescence test showed wider corneal lesion compared to last month. The result from the corneal swab is negative for bacterial or fungal infection, indicating a viral infection. Afterwards, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test from nasopharyngeal swab was performed and revealed that the patient was positive for COVID-19.

Dietary compounds can be sensed by nuclear receptors (NRs) that consequently exert pleiotropic effects including immune modulation. Here, we found that under homeostatic conditions the NR Liver X receptor (LXR), a sensor of cholesterol metabolites, regulates ROR?3t+ CD4 T cells in the intestine draining mesenteric lymph node (MLN). While LXR activation led to a decrease, LXR-deficiency resulted in an increase in MLN Th17 and ROR?3t+ Tregs. Mechanistically, LXR signaling in CD11c+ myeloid cells was required to control ROR?3t+ Treg. By contrast, modulation of MLN Th17 was independent of LXR signaling in either immune or epithelial cells. Of note, horizontal transfer of microbiota between LXR&#945;-/- and WT mice was sufficient to only partially increase MLN Th17 in WT mice. Despite LXR&#945; deficiency resulted in an increased abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae bacterial families compared to littermate controls, microbiota ablation (including SFB) was not sufficient to dampen LXR&#945;-mediated expansion of MLN Th17.

METHODS: An online questionnaire was disseminated to a cross-sectional sample of DHCWs from 19 countries using social media platforms. The questionnaire enquired about DHCWs frequency of using social media and their dependency on health-related information posted on those platforms. Anxiety was measured using General Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). RESULTS: Four-hundred and three (403) DHCWs completed the online questionnaire. Sixty-eight percent (68%) frequently use social media for information on COVID-19. The frequency of social media use was higher among younger DHCWs, with shorter clinical experience, and holders of undergraduate qualifications (p = 0.009, p = 0.002, and p = 0.023, respectively). Almost one third of DHCWs had moderate to severe anxiety (31.7%), which was significantly associated with the frequency of social media use (p = 0.016).

RESULTS: Thirteen female employees, who received mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV2 vaccine (Moderna) during the first three weeks of SARS-CoV2 vaccine rollout at San Francisco General Hospital, reported a pruritic rash at the injection site appearing 3-9 days after receiving their initial dose. Five had milder or similar reactions with earlier onset after the second dose. One additional female employee reported this delayed reaction only after the second dose. None of these 14 employees reported serious adverse events, such as anaphylaxis, or had symptoms severe enough to seek medical attention.

Questions have been raised by the media, schools, policy makers, and research communities about the effect on young peoples online behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study aimed to study self-reported changes in gaming, focusing on a younger section of the population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. We also wanted to look at potential risk factors behind problematic gaming during the pandemic, including gaming patterns, gambling behavior, psychological distress, certain sociodemographic characteristics, health factors, and school situation. METHODS: This was an anonymous online survey study of web panel participants in Sweden (n=1501) to study changes in gaming behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-reported increases in gaming were analyzed in logistic regression analyses against sociodemographic and health factors. RESULTS: Within the study population that reported changes in gaming activity, we found significant differences in age, employment status, disposable income, whether they ever played on loot boxes, time spent at home, school attendance, psychological distress, and gambling and gaming problems, as well as significant differences in changes in alcohol consumption and exercise habits. When examining the 16C24-year-old age group who reported changes in gaming activity, we found significant differences within the group in disposable income, time at home, and school attendance. When examining the 25C39-year-old age group who reported changes in gaming activity, we found significant differences within the group in employment status, disposable income, time spent at home, whether the respondents were studying, school attendance level, psychological distress, and gaming problems, as well as significant differences in changes in alcohol consumption and exercise habits. Psychological distress (all age groups analyzed together; 25C39-year-old age group), drinking less alcohol (all age groups analyzed together), spending more time at home (all age groups analyzed together), gaming problems, and exercising less (25C39-year-old age group) were positively correlated with a self-reported increase in gaming activity. Being employed (25C39-year-old age group) and being over 40 years of age (all age groups analyzed together) were negatively correlated with increased gaming. We found no significant correlations in the 16C24-year-old age group. CONCLUSIONS: Those who reported increased gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to be 16 years to 39 years old. In the age group of 25 years to 39 years old, the increase was associated with psychological distress, reporting less exercise, and being unemployed.

Rates are significantly higher in cystic fibrosis (CF), and impact health outcomes. Screening is recommended, but is difficult to implement/sustain annually in a busy CF centre. The aim was to develop an acceptable model for depression and anxiety screening in adolescents/adults with CF and their caregivers that could be sustained and shared. METHODS: Quality improvement methodology with plan-do-study-act cycles, flow diagrams, review of data monthly with our designated Mental Health Team and caregiver satisfaction surveys, were used to begin screening in clinics and to improve the process. We then piloted our process at a larger paediatric CF centre. RESULTS: Prior to 2013, screening was not performed at our CF centre. After the first quarter of depression screening, 88% of adolescents and 69% of adults with CF were screened. The process was refined. By the second year, 99% of patients were screened. Anxiety screening began in year three; 97%C99% of patients were screened for both anxiety and depression in years 3C5. Annual caregiver screening rates were >95%. Screening was changed from Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) to PHQ-9 due to better sensitivity in caregivers, and expanded to patients. Anxiety screening began in year 3 with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire. Patients and caregivers reported acceptance of screening. At the larger paediatric centre used as a pilot, 89.6% of patients were screened in year 1. Feedback included recommendations to improve tracking/follow-up of positive screens. CONCLUSIONS: Development and implementation of a stepwise process for depression and anxiety screening was successful in a paediatric/adult CF clinic, due to constant re-evaluation by an engaged team with feedback from patients via survey. A systematic approach at a busy CF centre can serve as a model to implement screening in a clinic.","output":"Systematic depression and anxiety screening for patients and caregivers: implementation and process improvement in a cystic fibrosis clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the COVID-19 outbreak recorded over the previous months could be characterized as a pandemic. The first known Italian SARS-CoV-2 positive case was reported on 21 February. In some countries, cases of suspected COVID-19-like pneumonia had been reported earlier than those officially accepted by health authorities. This has led many investigators to check preserved biological or environmental samples to see whether the virus was detectable on dates prior to those officially stated. With regard to Italy, the results of a microbiological screening in sewage samples collected between the end of February and the beginning of April 2020 from wastewaters in Milan (Northern Italy) and Rome (Central Italy) showed presence of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we evaluated, by means of a standardized diagnostic method, the SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence amongst patients affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARI) in an academic hospital located in Central Italy during the period of 1 November 2019C1 March 2020. Overall, the number of emergency room (ER) visits during the investigated period was 13,843. Of these, 1208 had an influenza-like syndrome, but only 166 matched the definition of SARI as stated in the study protocol. A total of 52 SARI cases were laboratory confirmed as influenza: 26 as a type B virus, 25 as a type A, and 1 as both viruses. Although about 17% of the total sample had laboratory or radiological data compatible with COVID-19, all the nasopharyngeal swabs stored underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and tested negative. Based on our result, it is confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic spread did not start prior to the official onset in central Italy. Routine monitoring of SARI causative agents at the local level is critical for reporting epidemiologic and etiologic trends that may differ from one country to another and also among different influenza seasons. This has a practical impact on prevention and control strategies.","output":"No Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 Circulation in Rome (Italy) during the Pre-Pandemic Period: Results of a Retrospective Surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The last two decades has seen a significant evolution in the surgical management of distal rectal cancer, with restoration of intestinal continuity now one of the primary objectives.

We report a case of aortic angiosarcoma in association with a graft. We also conducted a clinicopathological review of cases of primary aortic sarcomas associated with implanted grafts. CASE REPORT The patient was an 82-year-old woman. She underwent thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) at age 78 because of an aneurysm in the descending aorta. Approximately 4 years after the TEVAR, computed tomography revealed a type II endoleak and expansion of the aneurysm. Her c-reactive protein level rose to 34 mg/dL, and Ga scintigraphy showed 67Ga accumulation at the aneurysm. She had fever up to 39C, and a stent graft infection was suspected. Despite administration of antibiotics, her condition deteriorated, and she died. Postmortem examination identified epithelioid aortic angiosarcoma at the aorta with aneurysm repair and the graft, and the aortic angiosarcoma invaded the left lower lobe of the lung. CONCLUSIONS Our clinicopathological review revealed that the proper clinical diagnosis was very difficult owing to confusion of aortic sarcoma after the implantation with the infected graft, atypical endoleak, or pseudoaneurysm. The histological diagnosis was ambiguous because immunohistochemical and genetic studies were not adequately conducted. Overall prognosis of aortic sarcoma is poor as most patients die within a year, with no effective treatments. It is hoped that recent projects for genomic medicine will provide useful insights about the diagnosis and treatment of these cancers.","output":"Aortic Angiosarcoma in Association with Endovascular Aneurysm Repair: Case Report and Review of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are recurrent neural networks made up of well-defined neurons and causal relations.

Summary Introduction: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has posed a real challenge to health systems. In Spain, the heterogeneous distribution of the virus infection and the different health strategies have conditioned the morbidity and fatality rate. The aim of this study was to analyse the lethality of the infection by sex and age range in the Autonomous Communities (AC) of Spain. Material and methods. To perform the analysis, data were extracted from the Ministry of Health, Regional and Public Health Departments of the different AC. The infected population was estimated from the results of the ENE-COVID19 and the population registered on 1 January 2020 (INE) for the validity of the IgG antibody test with 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The case fatality rate (TL) (deaths/1000 estimated infected) by sex and age (<20 years, 20-64 and 65 years) was calculated for each AC. The standardized case fatality ratio (REL) was calculated by the exact method (EPIDAT). Results. The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain was 6% (range, 1.4% Ceuta - 14.1% Community of Madrid). The TL in Spain was 9,6/1000, ranged per AC from 1/1000 in Melilla to 26.6/1000 in La Rioja, with no correlation between case fatality and prevalence of infection. The TL was higher in men (10.2/1000, ratio 1.17 with respect to women) except in Catalu?a (ratio 0.92) and especially high in those over 64 years of age in La Rioja (143.5/1000), Asturias (69.2/1000) and Basque Country (46.6/1000). Overall excess REL was found to be over 30% in La Rioja (2.91, 95% CI 2.36-3.57), Asturias (1.51, 95% CI 1.27-1.80), Basque Country (1.42, 95% CI 1.31-1.54) and Extremadura (1.37, 95% CI 1.20-1.57) and in those over 64 years in Madrid and the Canary Islands. Conclusions: SARs-Cov-2 virus infection has been very unevenly distributed in the different ACs, with notably differences in TL between ACs, particularly high in La Rioja, Asturias and the Basque Country.

Reliability is understood as one of the representations of an operator acting on specific streams in time t(o) to t. One of these represents the global reliability of a system as a function of parallel action of all the streams of the system in time t(o) to t and is denoted as P(g)((t)). The second representation of reliability is a scalar value, P(ss) It shows a new function of global reliability of a manufacturing process as a product of system stream reliability. In order to plot the flow of the manufacturing processs global reliability function, we need to perform detailed calculations, computations, and analysis of the differences of individual values in real time, as well as plan an algorithm of the flow of system streams. This needs a lot of effort, translating however, to a detailed picture of the process. In the analysed example, measurements and research revealed an important increase of the value of reliability in a transition from a traditional to a robotised bakery. The article also presents a new concept of the reliability of a technological process, based on the analysis of relations of elements of the following streams: energy, matter, information, time, and finances. It shows the method of specifying streams and the method for defining the reliability of important and supportive relations. Important relations between stream elements are defined as having the reliability value of one in time. Supportive relations bear the reliability within a continuum between zero and one. Important relations are designated based on research, experience, and knowledge. Stream systemic reliability P(ss) is a scalar value, i.e. a number from the continuum between zero and one. The P(ss) value characterises failure-free operation of the whole system. Its average value in the normative time t(n) expresses the efficiency of the manufacturing system. The value P(ss) is a quotient of the number of important relation and the sum of important and supportive relations. The formula for P(ss) shows the method of optimising the process through the increasing of the number of important relations between the input stream components. The concept has been applied to study the efficiency of operation of a small-scale bakery. Systemic analysis of a bakery allows for important increase in the reliability of baking bread if robotisation has been implemented. The concept of systemic-stream reliability P(ss) may be applied to analyse the efficiency of any technological process and optimisation of any manufacturing process.","output":"Systemic analysis of a manufacturing process based on a small scale bakery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Existing analyses of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against COVID19 transmission have focussed on the joint effectiveness of large-scale NPIs.

Methods: To our knowledge, this is the largest data-driven study of NPI effectiveness to date. We collected chronological data on 9 NPIs in 41 countries between January and April 2020, using extensive fact-checking to ensure high data quality. We infer NPI effectiveness with a novel semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model, modelling both confirmed cases and deaths to increase the signal from which NPI effects can be inferred. Finally, we study the burden imposed by different NPIs with an online survey of preferences using the MaxDiff method. Results: Six NPIs had a >97.5% posterior probability of being effective: closing schools (mean reduction in R: 58%; 95% credible interval: 50% - 64%), limiting gatherings to 10 people or less (24%; 6% - 39%), closing nonessential businesses (23%; 5% - 38%), closing high-risk businesses (19%; 1% - 34%), testing patients with respiratory symptoms (18%; 8% - 26%), and stay-at-home orders (17%; 5% - 28%). These results show low sensitivity to 12 forms of varying the model and the data. The model makes sensible forecasts for countries and periods not seen during training. We combine the effectiveness and preference results to estimate effectiveness-to-burden ratios. Conclusions: Our results suggest a surprisingly large role for schools in COVID-19 transmission, a contribution to the ongoing debate about the relevance of asymptomatic carriers in disease spreading. We identify additional interventions with good effectiveness-burden tradeoffs, namely symptomatic testing, closing high-risk businesses, and limiting gathering size. Closing most nonessential businesses and issuing stay-at-home orders impose a high burden while having a limited additional effect.","output":"The effectiveness and perceived burden of nonpharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 transmission: a modelling study with 41 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandemia del Covid-19, popularmente conocido como coronavirus, fue anunciada en un artculo de la American Society of Microbiology que ya en el 2007 alertaba sobre los peligros del consumo de animales exticos en las diferentes comunidades chinas Los antecedentes del SARS y el MERS nos ayudan entender que la humanidad no est preparada para contingencias tan severas Las economas se ven descontroladas y no existen liderazgos;los sistemas de salud son deficientes: resultado de a?os de falta de inversin, de salarios bajos y dficit de personal calificado para atender, seguir, controlar y dirigir las enfermedades infecciosas The Covid-19 pandemic, popularly known as coronavirus, was announced in an article by the American Society of Microbiology that already in 2007 warned about the dangers of the consumption of exotic animals in different Chinese communities The background of SARS and MERS helps us understand that humanity is not prepared for such severe contingencies Economies are sold out and there is no leadership;health systems are deficient: the result of years of underinvestment, low salaries and lack of qualified personnel to attend, follow, control and direct infectious diseases","output":"COVID-19: El mundo en pausa. ?Cmo nos enfrentamos a esta nueva pandemia?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) capably bridges the disciplines of surgery, oncology and biomedical engineering science.

Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score 10 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out all six precautionary behaviors. For both measures, Wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p<0.001). Controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4-1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5-1.9). Having confidence in taking measures to protect oneself against the disease was associated with a lower risk (0.6, 0.5-0.7). The strongest predictor of behavioral change was perceived severity (1.2, 1.1-1.4), followed by confusion about information reliability (1.1, 1.0-1.3).

Among surface expressed polypeptides is the 35-kDa antigen, previously designated Ag35. Both monoclonal (mAb) and monospecific affinity pure antibodies directed against Ag35 neutralized vaccinia infectiousness, indicating that this prominent surface antigen has a function during early virus-host cell interactions. The binding of several monoclonal antibodies to various regions of Ag35 was tested by reacting CNBr fragments, derived from the polypeptide, employing Western blotting. All mAbs tested reacted with the same region of Ag35. Estimation of the molecular weights (MW), based on migration of the CNBr peptides in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that those partial digestion products which contained a proline-rich 99 amino acid limit digest fragment were present at a position approximately 12.5 kDa larger than that predicted from the DNA sequence. By contrast, partial and limit digest products lacking the proline-rich fragment migrated to the MW position expected from the length of the DNA sequence. This observation demonstrates that departure from a predicted 22.3 kDa to an anomalous MW of Ag35 is conferred by the proline-rich peptide. The surface location of Ag35 was confirmed by immune electron microscopy. In a competition test the binding specificity of mAb and affinity-purified antibodies at the surface of virions could be demonstrated. Evidence for an association of Ag35 with the virus envelope at various stages during biogenesis of vaccinia was obtained by immune electron microscopy of whole mounts and thin sections. Presence of Ag35 as an early component of immature and mature virions, probably residing in the bilayer membrane structure was detected. A distinction can, therefore, be made between Ag35 and several other vaccinia envelope polypeptides which are synthesized as late functions and added during late stages of envelope assembly.","output":"A prominent antigenic surface polypeptide involved in the biogenesis and function of the vaccinia virus envelope()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this Editorial, we take the opportunity to expand on the second Journal of University Teaching and Learning theme, Developing Teaching Practice. Building on Editorial 18(4), which articulated changes to higher education in the period roughly between 1980 and 2021, we believe it is pertinent to explore the changing conceptions of academic as 'teacher'. We use Engestrom's cultural-historical activity theory as a lens to consider how higher education teachers are situated in the current context of rapid changes arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore possible future purposes of higher education to consider flow-on impacts on the purpose of its teachers and how their roles might change to accommodate future expectations. We assert the need to challenge the notion of the academic as a person who is recruited into higher education largely because of their subject matter expertise while maintaining strong commitment to teaching expertise that is grounded in scholarship, critical self-reflection, and agency. In our various teaching and leadership roles, and consistent with the literature, we have observed paradoxical outcomes from the nexus between risk, innovation and development, driving risk aversity and risk management, with significant (contradictory) impacts on teaching, teachers and student learning. The barriers to implementing innovative curricula include questions of do students get a standardised and 'safe' educational experience or are they challenged and afforded the opportunity to transform and grow? Are they allowed to fail? Related, do teachers have genuine agency, as an educator, or are they positioned as agents of a higher education system? We explore these questions and invite our readers to engage in serious reflexivity and identify strategies that help them question their attitudes, thought processes, and assumptions about teaching and student learning. We welcome papers that contribute values-based conversations and explore ways of dealing with and adapting to change in our teaching practices, case studies of learning through failure, change and adaptation and the development of the field. Practitioner Notes 1. It is useful and important to explore changing conceptions of higher education teachers and teaching practice in the context of rapid changes and emergent (sometimes perverse) outcomes and impacts. 2. Engtrom's Cultural Historical Activity Theory is a useful lens for identifying issues and reflecting on the positioning of teachers and students within higher education. 3.

Parental decision making when accessing unscheduled care for their children is multifaceted and must be better understood to inform policy and practice. DESIGN: Nineteen semi\\\\structured interviews and one focus group (n = 4) with parents of children younger than twelve in Ireland were conducted. Participants had accessed unscheduled care for their children in the past. Data were thematically analysed. RESULTS: Parents accessed unscheduled care for their children after reaching capacity to manage the child's health themselves. This was informed by factors such as parental experience, perceived urgency and need for reassurance. Parents considered the necessity to access care and situated their health\\\\seeking behaviour within a framework of appropriateness. Where parents sought unscheduled care was largely determined by timely access, and inability to secure a general practitioner (GP) appointment often led parents to access other services. Parents expressed a need for more support in navigating unscheduled care options. CONCLUSIONS: Better resources to educate and support parents are required, and structural issues, such as accessibility to GPs, need to be addressed to enable parents to better navigate the unscheduled health system and manage their children's health. The discourse around appropriate and inappropriate access to health care has permeated parental decision making when accessing unscheduled health care for their children. What constitutes appropriate access should be examined, and a shift away from this framing of health\\\\seeking behaviour may be warranted.

Whether a quarantining strategy could be justified at a time when there was an increased demand for the services of HCWs remained unknown. AIMS: To establish whether quarantining staff away from a healthcare setting during a pandemic is justified. METHODS: This retrospective study examined close contacts of COVID-19-positive index cases (both residents and HCWs) in a community hospital over a 4-week period from 1 to 28 April 2020. Close contacts were identified in accordance with national guidelines. Zones of the hospital were examined to determine the number of COVID-positive index cases and their close contacts. A cumulative result for the hospital was recorded. RESULTS: While outcomes varied over time, per zone and per HCW category, the overall conversion rate from close contact to an index case was 30%.

Here, we developed a method called 2CIMPL that includes proximity ligation under native conditions to identify genome-wide RNA duplexes. Interactions between all eight segments were observed at multiple sites along a given segment and are concentrated at hotspots. Furthermore, synonymous nucleotide changes in a hotspot decreased the formation of RNA-RNA interactions at this site and resulted in a genome-wide rearrangement without a loss in replicative fitness. These results indicate that the viral RNA interaction network is flexible to account for nucleotide evolution. Moreover, comparative analysis of RNA-RNA interaction sites with viral nucleoprotein (NP) binding to the genome revealed that RNA junctions can also occur adjacent to NP peaks, suggesting that NP association does not exclude RNA duplex formation. Overall, 2CIMPL is a versatile technique to map in vivo RNA-RNA interactions.","output":"Mapping of Influenza Virus RNA-RNA Interactions Reveals a Flexible Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus disease COVID-19 began in December 2019 and has spread rapidly by human-to-human transmission. This study evaluated the transmissibility of the infectious disease and analyzed its association with temperature and humidity to study the propagation pattern of COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, we revised the reported data in Wuhan based on several assumptions to estimate the actual number of confirmed cases considering that perhaps not all cases could be detected and reported in the complex situation there. Then we used the equation derived from the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model to calculate R(0) from January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020 in 11 major cities in China for comparison. With the calculation results, we conducted correlation analysis and regression analysis between R(0) and temperature and humidity for four major cities in China to see the association between the transmissibility of COVID-19 and the weather variables. RESULTS: It was estimated that the cumulative number of confirmed cases had exceeded 45 000 by February 13, 2020 in Wuhan. The average R(0) in Wuhan was 2.7, significantly higher than those in other cities ranging from 1.8 to 2.4. The inflection points in the cities outside Hubei Province were between January 30, 2020 and February 3, 2020, while there had not been an obvious downward trend of R(0) in Wuhan. R(0) negatively correlated with both temperature and humidity, which was significant at the 0.01 level. CONCLUSIONS: The transmissibility of COVID-19 was strong and importance should be attached to the intervention of its transmission especially in Wuhan.

Too high share of receivables that are not settled in a timely manner can result in various problems for enterprises, including, in particular, financial problems that can lead to large-scale bankruptcy. Considering a huge number of connections between individual entities, the bankruptcy of one may pose a risk of a wave of bankruptcy of others. The paper aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the payment situation of Polish enterprises. The research was conducted on the basis of an analysis of data on the payment situation of Polish enterprises from selected industries. Basic descriptive statistics was used in the study to characterize the material. The nonparametric Wilcoxon pair order test, which is the equivalent of the Student's t-test for related variables, was used for the research. The research proved that at enterprises from almost every industry, the value of debts at the end of the second quarter of 2020 was higher than in the first quarter. It can therefore be concluded that the outbreak of the pandemic contributed to an increase in arrears, which, in turn, resulted in an increased risk of doing business. The greater the share of arrears with contractors, the greater the risk of financial problems at the enterprise, and hence the increased risk of bankruptcy. ? 2021 Robert Dankiewicz, Bart?omiej Balawejder, Tomasz Tomczyk, Viktor Trynchuk.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the due payments of Polish entreprises from selected industries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: On March 11, 2020, the WHO has declared that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic infection People's commitment to the recommended control measures is generally affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) concerning COVID-19;hence, this study aimed to assess the KAPs of university students in Sudan regarding COVID-19 Materials and Methods: This was an online descriptive cross-sectional study, performed between April and June 2020 among Sudanese students enrolled in 10 universities in Khartoum state The study was conducted using an online questionnaire designed in Arabic The sample size in this study was 657 students Data were collected by a convenience sampling method and were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Results: More than 60% of the participants were females, around two-Thirds (68 1%) aged between 18 and 23 years More than 81% of the participants live in urban areas;approximately two-fifth (59 5%) of them were medical students About 59% of the participants have sufficient knowledge Twenty-Two percent of the participants reported a positive attitude, while 71% of them reported a fair attitude, and only 3 8% reported a negative attitude Nearly 94% of them do not go out of home, and 95% do use disinfectants, solutions, and face masks to prevent contacting and spreading COVID-19 Knowledge was significantly associated with age, gender, study level, being medical or nonmedical students, attending online lectures or webinars about COVID-19, and educational level, while attitude was significantly associated with gender Conclusion: More than half of the participants had sufficient knowledge, and the minority of them had a negative attitude toward COVID-19, while most of them had a good practice Gender and attending online lectures or webinars about COVID-19 were the predictors for participant's knowledge","output":"Knowledge, attitude, and practice of university students toward COVID-19 in Sudan: An online-based cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The current study explored improved patient satisfaction scores at a single emergency department (ED) during the early phase of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic (March to May 2020).

In stable conditions where vertical temperature gradients are positive, would prevent the vertical motion of fluid flows, thus the initial inertia motions are maintained, whereas in unstable conditions where vertical temperature gradients are negative, fluids experience intensive convection, thus the initial inertia motions are more easily to get disturbed. This study experimentally and numerically investigated the dispersion of exhaled contaminants and body thermal plume in a displacement-ventilated room integrated with unstable and stable conditions. Two real-human subjects participated in the full-scale experiments. The effects of participants' relative position with reference to the ventilation vents and of ventilation rates on the flow field were examined. Results show that the thermal stratification associated with the displacement ventilation system was disturbed by unstable conditions, resulting in a uniformly distributed contaminants and thermal fields, therefore a reduced exposure level;whereas the thermal stratification was enhanced by stable conditions so that the transport of contaminants and thermal more inclined to follow their initially released direction and led to a relatively high exposure level in the breathing microenvironment. Air distribution in unstable conditions, when compared with stable conditions, was more sensitive to the relative position between the participants and the vents. Increasing the ventilation rate could greatly reduce the contaminant level of unstable conditions but may not achieve as good results in stable conditions.

The data were collected in the centenarian's home where the caregiver worked. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics and qualitative data by content analysis. The results showed that 58.2% of the caregivers were overburdened. Of these, 92.3% were females, 56.4% were 60-75 years old, 48.7% had 7 to 11 years of schooling, 53.8% were married, 66.7% were children of centenarians, the caregiving duration ranged from 1 to 5 years in 35.9%, and 69.2% cared for the older adult 24 hours/day. There was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.01) between the level of leisure-time physical activity and caregiving burden, with 64.9% of insufficiently active caregivers tending to be overburdened with the care demand.

MethodsWe determined IgG and NAb against SARS-CoV-2 variants one year following mild wild-type infection (n=104) and two-dose regimens with BNT162b2 (BNT/BNT) (n=67), ChAdOx1 (ChAd/ChAd) (n=82), or heterologous ChAdOx1 followed by BNT162b2 (ChAd/BNT) (n=116). FindingsWild type spike IgG and NAb remained detectable in 80% (83/104) of unvaccinated participants one year post mild infection. The neutralizing capacity was similar against wild type (reference), Alpha (0.95 (0.92-0.98) and Delta 1.03 (0.95-1.11) but significantly reduced against Beta (0.54 (0.48-0.60)) and Gamma 0.51 (0.44-0.61). Similarly, BNT/BNT and ChAd/ChAd elicited sustained capacity against Alpha and Delta (1.01 (0.78-1.31) and 0.85 (0.64-1.14)) and (0.96 (0.84-1.09) and 0.82 (0.61-1.10) respectively), with reduced capacity against Beta (0.67 (0.50-0.88) and 0.53 (0.40-0.71)) and Gamma (0.12 (0.06-0.27) and 0.54 (0.37-0.80)).

InterpretationPersistent neutralization of the wide-spread Alpha and Delta variants one year after wild-type infection may aid vaccine policy makers in low-resource settings when prioritizing vaccine supply. The reduced capacity of neutralizing Beta and Gamma strains, but not the Alpha and Delta strains following both infection and three different vaccine regimens argues for caution against Beta and Gamma-exclusive mutations in the efforts to optimize next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

The primary focus is on the regions of recirculating flow that can harbor infectious aerosol for much longer than the well-ventilated parts of the room. Computational fluid dynamics is used to obtain the steady state air flow field, and Lagrangian tracking of particles give the spatial and temporal distribution of infectious aerosol in the domain. It is found that the washbasin located next to the door is in a prominent recirculation zone, and particles injected in this region take much longer to be evacuated. The ventilation rate is found to be governed by the air residence time in the recirculation zone, and it is much higher than the time scale based on fully-mixed reactor model of the room.

We aimed to determine the symptoms most commonly associated with a positive result for a SARS-CoV-2 swab among community-based children. METHODS: We conducted an observational study among children tested and followed for SARS-CoV-2 infection using nasal, nasopharyngeal, throat or other (e.g., nasopharyngeal aspirate or tracheal secretions, or unknown) swabs between Apr. 13 and Sept. 30, 2020, in Alberta. We calculated positive likelihood ratios (LRs) for self-reported symptoms and a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab result in the entire cohort and in 3 sensitivity analyses: all children with at least 1 symptom, all children tested because of contact tracing whether they were symptomatic or not and all children 5 years of age or older. RESULTS: We analyzed results for 2463 children who underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection; 1987 children had a positive result and 476 had a negative result. Of children with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, 714 (35.9%) reported being asymptomatic. Although cough (24.5%) and rhinorrhea (19.3%) were 2 of the most common symptoms among children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were also common among those with negative test results and were not predictive of a positive test (positive LR 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81-1.14, and 0.87, 95% CI 0.72-1.06, respectively). Anosmia/ageusia (positive LR 7.33, 95% CI 3.03-17.76), nausea/vomiting (positive LR 5.51, 95% CI 1.74-17.43), headache (positive LR 2.49, 95% CI 1.74-3.57) and fever (positive LR 1.68, 95% CI 1.34-2.11) were the symptoms most predictive of a positive result for a SARSCoV-2 swab.

However, data-driven analyses of the socioeconomic determinants of COVID-19 burden are still needed. Using data from New York City (NYC), we aimed to determine how socioeconomic factors impact human mobility and COVID-19 burden. Methods/Summary: New York City has a large amount of heterogeneity in socioeconomic status (SES) and demographics among neighborhoods. We used this heterogeneity to conduct a cross-sectional spatial analysis of the associations between human mobility (i.e., subway ridership), sociodemographic factors, and COVID-19 incidence as of April 26, 2020. We also conducted a secondary analysis of NYC boroughs (which are equivalent to counties in the city) to assess the relationship between the decline in subway use and the time it took for each borough to end the exponential growth period of COVID-19 cases. Findings: Areas with the lower median income, a greater percentage of individuals who identify as non-white and/or Hispanic/Latino, a greater percentage of essential workers, and a greater percentage of healthcare workers had more subway use during the pandemic. The positive associations between subway use and median income, and between subway use and percent non-white and/or Hispanic/Latino do not remain when adjusted for the percent of essential workers. This suggests essential work is what drives subway use in lower SES zip codes and communities of color. Increased subway use was associated with a higher rate of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population when adjusted for testing effort (aRR=1.11; 95% CI: 1.03 - 1.19), but this association was weaker once we adjusted for median income (aRR=1.06; 95% CI: 1.00 - 1.12). All sociodemographic variables were significantly associated with the rate of positive cases per 100,000 population when adjusting for testing effort (except percent uninsured) and adjusting for both income and testing effort. The risk factor with the strongest association with COVID-19 was the percent of individuals in essential work (aRR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.36 - 1.86). We found that subway use declined prior to any executive order, and there was an estimated 28-day lag between the onset of reduced subway use and the end of the exponential growth period of SARS-CoV-2 within New York City boroughs. Interpretation: Our results suggest that the ability to stay home during the pandemic has been constrained by SES and work circumstances. Poorer neighborhoods are not afforded the same reductions in mobility as their richer counterparts. Furthermore, lower SES neighborhoods have higher disease burdens, which may be due to inequities in ability to shelter-in-place, and/or due to the plethora of other existing health disparities that increase vulnerability to COVID-19. Furthermore, the extended lag time between the dramatic fall in subway ridership and the end of the exponential growth phase for COVID-19 cases is important for future policy, because it demonstrates that if there is a resurgence, and stay-at-home orders are re-issued, then cities can expect to wait a month before reported cases will plateau.","output":"Socioeconomic disparities in subway use and COVID-19 outcomes in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reducing energy waste is one of the primary concerns facing Remote Industrial Plants (RIP) and, in particular, the accommodations and operational plants located in remote areas. With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to attack the health of workforce, managing the balance between energy efficiency and Occupation Health and Safety (OHS) in the workplace becomes another great challenge for the RIP. Maintaining this balance is difficult mainly because a full awareness of the OHS will generally consume more energy while reducing the energy cost may lead to a less effective OHS, and the existing literature has not seen a system that is designed for the RIPs to conserve energy usage and improve workforce OHS simultaneously. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose an AI Empowered Cyber Physical Ecosystem (AECPE) solution for the RIPs, which integrates Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), artificial intelligence, and mobile networks. The preliminary results of lab experiments and field tests proved that the AECPE was able to help industries reduce the corporate annual energy cost that is worth millions of dollars, optimise the environmental conditions, and improve OHS for all workers and stakeholders.

DESIGN Concurrent questionnaire survey of fit testers and test subjects. SETTING Ambulatory care, home nursing care, and acute care hospitals across South Australia. METHODS Quantitative facial-fit testing was performed with TSI PortaCount instruments for healthcare workers (HCWs) who wore 5 different models of a disposable P2 (N95-equivalent) respirator. The questionnaire included questions about the HCW's age, sex, race, occupational category, main area of work, smoking status, facial characteristics, prior training and experience in use of respiratory masks, and number of attempts to obtain a respirator fit. RESULTS A total of 6,160 HCWs were successfully fitted during the period from January through July 2007. Of the 4,472 HCWs who responded to the questionnaire and were successfully fitted, 3,707 (82.9%) were successfully fitted with the first tested respirator, 551 (12.3%) required testing with a second model, and 214 (4.8%) required 3 or more tests. We noted an increased pass rate on the first attempt over time. Asians (excluding those from South and Central Asia) had the highest failure rate (16.3% [45 of 276 Asian HCWs were unsuccessfully fitted]), and whites had the lowest (9.8% [426 of 4,338 white HCWs]). Race was highly correlated with facial shape. Among occupational groups, doctors had the highest failure rate (13.4% [81 of 604 doctors]), but they also had the highest proportion of Asians. Prior education and/or training in respirator use were not associated with a higher pass rate. CONCLUSIONS Certain facial characteristics were associated with higher or lower pass rates with regard to fit testing, and fit testers were able to select a suitable respirator on the basis of a visual assessment in the majority of cases. For the fit tester, training and experience were important factors; however, for the HCW being fitted, prior experience in respirator use was not an important factor.","output":"Evaluation of a large-scale quantitative respirator-fit testing program for healthcare workers: survey results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"About 4.25% of people have lost their lives due to COVID-19 disease, among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

On 31 December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unspecified etiology was reported to the World Health Organization in China. The availability of adequate SARS-CoV-2 drugs is also limited, and the efficacy and safety of these drugs for COVID-2019 pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical trials. For these reasons, there is a need for other strategies against COVID-19 that are capable of prevention and treatment. Physical exercise has proven to be an effective therapy for most chronic diseases and microbial infections with preventive/therapeutic benefits, considering that exercise involves primary immunological mediators and/or anti-inflammatory properties. This review aimed to provide an insight into how the implementation of a physical exercise program against COVID-19 may be a useful complementary tool for prevention, which can also enhance recovery, improve quality of life, and provide immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the long term. In summary, physical exercise training exerts immunomodulatory effects, controls the viral gateway, modulates inflammation, stimulates nitric oxide synthesis pathways, and establishes control over oxidative stress.","output":"Physical Exercise as a Multimodal Tool for COVID-19: Could It Be Used as a Preventive Strategy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), raising and reducing the function of Th17 and Treg cells, respectively, elicit hyperinflammation and disease progression. The current study aimed to evaluate the responses of Th17 and Treg cells in COVID-19 patients compared with the control group. Forty COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients were compared with 40 healthy controls. The frequency of cells, gene expression of related factors, as well as the secretion levels of cytokines, were measured by flow cytometry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques, respectively. The findings revealed a significant increase in the number of Th17 cells, the expression levels of related factors (RAR-related orphan receptor gamma [RORt], IL-17, and IL-23), and the secretion levels of IL-17 and IL-23 cytokines in COVID-19 patients compared with controls. In contrast, patients had a remarkable reduction in the frequency of Treg cells, the expression levels of correlated factors (Forkhead box protein P3 [FoxP3], transforming growth factor- [TGF-], and IL-10), and cytokine secretion levels (TGF- and IL-10). The ratio of Th17/Treg cells, RORt/FoxP3, and IL-17/IL-10 had a considerable enhancement in patients compared with the controls and also in dead patients compared with the improved cases. The findings showed that enhanced responses of Th17 cells and decreased responses of Treg cells in 2019-n-CoV patients compared with controls had a strong relationship with hyperinflammation, lung damage, and disease pathogenesis. Also, the high ratio of Th17/Treg cells and their associated factors in COVID-19-dead patients compared with improved cases indicates the critical role of inflammation in the mortality of patients.","output":"Th17 and Treg cells function in SARS-CoV2 patients compared with healthy controls."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia have been found in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.

Estimation of amylose and amylopectin in maize kernels is important for developing suitable hybrids. The existing protocols for estimation of amylose and amylopectin in maize are elaborate and lengthy, and involve high cost. Here, we developed a rapid and cost-effective method for estimation of amylose and amylopectin in maize kernels. 10% toluene and 80% ethanol were used for removal of proteins (~ 10%) and lipids (~ 4%) from maize flour. The over-estimation of amylose was minimized using NaOH with KI to stop free KI to bind with amylopectin. Standards were improved by mixing amylose and amylopectin in different concentrations (0-100%), rather than using amylose or amylopectin alone. Standard curve generated regression equation of y = 90.436x + 0.8535 with R 2 = 0.9989. Two types of samples viz., (1) protein, amylose and amylopectin (2) amylose and amylopectin, showed that starch fractions were highly comparable to expected values with correlation coefficient (r) of 0.9998 and mean standard deviation of 0.54. The protocol successfully estimated wide range of amylose (2.79-50.04%) and amylopectin (59.96-97.21%) among diverse maize inbreds including amylose extender1 (ae1) and waxy1 (wx1) mutants. Present protocol required 75% less time and 92.5% less cost compared to existing protocols. The newly developed method would be highly useful in developing maize hybrids high in amylose or amylopectin.

It is postulated that IL 6 is associated directly with the severity of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Another domain that is thought to predict the severity of COVID-19 is the neutrophil:lymphocyte (N:L) ratio; a higher N:L ratio is postulated to be related to more severe outcomes. Thus, the present study was aimed to establish a correlation of COVID-19 with IL-6 in terms of clinical outcomes. We had also tried to find the relationship between IL-6 and N:L ratio and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) score. METHODS: We have conducted a cross-sectional study of 200 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for COVID-19 from January to May 2021. Serum IL-6, N:L ratio, and HRCT chest were conducted on admission. RESULT: Out of 200 patients who were admitted to the ICU with COVID-19, while the IL-6 was higher in patients with increased N:L ratio and HRCT score, the association of IL-6 with clinical outcomes in terms of discharged and expired was found to be statistically not significant. CONCLUSION: Serum IL-6 was found not to be a potent marker for clinical outcomes in ICU patients in terms of death vs survived. However, the IL-6 levels on admission can be correlated with the computed tomography (CT) severity scores as well as N:L ratio of patients admitted to an ICU.

According to Article 124 of the Japanese Companies Act (JCA), if the record date for exercising shareholders rights is specified in the articles of incorporation (AOI), such rights must be exercised within three months from said date. Many Japanese companies set the record date at the end of March and hold an annual shareholders meeting by the end of June. However, if the date of the annual shareholders meeting is delayed, it is, in principle, necessary to shift the record date as well. Under the current JCA it is also possible to hold, as originally scheduled, a shareholders meeting to propose a resolution regarding dividends and then to report financial statements at a later date. However, in situations where audited financial statements do not exist, there is some opposition to the resolution on dividends and to the appointment and dismissal of directors at shareholders' meetings because the information that is the premise for such a resolution is insufficient. Therefore, companies that decide about dividends at shareholders meetings are likely to face a difficult decision. Actually many listed companies in Japan postponed the annual shareholders' meeting in 2020. While in Japan, it is generally believed that the dividends are to be determined at shareholders meetings, we should remember that many Japanese listed companies have been able to determine dividends by a resolution of the BOD based on the provisions of the AOI even before the recent coronavirus crisis. In the United States, it is common for the BOD to determine dividends. In the United Kingdom, dividend determination can be carried out by either the shareholders or the BOD, depending on the provisions in the AOI. Even in Germany, whose laws provide the authority to determine dividends to shareholders meetings, the BOD (including the supervisory board) assume authority to reserve up to half of the annual surplus as a voluntary reserve fund. As a matter of fact, currently, about 60% of Japanese listed companies can still determine dividends by a resolution of the BOD based on the provisions of AOI, and the number of such companies continues to grow. In this context, future issues regarding companies dividend distribution should be discussed.","output":"The Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on Annual Shareholders Meetings and Dividend Determination in Japanese Companies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health doctors of Korea contributed significantly to massive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing.

Saliva has been proposed as a minimally invasive specimen whose collection reduces the risks for health care personnel. Objective: To assess the suitability of saliva for COVID-19 diagnosis as a replacement of the reference standard NP/OP swab in the setting of a tertiary care pediatric unit. Study design: A paired study based in the prospective cohort design in patients suspected of having COVID-19. Methods: RT-PCR was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in paired samples of saliva and NP/OP swab collected from May through August 2020 from 156 pediatric participants, of whom 128 has at least one comorbidity and 91 showed clinical symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we studied a group of 326 members of the hospital staff, of whom 271 had symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: In the group of pediatric participants the sensitivity of the diagnostic test in saliva was 82.3% (95% CI 56.6C96.2) and the specificity 95.6% (95% CI 90.8C98.4). The prevalence of COVID-19 was 10.9% (17/156). In 6 of the 23 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in at least one specimen type, the virus was detected in saliva but not in NP/OP swab, while in 3 participants the NP/OP swab was positive and saliva negative.

Food supply can also be jeopardised by natural and man-made disasters, such as warfare, pandemics, or any other calamities which result in the destruction of crop fields and disruption of food distribution. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the impact of such calamities on the fresh food supply chain in Malaysia, especially when the Movement Control Order (MCO) policy was first implemented. The resulting panic buying caused some food shortage, while more importantly, the fresh food supply chain was severely disrupted, especially in urban areas, in the early stages of implementation. In this regard, urban farming, while a simple concept, can have a significant impact in terms of securing food sources for urban households. It has been used in several countries such as Canada, The Netherlands, and Singapore to ensure a continuous food supply. This paper thus attempted to review how the pandemic has affected Malaysian participation in urban farming and, in relation to that, the acceptance of urban farming in Malaysia and the initiatives and approaches of local governmental and non-governmental organisations in encouraging the urban community to participate in urban farming through peer-reviewed journal articles and other articles related to urban agriculture using the ROSES protocol. About 93 articles were selected after screening to ensure that the articles were related to the study. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the surge in Malaysians' awareness of the importance of urban farming has offered great opportunities for the government to encourage more Malaysian urban communities to participate in urban farming activities. Limitations such as relevant knowledge, area, and space, however, are impediments to urban communities' participation in these activities. Government initiatives, such as the Urban Community Garden Policy (Dasar Kebun Komuniti Bandar (DKKB)), are still inadequate as some issues are still not addressed. Permanent Food Production Parks (TKPM) and technology-driven practices are seen as possible solutions to the primary problem of land and space. Additionally, relevant stakeholders play a crucial role in disseminating relevant and appropriate knowledge and methodology applicable for urban farming. Partnerships between government agencies, the education sector, and the private sector are necessary to develop modern urban agricultural technologies as well as knowledge, knowhow, and supports to build and sustain urban community participation in urban farming activities.","output":"Ensuring Urban Food Security in Malaysia during the COVID-19 Pandemic-Is Urban Farming the Answer?

METHODS: We conducted a blind evaluation of five lateral-flow immunoassays (LFIA) and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant differences among ELISA kits and LFIAs for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG sensitivity (values ranging from 76.4% to 83.5%) and specificity (100% for the seven serological assays). For anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, the five LFIAs have a significantly higher sensitivity for samples collected 15 days after the first time RT-qPCR positive test, with values ranging from 47.1% to 88.2%; moreover, the specificity varied from 85% to 100%, but the only LFIA brand with a 100% specificity had the lowest sensitivity.

NS1 is also secreted, as a hexamer, to the extracellular milieu. Circulating NS1 has been associated with dengue pathogenesis by several mechanisms. Cell binding and internalization of soluble NS1 result in endothelial hyperpermeability and in the downregulation of the innate immune response. In this work, we report that the HDL scavenger receptor B1 (SRB1) in human hepatic cells and a scavenger receptor B1-like in mosquito C6/36 cells act as cell surface binding receptors for dengue virus NS1. The presence of the SRB1 on the plasma membrane of C6/36 cells, as well as in Huh7 cells, was demonstrated by confocal microscopy. The internalization of NS1 can be efficiently blocked by anti-SRB1 antibodies and previous incubation of the cells with HDL significantly reduces NS1 internalization. Significant reduction in NS1 internalization was observed in C6/36 cells transfected with siRNAs specific for SRB1. In addition, the transient expression of SRB1 in Vero cells, which lacks the receptor, allows NS1 internalization in these cells. Direct interaction between soluble NS1 and the SRB1 in Huh7 and C6/36 cells was demonstrated in situ by proximity ligation assays and in vitro by surface plasmon resonance. Finally, results are presented indicating that the SRB1 also acts as a cell receptor for Zika virus NS1. These results demonstrate that dengue virus NS1, a bona fide lipoprotein, usurps the HDL receptor for cell entry and offers explanations for the altered serum lipoprotein homeostasis observed in dengue patients. Importance Dengue is the most common viral disease transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The dengue virus NS1 is a multifunctional glycoprotein necessary for viral replication. NS1 is also secreted as a hexameric lipoprotein and circulates in high concentrations in the sera of patients. Circulating NS1 has been associated with dengue pathogenesis by several mechanisms, including favoring of virus replication in hepatocytes and dendritic cells and disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx leading to hyperpermeability. Those last actions require NS1 internalization. Here, we identify the scavenger cell receptor B1, as the cell-binding receptor for dengue and Zika virus NS1, in cultured liver and in mosquito cells. The results indicate that flavivirus NS1, a bona fide lipoprotein, usurps the human HDL receptor and may offer explanations for the alterations in serum lipoprotein homeostasis observed in dengue patients.","output":"The dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) uses the scavenger receptor B1 as a cell receptor in cultured cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Providing proper timely treatment of asthma, self-monitoring can play a vital role in disease control.

Three predictive models were developed: (a) regression models to predict lung function, (b) multi-class classification models to predict the severity, and (c) binary classification models to predict abnormality. Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Linear Regression (LR) algorithms were implemented to develop these predictive models. Training and test samples were separated (70%:30% using balanced portioning). Features were normalised and 10-fold cross-validation used to measure the model's training performances on the training samples. Models were then run on the test samples to measure the final performances. The RF based regression model performed better with lowest root mean square error = 10.86, and mean absolute score = 11.47, as compared to other models. In predicting the severity of lung function, the SVM based model performed better with 73.20% accuracy. The RF based model performed better in binary classification models for predicting abnormality of lung function (accuracy = 0.85, F1-score = 0.84, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88). The proposed machine learning approach can predict lung function (in terms of FEV1%), from the recorded voice files, better than other published approaches. These models can be extended to predict both the severity and abnormality of lung function with reasonable accuracies. This technique could be used to develop future telehealth solutions including smartphone-based applications which have potential to aid decision making and self-monitoring in asthma.","output":"Predicting pulmonary function from the analysis of voice: a machine learning approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a host receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The objective of this study was to determine if flavonoids and other polyphenols with B-ring 3,4-hydroxylation inhibit recombinant human (rh)ACE2 activity. rhACE2 activity was assessed with the fluorogenic substrate Mca-APK(Dnp). Polyphenols reduced rhACE2 activity by 15C66% at 10 M. Rutin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, tamarixetin, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid inhibited rhACE2 activity by 42C48%. Quercetin was the most potent rhACE2 inhibitor among the polyphenols tested, with an IC(50) of 4.48 M.

PT150 is a member of an extended platform of novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) modulating molecules. In vivo, their predominant net effect is one of systemic glucocorticoid antagonism, but they also show direct downregulation of AR and minor GR agonism at the cellular level. We hypothesize that anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity depends in part on this AR downregulation through diminished TMPRSS2 expression and modulation of ACE2 activity. Given that hypercortisolemia is now suggested to be a significant co-factor for COVID-19 progression, we also postulate an additive role for its potent immunomodulatory effects through systemic antagonism of cortisol.","output":"Clinical stage molecule PT150 is a modulator of glucocorticoid and androgen receptors with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a warning that, although the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from Wuhan City (China), is not pandemic, it should be contained to prevent the global spread. The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARS-CoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense.

Despite attempts to establish a guideline or triage system for evaluating ICU care needs, no clinically applicable paradigm is available. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict ICU care needs for pediatric pneumonia patients within 24 hours of admission, evaluate their performance, and identify clinical indices for making decisions for pediatric pneumonia patients. METHODS: Pneumonia patients admitted to National Taiwan University Hospital from January 2010 to December 2019 aged under 18 years were enrolled. Their underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, and laboratory data at admission were collected. The outcome of interest was ICU transfer within 24 hours of hospitalization. We compared clinically relevant features between early ICU transfer patients and patients without ICU care. ML algorithms were developed to predict ICU admission. The performance of the algorithms was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and average precision. The relative feature importance of the best-performing algorithm was compared with physician-rated feature importance for explainability. RESULTS: A total of 8464 pediatric hospitalizations due to pneumonia were recorded, and 1166 (1166/8464, 13.8%) hospitalized patients were transferred to the ICU within 24 hours. Early ICU transfer patients were younger (P<.001), had higher rates of underlying diseases (eg, cardiovascular, neuropsychological, and congenital anomaly/genetic disorders; P<.001), had abnormal laboratory data, had higher pulse rates (P<.001), had higher breath rates (P<.001), had lower oxygen saturation (P<.001), and had lower peak body temperature (P<.001) at admission than patients without ICU transfer. The random forest (RF) algorithm achieved the best performance (sensitivity 0.94, 95% CI 0.92-0.95; specificity 0.94, 95% CI 0.92-0.95; AUC 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-0.99; and average precision 0.93, 95% CI 0.90-0.96). The lowest systolic blood pressure and presence of cardiovascular and neuropsychological diseases ranked in the top 10 in both RF relative feature importance and clinician judgment. CONCLUSIONS: The ML approach could provide a clinically applicable triage algorithm and identify important clinical indices, such as age, underlying diseases, abnormal vital signs, and laboratory data for evaluating the need for intensive care in children with pneumonia.","output":"Evaluation of the Need for Intensive Care in Children With Pneumonia: Machine Learning Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using an autoencoder-based analysis to classify genomes of SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, we found a cluster consisting only of a specific genotype with two mutations in the helicase.

These changes include anosmia and dysgeusia. In some cases, these clinical manifestations appear even before the general flu-like symptoms, e.g., sore throat, thoracic oppression and fever. There is no direct report available on the loss of these chemical senses in obese COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, obesity has been shown to be associated with low ONS cues. These alterations in obese subjects are due to obesity-induced altered expression of olfacto-taste receptors. Besides, obesity may further aggravate the SARS-CoV-2 infection, as this pathology is associated with a high degree of inflammation/immunosuppression and reduced protection against viral infections. Hence, obesity represents a great risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it may hide the viral-associated altered ONS symptoms, thus leading to a high mortality rate in these subjects.","output":"Obesity and COVID-19: Oro-Naso-Sensory Perception"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to measures and restrictions taken by many governments around the world for preventing the spread of the Covid-19 virus and thus the pandemic, many higher education institutions have been closed for a long time.

Symmetric lenses compose to, of course, form new symmetric lenses. Symmetric lenses are usually represented as spans of asymmetric lenses. In many applications, the fact that a symmetric lens might also be represented as a cospan of asymmetric lenses is important, especially for implementation purposes. However, the composition of symmetric lenses does not preserve the property that the lenses can be represented by cospans -- two such symmetric lenses may (and frequently do) compose to form a symmetric lens which cannot be represented as a cospan of asymmetric lenses. Thus preserving the factorisation to show how cospans of asymmetric lenses might be used in implementations becomes important. In 2018, the first work on multilenses was begun. Multilenses can be represented as multi-spans of asymmetric lenses (often called 'wide spans', these are spans with an arbitrary finite number of legs). In this paper we analyse a small but realistic example of a supply chain in which the cospan representations would be 'composed away' by ordinary symmetric lens composition, and introduce a new kind of composition which we call 'fusion' in which two ordinary symmetric lenses (spans with two legs) fuse to form a multilens with three legs preserving the cospan representations, and more generally, two symmetric multilenses, spans with say m and n legs, fuse to form a symmetric multilens with m+n-1 legs, again preserving cospan representations.","output":"The more legs the merrier: A new composition for symmetric (multi-)lenses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The distribution of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) in Queensland is predicted to contract as a result of climate change, driven by the frequency, intensity and duration of heatwaves and drought.

This study aimed to establish the efficacy of surgically implanted thermal radio transmitters and data loggers to measure the body temperature of free-ranging koalas across a range of environmental conditions and ambient temperatures. Five free-ranging koalas in southeast Queensland were implanted with thermal transmitters and data loggers waxed together as a single package. Body temperatures were recorded for variable periods ranging from 3 to 12 months. Diurnal rhythms in body temperature were detected irrespective of season. The long-term diurnal body temperature peak for all koalas occurred between 16:00 and 17:00 h and body temperature was 36.7-36.9 C, the long-term nadir occurred between 07:00 and 08:00 h and body temperature was 35.4-35.7 C. Koala body temperatures as low as 34.2 C and as high as 39.0 C were recorded. Thermolability became apparent when ambient temperatures were outside the deduced thermal neutral zone for koalas (14.5-24.5 C): heat was accumulated during the day and dissipated during the cool of the night. While this study is the first to report on body temperature of free-ranging koalas in their normal behavioural context, further investigations are necessary to determine the physiological boundaries of the thermal niche for this species, in order to better equip models that will more accurately predict the impacts of climate change on koalas.","output":"Body temperature of free-ranging koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) in south-east Queensland."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reports an error in \\"Reflexoes baseadas na Psicologia sobre efeitos da pandemia COVID-19 no desenvolvimento infantil\\" [\\"Reflections based on Psychology about the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on child development] by Maria Beatriz Martins Linhares and Sonia Regina Fiorim Enumo (Estudos de Psicologia, 2020, Vol 37[e200089]) In the original article, there were some errors in the reference and citation on page 4 The corrected reference and citation are present in the erratum as: Muratori, P , & Ciacchini, R (2020) Children and the COVID-19 transition: psychological reflections and suggestions on adapting to the emergency Clinical Neuropsychiatry, 17(2), 131-134 https://doi org/10 36131/CN20200219 (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-44127-001) Unquestionably, the COVID-19 pandemic threatens the physical and mental health of the population nowadays In despite of the children are less contaminated in the symptomatic and severe way, these children could be more impacted in the psychological development, as they are a vulnerable population The present paper addresses the conceptual aspects of Chaos Theory in development and toxic stress, associated with the concepts of self-regulation and coping of stress, aiming to support reflections, from the psychological point of view, about the potential effects of the condition of adversity arising from the pandemic on child development and parenting The theoretical and conceptual framework supports the comprehension of the adaptive and not adaptive coping types facing the potentially traumatic adverse experience nowadays (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"\\"Reflexoes baseadas na Psicologia sobre efeitos da pandemia COVID-19 no desenvolvimento infantil\\": Erratum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-primate hepacivirus (NPHV) has been identified in dogs, horses, bats and wild rodents.

We describe epidemiology of PB and PE use following implementation of an Antibiotic Stewardship Program (ASP) in a 1300-bed, private, tertiary-care center in Southern India. METHODS: An ASP was established at Amrita Hospital in Feb 2016 consisting of an administrative champion, hospitalist, microbiologist, intensivist and 5 pharmacists. Institutional guidelines for polymyxins were established and disseminated. The ASP team performed daily post-prescriptive reviews, evaluated and tracked appropriateness of PB and PE use, including administration of a loading dose (LD), maintenance dose (MD), frequency, route and duration of therapy. ASP recommendations and compliance were recorded. RESULTS: During the 12-month study period (Feb 16-Jan 17), 348 patients received 295 PE and 94 PB courses. Mean age was 50 yrs and 73% were male. Patients on Medicine and Hematology/Oncology teams accounted for 42% of all prescriptions. The most common infections were bacteremia (34%), pneumonia (29%) and UTI (23%). Pathogens were recovered in 69% (269/389) of cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae 23% (90/389) and Acinetobacter baumanii11 % (45/389) were most common. 290 (75%) of polymyxin course were judged to be inappropriate (78% of PE and 22% of PB). The most frequent reasons for inappropriate therapy included incorrect frequency of administration (64% for PB and 58% for PE), inappropriate MD (60% for PB and 48% for PE) and wrong duration of therapy (54% for PE and 48% for PB). 95% of incorrect MD for both PE and PB were too low. The reasons for inappropriateness were similar for both polymyxins.While all inappropriate LD episodes for PB (n = 22 %) were due to lack of a LD, errors for PE (n = 34%) involved either omission of LD or administration of LD that was too low.ASP recommendations were made in 190 instances with 58% provider compliance.

A monoclonal antibody (MAb) (designated as 15E2) against the IBV M protein was prepared and a series of 14 partially-overlapping fragments of the IBV M gene were expressed with a GST tag. These peptides were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting analysis using MAb 15E2 to identify the epitope. A linear motif, (199)FATFVYAK(206), which was located at the C-terminus of the M protein, was identified by MAb 15E2. ELISA and western blotting also showed that this epitope could be recognized by IBV-positive serum from chicken. Given that 15E2 showed reactivity with the (199)FATFVYAK(206) motif, expressed as a GST fusion protein, in both western blotting and in an ELISA, we proposed that this motif represented a linear B-cell epitope of the M protein. The (199)FATFVYAK(206) motif was the minimal requirement for reactivity as demonstrated by analysis of the reactivity of 15E2 with several truncated peptides that were derived from the motif.

The isolated components were evaluated in vitro for radical scavenging potential using ABTS(?+) and DPPH test, anti-inflammatory activities for Cox-1 and Cox-2, and cytotoxicies against nine tumour cell lines (A549, BGC-823, CHG-5, HCT15, HeLa, HepG2, MDA-MB-231, SHG-44 and SGC-7901 cells). As a result, 4, 5 and 7C10 showed potent radical scavenging activities, while limonoids 1C4 and 11 exhibited significant anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic potential.","output":"Limonoids isolated from Toona sinensis and their radical scavenging, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic brought an unusual decrease in human activity associated with partial and total lockdowns. Simultaneously, a series of wildlife sightings-mainly in urban areas-have been brought to public attention and often attributed to lockdown measures. Here we report on a series of wild carnivore records, including threatened species, obtained through camera traps set in urban forests, campuses, suburbs, and peri-urban areas of two cities in Chile, during partial lockdown measures. Our records are novel for Chile, a country where urban carnivore ecology is mostly unknown, and include the detection of four native carnivores, including the vulnerable gi?a (Leopardus guigna) and the endangered southern river otter (Lontra provocax). These records also constitute a valuable baseline collected during partial lockdown measures in two cities of the Global South. We emphasize, however, that these findings cannot be used to argue for or against an effect of lockdown measures on wildlife. More generally, we call for caution in the interpretation of seemingly novel carnivore records during periods of lockdown and stress the value of international collaboration in evaluating the effects of the Anthropause on wildlife.","output":"Urban wildlife in times of COVID-19: What can we infer from novel carnivore records in urban areas?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To explore the effects of the respiratory rate (RR) on the venous-to-arterial CO(2) tension difference (gapCO(2)) in septic shock patients undergoing volume mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Adult patients with septic shock underwent volume mechanical ventilation between October 2015 and October 2016. RR was started at 10 breaths/min, and 2 breaths/min were added every 60 min until 16 breaths/min was reached. At every point, central venous and arterial blood gas measurements were obtained simultaneously. RESULTS: In this study, gapCO(2) induced by hyperventilation significantly increased, while the central venous carbon dioxide pressure (PvCO(2)) and the partial pressure of CO(2) (PaCO(2)) in arteries decreased. The decreasing trend of the PaCO(2) was more obvious than that of the PvCO(2). HCO(3)(?) and ctCO(2) were markedly decreased, when the RR was increased (P < 0.05). Central venous oxygen saturation (S(cv)O(2)) had a decreasing trend between 14 (77.1  8.3%) and 16 (75.2  8.7%) breaths/min; however, the difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: In septic patients undergoing ventilation, respiratory alkalosis induced by hyperventilation caused an increase in the gapCO(2). Clinicians should cautiously interpret the gapCO(2) in hemodynamically stable ventilated septic shock patients and its relationship with low cardiac output and inadequate perfusion.","output":"Effects of respiratory rate on venous-to-arterial CO(2) tension difference in septic shock patients undergoing volume mechanical ventilation"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(O,[["render",V]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/18.md","filePath":"doctor/18.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/18.md"},M=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{z as __pageData,M as default};
