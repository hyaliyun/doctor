The 10th edition of the International Diabetes Federation Atlas estimated incident cases in 2021 for 215 countries/territories (\\"countries\\"). METHODS Studies on T1D incidence for young people aged 0-19 years were sourced and graded using previously described methods. For countries without studies, data were extrapolated from similar nearby countries. RESULTS An estimated 108,300 children <15 years will be diagnosed in 2021, a number rising to 149,500 when the age range extends to <20 years. The ratio of incidence in 15-19 years compared to those aged 0-14 years was particularly high in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa/Middle East, and in Mexico. Only 97 countries have their own incidence data, with extrapolation required for some very populous nations. Most data published were not recent, with 27 countries (28%) having data in which the last study year was 2015 or afterwards, and 26 (27%) having no data after 1999. CONCLUSIONS Many countries have recent data but there are large gaps globally. Such data are critical for allocation of resources, teaching, training, and advocacy.

This translation and cross-cultural adaptation was performed in eight stages: initial translations, reconciliation of translations and cultural adaptation, back translation, appraisal of back translations, validation of the translation, review and adjustment by reconciliation committee, pretesting in 12 football players and document finalisation. As an alternative to the problematic Months In Reverse Order Test (MIROT) in Arabic, the Serial 3s test (32 Arabic and 30 English participants), the Days of the Week Backwards test (DWBT), and the Adding Serial 3s test were tested (30 English and 30 Arabic participants) for accuracy, difficulty and time of completion. The Arabic SCAT5 was similar and comparable to the original English version (7-point Likert scales =< 2). Testing of the pre-final version of the Arabic SCAT5 took 20.4 (SD 3.4) and 17.7 (SD 3.0) minutes respectively to complete and was found acceptable in terms of clarity, understandability, grammatical correctness and coherence. The Arabic Serial 3s test (subtraction version) was unsuitable due to high completion time, low pass rate and high difficulty perception [time = 47.2 (SD 28.0) s; accuracy = 55.2%; difficulty = 3.2 (SD 1.1)].

The mechanism analysis shows that the accelerated divergence in wages and the decelerated convergence in business income were the major drivers, which also led to decelerated convergence in rural per capita consumption. Although epidemics have not threatened rural food consumption and the Engel coefficient of rural households, these two indicators of basic living needs have failed to achieve convergence across regions.

The objective of the study was to estimate the genetic variability within EHV-5 viruses circulating among horses in Poland. Partial glycoprotein B (gB) sequences from 92 Polish horses from 13 studs throughout Poland were compared to each other and to three EHV-5 sequences from other countries. Despite the overall high level of conservation, considerable variability was observed around the putative furin cleavage site. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the viruses clustered within two major lineages (A and B), with further sub-clustering within group A. The clustering of EHV-5 sequences was independent of age or geographical origin of the sampled horses. Recombination was identified as one of the factors contributing to the genomic heterogeneity. Viruses from unweaned foals were more similar to viruses from other foals at the same stud than to viruses form their dams, suggesting the horizontal transfer and/or evolution of EHV-5 within individual hosts. Our data indicate that the gB sequence is not suitable for tracking the source of EHV-5 infection.

In addition to mutations in structural Spike glycoprotein, rapid accumulation of mutations across non-structural genes is leading to continuous virus evolution, altering its pathogenicity. We performed whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected from different clinical groups from eastern India, during the second pandemic wave (April-May, 2021). In addition to the several common spike mutations in Delta variant, two mutually explicit signature constellations of non-spike co-appearing mutations were identified, driving symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. We attempted to correlate these unique signatures of non-Spike co-appearing mutations to COVID-19 disease outcome. Results revealed that the Delta strains harboring a unique constellation of 9 non-spike co-appearing mutations could be the wheeler and dealer of symptomatic infection, even post vaccination. The strains predominantly driving asymptomatic infection possessed 7 non-spike co-appearing mutations, which were mutually exclusive in contrast to the set of mutations causing symptomatic disease. Phylodynamic analysis depicted high probability of emergence of these unique sub-clusters within India, with subsequent spread worldwide. Interestingly, some mutations of this signature were selected in Omicron and IHU variants, which suggest that gradual accumulation of such co-existing mutations may lead to emergence of more vaccine-evading variants in future. Hence, unfaltering genome sequencing and tracking of non-Spike mutations might be significant in formulation of any future vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that might evade the current vaccine-induced immunity.","output":"Evolution of Delta variant by non-Spike signature co-appearing mutations: trailblazer of COVID-19 disease outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper deals with the recognition of selected burning liquids by convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

This study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictive factors of anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder among EVD survivors, approximately 2 years after discharge from the Ebola treatment centre (ETC). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study between May and August 2017 among 197 adults Ebola survivors in Bombali district, Northern Sierra Leone. We collected information about demographics, mental health status and possible predictive factors. The HAD scale was used to measure anxiety and depression. PTSD was measured using the PTSD-checklist (PCL). Chi-square test or Fisher exact two-tailed tests were used to test for associations and the multiple logistic regressions model to determine factors that were independently associated with the outcome variables. RESULTS: The mean anxiety, depression and PTSD scores were (5.0  3.9), (7.1  3.8) and (39.5  6.4) respectively. Based on cut-off scores, the prevalence of anxiety (HADs score  8), depression (HADs score  8) and PTSD (PCL  45) among Ebola survivors were (n = 49, 24.9%), (n = 93, 47.2%) and (n = 43, 21.8%) respectively. Older Ebola survivors (30 years) were more likely to show symptoms of depression (AOR = 8.5, 95% CI: 2.68C27.01, p = 0.001) and anxiety (AOR = 3.04; 95%CI: 1.2C7.7, p = 0.019) compared to younger ones (< 30 years). In addition, Ebola survivors who experienced a decreased level of exercise post-ETC discharge were more likely to show symptoms of depression (AOR = 2.63; 95%CI: 1.25C5.54, p = 0.011) and anxiety (AOR = 3.60; 95%CI: 1.33C9.72, p = 0.012) compared to those whose exercise remained the same post-ETC discharge. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that anxiety, depression and PTSD are common among the Ebola survivors in Bombali district, Northern Sierra Leone, and that underscores the need to diagnose and manage mental health morbidities among Ebola survivors long after their recovery from Ebola virus disease.

We present a two-stage iterative algorithm that first solves initial conflict by manipulating their speed and heading control and then identifying each aircraft's optimal time to recover its trajectory towards their nominal. The avoidance stage extends existing mixed-integer programming formulations, and for the recovery stage, we propose a novel mixed-integer formulation. We assume that speed and heading control are continuous variables for this approach while the recovery time is treated as a discrete variable. In this approach, it is shown that the trajectory recovery costs can be anticipated by inducing avoidance trajectories with higher deviation, therefore obtaining earlier recovery time within few iterations.

We applied this testing algorithm to 4360 samples ED patients obtained in the springs of 2020 and 2021. Using multinomial logistic regression, we determined factors associated with infection and vaccination. RESULTS: For the algorithm, sensitivity and specificity for identifying vaccinated individuals was 100% and 99%, respectively, and 84% and 100% for naturally infected individuals. Among the ED subjects, seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 increased from 2% to 24% between April 2020 and March 2021. Vaccination prevalence rose to 11% by mid-March 2021. Marked differences in burden of disease and vaccination coverage were seen by sex, race, and ethnicity.

Hence, early surveillance and public health emergency disposal are considered crucial to curb this emerging infectious disease. However, studies that investigated the early surveillance and public health emergency disposal for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China are relatively few. We aimed to compare the strengths and weaknesses of early surveillance and public health emergency disposal for prevention and control between COVID-19 and H7N9 avian influenza, which was commended by the international community, in China. Methods: A case-comparison study was conducted using a set of six key time nodes to form a reference framework for evaluating early surveillance and public health emergency disposal between H7N9 avian influenza (2013) in Shanghai, China and COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Findings: A report to the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China, for the first hospitalized patient was sent after 6 and 20 days for H7N9 avian influenza and COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the pathogen was identified faster in the case of COVID-19 than in the case of H7N9 avian influenza (12 days vs. 31 days). The government response regarding COVID-19 was 10 days later than that regarding avian influenza. The entire process of early surveillance and public health emergency disposal lasted 5 days longer in COVID-19 than in H7N9 avian influenza (46 days vs. 41 days). Conclusions: The identification of the unknown pathogen improved in China between the outbreaks of avian influenza and COVID-19.

Hence, this systematic review aimed to describe what is known about the decline of childhood invasive pneumococcal disease post-introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Africa. METHODS This systematic review included articles published between 2009 and 2018 on the implementation of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Africa. We searched PubMed, Scopus and African Index Medicus for articles in English. Studies on implementation programmes of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 10/13, with before and after data from different African countries, were considered eligible. The review followed the procedures published in PROSPERO (ID = CRD42016049192). RESULTS In total, 2,280 studies were identified through electronic database research, and only 8 studies were eligible for inclusion in the final analysis. Approximately half (n = 3) of these studies were from South Africa. The overall decline in invasive pneumococcal disease ranged from 31.7 to 80.1%. Invasive pneumococcal diseases caused by vaccine serotypes declined significantly, the decline ranged from 35.0 to 92.0%. A much higher decline (55.0-89.0%) was found in children below 24 months of age. Of all vaccine serotypes, the relative proportions of serotypes 1, 5 and 19A doubled following vaccine roll out. INTERPRETATION Following the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, a significant decline was observed in invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes. However, data on the effectiveness in this region remain scarce, meriting continued surveillance to assess the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination to improve protection against invasive pneumococcal disease.","output":"Effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines against invasive pneumococcal disease among children under five years of age in Africa: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemic of COVID-19 has become a major public health challenge globally. There are concerns that an increased number of individuals who abuse substances could encounter greater risks of experiencing the effects of COVID-19. The present paper reviews the potential health risks that can be associated with using the commonly abused stimulant plant, khat and associated substances during the COVID-19 pandemic. The literature indicates that khat chewing, as practiced by most chewers, can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission and spread. Chewers with compromised health due to khat could be at greater risks of being affected by COVID-19, and these effects may include worsening of respiratory, cardiovascular, CNS, renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, hemostatic and immune dysfunctions. Furthermore, tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking in association with khat use has the potential to intensify most of these disorders. The review suggests that healthcare providers and khat chewers should take appropriate precautionary measures when khat and/or the associated substances are used during COVID-19 epidemic. The research community should also conduct further studies to provide additional and more specific information on the topic. ? 2021, CRISA Publications.","output":"Use of Khat and Associated Substances during Covid-19 Pandemic: Potential Adverse Consequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to appraisal theory, individuals cope with perceived threats in different ways. If engaging in problem-focused coping, for example, they may seek information useful for eliminating the root cause of the threat. However, during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, people tend to navigate complex information environments marked by high levels of uncertainty. In such contexts, individuals may adopt maladaptive behavioursfor instance, avoiding information or switching to pseudo-epistemic copingin which they engage with non-scientific explanations. As a consequence, they may learn less from their information environment and become susceptible to conspiracy theories. Against that background, we investigated how threat perceptions relate to learning, believing in conspiracy claims and conspiracy thinking in context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing from two-wave panel data, we found that threat perceptions negatively related to learning and positively related to believing conspiracy claims. Taken together, our findings indicate that high levels of threat perceptions in uncertain information environments may impede societal learning and encourage conspiracy beliefs. Thus, although provoking general anxiety may support short-term political goals, including adherence to policy during crises, accumulated threat perceptions may adversely affect citizens motivation to cooperate in the long term.","output":"How Threat Perceptions Relate to Learning and Conspiracy Beliefs About COVID-19: Evidence From a Panel Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To assess perceived deficiencies of reproductive endocrinology and infertility (REI) fellow education due to changes in care secondary to COVID-19. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study performed in an academic setting. A survey was generated and administered to REI fellows and attendings practicing in programs across the United States. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify results regarding clinical volume, academic responsibilities, clinical safety, and fellowship education. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 23%. Eighty-four percent of respondents self-identified as fellows, and 16% identified as program directors or other REI academic instructors. Overall, the survey responses confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic tremendously affected clinical volume, with 91% of participants reporting their clinical volume decreased by at least half. Although 67% of attendings believed that the changes related to COVID-19 have or will have significantly affected the clinical skills of fellows, 66% of fellows did not believe that their clinical training had been significantly impacted. Sixty-seven percent of fellows and 78% of attendings do not believe that changes related to COVID-19 will affect the ability of fellows to practice independently. CONCLUSION: Even though most attendings surveyed believed that the changes related to COVID-19 would affect the clinical skills of fellows, the cessation of clinical and research activities was short-lived, likely tempering the overall effect on clinical training.

METHODS: The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe-COVID-19 was used, collecting information from the beginning of June 2020 to August 2020 about individuals state of health and the care they received. Several probit regression models were used to analyze the differences in the probability of (1) being sad or depressed, (2) being anxious or nervous, (3) having difficulty sleeping, and (4) feeling lonely, between individuals who provided informal care and individuals who did not. Several subanalyses by geographic area, mortality rates due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and long-term care expenditure were also performed. RESULTS: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, informal caregivers have had a higher probability of being sad or depressed of 8 percentage points (p.p.), a 7.1 p.p. higher probability of being anxious or nervous, and a 5.9 p.p. higher probability of having difficulty sleeping than non-caregivers. Informal caregivers in Southern Europe have had an 8 p.p. higher probability of being sad or depressed than non-caregivers. In Eastern Europe, this difference in probability reaches 9.7 p.p. Finally, in countries with higher mortality rates due to COVID-19, there have been greater differences in terms of being sad or depressed between caregivers and non-caregivers, regardless of expenditure on long-term care.

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 630 children <5years with ARI. Clinical diagnosis and disease severity were also recorded. Samples were analysed by multiplex PCR for 18 viral and atypical bacterial pathogens; RV positive samples underwent partial sequencing to determine species and type. RESULTS: RV was the fourth commonest pathogen accounting for 18.7% of pathogens detected. RV was commonly detected in children with bronchiolitis, pneumonia and asthma/episodic viral wheeze (EVW). Species and type were assigned in 112 cases (73% RV-A; 27% RV-C; 0% RV-B). Generally, there were no differences in clinical or demographic characteristics between those infected with RV-A and RV-C. However, in children with asthma/EVW, RV-C was detected relatively more frequently than RV-A (23% vs 5%; p=0.04).

METHODS Residential Care Homes for the Elderly in Hong Kong were selected by stratified single-stage cluster random sampling. All residents aged 65 years or above from the recruited homes were surveyed. Infections were identified using standardised definitions. Demographic and health information-including medical history, immunisation record, antibiotic use, and activities of daily living (as measured by Barthel Index)-was collected by a survey team to determine any associated factors. RESULTS Data were collected from 3857 residents in 46 Residential Care Homes for the Elderly from February to May 2014. A total of 105 residents had at least one type of infection based on the survey definition. The overall prevalence of all infections was 2.7% (95% confidence interval, 2.2%-3.4%). The three most common infections were of the respiratory tract (1.3%; 95% confidence interval, 0.9%-1.9%), skin and soft tissue (0.7%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5%-1.0%), and urinary tract (0.5%; 95% confidence interval, 0.3%-0.9%).

METHODS: We compared relevant time metrics between patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and/or endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) before and after the declared restrictions and state of emergency imposed in our region (March 17, 2020). RESULTS: We identified a significant increase in the median door-to-CT times for patients receiving intravenous tPA (19 min, interquartile range (IQR): 14-27 min vs. 13 min, IQR: 9-17 min, p = 0.008) and/or EVT (20 min, IQR: 15-33 min vs. 11 min, IQR: 5-20 min, p = 0.035) after the start of social and healthcare restrictions in our region compared to the previous 12 months. For patients receiving intravenous tPA treatment, we also found a significant increase (p = 0.005) in the median door-to-needle time (61 min, IQR: 46-72 min vs. 37 min, IQR: 30-50 min). No delays in the time from symptom onset to hospital presentation were uncovered for patients receiving tPA and/or endovascular reperfusion treatments in the first 1.5 months after the establishment of regional and institutional restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: We detected an increase in our institutional time to treatment metrics for acute ischemic stroke patients receiving tPA and/or endovascular reperfusion therapies, related to delays from hospital presentation to the acquisition of cranial CT imaging for both tPA- and EVT-treated patients, and an added delay to treatment with tPA.","output":"In-Hospital Delays for Acute Stroke Treatment Delivery During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to provide information on changes in mental health among disadvantaged immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa in the Greater Paris area and their level of information about Covid-19.

The validity of continuous deterministic models is questionable because they fail to incorporate two important characteristics of human society: high clustering and low degree of separation. A small-world network model is used to study the spread of COVID-19, thus providing more reliable information to provide guidance to mitigate it. Optimal timing of lockdown and reopening society is investigated so that intervention measures to combat COVID-19 can work more efficiently. Several important findings are listed as follows: travel restrictions should be implemented as soon as possible; if flattening the curve is the purpose of the interventions, measures to reduce community transmission need not be very strict so that the lockdown can be sustainable; the fraction of the population that is susceptible, rather than the levels of daily new cases and deaths, is a better criterion to decide when to reopen society; and society can be safely reopened when the susceptible population is still as high as 70%, given that the basic reproduction number is 2.5. Results from small-world network models can be significantly different than those from continuous deterministic models, and the differences are mainly due to a major shortfall intrinsically embedded in the continuous deterministic models. As such, small-world network models provide meaningful improvements over continuous deterministic models and therefore should be used in the mathematical modeling of infection spread to guide the present COVID-19 interventions. For future epidemics, the present framework of mathematical modeling can be a better alternative to continuous deterministic models.","output":"Mitigating COVID-19 on a small-world network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed severe stress on healthcare systems worldwide, which is amplified by the critical shortage of COVID-19 tests.

The resurgence of pertussis in high-income countries is partly due to waning vaccine immunity, resulting in a pool of unprotected adolescents and adults. However, pertussis is generally less severe in adolescents and adults, and this difference in presentation means it can often be unrecognised by healthcare professionals, meaning that it is largely under-diagnosed in older populations. A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and BIOSIS was undertaken to identify studies published between 1 January 1990 and 17 June 2019, with information on pertussis epidemiology and mortality in school-aged children, adolescents and adults in Europe. A formal statistical comparison (e.g. using meta-analyses) was not possible because of the mix of methodologies reported. There were 69 epidemiological studies and 19 mortality studies identified for review. Over the past decade, the reported incidence of notified pertussis cases varied widely between European countries, which is likely associated with differences in surveillance systems, diagnostic techniques and reporting regulations. However, several studies show that pertussis is circulating among adolescents and adults in Europe, and although pertussis-related morbidity and mortality are highest in infants, there is evidence that adults aged > 50 years are at increased risk. For example, in a hospital-based surveillance study in Portugal, between 2000 and 2015, 94% of hospitalised pertussis cases were infants aged < 1 year, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.8%; however, among hospitalised adult cases of pertussis, the CFRs were 11.5% (aged 18C64 years) and 17.4% (aged > 65 years). Very few European countries currently include pertussis boosters for adults in the national immunisation strategy. In addition to increasing pertussis vaccination coverage in adolescents and adults, mitigation strategies in European countries should include improved diagnosis and treatment in these populations.

These disruptions resulted in a significant increase in parental responsibility for childcare. Such a substantial increase in time requirements for childcare domestically has potential mental health consequences. We therefore ascertained the relationship between childcare and depression in South Africa during the pandemic. METHODS: Data came from the National Income Dynamics Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey, a longitudinal telephonic survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. The outcome was a depression index obtained from the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire while the main covariate was the average number of hours spent in taking care of children per weekday. We employed the ordered logit model. FINDINGS: We found a positive relationship between spending more hours on childcare and worse depressive health for caregivers in both periods analyzed. Childcare responsibilities preventing/mitigating the ability of caregivers to work as well as preventing caregivers from searching for jobs moderated the depression-childcare relationship.

Using programmatic and electronic health record data we describe the implementation and initial utilization. RESULTS: Through collaboration across multi-disciplinary teams and strategic planning, four telehealth program initiatives have been deployed in response to COVID-19: virtual urgent care screening, remote patient monitoring for COVID-19 positive patients, continuous virtual monitoring to reduce workforce risk and utilization of personal protective equipment, and the transition of outpatient care to telehealth. Biomedical Informatics was integral to our institutional response in supporting clinical care through new and reconfigured technologies. Through linking the telehealth systems and the electronic health record, we have the ability to monitor and track patients through a continuum of COVID-19 services. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has facilitated the rapid expansion and utilization of telehealth and health informatics services. We anticipate that patients and providers will view enhanced telehealth services as an essential aspect of the healthcare system. Continuation of telehealth payment models at federal and private levels will be a key factor in whether this new uptake is sustained.

HLA alleles have been reported to be involved in response to viral infections such as SARS-CoV2. Our study reviews the HLA alleles associated with protection or susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 and the prevalence of these HLA alleles in South America. Previous studies on HLA and SARS-CoV2 infection reported that HLA-A*02:02, HLA-B*15:03, and HLA-C*12:03 are protective; while HLA-A*25:01, HLA-B*46:01, and HLA-C*01:02 increase susceptibility. We identified that these alleles are not frequent in South America, confirmed that the spike protein is the most immunogenic protein of SARS-CoV2, and detected new immunogenic epitopes that bound to protective HLA alleles and to HLA alleles common in South America (binding score > 0.90). These could be used as vaccine targets.","output":"Risk HLA alleles in South America and potential new epitopes for SARS-CoV2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemics and pandemics of a few infectious diseases during the past couple of decades have accentuated the significance of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) due to their influence on public health. Although Asia region has been identified as the epicentre of many EIDs and upcoming infections, several new pathogens have also emerged in the past in other parts of the world. Furthermore, the emergence of new viral diseases/infections, such as Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, SARS coronavirus, Hendra virus, avian influenza A (H5N1), Nipah virus, Zika virus and swine influenza A (H1N1) virus, from time to time is a glaring example threatening adversely both animal and public health globally. Infectious diseases are dynamic and concerning due to their epidemiology and aetiological agents, which is manifested within a host, pathogen and environment continuum involving domestic animals, wildlife and human populations. The complex relationship among host populations and other environmental factors creates conditions for the emergence of diseases. The factors driving the emergence of different emerging infectious disease (EID) interfaces include global travel, urbanisation and biomedical manipulations for human EIDs; agricultural intensification for domestic animal EIDs; translocation for wildlife EIDs; human encroachment, ex situ contact and ecological manipulation for wildlifeChuman EIDs; encroachment, new introductions and spill-over and spill-back; and technology and industry for domestic animalChuman EIDs. The concepts of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and biosecurity have gained recognition globally in almost all the realms of human activities, including livestock health and production management.

SETTINGS: A rural setting of Nepal. PARTICIPANTS: Data collection included five video recordings, five key informant interviews and observation notes from a final co-design workshop that involved a total of 68 stakeholders: persons with COPD and their family members; healthcare providers, including respiratory physicians; local community leaders; representatives from local, provincial and federal government; academics; and representatives from non-government organisations. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Feasibility and acceptability of using a co-design approach to develop an integrated model of care for people with multi-morbid COPD in rural Nepal. RESULTS: Our qualitative evaluation of the Hasso Plattners co-design process found that all stakeholders (including people with COPD/community members, primary care practitioners and local government/senior health officials) were actively engaged in and significantly contributed to the process of co-design. Four main themes were identified which determined the feasibility and acceptability of the resulting integrated model of care: engagement of stakeholders, factors contributing to the co-design, consequences of the co-design process, and challenges and opportunities learnt by the researchers and participants in the co-design process. Based on the relationship between the four main themes emerging from this research, we developed an evaluation framework to guide the co-design of a health service innovation. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the Hasso Plattners co-design process. Our findings suggest that this co-design approach can be useful and acceptable to local communities and government agencies. It enabled the meaningful contribution of a diverse group of stakeholders in the design and delivery of health services in low-income and middle-income countries.","output":"Evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of a co-design approach to developing an integrated model of care for people with multi-morbid COPD in rural Nepal: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Indonesian government has issued various policies to control COVID-19. However, COVID-19 new cases continued to increase and there remains uncertainties as to the future trajectory. We aimed to investigate how do medical and health academics view the Indonesian governments handling of the COVID-19 and which area of health systems that need to be prioritized to improve governments response to COVID-19. We conducted a modified Delphi study adapting the COVID-19 assessment score card (COVID-SCORE) as the measurement criteria. We invited medical and health academics from ten universities across Indonesia to take part in the Delphi study. In the first round, participants were presented with 20 statements of COVID-SCORE and asked to rate their agreement with each statement using five-point Likert scale. All participants who have completed the first cycle were invited to participate in the second cycle in which they had the opportunity to revise their answer based on results of previous cycle and to rank a priority of actions to improve government response. We achieved consensus for 5 statements, majority agreements for 13 statements and no consensus for 2 statements. The prioritization suggested that top priorities for improving governments response to COVID-19 in Indonesia, according to medical and health academics, encompass: (1) The authorities communicate clearly and consistently about COVID-19 and provide public health grounds for their decisions; (2) Everyone can get a free, reliable COVID-19 test quickly and receive the results promptly; (3) Contact tracing is implemented for positive cases; (4) Public health experts, government officials, and academic researchers agree on COVID-19 nomenclature and clearly explain the reasons for public health measures; and (5) Government communications target the entire diverse population.

How to objectively and quantitatively differentiate pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 virus remains clinical challenge. OBJECTIVE: To formulate standardized scoring criteria and an objective quantization standard to guide decision making in detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 virus induced pneumonia in clinical practice. METHODS: A retrospective dataset includes computed tomography (CT) images acquired from 43 pneumonia patients with COVID-19 virus detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and 49 pneumonia patients without COVID-19 virus. All patients were treated during the same time period in two hospitals. Key indicators of differential diagnosis were identified in relevant literature and the scores were quantified namely, patients with more than 8 points were identified as high risk, those with 6C8 points as moderate risk, and those with fewer than 6 points as low risk for COVID-19 virus. In the study, 3 radiologists determined the scores for all patients. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were subsequently calculated. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were determined as high risk, among which 42 were COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR tests. Next, 9 were identified as moderate risk, one of whom was COVID-19 positive. Last, 22 were classified into the low-risk group, all of them are COVID-19 negative. Based on these results, the sensitivity of detection COVID-19 positive cases between the high-risk group and the non-high-risk group was 0.98 with 95% confidence interval [0.88, 1.00], and the specificity was 0.61 [0.46, 0.75]. The detection sensitivity between the moderate-/high-risk group and the low-risk group was 1.00 [0.92, 1.00], and the specificity was 0.45 [0.31, 0.60]. CONCLUSION: The proposed quantitative scoring criteria showed high sensitivity and moderate specificity in detecting COVID-19 using CT images, which indicates that these criteria may be beneficial for screening in real-world practice and helpful for long-term disease control.","output":"Differentiating pneumonia with and without COVID-19 using chest CT images: from qualitative to quantitative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The upsurge of COVID-19 has caused numerous psycho-social challenges for healthcare professionals because of its ability to spread rapidly in the community and high mortality rate. The seriousness of the disease has led many healthcare professionals plagued by stigma as well as discrimination. In this study, depressive symptomatology, levels of anxiety, and related psychosocial and occupational factors experienced by healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka during COVID -19 were investigated. METHODS: A total of 512 healthcare professionals were surveyed using an online survey. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised-10, and psychosocial and occupational factors predictive of depression and anxiety were included in the survey questionnaire. Logistic regression determined the factors associated with the presence of depressive symptoms and anxiety. RESULTS: Results showed that elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were experienced by 53.3% and 51.3%, respectively, of the participants. No differences in the prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were found between those who were exposed and non-exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients. Having a fear of being infected with COVID-19 and spreading it among family members were associated with increased risk of depression. Among those exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients, poor occupational safety (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.25-3.39), stigmatization (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.29-3.72), and heavy workload (OR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.53-3.92) were associated with increased risk of elevated depressive symptoms, whilst poor self-confidence (OR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.56-4.09) and heavy workload (OR = 1.94. 95% CI 1.22-3.12) were associated with increased risk of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Fear of being infected and distress caused by fear of spreading it among family members, stigmatization, poor self-confidence, poor occupational safety and heavy workload are vital risk factors that need to be considered in future psychological support services designed for the healthcare professionals in unprecedented outbreaks like COVID-19.","output":"Psychological experiences of healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cumulative sum (CUSUM) plots and methods have wide-ranging applications in healthcare.

However, vaccine hesitancy by even a small subset of the population can undermine the success of this strategy. The objective of this research is to investigate the vaccine characteristics that matter the most to Australian citizens and to explore the potential uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine in Australia. Through a stated preference experiment, preferences towards a COVID-19 vaccine of 2136 residents of the Australian states and territories were collected and analysed via a latent class model. Results show that preferences for mild adverse cases, mode of administration, location of administration, price and effectiveness are heterogeneous. Conversely, preferences for immediacy and severe reactions are homogeneous, with respondents preferring a shorter period until vaccine is available and lower instances of severe side effects. The expected uptake of the vaccine is estimated under three different scenarios, with the value of 86% obtained for an average scenario.

Still, more than 50% of chronic liver disease cases are detected at later stages when patients exhibit episodes of liver decompensation.

In this perspective review, we summarize the main findings of studies that compared the breath of patients with chronic liver diseases against that of control subjects and found candidate biomarkers for a potential breath test. Interestingly, identified compounds with best classification performance are of exogenous origin and used as flavoring agents in food. Therefore, random dietary exposure of the general population to these compounds prevents the establishment of threshold levels for the identification of disease subjects. To overcome this limitation, we propose the exogenous volatile organic compounds (EVOCs) probe approach, where one or multiple of these flavoring agent(s) are administered at a standard dose and liver dysfunction associated with chronic liver diseases is evaluated as a washout of ingested compound(s).

The objective of this review was to compare the postoperative outcome after pancreatic enucleation versus standard resection. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched systematically until February 2015 to identify studies comparing the outcome of enucleation versus standard resection for pancreatic neoplasms. After critical appraisal, meta-analysis was performed and the findings were presented as odds ratios or weighted mean differences with corresponding 95 per cent c.i. RESULTS Twenty-two observational studies (1148 patients) were included. Duration of surgery (P < 0.001), blood loss (P < 0.001), length of hospital stay (P = 0.04), and postoperative endocrine (P < 0.001) and exocrine (P = 0.01) insufficiency were lower after enucleation than after standard resection. Mortality (P = 0.44), overall complications (P = 0.74), reoperation rate (P = 0.93) and delayed gastric emptying (P = 0.15) were not significantly different between the two approaches. The overall rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) was higher after enucleation than after standard resection (P < 0.001). However, the raised POPF rate did not result in higher mortality or overall morbidity. Sensitivity analysis of high-volume studies (total of more than 20 enucleations and more than 4 per year) showed that, in specialized centres, enucleation can be performed with no increased risk of POPF (P = 0.12). CONCLUSION Compared with standard resection, pancreatic enucleation can be performed effectively and with comparable safety in high-volume institutions.

Critiques of PPI being dominated by the usual suspects reflect concerns over the barriers to involvement in PPI faced by people from minority groups or non-professional backgrounds. Yet, what has received less attention is how undertaking PPI work might produce diverse experiences, potentially shaping the motivation and capacity of people from different backgrounds to continue in PPI. METHODS: We conducted qualitative research to explore experiences of the health research PPI field in the UK and to understand how these might shape the accessibility of PPI for people of diverse backgrounds. We conducted in-depth and follow-up interviews with five PPI contributors with experience of multiple health research projects, and a focus group with nine people in professional roles relating to PPI. Interview data were analysed using a narrative approach, and then combined with the focus group data for thematic analysis. RESULTS: The structure, organisation and relationships of health research in the UK all shape PPI experiences in ways that can intersect the different backgrounds and identities of contributors, and can pose barriers to involvement and motivation for some. Navigating processes for claiming expenses can be frustrating particularly for people from lower-income backgrounds or with additional needs, and short-term research can undermine relationships of trust between contributors and professionals. Pressure on PPI coordinators to find more diverse contributors can also undermine ongoing relationships with contributors, and how their inputs are valued. CONCLUSIONS: To increase diversity within PPI, and to ensure that people of different backgrounds are supported and motivated to continue in PPI, changes are needed in the wider health research infrastructure in the UK. More resources are required to support relationships of trust over time between contributors and professionals, and to ensure the unique circumstances of each contributor are accommodated within and across PPI roles.

RESULTS: From July 20 to October 28, 2020, 767 patients were enrolled, of which 735 had evaluable samples. Their mean (SD) age was 46.8 (16.6) years, and 422 (57.4%) were women. A total of 623 (84.8%) patients had COVID\\\\19 symptoms, most commonly shortness of breath (n = 404; 55.0%), cough (n = 314; 42.7%), and fever (n = 253; 34.4%). Although 460 (62.6%) had symptoms 7 days, the mean (SD) time since symptom onset was 8.1 (14.0) days. Positive tests occurred in 173 (23.5%) and 141 (19.2%) with the gold standard versus BinaxNOW test, respectively. Those with symptoms >2 weeks had a positive test rate roughly half of those with earlier presentations. In patients with symptoms 7 days, the sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values for the BinaxNOW test were 84.6%, 98.5%, 94.9%, and 95.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The BinaxNOW point\\\\of\\\\care test has good sensitivity and excellent specificity for the detection of COVID\\\\19. We recommend using the BinasNOW for patients with symptoms up to 2 weeks.","output":"Utility of COVID\\\\19 antigen testing in the emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a rural district of South India, six months after the index case. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 509 adults aged more than 18 years. From all the four subdistricts, two grampanchayats (administrative cluster of 5-8 villages) were randomly selected followed by one village through convenience. The participants were invited for the study to the community-based study kiosk set up in all the eight villages through village health committees. We collected socio-demographic characteristics and symptoms using a mobile application-based questionnaire, and we tested samples for the presence of IgG antibodies for SARS CoV-2 using an electro chemiluminescent immunoassay. We calculated age-gender adjusted and test performance adjusted seroprevalence. RESULTS: The age-and gender-adjusted seroprevalence was 8.5% (95% CI 6.9%- 10.8%). The unadjusted seroprevalence among participants with hypertension and diabetes was 16.3% (95% CI:9.2-25.8) and 10.7% (95% CI: 5.5-18.3) respectively. When we adjusted for the test performance, the seroprevalence was 6.1% (95% CI 4.02-8.17). The study estimated 7 (95% CI 1:4.5-1:9) undetected infected individuals for every RT-PCR confirmed case. Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) was calculated as 12.38 per 10000 infections as on 22 October 2020. History of self-reported symptoms and education were significantly associated with positive status (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of the rural population in a district of south India remains susceptible to COVID-19. A higher proportion of susceptible, relatively higher IFR and a poor tertiary healthcare network stress the importance of sustaining the public health measures and promoting early access to the vaccine are crucial to preserving the health of this population.

One of the reasons is AI's image processing technology. Since ophthalmology requires the processing of images of the eyes for different eye conditions, AI is playing a significant role in the field. It has allowed the growth of 'intelligent diagnosis' Through this study, a model will be proposed for the earliest detection of glaucoma using AI specifically Deep Learning (DL) and Virtual Reality (VR). This would help patients to begin treatment at the earliest stages to prevent complete loss of vision. The idea of designing this model as compared to more efficient yet complex techniques available in hospitals is because in the delay of glaucoma detection, precious time is lost and with it, irreparable damage is inflicted upon the eye. The diagnosis of glaucoma depends on the optic disc and surrounding retinal nerve fiber layer assessment performed by a trained professional. Therefore, the detection of glaucoma has always been limited in its economic value due to the precise skills required and its labor-intensive nature. Given the growing public health concern, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, improvements towards the field of screening and diagnosis of glaucoma are endorsed. The proposed methodology would consist of a VR environment for obtaining information required like maximum peripheral distance combined with various inputs that would be taken for the DL model, an efficient and precise diagnosis would be expected which would highly cut the cost of performing expensive eyes tests. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Application of deep learning and virtual reality in ophthalmology for detection of glaucoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and safety of performing laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) with conventional laparoscopic instruments.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization for three antivirals: remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir. Remdesivir and molnupiravir are nucleoside analogs that undergo biotransformation to form active metabolites that incorporate into new viral RNA to stall replication. Unlike remdesivir or molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir is a protease inhibitor that covalently binds to the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease to interrupt the viral replication cycle. A recent study identified that remdesivir and the active metabolite of molnupiravir, EIDD-1931, are substrates of equilibrative nucleoside transporters 1 and 2 (ENT1 and 2). Despite the ubiquitous expression of the ENTs, the preclinical efficacy of remdesivir and molnupiravir is not reflected in wide-scale SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials. Interestingly, downregulation of ENT1 and ENT2 expression has been shown in lung epithelial and endothelial cells in response to hypoxia and acute lung injury, although it has not been directly studied in patients with COVID-19. It is possible that the poor efficacy of remdesivir and molnupiravir in these patients may be partially attributed to the repression of ENTs in the lungs, but further studies are warranted. This study investigated the interaction between nirmatrelvir and the ENTs and found that it was a poor inhibitor of ENT-mediated [3 H]uridine uptake at 300 M. Unlike for remdesivir or EIDD-1931, ENT activity is unlikely to be a factor for nirmatrelvir disposition in humans; however, whether this contributes to the similar in vitro and clinical efficacy will require further mechanistic studies.","output":"PF-07321332 (Nirmatrelvir) does not interact with human ENT1 or ENT2: Implications for COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study argues the likely misallocation of capital in Pakistan associated with the perverse incentives faced by banking institutions to provide additional loans to weak businesses and households. Businesses and households are more likely to receive additional bank financing if they are financially constrained, because: (a) financial intermediaries in Pakistan have an incentive to allocate funds to weaker borrowers in order to avoid the realization of non-performing loans on their financial statements;and (b) the financial regulators relief package for commercial banks to sidestep deleveraging that will hamper economic growth arising from COVID-19 pandemic. This study hypothesizes that a potential ever-greening behavior would be more observable among financial institutions that have capital adequacy ratios close to regulatory minimum requirement;and the policy of forbearance on extending funds by banks will be compounded due to the existence of deposit insurance scheme. However, the evidence suggests that banking institutions in Pakistan have not adopted the policy of forbearance despite announcement of incentives by State Bank of Pakistan (the central bank) - commercial banks prefer to park their excess liquidity in government securities in the face of global pandemic.

The data analyzed are eighteen in-depth focused interviews that were conducted in February-March 2021 in seven out of eight federal districts of the Russian Federation. The interview guide included five sets of questions on the following topics: (1) preferred channels and genres of communication, and the motives of these preference;(2) the image of the crisis and the authorities during the crisis, and the factors that influenced these perceptions;(3) patterns of behavior during the pandemic and factors contributing to their formation;(4) evaluation of the effectiveness of official communications during the pandemic, and expectations related to the messages from authorities. The analysis revealed that Russian citizens demonstrate the behavior of a modern actor in such aspects as a tendency towards rational analysis of information, preference for discussive content, multi-channel information, and involvement in the global information space. With regard to public communications, it is argued that they do not provide space for discussions, do not take into account the analytical capabilities of the knowledge society actors, do not provoke the community involvement (in the exchange of information, social participation);their content is poorly focused on public interests and calls for personalization.

As a virus that transmits by respiratory droplets and aerosols, determining the duration of viable virus shedding from the respiratory tract is critical for patient prognosis, and informs infection control measures both within healthcare settings and the public domain. Methods We examined upper and lower airway respiratory secretions for both viral RNA and infectious virions in mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the intensive care unit of the University Hospital of Wales. Samples were taken from the oral cavity (saliva), oropharynx (sub-glottic aspirate), or lower respiratory tract (non-directed bronchoalveolar lavage (NBL) or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) and analyzed by both qPCR and plaque assay. Results 117 samples were obtained from 25 patients. qPCR showed extremely high rates of positivity across all sample types, however live virus was far more common in saliva (68%) than in BAL/NBAL (32%). Average titres of live virus were higher in subglottic aspirates (4.5x10^7) than in saliva (2.2x10^6) or BAL/NBAL (8.5x10^6), and reached >10^8 PFU/ml in some samples. The longest duration of shedding was 98 days, while the majority of patients (14/25) shed live virus for 20 days or longer. Conclusions Intensive care unit patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can shed high titres of virus both in the upper and lower respiratory tract, and tend to be prolonged shedders.

As a response, the United States shut down public gatherings and businesses in an effort to quarantine. This included the stopping of elective operations, which greatly affected plastic surgeons and their practices during the initial shutdown. OBJECTIVES: We aim to study the early impact of COVID-19 on the financial implications and practice patterns of plastic surgeons in the state of California during the initial shutdown of elective surgery and provide guidelines for effective management during future crises. METHODS: A 20-question survey was sent using Qualtrics XM software to 851 surgeon members of the California Society of Plastic Surgeons. The survey was open from May 13, 2020, to May 29, 2020. Standard statistical analysis was completed to compare private practice and nonprivate practice plastic surgeons. RESULTS: We had a total of 140 respondents to our survey for a 16.5% response rate. The majority (77.1%) of the respondents were in a private practice setting. Private practice plastic surgeons reported a higher financial impact with a 79% reduction in financial income compared with nonprivate practice plastic surgeons at a 37% reduction (P < 0.0001). Additionally, private practice plastic surgeons demonstrated a higher reduction in case volume and were more likely to lay off or furlough staff, close their practice, and apply for loans (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our survey study showed that private practice plastic surgeons in the state of California faced the most financial hardship during the early shutdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. It serves as a valuable snapshot in our economic history and depicts the heavy financial impact of the stopping of elective surgery.

Because wearing a mask mixes expired air with the subject's inspired air stream, the concentration of inspired carbon dioxide [CO2] is elevated, resulting in mild hypercapnia. Changes in the inspired gas mixture have been demonstrated to alter R2*-weighted Blood Oxygen Dependent (BOLD) contrast. In this study, we investigate a potential for face masking to alter BOLD contrast during a sensory-motor task designed to activate visual, auditory, and sensorimotor cortices in 8 subjects. We utilize a nasal cannula to supply air to the subject wearing a surgical mask in on-off blocks of 90s to displace expired CO2, while the subject performs the sensory-motor task. While only a small fraction (2.5%) of the sensory-motor task activation is related to nasal air modulation, a 30.0% change in gray matter BOLD signal baseline is found due to air modulation. Repeating the scan with mask removed produces a small subject-specific bias in BOLD baseline signal from nasal air supply, which may be due to cognitive influence of airflow or cannula-induced hypoxia. Measurements with capnography demonstrate wearing a mask induces an average increase in ETCO2 of 7.4%.

Psychological distress and mental well-being represent distinct dimensions of our mental health, and congruent changes in outcomes of distress and well-being do not necessarily co-occur within individuals. When testing intervention impact, it is therefore important to assess change in both outcomes at the individual level, rather than solely testing group differences in average scores at the group level. OBJECTIVE: This study set out to investigate the differential impact of an internet-based group mental health intervention on outcomes of positive mental health (ie, well-being, life satisfaction, resilience) and indicators of psychological distress (ie, depression, anxiety, stress). METHODS: A 5-week mental health intervention was delivered to 89 participants using the Zoom platform during 2020. Impact on outcomes of distress, well-being, and resilience was assessed at the start and end of the program with multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) and reliable change indices (RCIs) being used to determine program impact at the group and individual levels, respectively. RESULTS: The intervention significantly improved all mental health outcomes measured, (F(6,83)=5.60, P<.001; Wilks =.71; partial (2)=.29) showing small to moderate effect sizes on individual outcomes. The largest effect sizes were observed for life satisfaction and overall well-being ((2)=.22 and (2)=.2, respectively). Larger effect sizes were noted for those with problematic mental health scores at baseline. A total of 92% (82/89) of participants demonstrated reliable change in at least one mental health outcome. Differential response patterns using RCI revealed that more than one-half of the participants showed improvement in both mental well-being and psychological distress, over one-quarter in outcomes of well-being only, and almost one-fifth in distress only.

Initial treatment with romosozumab followed by an antiresorptive resulted in larger increases in bone mineral density of both hip and spine compared with the reverse sequence. INTRODUCTION Teriparatide followed by an antiresorptive increases bone mineral density (BMD) more than using an antiresorptive first. To evaluate whether treatment sequence affects romosozumab response, we reviewed randomized clinical trials where romosozumab was administered before (ARCH, FRAME) or following (STRUCTURE, Phase 2 extension) an antiresorptive (alendronate or denosumab, respectively). METHODS We evaluated BMD percentage change for total hip (TH) and lumbar spine (LS) and response rates (BMD gains  3% and  6%) at years 1 and 2 (except STRUCTURE with only 1-year data available). RESULTS With 1-year romosozumab initial therapy in ARCH and FRAME, TH BMD increased 6.2% and 6.0%, and LS BMD increased 13.7% and 13.1%, respectively. When romosozumab was administered for 1 year after alendronate (STRUCTURE) or denosumab (Phase 2 extension), TH BMD increased 2.9% and 0.9%, respectively, and LS BMD increased 9.8% and 5.3%, respectively. Over 2 years, TH and LS BMD increased 7.1% and 15.2% with romosozumab/alendronate, 8.5% and 16.6% with romosozumab/denosumab, and 3.8% and 11.5% with denosumab/romosozumab, respectively. A greater proportion of patients achieved BMD gains  6% when romosozumab was used first, particularly for TH, versus the reverse sequence (69% after romosozumab/denosumab; 15% after denosumab/romosozumab). CONCLUSION In this study, larger mean BMD increases and greater BMD responder rates were achieved when romosozumab was used before, versus after, an antiresorptive agent.

The per-position amino acid frequencies and Shannon entropies of the coding sequences were calculated for each month, and a map of intrinsic disorder regions and binding sites was generated. The analysis revealed dominant variants, most of which were located in loop regions and on the surface of the proteins. Mutation entropy decreased between March and April of 2020 after steady increases at several sites, including the D614G mutation site of the spike (S) protein that was previously found associated with higher case fatality rates and at sites of the NSP 12 polymerase and the NSP13 helicase proteins.

The regions spanning these mutations exhibited significant intrinsic disorder, which was enhanced and decreased by the N-protein and viroporin 3a protein mutations, respectively. These results predict an ongoing mutational shift from the spike and replication complex to other regions, especially to encoded molecules known to represent major -interferon antagonists. The study provides valuable information for therapeutics and vaccine design, as well as insight into mutation tendencies that could facilitate preventive control.","output":"New Pathways of Mutational Change in SARS-CoV-2 Proteomes Involve Regions of Intrinsic Disorder Important for Virus Replication and Release"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We perform interface-resolved simulations of finite-size evaporating droplets in weakly-compressible homogeneous shear turbulence (HST). The study is conducted by varying three dimensionless physical parameters: the initial gas temperature over the critical temperature $T_{g,0}/T_c$, the initial droplet diameter over the Kolmogorov scale $d_0/\\\\eta$ and the surface tension, i.e. the shear-based Weber number, $We_{\\\\mathcal{S}}$. For the smallest $We_{\\\\mathcal{S}}$, we first discuss the impact on the evaporation rate of the three thermodynamic models employed to evaluate the gas thermophysical properties: a constant property model and two variable-properties approaches where either the gas density or all the gas properties are allowed to vary. Taking this last approach as reference, the model assuming constant gas properties and evaluated with the\\"1/3\\"rule, is shown to predict the evaporation rate better than the model where the only variable property is the gas density. Moreover, we observe that the well-known Fr\\\\\\"ossling/Ranz-Marshall correlation underpredicts the Sherwood number at low temperatures, $T_{g,0}/T_c=0.75$. Next, we show that the ratio between the actual evaporation rate in turbulence and the one computed in stagnant condition is always much higher than one for weakly deformable droplets: it decreases with $T_{g,0}/T_c$ without approaching unity at the highest $T_{g,0}/T_c$ considered. This suggests an evaporation enhancement due to turbulence also in conditions typical of combustion applications. Finally, we examine the overall evaporation rate and the local interfacial mass-flux at higher $We_{\\\\mathcal{S}}$, showing a positive correlation between evaporation rate and interfacial curvature, especially at the lowest $T_{g,0}/T_c$.","output":"Finite-size evaporating droplets in weakly compressible homogeneous shear turbulence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus pneumonia that first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has attracted great attention from both the Chinese government and the international community The International Committee on Viral Classification named the virus &amp;quot;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2&amp;quot;(SARS-CoV-2), and the WHO named the pneumonia it causes &amp;quot;Coronavirus Disease 2019&amp;quot;(COVID-19) At present, the disease is centered in Wuhan City and is spreading rapidly to all parts of China, as well as twenty other countries About 20% of the people infected during the SARS epidemic in 2003 were employees in hospital environments COVID-19 has infected an even greater number of heath care workers Therefore, ophthalmologists need to understand the disease and recognize the importance of taking preventive measures Although ophthalmologists do not work on the front lines of the outbreak, due to their area of expertise, a variety of situations, such as infection consultations or ophthalmic emergency treatments, can lead to the exposure of ophthalmologists to high-risk environments This risk will only increase as the number of infected patients continues to increase When dealing with seemingly normal ophthalmic patients, the vigilance of ophthalmologists and associated staff tends to be significantly reduced To better protect patients, families, and health care workers, it is strongly recommended that in addition to the standard precautions for the care of all patients, strict contact precautions and droplet precautions need to be taken by ophthalmologists These measures include 1) wearing an efficient mask (an N95 mask);2) always performing hand hygiene before and after examining a patient;(3) wearing sterile gloves when entering a patients room and touching a patient;(4) wearing a gown when contact is expected with items and environmental surfaces surrounding a patient or when the patient is incontinent or has diarrhea or a surgical or other invasive wound with oozing fluid;5) cleaning and disinfecting ophthalmic equipment and correctly handling medical waste after examination to prevent transmission to patients who are subsequently examined;6) wearing goggles and a disposable mask to cover the front and sides of the face before touching a patient, as the virus could spread through the ocular surface;7) performing the relevant screening for novel coronavirus pneumonia for regular patients who have conjunctivitis and respiratory symptoms at the same time;8) prohibiting the use of infected patients as potential donors for corneal transplants and temporarily adding donor SARS-CoV-2 screening to the medical standard of the eye bank during the outbreak;and 9) for the purposes of scientific research, diagnosis, and other special needs, packing, shipping, and transporting collected specimens according to the relevant dangerous biological goods regulations","output":"How Ophthalmologists Should Understand and Respond to the Current Epidemic of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

While something new and positive can be created to replace international service-learning, the changes required to do so are so fundamental that the result will be something completely different from the way that international service-learning is conducted today.

Understanding the genetic diversity of Map in Australia will assist epidemiological studies for tracking disease transmission and identify subtype characteristics for use in development of improved diagnostic typing methods. Here we investigated the phylogenetic relationships of 351 Map isolates and compared different subtyping methods to assess their suitability for use in diagnostics and accuracy. RESULTS: SNP-based phylogenetic analysis of 228 Australian isolates and 123 publicly available international isolates grouped Type S and Type C strains into two distinct lineages. Type C strains were highly monomorphic with only 20 SNP differences separating them. Type S strains, when aligned separately to the Telford strain, fell into two distinct clades: The first clade contained seven international isolates while the second clade contained one international isolate from Scotland and all 59 Australian isolates. The Australian Type B strain clustered with US bison strains. IS1311 PCR and Restriction Enzyme Analysis (REA) intermittently generated incorrect results when compared to Long Sequence Polymorphism (LSP) analysis, whole genome SNP-based phylogenetic analysis, IS1311 sequence alignment and average nucleotide identity (ANI). These alternative methods generated consistent Map typing results. A published SNP based assay for genotyping Map was found to be unsuitable for differentiating between Australian and international strain types of Map. CONCLUSION: This is the first phylogenetic analysis of Australian Map isolates. The Type C lineage was highly monomorphic, and the Type S lineage clustered all Australian isolates into one clade with a single Scottish sheep strain. The Australian isolate classified as Type B by IS1311 PCR and REA is likely to be descended from bison and most closely related to US bison strains.

In contrast to expectancy-value theories, the Prototype Willingness Model (PWM) is well-suited for investigating novel and socially informed behaviors. PURPOSE: We explored whether PWM social cognitions predicted coronavirus prevention behaviors. METHOD: A representative sample of United States adults (N = 738; M(age) = 46.8; 51.8% women; 78% white; April 2020) who had not had COVID-19 reported PWM predictor variables (perceived vulnerability, prevention descriptive norms, prototypes engaging in prevention behavior, and prevention behavioral intentions). Two weeks later, participants reported their prevention behaviors (handwashing, mask-wearing, social distancing, etc.) and future public health behavioral willingness (contact tracing, temperature checks, etc.). RESULTS: Controlling for putative demographic, past behavior, and coronavirus-contextual (e.g., local infection rates) covariates, mediation models indicated that higher norms and favorable prototypes were associated with greater prevention behavioral intentions, which in turn predicted increased prevention behavior, F(18, 705) = 92.20, p < .001, R(2) = .70. Higher norms and favorable prototypes associated both directly and indirectly (through greater prevention behavioral intention) with greater willingness to engage in emerging public health behaviors, F(15, 715) = 21.49, p < .001, R(2) = .31. CONCLUSIONS: Greater descriptive norms and favorable prototypes for prevention behavior predicted: (a) future prevention behaviors through increases in behavioral intentions and (b) willingness to participate in emerging public health behaviors. These results held across demographic groups, political affiliation, and severity of regional outbreaks.

Herein, we make the first large-scale report of the safety and efficacy of apixaban (Eliquis) for thrombus prevention following bariatric surgery. PURPOSE To evaluate the safety and efficacy of apixaban following bariatric surgery. SETTING Three private institutes, USA. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from 5017 consecutive bariatric patients that were placed on postoperative apixaban for thromboprophylaxis were used for retrospective analysis. The dose prescribed to patients was 2.5 mg PO BID for a total of 30 days starting on day 3 postoperatively. RESULTS In total, of the 5017 patients, 59.7%, 31.2%, 4.4%, 2.5%, 1.8%, and 0.1% of the patients had undergone sleeve gastrectomy (SG), single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with SG (SADI-S), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), conversion from SG to SADI, small bowel reconstruction, and RYGB reversal, respectively. The 30-day follow-up rate was 95.3%. In total, 1.7% of patients experienced apixaban-related side effects. The most common side effects were menorrhagia and rash. Two (0.03%) side effects developed into Clavien-Dindo grade II complications. Overall, 10 (0.1%) patients experienced thromboembolic complications (five (0.09%) PVTs and five (0.09%) PEs). In each case, the protocol was not followed for extenuating circumstances. There were no deaths or thromboembolic events in cases where the protocol was able to be fully followed. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, 30 days of postoperative apixaban appears to be safe and effective with minimal side effects while preventing thromboembolic events.","output":"The Safety and Efficacy of Apixaban (Eliquis) in 5017 Post-bariatric Patients with 95.3% Follow-up: a Multicenter Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Education has become one of the fundamental necessities of human life beside food, shelter, clothing, etc. Aims and objectives of any society can be achieved through the proper education of its people.

Total IgG, IgA and IgM serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis were conducted, following PRISMA guidelines. Univariate and multivariate methods were used to analyze data. Out of a total of 100 consecutive patients, 53 were women, the median of age was 49 years (IQR: 37.8C55.3), the median of post-COVID time after the first symptoms was 219 days (IQR: 143C258), and 65 patients were hospitalized during acute COVID-19. Musculoskeletal, digestive (i.e., diarrhea) and neurological symptoms including depression (by Zung scale) were the most frequent observed in PCS patients. A previous hospitalization was not associated with PCS manifestation. Arthralgia and diarrhea persisted in more than 40% of PCS patients. The median of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 866.2 U/mL (IQR: 238.2C1681). Despite this variability, 98 patients were seropositive.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 215 patients attending a single tertiary center to assess their interest in teleophthalmology. Comparisons between those interested and those not interested were conducted; logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of price on interest. RESULTS: Two thirds (66.5%) of patients were interested in teleophthalmology instead of in-person clinic visits. Those interested were significantly younger than uninterested patients (48.822.7 vs 62.418.3 years) and were more likely to miss work to attend clinic, own both a computer and smartphone, have experience with video conferencing, and use the internet frequently (all P<0.05). Interested patients were also more likely to indicate time and cost savings, as well as improved follow-up testing, compared to uninterested patients (both P<0.001). Overall, 70.4% of interested patients expressed WTP out-of-pocket for teleservices, especially at low (<$14 US dollars) and moderate-high (>$28) price points. Higher level of education was associated with WTP (OR=2.31, 95% CI 1.05C5.06; P=0.037). CONCLUSION: Most patients were interested in teleophthalmology services, especially if they were young, would otherwise miss work, and were familiar with electronics, video conferencing, and internet use.

It only targets a single class of interest, and there are 8,072 and 8,749 polygons extracted, whilst the planting areas of Panax notoginseng are estimated as 35.45 and 32.47 square kilometers achieved by SVM and ANN, respectively. Meanwhile, special concerns raised in terms of remote sensing mapping for modeling planting patterns and monitoring plant rotations of perennial Panax notoginseng cultivated under shade-net structures based on the experiments. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Remote Sensing Image Classification for Spatial Information Extraction of Panax notoginseng Fields"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging information on the interactions between the COVID-19 pandemic and global food systems has highlighted how the pandemic is accentuating food crises across Africa. Less clear, however, are how the impacts differ between farming systems. Drawing on 50 key informant interviews with farmers, village leaders and extension officers, in South Africa and Tanzania, we identify the effects of COVID-19 and associated measures to curb the spread of the disease on farming production systems, the coping mechanisms adopted by farmers, and explore their longer-term plans for adaptation. We focus on a diverse range of production systems, from small-scale mixed farming systems in Tanzania, to large-scale corporate farms in South Africa. Our findings highlight how COVID-19 restrictions have interrupted the supply chains of agricultural inputs and commodities, increasing the storage time for produce, decreasing income and purchasing power, and reducing labour availability. Farmersresponses were heterogeneous, with highly diverse small-scale farming systems and those less engaged with international markets least affected by the associated COVID-19 measures. Large-scale farmers were most able to access capital to buffer short-term impacts, whereas smaller-scale farms shared labour, diversified to subsistence produce and sold assets. However, compounded shocks, such as recent extreme climate events, limited the available coping options, particularly for smaller-scale and emerging farmers. The study highlights the need to understand the characteristics of farm systems to better equip and support farmers, particularly in contexts of uncertainty. We propose that policy actions should focus on (i) providing temporary relief and social support and protection to financially vulnerable stakeholders, (ii) job assurance for farmworkers, and engaging an alternative workforce in farming, (iii) investing in farming infrastructure, such as storage facilities, digital communication tools, and extension services, and iv) supporting diversified agroecological farming systems.","output":"Impacts of COVID-19 on Diverse Farm Systems in Tanzania and South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, are considered a vulnerable group to experience acute stress disorder (ASD) and subsequent psychological distress amid COVID\\\\19 pandemic. This study aims to establish the prevalence of acute stress disorder and predictors of psychological distress among Jordanian nurses. METHODS: A quantitative, cross\\\\sectional, descriptive and comparative design was used. Data was collected using a web\\\\based survey. A total of 448 Jordanian nurses (73% females) completed and returned the study questionnaire. RESULTS: The majority of nurses (64%) are experiencing ASD due to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and thus are at risk for PTSD predisposition. More than one third of nurses (41%) are also suffering significant psychological distress. Among our sample, age, ASD, and coping self\\\\efficacy significantly predicted psychological distress. More specifically, younger nurses are more prone to experience psychological distress than older ones. While higher scores on ASD showed more resultant psychological distress, coping self\\\\efficacy was a protective factor. CONCLUSION: Given that individuals who suffer from ASD are predisposed to PTSD, follow\\\\up with nurses to screen for PTSD and referral to appropriate psychological services is pivotal. Coping self\\\\efficacy is found to ameliorate the effect of psychological distress on nurses' traumatic experience. Such findings warrant intensive efforts from healthcare institutions to provide psychosocial support services for nurses and ongoing efforts to screen them for traumatic and psychological distress symptoms. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nursing leaders and managers are in the forefront of responding to the unique needs of their workforces during the COVID\\\\19 crisis. They need to implement stress\\\\reduction strategies for nurses through providing consecutive rest days, rotating allocations of complex patients, arranging support services, and being accessible to staff. They also need to ensure nurses personal safety through securing and providing personal safety measures and undertake briefings to ensure their staff's physical and mental well\\\\being, as well as providing referrals to appropriate psychological services.","output":"Acute Stress Disorder, Coping Self\\\\Efficacy, and Subsequent Psychological Distress among Nurses Amid COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forests have re-taken centre stage in global conversations about sustainability, climate and biodiversity. Here, we use a horizon scanning approach to identify five large-scale trends that are likely to have substantial medium- and long-term effects on forests and forest livelihoods: forest megadisturbances; changing rural demographics; the rise of the middle-class in low- and middle-income countries; increased availability, access and use of digital technologies; and large-scale infrastructure development. These trends represent human and environmental processes that are exceptionally large in geographical extent and magnitude, and difficult to reverse. They are creating new agricultural and urban frontiers, changing existing rural landscapes and practices, opening spaces for novel conservation priorities and facilitating an unprecedented development of monitoring and evaluation platforms that can be used by local communities, civil society organizations, governments and international donors. Understanding these larger-scale dynamics is key to support not only the critical role of forests in meeting livelihood aspirations locally, but also a range of other sustainability challenges more globally. We argue that a better understanding of these trends and the identification of levers for change requires that the research community not only continue to build on case studies that have dominated research efforts so far, but place a greater emphasis on causality and causal mechanisms, and generate a deeper understanding of how local, national and international geographical scales interact.","output":"Forest-linked livelihoods in a globalized world."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent decades, surgical techniques, new anticancer drugs' development, and radiation equipment have led to continuous improvements in cancer survival rates and quality of life of cancer survivors (CSs).

However, comprehensive studies regarding the contributions of single facets of executive functioning to movement control in older adults are still lacking. A battery of nine neuropsychological tasks was administered to n = 92 older adults in order to derive latent factors for inhibition, shifting, and updating by structural equation modeling. A bimanual task was used to assess complex motor control. A sample of n = 26 young adults served as a control group to verify age-related performance differences. In older adults, structural equation models revealed that performance on the most challenging condition of the complex motor task was best predicted by the updating factor and by general executive functioning performance.

The objective of this study was to quantify the frequency of barriers encountered by patients seeking to fill buprenorphine prescriptions from pharmacies in United States (US) counties with high opioid-related mortality. METHODS To characterize buprenorphine availability, we conducted a telephone audit (\\"secret shopper\\") study using a standardized script in two randomly selected pharmacies (one chain, one independent) in US counties reporting higher than average opioid overdose rates. Availability across pharmacy type (chain versus independent), county characteristics (rurality, region, overdose rate), and day of week were analyzed using univariate tests of categorical data. Independent predictors of buprenorphine availability were then identified using a multivariable binomial regression model. RESULTS Among 921 pharmacies contacted (467 chain, 454 independent), 73 % were in urban counties and 42 % were in Southern states. Of these pharmacies, 675 (73 %) reported being able to dispense buprenorphine. There were 183 (20 %) pharmacies that indicated they would not dispense buprenorphine. Independent pharmacies (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.59; 95 % CI 1.21-2.08) and pharmacies in Southern states (aPR 2.06; 95 % CI 1.43-2.97) were significantly more likely to restrict buprenorphine. CONCLUSIONS In US counties with high overdose mortality rates, one in five pharmacies indicated they would not dispense buprenorphine. Buprenorphine access limitations were more common among independent pharmacies and those in Southern states.

According to liver function, they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33). Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed. Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8% (33/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and albumin were significantly lower in ALT elevation group. The proportion of severe and critical patients in ALT elevation group was significantly higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed CRP 20 mg/L and lymphocyte count< 1.1*10^9/L were independently related to hepatic injury. Conclusions: Lymphopenia and CRP may serve as the risk factors related to hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19, which might be related to inflammatory cytokine storm in liver injury. Early detection and timely treatment of hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19 are necessary.","output":"Risk factors related to hepatic injury in patients with corona virus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) impacted Hong Kong in early January 2020 Quarantine and social distancing measures have been implemented to prevent disease spread Material and Method: Retrospective cohort study was carried out in our cluster to compare the acute appendicitis cases during pandemic period, January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, with the same period 1 year before Parameters including time of presentation, complicated appendicitis rate, operative time, post-operative complication rate, and total length of stay were compared and analysed Results: A total number of 348 patients (160 in the pre-COVID group versus 188 in the post-COVID group) were included There is no significant difference in basic demographics The time of presentation was significantly longer in March (3 75 days vs 1 56 days, P = 031) and June 2020 (3 02 days vs 1 88 days, P = 026) compared with the pre-COVID group, which correlate with the spike of local confirmed cases There was a significantly higher incidence of complicated appendicitis (67% vs 52%, P = 028) and post-operative complication rate (29% vs 7%, P = 042) in February post-COVID group compare with the pre-COVID group Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic period, more patients with acute appendicitis presented late to the hospital, with an increase in complicated appendicitis rate and post-operative complication rate ? 2020 College of Surgeons of Hong Kong","output":"Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on acute appendicitis in Hong Kong: Retrospective cohort study in a local cluster hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family consists of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that show potent antiviral capacity against a broad range of viruses.

However, an association study of IFITM1 polymorphisms with susceptibility to this infection has not been reported thus far. OBJECTIVE: To identify an association between the susceptibility to pandemic influenza A 2009 H1N1 virus infection and IFITM1 polymorphisms, we compared genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies of the IFITM1 gene between healthy controls and pandemic influenza A 2009 H1N1-infected patients. In addition, we investigated linkage disequilibrium (LD) by Haploview 4.2 and the binding ability of transcription factors according to IFITM1 polymorphism alleles by PROMO. Furthermore, we measured the LD value between the IFITM1 gene and the IFITM3 gene. RESULTS: We found 3 novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and did not find an association between IFITM1 SNPs and susceptibility to pandemic influenza A 2009 H1N1 virus infection. We found strong LD among IFITM1 SNPs but did not find a difference in the transcription factor-binding ability according to regulatory IFITM1 SNP alleles. In addition, we found strong LD between IFITM1 SNPs and IFITM3 SNPs.

Findings The research identified these seven challenges: health and safety on-site, economic cost, possible legal exposures, manpower availability, instability of the supply chain and subcontractors, and the uncertainty related to the constant and unpredictable evolution of the pandemic. The magnitude of each challenge was also found to differ depending on the size of the contractor, the rigor of local regulations and the sector where the contractor works. Research limitations/implications This research contributes to increasing understanding on the subject and provides an initial assessment framework, based on these seven parameters, so that contractors can analyse their weaknesses and plan specific priorities so that their companies can remain competitive, minimising the impact of COVID-19 and possible future waves.

OBJECTIVES: In this study we investigated whether the circulation of different respiratory virus infections in Austria, as assessed by the established respiratory virus surveillance system, is affected by these measures as well and may reflect the success of the lockdown in limiting respiratory virus transmission. STUDY DESIGN: Sentinel data obtained for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus cases were analyzed and compared between the season 2019/2020 and the five previous seasons. RESULTS: We observed a rapid and statistically significant reduction of cumulative cases for all these viruses within short time after the lockdown in March 2020, compared to previous seasons (each p < 0.001). Also, sentinel screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections was performed and a decrease of SARS-CoV-2 was seen after the lockdown. While for the seasonally occurring viruses as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus or human metapneumovirus the lockdown led to the end of the annual epidemics, a re-increase of rhinovirus infections was observed after liberalization of numerous lockdown measures.

While the disproportionate effect of the pandemic on women suggests that they would oppose burdensome quarantine measures, theories of gender differences in prosocial and communion attitudes indicate that women should be more likely to conform with public health measures designed to protect the most vulnerable. We test hypotheses about a gender gap in attitudes toward public health recommendations through an original, nationally representative survey implemented in Peru, one of the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, and the construction of a representative matched sample that allows us to make comparisons between women and men. We find that women are more likely than men to endorse lockdown measures and to support the continuation of a nationwide quarantine. We also find evidence of a gender gap in compliance with public health recommendations about avoiding crowded areas and social gatherings. Our findings have important policy implications.

Patients were randomly divided into two groups: group A (standard care group) and group B (M. vaccae in combination with standard care group). The primary outcome was the time interval from admission to viral RNA negative conversion (oropharyngeal swabs were used in this study). Secondary outcomes included chest computed tomography (CT), mortality, length of hospital stay, complications during treatment, and so on. Patients were followed up to 4 weeks after discharge (reexamination of viral RNA, chest CT, etc.). Results: Nucleic acid test negative conversion time in group B was shorter than that in group A (2.9 days [2.7-8.7] vs. 6.8 days [3.3-13.8]; p = 0.045). No death and no conversion to severe or critical cases were observed in both groups. Two weeks after discharge, neither \\"relapse\\" nor \\"return to positive\\" cases were found.

Detailed knowledge of the molecular biology of the infection is indispensable for understanding of the viral replication, host responses, and disease progression. We provide gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in three human cell lines (H1299, Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells), using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. Small RNA profiling showed strong expression of the immunity and inflammation-associated microRNA miRNA-155 upon infection with both viruses. SARS-CoV-2 elicited approximately two-fold higher stimulation of the interferon response compared to SARS-CoV in the permissive human epithelial cell line Calu-3, and induction of cytokines such as CXCL10 or IL6. Single cell RNA sequencing data showed that canonical interferon stimulated genes such as IFIT2 or OAS2 were broadly induced, whereas interferon beta (IFNB1) and lambda (IFNL1-4) were expressed only in a subset of infected cells. In addition, temporal resolution of transcriptional responses suggested interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) activities precede that of nuclear factor-B (NF-B).

Inhibition of the HSP90 charperone activity by Tanespimycin/17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) resulted in a reduction of viral replication, and of TNF and IL1B mRNA levels.

Five copies of early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1) binding elements were identified in the intron of HSV-1 ICP22 (infected cell protein No. 22) gene, leading to the hypothesis that Egr-1 binds to the viral genome and regulates the viral gene expression. Transient co-transfection assays indicated that Egr-1 negatively regulated the transcription of both full-length and intron-removed ICP22 promoters. The same assays also revealed that Egr-1 repressed ICP4 (infected cell protein No. 4) promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner but showed less inhibition when the intron was removed. Histone deacetylation was not involved in this regulation since histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A did not exhibit any effect on Egr-1-mediated repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Egr-1 reduced the binding of Sp1 to the promoters and that the co-repressor Nab2 (NGFI-A/EGR1-binding protein) was recruited to the proximity of ICP4 in the presence of Egr-1. These results suggested that the multifunctional transcription factor Egr-1 can repress HSV-1 immediate-early gene expression through the recruitment of co-repressor Nab2 and reduction of Sp1 occupancy, and thus may play a critical role in HSV-1 gene silencing during latency.","output":"Early Growth Response gene 1 (Egr-1) regulates HSV-1 ICP4 and ICP22 gene expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cryptosporidium, a protozoan parasite in the phylum Apicomplexa, is the etiological agent of cryptosporidiosis, an intestinal infection characterized by profuse watery diarrhea. Over 30 species of Cryptosporidium are recognized, some host specific whereas others infect a broader host range. Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum are the species most commonly associated with human infection; C. hominis is largely associated only with human infections, but C. parvum is also associated with infection in animals, especially young ruminants. In some regions, cryptosporidiosis is a serious veterinary problem, particularly for calves, and lambs. Many outbreaks of human cryptosporidiosis have been associated with zoonotic transmission following contact with infected animals. In Africa, where cryptosporidiosis is a major contributor to pediatric morbidity and mortality, evidence suggests transmission is principally anthroponotic. Given the frequent close contact between humans and animals in Africa, the apparent predominance of human-to-human transmission is both interesting and puzzling. In this article, after a brief text book introduction to the parasite, we consider in separate sections the different aspects of relevance to Cryptosporidium transmission in African countries, describing different aspects of the various species and subtypes in human and animal infections, considering livestock management practices in different African countries, and looking for any characteristic hot spots where zoonotic transmission has apparently occurred. Studies where transmission networks have been investigated are particularly relevant. Finally, in a separate section, we try to gather these different strands of evidence together in order to assess the reasons behind the apparent predominance of anthroponotic transmission in Africa. Reviewing the available evidence provides an opportunity to re-think transmission pathways, not only in Africa but also elsewhere, and also to pose questions. Does the predominance of human-to-human transmission in Africa reflect a relative absence of zoonotic C. parvum in African livestock? Are Africans less susceptible to zoonotic Cryptosporidium infection, perhaps resulting from early immunostimulation by C. hominis or due to inherent genetic traits? Is the African environmentin all its varietysimply more detrimental to oocyst survival? Will the so-called hypertransmissible subtypes, currently relatively rare in Africa, be introduced from Europe or elsewhere, and, if so, will they fade out or establish and spread? Our intention with this manuscript is not only to summarize and consolidate diverse data, thereby providing an overview of data gaps, but also to provide food for thought regarding transmission of a parasite that continues to have a considerable impact on both human and animal health.","output":"Cryptosporidium Infections in AfricaHow Important Is Zoonotic Transmission?

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease appeared, for the first time (December 2019), in China and has spread quickly worldwide causing a large number of deaths. Considering the global threat, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared, in March 2020, COVID-19 as a pandemic. Many studies suggest the great effect of the existing vaccines to protect against symptomatic cases of death by the COVID-19 virus. This paper, proposes to compare the main antigenic proteins sequences of the existing vaccines with Spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our choice of S protein is justified by the major role that plays it in the receptor recognition and membrane fusion process based on an intelligent system. Herein, we focus on finding a correlation between S protein and compulsory vaccines in the countries that have a less death number by COVID-19 virus. In this work, we have used a combination of coding methods, signal processing, and bioinformatic techniques with the goal to localize the similar patterns between the S gene of the SARS-Cov-2 genome and 14 investigated vaccines. Results A total of 8 similar sequences which have a size more than 6 amino acids were identified. Further, these comparisons propose that these segments can be implicated in the immune response against COVID-19, which may explain the wide variation by country in the severity of this viral threat. Conclusions Our in silico study suggests a possible protective effect of Poliovirus, HIB, Hepatitis B, PCV10, Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccines against COVID-19.","output":"Intelligent system based comparative analysis study of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antigenic proteins in different types of vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The absence of effective antiviral medications and vaccines increased the focus on non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors for mitigating against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To examine the current status of non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors practiced during the COVID-19 outbreak and factors affecting behavioral activities, we compared to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in Korea. METHODS: This was a serial cross-sectional population-based study in Korea with four surveys conducted on June 2 and 25, 2015 (MERS-CoV surveys), and February 4, and April 2, 2020 (COVID-19 surveys). Of 25,711 participants selected using random digit dialing numbers, 4,011 participants (aged  18 years) were successfully interviewed, for the 2020 COVID-19 (n = 2,002) and 2015 MERS-CoV (n = 2,009) epidemics were included. Participants were selected post-strati?cation by sex, age, and province. The total number of weighted cases in this survey equaled the total number of unweighted cases at the national level. We measured the levels of preventive behaviors (social distancing [avoiding physical contact with others]), and practicing transmission-reducing behaviors such as wearing face mask and handwashing. RESULTS: Between the surveys, respondents who reported practicing social distancing increased from 41.9%C58.2% (MERS-CoV) to 83.4%C92.3% (COVID-19). The response rate for the four surveys ranged between 13.7% and 17.7%. Practicing transmission-reducing behaviors (wearing face masks and handwashing) at least once during COVID-19 (78.8%, 80.2%) also increased compared to that during MERS-CoV (15.5%, 60.3%). The higher affective risk perception groups were more likely to practice transmission-reducing measures (adjusted odds ratio, 3.24C4.81; 95 confidence interval, 1.76C6.96) during both COVID-19 and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSION: The study findings suggest markedly increased proportions of non-pharmaceutical behavioral practices evenly across all subgroups during the two different novel virus outbreaks in Korea.

We compared continuous Normothermic Ex Vivo Kidney Perfusion (NEVKP) with hypothermic anoxic machine perfusion (HAMP) and static cold storage (SCS) in a porcine kidney autotransplantation model. METHODS Porcine kidneys were exposed to 30min of warm ischemia and then reimplanted following either 16hr of either SCS, HAMP (LifePort 1.0) or NEVKP prior to autotransplantation (n=5 per group). The contralateral kidney was removed. Animals were followed for 8 days. RESULTS Grafts preserved by NEVKP demonstrated improved function with more rapid recovery compared to HAMP and SCS (mean peak serum creatinine: 3.66+/-1.33mg/dl (postoperative day 1; POD1), 8.82+/-3.17mg/dl (POD2), and 12.90+/-2.19mg/dl (POD3), respectively). The NEVKP group demonstrated significantly increased creatinine clearance calculated on POD3 (63.6+/-19.0ml/min) compared to HAMP (13.5+/-10.3ml/min, p=0.001) and SCS (4.0+/-2.6ml/min,p=0.001). Histopathologic injury scores on POD8 were lower in both perfused groups (NEVKP and HAMP, score: 1-1.5) compared to SCS (score: 1-3, p=0.3), without reaching statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS NEVKP storage significantly improved early kidney function compared to both cold preservation strategies, although HAMP also demonstrates improvement over SCS.

Ketamine, an analgesic adjuvant with sympathomimetic properties, has been shown to improve perioperative pain management. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate whether low-dose ketamine, due to its intrinsic effect on the sino-atrial node, affects HRV and, therefore, interferes with ANI measurements. This pilot study included 20 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomies. Anesthesia and analgesia were maintained with sevoflurane and fentanyl respectively, in a standardized manner. Five minutes after intubation, 0.5 g kg(-1) of intravenous (i.v.) ketamine was administered.

Early and effective predictors of clinical outcomes are urgently needed to improve management of Covid-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether elevated D-dimer levels could predict mortality in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: Patients with laboratory confirmed Covid-19 were retrospective enrolled in Wuhan Asia General Hospital from January 12, 2020, to March 15, 2020. D-dimer levels on admission and death events were collected to calculate the optimum cutoff using receiver operating characteristic curves. According to the cutoff, the subjects were divided into two groups. Then the in-hospital mortality between two groups were compared to assess the predictive value of D-dimer level. RESULTS: A total of 343 eligible patients were enrolled in the study. The optimum cutoff value of D-dimer to predict in-hospital mortality was 2.0 g/mL with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 83.3%. There were 67 patients with D-dimer &#8805;2.0 g/mL, and 267 patients with D-dimer <2.0 g/mL on admission. 13 deaths occurred during hospitalization. Patients with D-dimer levels &#8805;2.0 g/mL had a higher incidence of mortality when comparing with those who with D-dimer levels <2.0 g/mL (12/67 vs 1/267, P < .001; hazard ratio, 51.5; 95% confidence interval, 12.9-206.7). CONCLUSIONS: D-dimer on admission greater than 2.0 g/mL (fourfold increase) could effectively predict in-hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19, which indicated D-dimer could be an early and helpful marker to improve management of Covid-19 patients.

The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains undefined, and whether specific inflammatory biomarker patterns can distinguish MIS-C from other hyperinflammatory syndromes, including Kawasaki disease and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether inflammatory biomarkers could be used to distinguish between these conditions. Methods: We studied a prospective cohort of patients with MIS-C and Kawasaki disease and an established cohort of patients with new-onset systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and MAS associated with systemic JIA (JIA-MAS), diagnosed according to established guidelines. The study was done at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (Cincinnati, OH, USA). Clinical and laboratory features as well as S100A8/A9, S100A12, interleukin (IL)-18, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9), and IL-6 concentrations were assessed by ELISA and compared using parametric and non-parametric tests and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Findings: Between April 30, 2019, and Dec 14, 2020, we enrolled 19 patients with MIS-C (median age 90 years [IQR 45-150]; eight [42%] girls and 11 [58%] boys) and nine patients with Kawasaki disease (median age 20 years [20-40]); seven [78%] girls and two [22%] boys). Patients with MIS-C and Kawasaki disease had similar S100 proteins and IL-18 concentrations but patients with MIS-C were distinguished by significantly higher median concentrations of the IFN?3-induced CXCL9 (1730 pg/mL [IQR 604-6300] vs 278 pg/mL [54-477]; p=0038). Stratifying patients with MIS-C by CXCL9 concentrations (high vs low) revealed differential severity of clinical and laboratory presentation. Compared with patients with MIS-C and low CXCL9 concentrations, more patients with high CXCL9 concentrations had acute kidney injury (six [60%] of ten vs none [0%] of five), altered mental status (four [40%] of ten vs none [0%] of five), shock (nine [90%] of ten vs two [40%] of five), and myocardial dysfunction (five [50%] of ten vs one [20%] of five); these patients also had higher concentrations of systemic inflammatory markers and increased severity of cytopenia and coagulopathy. By contrast, patients with MIS-C and low CXCL9 concentrations resembled patients with Kawasaki disease, including the frequency of coronary involvement. Elevated concentrations of S100A8/A9, S100A12, and IL-18 were also useful in distinguishing systemic JIA from Kawasaki disease with high sensitivity and specificity. Interpretation: Our findings show MIS-C is distinguishable from Kawasaki disease primarily by elevated CXCL9 concentrations. The stratification of patients with MIS-C by high or low CXCL9 concentrations provides support for MAS-like pathophysiology in patients with severe MIS-C, suggesting new approaches for diagnosis and management.

In recent weeks, however, the numbers of cases have increased substantially. There has a been a clustering of cases in February 2020 in this DGHS with a multi-ethnic population. About 45,000 children present to PED in a typical year. The rise and fall of COVID-19 in the first wave mirrored PIMS -TS cases and a similar pattern was noted in the second wave although the incidence of PIMS -TS shows a marked increase.ObjectivesThe focus of this descriptive study was to look at the clinical characteristics of children presenting with PIMS - TS in the second wave of the pandemic to a district general hospital and to highlight the clustering of cases in 2021.MethodsChildren confirmed to have PIMS-TS were identified, case notes, investigations and treatment were reviewed.ResultsA cluster of 13 children were diagnosed with PIMS -TS from 17th of January to the 28th of February. One child was diagnosed to have Kawasaki disease.6 children were diagnosed in the first two weeks of February 2021.The median age of patients was 6.2 years. In the first wave of the pandemic children of Afro Caribbean origin represented a significant proportion of children with PIMS-TS. In 2021, 4 children with PIMS- TS were Asian, 4 children were White and 5 were Afro Caribbean in origin. All children presented with fever of more than 3 days. 5 children presented with partial Kawasaki features, 9 presented with shock, 4 presented with gastrointestinal symptoms and rash, one with features suggestive of meningitis later diagnosed to have sigmoid sinus thrombosis. None of these children had co- morbidities. Maximum CRP ranged from 90 to 245. 9 children were transferred to PICU and all had good outcomes. Serology for COVID -19 antibodies was positive in 10 children and COVID -19 NPA -RT PCR was positive in 2.ConclusionsIt is likely that this clustering of cases of PIMS- TS is specific to a certain geographical area. The ethnicity of the population of children with PIMS -TS shows a difference compared to the first wave of the pandemic. There was a high incidence of COVID -19 in December 2020 in adult ED, there was also a higher incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in children. PIMS -TS which is a dysregulated response to SARS-CoV-2 could be a late response to increased prevalence and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in the second wave. The presentation of PIMS- TS is varied and heterogenous. A strategy of education and continuous updates with case based discussions and literature review was put in place. This was to inform frontline doctors and nurses in the trust and resulted in timely identification, treatment and referral of the children who presented with PIMS -TS. Good clinical examination, following APLS, NICE and RCPCH guidelines and discussion with a tertiary centres remained the cornerstones in the management of the children with PIMS-TS in ED.","output":"PIMS -TS an artful masquerader C variation in the incidence and characteristics in the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) induced Coronavirus Disease - 19 (COVID-19) cases have been increasing at an alarming rate (7.4 million positive cases as on June 11 2020), causing high mortality (4,17,956 deaths as on June 11 2020) and economic loss (a 3.2% shrink in global economy in 2020) across 212 countries globally. The clinical manifestations of this disease are pneumonia, lung injury, inflammation, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Currently, there is no vaccine or effective pharmacological agents available for the prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV2 infections. Moreover, development of a suitable vaccine is a challenging task due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and Th-2 immunopathology, which aggravates infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the emerging SARS-CoV-2 strain exhibits several distinct genomic and structural patterns compared to other coronavirus strains, making the development of a suitable vaccine even more difficult. Therefore, the identification of novel small molecule inhibitors (NSMIs) that can interfere with viral entry or viral propagation is of special interest and is vital in managing already infected cases. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by the binding of viral Spike proteins (S-protein) to human cells through a 2-step process, which involves Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS)-2. Therefore, the development of novel inhibitors of ACE2/TMPRSS2 is likely to be beneficial in combating SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the usage of ACE-2 inhibitors to block the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry requires additional studies as there are conflicting findings and severe health complications reported for these inhibitors in patients. Hence, the current interest is shifted toward the development of NSMIs, which includes natural antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to manage a SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is imperative to investigate the efficacy of existing antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2-mediated oxidative stress. Therefore, in this review, we have reviewed structural features of SARS-CoV-2 with special emphasis on key molecular targets and their known modulators that can be considered for the development of NSMIs.","output":"Strategies for Targeting SARS CoV-2: Small Molecule InhibitorsThe Current Status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and purpose Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) is challenging due to significant motion of gastrointestinal (GI) organs. The goal of our study was to quantify inter and intrafraction deformations and dose accumulation of upper GI organs in LAPC patients. Materials and methods Five LAPC patients undergoing five-fraction magnetic resonance-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) using abdominal compression and daily online plan adaptation to 50 Gy were analyzed. A pre-treatment, verification, and post-treatment MR imaging (MRI) for each of the five fractions (75 total) were used to calculate intra and interfraction motion. The MRIs were registered using Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) deformable image registration (DIR) method and total dose delivered to stomach_duodenum, small bowel (SB) and large bowel (LB) were accumulated. Deformations were quantified using gradient magnitude and Jacobian integral of the Deformation Vector Fields (DVF). Registration DVFs were geometrically assessed using Dice and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) between the deformed and physician's contours. Accumulated doses were then calculated from the DVFs. Results Median Dice and HD95 were: Stomach_duodenum (0.9, 1.0 mm), SB (0.9, 3.6 mm), and LB (0.9, 2.0 mm). Median (max) interfraction deformation for stomach_duodenum, SB and LB was 6.4 (25.8) mm, 7.9 (40.5) mm and 7.6 (35.9) mm. Median intrafraction deformation was 5.5 (22.6) mm, 8.2 (37.8) mm and 7.2 (26.5) mm. Accumulated doses for two patients exceeded institutional constraints for stomach_duodenum, one of whom experienced Grade1 acute and late abdominal toxicity. Conclusion LDDMM method indicates feasibility to measure large GI motion and accumulate dose. Further validation on larger cohort will allow quantitative dose accumulation to more reliably optimize online MRgRT.","output":"Inter- and intrafraction motion assessment and accumulated dose quantification of upper gastrointestinal organs during magnetic resonance-guided ablative radiation therapy of pancreas patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) epidemic has created an unprecedented medical and economic crisis all over the world. SARS-CoV-2 is found to have more contagious character as compared to MERS-CoV and is spreading in a very fast manner all around the globe. It has affected over 31 million people all over the world till date. This virus shares around 80% of genome similarity with SARS-CoV. In this perspective, we have explored three major targets namely; SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, and 3CL or Mpro Protease for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. These targets have attracted attention of the medicinal chemists working on computer-aided drug design in developing new small molecules that might inhibit these targets for combating COVID-19 disease. Moreover, we have compared the similarity of these target proteins with earlier reported coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We have observed that both the coronaviruses share around 80% similarity in their amino acid sequence. The key amino acid interactions which can play a crucial role in designing new small molecule inhibitors against COVID-19 have been reported in this perspective. Authors believe that this study will help the medicinal chemists to understand the key amino acids essential for interactions at the active site of target proteins in SARS-CoV-2, based on their similarity with earlier reported viruses.

Methods We retrospectively report on 1061 SARS-CoV-2 positive tested patients treated with HCQ (200 mg three times daily for ten days) + AZ (500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days) for at least three days. Outcomes were death, clinical worsening (transfer to ICU, and >10 day hospitalization) and viral shedding persistence (>10 days). Results A total of 1061 patients were included in this analysis (46.4% male, mean age 43.6 years C range 14C95 years). Good clinical outcome and virological cure were obtained in 973 patients within 10 days (91.7%). Prolonged viral carriage was observed in 47 patients (4.4%) and was associated to a higher viral load at diagnosis (p < .001) but viral culture was negative at day 10. All but one, were PCR-cleared at day 15. A poor clinical outcome (PClinO) was observed for 46 patients (4.3%) and 8 died (0.75%) (74C95 years old). All deaths resulted from respiratory failure and not from cardiac toxicity. Five patients are still hospitalized (98.7% of patients cured so far). PClinO was associated with older age (OR 1.11), severity at admission (OR 10.05) and low HCQ serum concentration. PClinO was independently associated with the use of selective beta-blocking agents and angiotensin II receptor blockers (p < .05). A total of 2.3% of patients reported mild adverse events (gastrointestinal or skin symptoms, headache, insomnia and transient blurred vision). Conclusion Administration of the HCQ+AZ combination before COVID-19 complications occur is safe and associated with very low fatality rate in patients.","output":"Full-length title: Early treatment of COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin: A retrospective analysis of 1061 cases in Marseille, France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heterogeneous immunoassays such as ELISA have become indispensable in modern bioanalysis, yet translation into point-of-care assays is hindered by their dependence on external calibration and multiple washing and incubation steps.

The consumption of isoflavonoids is increasing in the general population, especially due to the use of food supplements and a variety of isoflavonoid-rich foods. However, detailed studies on the vascular influence of individual pure isoflavonoids are mostly missing. For this study, 16 isoflavonoids were initially screened for their vasorelaxant properties on rat aortas.

They both induced an endothelium independent vascular relaxation, with EC50 below 6 and 17 M, respectively. Biochanin A, but not glycitein, was able to block the vasoconstriction caused by KCl, CaCl2, serotonin, and U46619 in a dose-dependent manner. Another series of experiments suggested that the major mechanism of action of biochanin A was the inhibition of L-type calcium channels. Moreover, biochanin A in relatively small concentrations (2a??-a??4 M) interfered with the cGMP, but not cAMP, pathway in isolated coronary arteries. These results indicate that some isoflavonoids, in particular biochanin A, are able to have vasodilatory effects in micromolar concentrations, which is of potential clinical interest for the management of cardiovascular pathologies.","output":"Biochanin A, the Most Potent of 16 Isoflavones, Induces Relaxation of the Coronary Artery Through the Calcium Channel and cGMP-dependent Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: currently the world suffers from community contamination of a new coronavirus (Sars-Cov-2), which has even resulted in the recognition of the pandemic state by the World Health Organization.

The model is fitted to the corresponding cumulative number of hospitalized individuals (active cases) reported by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), and parameterized using the least squares method. The basic reproduction number which measures the potential spread of COVID-19 in the population is computed using the next generation operator method. Further, Lyapunov function is constructed to investigate the stability of the model around a disease-free equilibrium point. It is shown that the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium if the basic reproduction number of the novel coronavirus transmission is less than one. Sensitivities of the model to changes in parameters are explored. It is revealed further that the basic reproduction number can be brought to a value less than one in Nigeria, if the current effective transmission rate of the disease can be reduced by 50%. Otherwise, the number of active cases may get up to 2.5% of the total estimated population. In addition, two time-dependent control variables, namely preventive and management measures, are considered to mitigate the damaging effects of the disease using Pontryagin's maximum principle.

Here, we report an image-based multicycle infection procedure with -coronavirus hCoV 229E-eGFP in an arrayed chemical library screen of 5440 clinical and preclinical compounds. Toxicity counterselection and challenge with the -coronaviruses OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 in tissue culture and human airway epithelial explant cultures (HAEEC) identified four FDA-approved compounds with oral availability. Methylene blue (MB, used for the treatment of methemoglobinemia), Mycophenolic acid (MPA, used in organ transplantion) and the anti-fungal agent Posaconazole (POS) had the broadest anti-CoV spectrum. They inhibited the shedding of SARS CoV 2 and variants-of-concern (alpha, beta, gamma) from HAEEC in either pre- or post exposure regimens at clinically relevant dosage. Co-treatment of cultured cells with MB and the FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 RNA-polymerase inhibitor Remdesivir reduced the effective anti-viral dosage of MB by 2-fold, and Remdesivir by 4 to 10-fold, indicated by BLISS independence syner-gy modelling. Neither MB, MPA or POS affected the cell delivery of SARS-CoV-2 or OC43 (+)sense RNA, but blocked subsequent viral RNA accumulation in cells. Unlike Remdesivir, MB, MPA or POS did not reduce the release of viral RNA in post exposure regimen, thus indicating infection inhibition at a post-replicating step as well. In summary, the data emphasize the power of unbiased, full cycle compound screens to identify and repurpose broadly acting drugs against coronaviruses.Funding Information: We acknowledge financial support from the Swiss National Science foundation (SNSF) to UFG and GT (31CA30_196177 / 1), the NCCR Chemical Biology supported by the SNSF for purchasing the BSF-EPFL repurposing collection, and a special Coronavirus Research grant from the University of Zurich to UFG.

The responsibility of healthcare-associated infection control professionals (ICPs) is to prevent and control the nosocomial infections. The mental health status of ICPs deserves more attention, however, the correlational research is still lacking. This study aims to investigate the incidence and risk factors of mental health status among ICPs in China during the outbreak of COVID-19. A national cross-sectional survey was performed. The online questionnaire was completed by 9228 ICPs from 3776 hospitals throughout China. Data collection tools were used, including demographics data questionnaire, the Chinese version of the 12-item general health questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the Chinese version of the psychological capital questionnaire (PCQ) for medical staff. Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted. The total score of mental health of Chinese ICPs was 3.45  2.57. 5608 (60.77%) ICPs might have mental health problems. The psychological capital was in the upper-middle level with an average score of 3.72  0.38. An increased mental health problem risk was associated with the greater self-efficacy and working in the public hospital; a significantly lower risk was obtained by working in the second-class hospital rather than in the third-class hospitals. Besides, mental health problem risk of ICPs working in hospitals of the western economic region or northeast economic region was more significant than that in hospitals of the central economic region. However, a lower risk was caused by the unmarried than married, and working years in department 1 year contributed to the lower risk than that >20 years. Moreover, fewer working hours per week, higher values of hope, and optimism each were contributed to a lower risk. Chinese healthcare-associated ICPs were under different levels of mental health problems in fighting against COVID-19. More importantly, we should actively deal with the mental health problem of ICPs and help them get rid of psychological disorders.","output":"Mental health status among Chinese healthcare-associated infection control professionals during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019: A national cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Teledermatology has been proving to be of great help for delivering healthcare, especially now, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It is crucial to assess how accurate this method can be for evaluating different dermatoses. Such knowledge can contribute to the dermatologists' decision of whether to adhere to teledermatology or not. Our objective was to determine the accuracy of teledermatology in the 10 most frequent skin neoplasms in our population, comparing telediagnosis to histopathological report and in-person dermatologists' diagnosis. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in S?o Paulo, Brazil, where a store-and-forward teledermatology project was implemented under primary-care attention to triage surgical, more complex, or severe dermatoses. A total of 30,976 patients presenting 55,012 lesions took part in the project. Thirteen teledermatologists who participated in the project had three options to refer the patients: send them directly to biopsy, to the in-person dermatologist, or back to the general physician with the most probable diagnosis and management. In the groups referred to the in-person dermatologist and biopsy, we looked for the 10 most frequent International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems-10 (ICD-10) of skin neoplasms, which resulted in 289 histopathologic reports and 803 in-person dermatologists' diagnosis. We were able to compare the ICD-10 codes filled by teledermatologists, in-person dermatologists, and from histopathological reports. The proportion of complete, partial, and no agreement rates between the in-person dermatologist's, histopathologic report, and the teledermatologist's diagnosis was assessed. We also calculated Cohen's kappa, for complete and complete plus partial agreement. The mean complete agreement rate comparing telediagnosis to histopathological report was 54% (157/289; kappa = 0.087), being the highest for malign lesions; to in-person dermatologists was 61% (487/803; kappa = 0.213), highest for benign lesions. When accuracy of telediagnosis for either malign or benign lesions was evaluated, the agreement rate with histopathology was 70% (kappa = 0.529) and with in-person dermatologist, 81% (kappa = 0.582). This study supports that teledermatology for skin neoplasms has moderate accuracy. This result reassures that it can be a proper option for patient care, especially when the goal is to differentiate benign from malign lesions.","output":"Part II: Accuracy of Teledermatology in Skin Neoplasms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Tele-exercise could represent an alternative for remote care in individuals with spinal cord injury at this time of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019.

The purpose of this study was to compare the implementation and training load between synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise programs in individuals with spinal cord injury. METHODS: Forty individuals with spinal cord injury were recruited and stratified into tetraplegia and paraplegia groups. All subjects performed 3 weeks of both the synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise programs, after two weeks of familiarization with the exercises, remote connection tools and methods to record information. The primary outcomes were training load (average daily workload and average and total weekly training load) and implementation (adherence and successful exercise recording). Demographic characteristics were obtained from participants' electronic medical records. RESULTS: Weekly mean workload, total workload, adherence and successful exercise recording presented significantly higher values in the synchronous compared to asynchronous tele-exercises. Average daily workload did not present significant differences between the tele-exercises. DISCUSSION: The training load for each training session presented no differences between synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercises. Both adherence and successful data recording showed more favourable implementation values for synchronous training, thus allowing greater weekly training loads (total and average).","output":"Synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: Comparisons of implementation and training load in individuals with spinal cord injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has radically changed the way of life around the World.

Many COPD patients were reported to have muscle atrophy and weakness, with several studies suggesting intrinsic muscle mitochondrial impairment as a possible driver of this phenotype. Whereas much information has been learned about muscle pathology once a patient has COPD, little is known about how active tobacco smoking might impact skeletal muscle physiology or mitochondrial health. In this study, we examined the acute effects of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) on muscle mitochondrial function and hypothesized that toxic chemicals present in CSC would impair mitochondrial respiratory function. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that acute exposure of muscle mitochondria to CSC caused a dose-dependent decrease in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Next, we applied an analytical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based approach to identify 49 water-soluble and 12 lipid-soluble chemicals with high abundance in CSC. By using a chemical screening approach in the Seahorse XF96 analyzer, several CSC-chemicals, including nicotine, o-Cresol, phenylacetate, and decanoic acid, were found to impair ADP-stimulated respiration in murine muscle mitochondrial isolates significantly. Further to this, several chemicals, including nicotine, o-Cresol, quinoline, propylene glycol, myo-inositol, nitrosodimethylamine, niacinamide, decanoic acid, acrylonitrile, 2-naphthylamine, and arsenic acid, were found to significantly decrease the acceptor control ratio, an index of mitochondrial coupling efficiency.","output":"NMR Spectroscopy Identifies Chemicals in Cigarette Smoke Condensate That Impair Skeletal Muscle Mitochondrial Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY OBJECTIVE We determine whether videolaryngoscopy results in a higher prevalence of first-attempt intubation success and improved glottic visualization than direct laryngoscopy when performed by pediatric emergency medicine providers in simulated patients. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study at a single institution. Fellows and faculty in pediatric emergency medicine were invited to participate. Each subject performed intubations on 3 simulators (newborn, infant, adult), using a videolaryngoscope; each simulator was intubated by each subject with and without use of video. Primary outcome was first-attempt intubation success; secondary outcome was percentage of glottic opening score (POGO). RESULTS Twenty-six participants performed 156 intubations; complete data were available for 148 intubations. First-attempt success in the neonate was 88%; in the infant, 79%; and in the adult, 60%. In the adult simulator, videolaryngoscopy use showed a first-attempt success in 81% of subjects compared with 39% with direct laryngoscopy (difference 43%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 18% to 67%). There was no difference in first-attempt success rates between videolaryngoscopy and direct laryngoscopy in the newborn or infant simulators. Videolaryngoscopy use led to increased POGO scores in all 3 simulators, with a difference of 25% (95% CI 2% to 48%) in newborn simulators, 23% (95% CI 2% to 48%) in infant simulators, and 42% (95% CI 18% to 66%) in adult simulators.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review of rituximab treated adult patients who completed mRNA vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 was conducted. Primary outcome was presence and strength of serologic antibody response to vaccination. Comparisons between those with and without detectable serologic response were calculated using T-tests, Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Negative and positive predictive value was calculated between serologic response and B-cell reconstitution status. RESULTS: In 56 patients, a significant difference in level of B-cell reconstitution was seen in patients with positive (median, IQR 2 (0.13-10)% of total lymphocyte population) versus negative (median, IQR 0 (0-0)%)(p<0.001) serologic response to vaccination. There was also significant difference in time from last rituximab infusion between patients with positive (median #days, IQR 594 (262, 1163) versus negative (median #days, IQR 138 (68, 197))(p-value <0.001) serologic response to vaccination. 13% (3/24) of patients >12 months since last rituximab exposure, 55% (6/11) of patients 6-12 months from last exposure, and 86% (18/21) of patients <6 months since last exposure did not demonstrate a serologic response to vaccination.

METHODS: Participants were a national convenience sample of 810 US adults recruited online in May 2020. All participated in a smoking message experiment and a vaping message experiment, presented in a random order. In each experiment, participants viewed one message formatted as a Twitter post. The experiments adopted a 3 (traditional health harms of smoking or vaping: three harms, one harm, absent)  2 (COVID-19 harms: one harm, absent) between-subjects design. Outcomes included perceived message effectiveness (primary) and constructs from the Tobacco Warnings Model (secondary: attention, negative affect, cognitive elaboration, social interactions). RESULTS: Smoking messages with traditional or COVID-19 harms elicited higher perceived effectiveness for discouraging smoking than control messages without these harms (all p <0.001). However, including both traditional and COVID-19 harms in smoking messages had no benefit beyond including either alone. Smoking messages affected Tobacco Warnings Model constructs and did not elicit more reactance than control messages.

More specifically, the snowball sampling method was conducted with (1624 participants) aged between (18 -+60) during the COVID-19 pandemic from Riyadh and Najran cities. Accordingly, an online survey was conducted during the outbreak's peak phase, using the researchers' questionnaire. The results indicated that the psychological impact level was 42.25%, social (64.4%), and economic (51%) on Saudi society during the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, psychosocial influence levels are exceptionally high for unmarried women, patients, and over 60 years. In contrast, the economic impact is high for married couples, private sector employees, and those living in rural areas with less than SAR 5,000.

METHODS Patients with a germline CDH1 mutation who underwent prophylactic laparoscopic total gastrectomy with jejunal pouch were included in our prospective database. RESULTS A total of 11 patients with a median age of 40 (22-61) years were included. The average operative time was 4:26  0:49 h and the average blood loss was 219  155 ml. Median length of hospital stay was 10 (7-27) days. In two patients, an esophagojejunal anastomotic leakage occurred (grade 4). The leakages were seen in patient numbers 2 and 3, which may be a result of a learning curve. The latter eight patients did not develop anastomotic leakage. Pulmonary complications occurred in one patient with atelectasis and in one patient with pneumonia (grade 2). The 60-day mortality rate was 0 %. Multiple foci of intramucosal diffuse gastric signet ring cell carcinoma were found in the resection specimen of 9/11 (82 %) patients. All 11/11 (100 %) resections were microscopically radical.

Pertinent articles were carefully reviewed for additional relevant citations.ResultsGenerally, there is a higher prevalence of symptoms of adverse psychiatric outcomes among the public when compared to the prevalence before the pandemic. Psychological reactions to pandemics include maladaptive behaviours, emotional distress and symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and avoidance behaviors. The groups known to be at higher risk for mental health problems during the pandemic are: women, healthcare workers, people under 40 years old and with chronic diseases. Other risk factors are: frequent exposure to social media/news relating to COVID-19, poor economic status, lower education level, and unemployment.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented threat to mental health.

Following the Camelyon-16 challenge in 2016, several researchers have dedicated their time to build Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to help radiologists and other clinicians diagnose breast cancer. In particular, there has been an emphasis on Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS); the clinical term for early-stage breast cancer. Large companies have given their fair share of research into this subject, among these Google Deepmind who developed a model in 2020 that has proven to be better than radiologists themselves to diagnose breast cancer correctly. We found that among the issues which exist, there is a need for an explanatory system that goes through the hidden layers of a CNN to highlight those pixels that contributed to the classification of a mammogram. We then chose an open-source, reasonably successful project developed by Prof. Shen, using the CBIS-DDSM image database to run our experiments on. It was later improved using the Resnet-50 and VGG-16 patch-classifiers, analytically comparing the outcome of both. The results showed that the Resnet-50 one converged earlier in the experiments. Following the research by Montavon and Binder, we used the DeepTaylor Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) model to highlight those pixels and regions within a mammogram which contribute most to its classification. This is represented as a map of those pixels in the original image, which contribute to the diagnosis and the extent to which they contribute to the final classification.

These neurological disorders are grouped into several categories, ranging from non-specific and moderate symptoms such as headache, myalgia and hyposmia to severe symptoms including cerebrovascular disease and intracranial infections. Severe neurological symptoms such as acute cerebrovascular disease occur only in a minority of patients with usual risk factor, and are associated with poor outcome.

An obvious colour change from green to blue of starch/PANI films was observed upon exposure to the ammonia vapour.

Fungal pathogens are responsible for a variety of conditions, including superficial diseases, allergic pathologies and potentially lethal invasive infections. Neutrophils and eosinophils have been implicated as effector cells in several pathologies. Neutrophils are major effector cells involved in the control of fungal infections and exhibit a plethora of antifungal mechanisms, such as phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, degranulation, extracellular vesicle formation, and DNA extracellular trap (ET) release. Eosinophils are polymorphonuclear cells classically implicated as effector cells in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases and helminthic infections, although their roles as immunomodulatory players in both innate and adaptive immunity are currently recognized. Eosinophils are also endowed with antifungal activities and are abundantly found in allergic conditions associated with fungal colonization and sensitization. Neutrophils and eosinophils have been demonstrated to release their nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in response to many pathogens and pro-inflammatory stimuli. ETs have been implicated in the killing and control of many pathogens, as well as in promoting inflammation and tissue damage. The formation of ETs by neutrophils and eosinophils has been described in response to pathogenic fungi.

MicroRNA-26a (miR-26a) exhibits anti-inflammatory immune effects on immune cells. However, the exact mechanism by which miR-26a plays an anti-inflammatory role remains unclear. Here, we report that miR-26a reduces inflammatory response via inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by targeting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). We found that miR-26a was downregulated in vitro and in vivo. The miR-26a mimic significantly decreased COX-2 protein levels, further inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We predicted that miR-26a could potentially target COX-2 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Computational algorithms showed that the 3-UTR of COX-2 mRNA contains a binding site for miR-26a. This putative targeting relationship between miR-26a and COX-2 was further confirmed by a dual-reporter gene assay. The anti-inflammatory effects of the miR-26a mimic were diminished by PGE2 supplementation. Importantly, miR-26a mimics protected mice from lethal endotoxic shock and attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Collectively, these results suggest that miR-26a may function as a novel feedback negative regulator of the hyperinflammatory response and as a drug target for the progression of inflammation.

TT, cFT, and InhB were below the normal range at T0 and significantly increased at T1 (TT 1.98 [1.30C2.72] vs. 2.53 [1.28C3.37] ng/mL, p = 0.038; cFT (0.0441 [0.0256C0.0742] vs. 0.0702 [0.0314C0.0778] ng/mL, p = 0.046; InhB 60.75 [25.35C88.02] vs. 77.05 [51.15C134.50], p < 0.01). Conclusions: Both TT and cFT levels are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in men admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

We evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on early childhood vaccination rates at 2 sites of an academic family health team in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, serving both an urban and suburban patient population. METHODS: We conducted a preCpost analysis of vaccination records from Jan. 1, 2018, to Nov. 30, 2020, for a cohort of children born between Jan. 1, 2018, and Aug. 31, 2020, from the electronic medical record (EMR) of the Mount Sinai Academic Family Health Team (including an urban academic site in Toronto and a suburban community site in Vaughan, Ontario). We estimated the proportion of children receiving timely, delayed or no vaccination for 10 publicly funded vaccines in the Ontario immunization schedule for the pre-COVID-19 (Jan. 1, 2018, to Mar. 16, 2020) and COVID-19 (Mar. 17 to Nov. 30, 2020) pandemic periods. We determined timeliness in accordance with the recommended age of administration, with a 28-day window; we considered vaccines administered after this window to be delayed. We estimated the median time to vaccination for each vaccine and present cumulative incidence curves. RESULTS: The patient population was balanced between boys (52.4%) and girls (47.6%), with an average age of 18.5 months and representation across low-, middle- and high-income groups. Of the 506 children in our cohort, 422 were up to date with vaccinations (83.4%) by the end of the study period. Comparatively, 308 (83.2%) of the 370 eligible patients were up to date for all required vaccinations by the end of the pre-COVID-19 period. Among children younger than 12 months, vaccination rates were similar in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 pandemic periods. Lower rates of timely vaccination for children between 12 and 18 months of age were amplified during the pandemic. Cumulative incidence curves were suggestive of a decrease in the timeliness of vaccinations in the COVID-19 period for the vaccines administered at 12, 15 and 18 months, compared with the pre-COVID-19 period. INTERPRETATION: Our local findings suggest a deterioration in the uptake of routine childhood vaccines in children aged 12 to 18 months in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further study is needed to determine the extent of the vaccination gap in children across Canada, including the impact of subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Routine childhood vaccination rates in an academic family health team before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: a preCpost analysis of a retrospective chart review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE During the COVID-19 pandemic, quaternary-care facilities continue to provide care for patients in need of urgent and emergent invasive procedures. Perioperative protocols are needed to streamline care for these patients notwithstanding capacity and resource constraints. METHODS A multidisciplinary panel was assembled at the University of California, San Francisco, with 26 leaders across 10 academic departments, including 7 department chairpersons, the chief medical officer, the chief operating officer, infection control officers, nursing leaders, and resident house staff champions. An epidemiologist, an ethicist, and a statistician were also consulted. A modified two-round, blinded Delphi method based on 18 agree/disagree statements was used to build consensus. Significant disagreement for each statement was tested using a one-sided exact binomial test against an expected outcome of 95% consensus using a significance threshold of p < 0.05. Final triage protocols were developed with unblinded group-level discussion. RESULTS Overall, 15 of 18 statements achieved consensus in the first round of the Delphi method; the 3 statements with significant disagreement (p < 0.01) were modified and iteratively resubmitted to the expert panel to achieve consensus. Consensus-based protocols were developed using unblinded multidisciplinary panel discussions. The final algorithms 1) quantified outbreak level, 2) triaged patients based on acuity, 3) provided a checklist for urgent/emergent invasive procedures, and 4) created a novel scoring system for the allocation of personal protective equipment. In particular, the authors modified the American College of Surgeons three-tiered triage system to incorporate more urgent cases, as are often encountered in neurosurgery and spine surgery.

It is noteworthy that digestive symptoms are also observed in COVID-19 patients. In this article, we describe the immuno-inflammatory characteristics of low severity COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms. METHODS: Patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 were split into three groups based on the patients' symptoms. The first group displayed digestive symptoms only, the second group displayed respiratory symptoms only, and the last group displayed both digestive and respiratory symptoms. Patients were discharged based on negative results of rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from at least two sequential respiratory tract specimens collected 24 hours apart. Multiorgan function and immuno-inflammatory characteristics were analyzed for all of the three groups. RESULTS: Mild liver damage and activation of the immuno-inflammatory system were the most common abnormalities observed in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms but no significant differences were found (P > 0.05). Patients with digestive symptoms were more likely to have slightly higher and later peak values of inflammatory cytokines during the subsequent course of disease (P < 0.05). In addition, a significant correlation between IL-2 and TNF level was found in the first group which included patients with digestive symptoms only (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mild cases of COVID-19 only displaying digestive symptoms are a special subtype. Patients in this group were more likely to have slightly higher and delayed peak values of inflammatory cytokines during the subsequent course of the disease.

Patients with cancer affected by COVID-19 are at a higher risk of developing complications and worse outcomes compared to the non-cancer population, particularly the ones on active systemic treatment. Considering the COVID-19s high transmissibility in asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients, we sought to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in patients with solid cancers receiving systemic therapy in a Brazilian public health hospital. Furthermore, we studied whether socio-economic status was associated with prevalence. METHODS: Consecutive asymptomatic patients undergoing treatment for solid tumours at the chemotherapy and infusion centre of Hospital de Base were enrolled. Patients were prospectively tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA real-time polymerase chain reaction with nasal and oropharyngeal swabs immediately prior to treatment. A socio-economic survey was carried out prior to testing. Demographic and socio-economic characteristics were summarised in means, medians and proportions. RESULTS: From 6 to 13 October 2020, 148 asymptomatic patients were identified. Of those, 41 were excluded, leaving 107 eligible patients. The mean age of the population was 58 years (SD  12.6); 54% were female and 90% were self-identified as White. The most common cancer sites were gastrointestinal tract (36%) and breast (25%). Most patients had a metastatic disease (59%) and were on anticancer treatment involving chemotherapy (95%). Regarding socio-economic status, 46% of our population had either primary school or illiterate as their highest educational level. In terms of monthly income, 92% had a personal income inferior to U$380 and 88% a household income inferior to U$585. Of the 107 patients tested, only 1 (0.9%) was positive for COVID-19. This is a 48-year-old man living in an urban area, with primary school educational level and a monthly personal income inferior to U$390. CONCLUSION: Despite a high prevalence of COVID-19 in Brazil, our cohort demonstrated a low prevalence of COVID-19 (0.9%) amongst asymptomatic patients with cancer. We hypothesise that patients with cancer, independent of their socio-economic status, are aware of the increased risk of developing a severe disease and are adherent to physical distancing, masking and hygiene measures.","output":"Systematic SARS-CoV-2-testing for asymptomatic cancer patients treated at a public healthcare tertiary centre in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many individuals infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop no or only mild symptoms, but some can go on onto develop a spectrum of pathologies including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, systemic inflammation, and multiorgan failure. Many pathogens, viral and non-viral, can elicit these pathologies, which justifies reconsidering whether the target of therapeutic approaches to fight pathogen infections should be (a) the pathogen itself, (b) the pathologies elicited by the pathogen interaction with the human host, or (c) a combination of both. While little is known about the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2, it is well-established that the above-mentioned pathologies are associated with hyper-inflammation, tissue damage, and the perturbation of target organ metabolism. Mounting evidence has shown that these processes are regulated by endoproteinases (particularly, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)). Here, we review what is known about the roles played by MMPs in the development of COVID-19 and postulate a mechanism by which MMPs could influence energy metabolism in target organs, such as the lung. Finally, we discuss the suitability of MMPs as therapeutic targets to increase the metabolic tolerance of the host to damage inflicted by the pathogen infection, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Targeting MMP-Regulation of Inflammation to Increase Metabolic Tolerance to COVID-19 Pathologies: A Hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study aims to develop an end-to-end natural language processing pipeline for triage and diagnosis of COVID-19 from patient-authored social media posts, in order to provide researchers and other interested parties with additional information on the symptoms, severity and prevalence of the disease.

There are currently no approved vaccines or therapies for VEEV infections; therefore, it is imperative to identify novel targets for therapeutic development. We hypothesized that a functional UPS is required for efficient VEEV multiplication. We have shown that at non-toxic concentrations Bortezomib, a FDA-approved inhibitor of the proteasome, proved to be a potent inhibitor of VEEV multiplication in the human astrocytoma cell line U87MG. Bortezomib inhibited the virulent Trinidad donkey (TrD) strain and the attenuated TC-83 strain of VEEV. Additional studies with virulent strains of Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) demonstrated that Bortezomib is a broad spectrum inhibitor of the New World alphaviruses.

This has led to speculations that some lineages of SARS-CoV-2 may be evolving towards higher transmissibility. The most plausible candidate mutations under putative natural selection are those which have emerged repeatedly and independently (homoplasies). Here, we formally test whether any of the recurrent mutations that have been observed in SARS-CoV-2 are significantly associated with increased viral transmission. To do so, we develop a phylogenetic index to quantify the relative number of descendants in sister clades with and without a specific allele. We apply this index to a carefully curated set of recurrent mutations identified within a dataset of 46,723 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients worldwide. We do not identify a single recurrent mutation in this set convincingly associated with increased viral transmission. Instead, recurrent SARS-CoV-2 mutations currently in circulation appear to be evolutionary neutral.

We aim to compile the clinical, laboratory, and investigational data on reported cases of post-COVID-19 vaccination in adults and assess the clinical features, investigational findings, and prognosis in this meta-analysis. METHODS: PubMed database was searched using keywords for post-COVID-19 vaccination myocarditis for articles published before July 6th, 2021. 37 unique studies were identified. Case reports and case series published in English which reported individual patient data on adults aged 18 years or older that were hospitalized for presumed post mRNA vaccination myocarditis are included in our study. Pre-prints were included if they had individual patient data. Editorials, correspondence, reviews, perspectives, original articles were excluded. 13 articles met our criteria for inclusion. Individual participant data was tabulated on a spreadsheet. Age, time of presentation, and length of stay are expressed as Median. The rest of the findings are mentioned as frequency (n). RESULTS: Post mRNA vaccination myocarditis is predominantly seen in males with a mean age of 27.5 years and more after their second dose of vaccination. It is reported after both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine use. The median time of hospital presentation was 3 days after vaccination. The main presenting symptom is chest pain in 96.7% of the patients. Troponin was elevated and cardiac MRI showed late gadolinium enhancement in all the patients. The mean hospital length of stay was 5.5 days. All the patients made a good recovery. CONCLUSION: Post COVID-19 myocarditis is possibly a hypersensitivity reaction to mRNA vaccines. It is predominantly seen in young males and is characterized by chest pain, elevated troponin, and abnormal cardiac MRI. The condition carries a good prognosis. Further investigations are necessary to understand the underlying pathogenesis.","output":"A meta-analysis of myocarditis post-mRNA vaccine administration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eula Bingham, a toxicologist who invigorated the Occupational Safety and Health Administration as its director and set stringent standards to protect workers from hazardous materials, died on 13 June 2020 in Cincinnati.

Measures to mitigate the risks of transmitting COVID-19 are creating significant challenges to restarting all surgical services safely. We describe the development of a risk stratification tool to prioritise patients for cataract surgery taking account both specific risk factors for poor outcome from COVID-19 infection as well as surgical need. In addition we report the demographics and comorbidities of patients on our waiting list. METHODS: A prospective case review of electronic records was performed. A risk stratification tool was developed based on review of available literature on systemic risk factors for poor outcome from COVID-19 infection as well as a surgical need score. Scores derived from the tool were used to generate 6 risk profile groups to allow prioritised allocation of surgery. RESULTS: There were 744 patients awaiting cataract surgery of which 66 (8.9 %) patients were shielding. One hundred and thirty-two (19.5 %) patients had no systemic comorbidities, 218 (32.1 %) patients had 1 relevant systemic comorbidity and 316 (46.5 %) patients had 2 or more comorbidities. Five hundred and ninety patients (88.7 %) did not have significant ocular comorbidities. Using the risk stratification tool, 171 (23 %) patients were allocated in the highest 3 priority stages. Given an aging cohort with associated increase in number of systemic comorbidities, the majority of patients were in the lower priority stages 4 to 6. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has created an urgent challenge to deal safely with cataract surgery waiting lists. This has driven the need for a prompt and pragmatic change to the way we assess risks and benefits of a previously regarded as low-risk intervention. This is further complicated by the majority of patients awaiting cataract surgery being elderly with comorbidities and at higher risk of mortality related to COVID-19. We present a pragmatic method of risk stratifying patients on waiting lists, blending an evidence-based objective assessment of risk and patient need combined with an element of shared decision-making. This has facilitated safe and successful restarting of our cataract service.","output":"Cataract risk stratification and prioritisation protocol in the COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory outcomes of solid cancer patients who were reinfected with COVID-19.

Herein, biotinylated (-) ssRNA of H1N1 virus and its complementary (+) ssRNA were labeled with electrochemical signal probes of ferrocene and anthraquinone, respectively. The resultants were hybridized and conjugated with avidin-modified magnetic beads to create electrochemical RNA beacons. The electrochemical signal variation of the H1N1 RNA beacon treated with the RNA degradation agent of BLM-Fe() were monitored. Results indicate that the BLM-Fe() agent could effectively cleave both H1N1 dsRNAs and ssRNAs at selective cutting sites, as evidenced by the mass spectrometry analysis. This indicates that the BLM-Fe(II) agent could be utilized to block the viral-host infection process by curbing the host-cell viral RNA-mRNA transcription or inactivate the viruses through the cleavage of viral genomes. The efficiency of the BLM-Fe() agent was verified with clinical seasonal H1N1 samples using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The therapeutic gene drug of BLM-Fe() holds great potential for controlling new strains of H1N1 virus resistant to clinical antiviral drugs. More importantly, the so designed RNA beacons may provide a rapid, sensitive and cost-effective platform of drug screening by monitoring the drug-DNA/RNA interactions.","output":"Bleomycin-Fe(II) agent with potentiality for treating drug-resistant H1N1 influenza virus: A study using electrochemical RNA beacons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced further challenges into Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (DNACPR) decisions. Existing evidence suggests success rates for CPR in COVID-19 patients is low and the risk to healthcare professionals from this aerosol-generating procedure complicates the benefit/harm balance of CPR. METHODS: The study is based at a large teaching hospital in the United Kingdom where all DNACPR decisions at are documented on an electronic healthcare records (EHR). Data from all DNACPR/TEAL status forms between 1(st) January 2017 and 30(th) April 2020 were collected and analysed. We compared patterns of decision making and rates of form completion during the 2-month peak pandemic phase to an analogous period during 2019. RESULTS: A total of 16,007 forms were completed during the study period with a marked increase in form completion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with a form completed were on average younger and had fewer co-morbidities during the COVID-19 period than in March-April 2019. Several questions on the DNACPR/TEAL forms were answered significantly differently with increases in patients being identified as suitable for CPR (23.8% versus 9.05%; p < 0.001) and full active treatment (30.5% versus 26.1%; p = 0.028). Whilst proportions of discussions that involved the patient remained similar during COVID-19 (95.8% versus 95.6%; p = 0.871), fewer discussions took place with relatives (50.6% versus 75.4%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the emphasis on senior decision making and conversations around ceilings of treatment appears to have changed practice, with a higher proportion of patients having DNACPR/TEAL status documented. Understanding patient preferences around life-sustaining treatment versus comfort care is part of holistic practice and supports shared decision making.

However, there is limited literature on the virucidal efficacy of oral antiseptics against SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study investigated the virucidal efficacy of three oral-antiseptics compared to a placebo-control in the sputum of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. METHODOLOGY: A pilot study of adults with SARS-CoV-2 positive results, as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of <7 days. The oral antiseptics investigated were: Hexetidine (0.1% w/v);Thymol (0.063% w/v) and H2O2(1.5%) compared to de-mineralized sterile water (Placebo-control). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of negative RT-PCR results at 15-mins, 30-mins, 1-hour, 2-hours and 4-hours After Oral antiseptics Interventions (AOI) compared to the placebo-control. Statistical analysis was done using STATA 15.0 software with p-values of <0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Data from a total of 66 participants that were RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive at baseline (0-min) was analysed. At 15-mins AOI, the highest proportion of negativation from sputum samples was observed in the Hexedine group, with 69.2% of the baseline PCR positive cases converting to negative compared to 46.7% in the placebo-control group.

DESIGN: Life cycle assessment was used to determine environmental impacts of PPE distributed to health and social care in England during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The base scenario assumed all products were single-use and disposed of via clinical waste. Scenario modelling was used to determine the effect of environmental mitigation strategies: (1) eliminating international travel during supply; (2) eliminating glove use; (3) reusing gowns and face shields; and (4) maximal recycling. SETTING: Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, UK. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The carbon footprint of PPE distributed during the study period totalled 106,478 tonnes CO2e, with greatest contributions from gloves, aprons, face shields and Type IIR surgical masks. The estimated damage to human health was 239 DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), impact on ecosystems was 0.47 species.year (loss of local species per year), and impact on resource depletion was costed at US $12.7m (GBP 9.3m). Scenario modelling indicated UK manufacture would have reduced the carbon footprint by 12%, eliminating gloves by 45%, reusing gowns and gloves by 10% and maximal recycling by 35%. RESULTS: A combination of strategies may have reduced the carbon footprint by 75% compared with the base scenario, and saved an estimated 183 DALYS, 0.34 species.year and US $7.4m (GBP 5.4m) due to resource depletion. CONCLUSION: The environmental impact of PPE is large and could be reduced through domestic manufacture, rationalising glove use, using reusables where possible and optimising waste management.","output":"Environmental impact of personal protective equipment distributed for use by health and social care services in England in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El mundo, despues de la pandemia de la COVID-19, no sera el mismo que existia y ni tan siquiera eso es deseable La reanudacion de la \\"normalidad\\" (que solo es \\"normal\\" para unos pocos) seria el regreso a la produccion y el consumo insostenibles, la perdida de derechos, la exacerbacion de las iniquidades y una brutalidad diaria para muchos que luchan por sobrevivir En America Latina (AL), el fin del mundo ya se anuncio incluso antes de la pandemia Si, desde Bogota - 1992, la Declaracion de Promocion de la Salud denuncia la pobreza como el mayor determinante social de enfermedades en la region, los gobiernos parecen ignorarla, debilitando los sistemas de salud, educacion, ciencia y tecnologia, transferencia de ingresos y asistencia social bajo los auspicios de la austeridad fiscal, favoreciendo el aumento de la desigualdad Usando datos de tres paises, Argentina, Brasil y Chile: 1) se senalan sus bajas inmunidades sociales anteriores a la pandemia;2) se analizan sus politicas publicas en respuesta a la pandemia, considerando los diferentes enfoques de intervencion en salud: grupos de riesgo, poblacion, vulnerabilidad y proporcionalismo universal;y, 3) se indica como la Promocion de la Salud (PS) podria influir sobre las politicas publicas para no volver al mundo que existia, usando como ancla dos documentos lanzados durante la pandemia y que explicitan la lente epistemica de la comunidad global de la PS en cinco puntos: intersectorialidad, sostenibilidad, empoderamiento, compromiso con la salud publica y equidad, y perspectiva de curso de vida Evidencias producidas en el transcurso de la pandemia en los tres paises indican que los enfoques adoptados en las politicas publicas pueden, o no, favorecer el alcance de la agenda inconclusa de la PS y del desarrollo sostenible","output":"Politicas publicas adoptadas en la pandemia de la COVID-19 en tres paises de America Latina: contribuciones de la Promocion de la Salud para no volver al mundo que existia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic, much communication occurred online, through social media.

Eight themes emerged regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with RMDs: (1) lack of understanding of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19; (2) critical changes in health behaviour; (3) challenges in healthcare practice and communication with healthcare professionals; (4) difficulties with access to medical care; (5) negative impact on physical and mental health, coping strategies; (6) issues around work participation, (7) negative effects of the media; (8) awareness-raising. CONCLUSION: The findings show that Twitter serves as a real-time data source to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with RMDs. The platform provided early signals of potentially critical health behaviour changes. Future epidemics might benefit from the real-time use of Twitter-based PGHD to identify emerging health needs, facilitate communication, and inform clinical practice decisions.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic impact on people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases: Insights from patient-generated health data on social media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to consider a broadened suite of paradigmatic lenses to help better understand customer engagement during and beyond COVID-19 During this period of uncertainty and economic downturn, many customers are questioning their ways of living and being, and thus businesses are engaging customers in new and evolving ways To appreciate this broadened realm of engagement requires researchers and businesses to embrace existential humanism as an alternative, yet complementary, paradigmatic lens Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper The authors consider three distinct paradigmatic lenses on human (inter)action-economic rationalism, institutionalism and existential humanism-and apply these lenses to deepen the underlying theorizing of the customer engagement concept Further, the authors illustrate how customers engage with businesses in distinct ways, seeking meaning congruent with the challenges faced during COVID-19 Findings The authors argue that the common tripartite model of cognitive, emotional and behavioral customer engagement, typically informed by reductionist and unilateral paradigmatic lenses, is insufficient to understand why customers seek to engage with businesses during and after COVID-19 Originality/value In providing a broader paradigmatic perspective, the authors make a plea for a stronger consideration and activation of spiritual engagement in marketing The current COVID-19 environment challenges extant philosophical assumptions of engagement theorizing, which we address by way of existential humanism The authors contribute through a more differentiated perspective of engagement, accounting for a broader spectrum of human experience This enables more informed theorizing across levels of abstraction, while emphasizing diverse avenues for future engagement for a time even beyond COVID-19","output":"Engaging in times of COVID-19 and beyond: theorizing customer engagement through different paradigmatic lenses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Far from being an equalizer, as some have claimed, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed just how vulnerable many of our social, health, and political systems are in the face of major public health shocks Rapid responses by health systems to meet increased demand for hospital beds while continuing to provide health services, largely via a shift to telehealth services, are critical adaptations However, these actions are not sufficient to mitigate the impact of coronavirus for people from marginalized communities, particularly those with behavioral health conditions, who are experiencing disproportional health, economic, and social impacts from the evolving pandemic Helping these communities weather this storm requires partnering with existing community-based organizations and local governments to rapidly and flexibly meet the needs of vulnerable populations","output":"Addressing major health disparities related to coronavirus for people with behavioral health conditions requires strength-based capacity building and intentional community partnership.

Despite youth status as \\"tech natives,\\" limited data are available on their perspectives on telemedicine. Our study seeks to understand youth telemedicine knowledge, prior experiences, preferences for use, and the impact of COVID-19 on these perspectives. Methods: Participants in MyVoice, a national text message cohort of U.S. youth age 14-24, were sent five open-ended questions in October 2019 and October 2020. A codebook was iteratively developed by using inductive analysis. Responses were independently coded by two investigators, with discrepancies resolved by discussion or a third investigator. Results: Sixty-five percent (836/1,283) and 77% (887/1,129) of participants responded to at least 1 question in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Most youth reported awareness of telemedicine and although many have not used it, COVID-19 has increased use. Further, many are willing to try telemedicine services. Most youth noted a preference for video rather than phone visits, but they believe both to be less effective than in person. Youth also reported varied preferences on services best suited for telemedicine, with COVID-19 positively impacting their views. Discussion: Youth are aware of and willing to use telemedicine services, with many reporting use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Youth are willing to accept a wide variety of telemedicine services, though they still desire in-person options. Health systems and clinics should offer a wide range of services via telemedicine to fit the varying needs of youth both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Perspectives on Telemedicine from a National Study of Youth in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To capture and monitor flu-like symptoms in relation to the clinical characteristics and the oncologic treatment of a large head and neck cancer (HNC) patient cohort during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Patients were monitored through by 2 rounds of interviews. Clinical characteristics of patients with no symptoms (group 0) and of those reporting a??1 (group A), a??3 (group B), or a??5 symptoms (group C) were analyzed. Patients with a??1 symptom at both interviews were defined as group A2. RESULTS: Five hundred patients with HNC were analyzed. A higher frequency of patients with the following characteristics was observed in group A vs group 0: active treatment (40% vs 24%, p = 0.0002), gastrostomy (6% vs 2%, p = 0.027), recent active treatment (48% vs 29%, p < 0.0001), and higher number of concomitant medications (p = 0.01). A lower median age was observed in group B vs group no-B (patients with fewer than three symptoms) (59 vs 63.55 years, p = 0.016) and in group A2 vs group no-A2 (patients without at least one symptom at both interviews) (56 vs 63 years, p = 0.021); patients in group B received more recent active treatment than those in group no-B and in group A2 vs those in group no-A2 (p = 0.024 and 0.043, respectively); patients in group B had a lower body mass index than those in group no-B (22.4 vs 23.93 kg/m2, p = 0.0066).

We found a consistent and strong effect of disease severity on antibody magnitude, driven by fever, cough, hospitalization, and oxygen requirement. Responses to spike protein versus nucleocapsid had consistently higher correlation with neutralization. Assays varied substantially in sensitivity during early convalescence and time to seroreversion. Variability was dramatic for individuals with mild infection, who had consistently lower antibody titers, with sensitivities at 6 months ranging from 33 to 98% for commercial assays.

The potential harm of microplastic pollution to the environment has been confirmed. With the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 in the world, disposable surgical masks as effective and cheap protective medical equipment have been widely used by the public. Disposable masks have been a new social norm, but they must have a sense of environmental responsibilities. The random disposal of masks may result in new and greater microplastic pollution, because masks made of polymer materials would release microplastics after entering the environment. Current results showed that masks are a potential and easily overlooked source of environmental microplastics. The release amount of microplastics in the static water by one mask was 360 items, and with the increase of vibration rate, the release amount also increased. The addition of organic solvents (detergent and alcohol) in water would increase the release of microplastics from masks. When the mask became fragments, the ability to release microplastic fibers into the environment was greatly improved due to the increase of exposure area. After two months of natural weathering, the masks become very fragile pieces and microplastics. A fully weathered mask could release several billions of microplastic fibers into the aquatic environment once these fragile fragments enter the water without reservation. The rapid growth of mask production and consumption and improper disposable is worrying.

METHODS: Plasma D-dimer levels were measured using three different kits in critically ill patients to examine the usefulness of such measurements for detecting the thrombotic diseases and determining the correlation with the FDP and FDP/D-dimer ratio. RESULTS: Although three D-dimer kits showed marked utility for diagnosing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and peripheral arterial and venous thromboembolism (PAVTE), the D-dimer levels determined using the three kits varied among diseases. Indeed, one D-dimer kit showed a high FDP/D-dimer ratio, and another kit showed a low FDP/D-dimer ratio. D-dimer kit with low FDP/D-dimer ratio tended to have high cut-off values and low specificity for diagnosing DIC and PAVTE. In D-dimer kit with high FDP/D-dimer ratio, FDP/D-dimer ratios in patients with thrombosis was significantly higher than that in patients without thrombosis. CONCLUSION: All three D-dimer kits show utility for detecting thrombotic diseases. However, the D-dimer levels determined using the kits varied due to differences in the FDP/D-dimer ratio.

The genomes of SARS-CoV-2 are being rapidly sequenced and shared on public repositories. To keep up with these updates, scientists need to frequently refresh and reclean data sets, which is an ad hoc and labor-intensive process. Further, scientists with limited bioinformatics or programming knowledge may find it difficult to analyze SARS-CoV-2 genomes. OBJECTIVE: To address these challenges, we developed CoV-Seq, an integrated web server that enables simple and rapid analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. METHODS: CoV-Seq is implemented in Python and JavaScript. The web server and source code URLs are provided in this article. RESULTS: Given a new sequence, CoV-Seq automatically predicts gene boundaries and identifies genetic variants, which are displayed in an interactive genome visualizer and are downloadable for further analysis. A command-line interface is available for high-throughput processing. In addition, we aggregated all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and China National GeneBank (CNGB), and extracted genetic variants from these sequences for download and downstream analysis.

Overnutrition increases the risks of serious diet-related chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. However, there is limited evidence on the magnitude and risk factors of overnutrition in the study area. OBJECTIVE: To determine the magnitude of overnutrition and associated factors among school adolescents in Dire Dawa, Eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May to June 2021 among 498 adolescent students selected using a multi-stage sampling procedure. A systematic random sampling technique was employed. Self-administered questionnaires, including food frequency and anthropometric measurement, were used to collect the data. The BMI-for-age Z score was calculated using the WHO Anthro-Plus. A binary logistic regression model was fitted with an odds ratio, and 95% confidence levels. Statistical significance is declared at a p-value below 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 498 (98.4%) were included with the overall prevalence of overnutrition of 26.1% (95% CI: 22.3C29.9), where 23.7% and 2.4% had overweight and obesity, respectively.

TAs are secondary metabolites occurring in several plants. The main TAs considered in the assessments of EFSA and FAO/WHO were (-)-hyoscyamine and (-)-scopolamine, which exert their pharmacological and toxicological effects by acting as competitive antagonists of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Both EFSA and FAO/WHO considered a study in human volunteers as the key study to assess the effects of TAs. The CONTAM Panel established a group acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.016 g/kg body weight (bw) for the sum of (-)-hyoscyamine and (-)-scopolamine, based on decreased heart rate. FAO/WHO concluded that it was not possible to establish an ARfD and instead selected a point of departure of 1.54 g/kg bw for the sum of the two substances, based on decreased salivary secretion, and applied it in a margin of exposure approach. A detailed assessment of the differences in the two approaches is provided in the report. Overall, it is not straightforward to compare quantitatively the differences emerging from the assessments of the CONTAM Panel and the FAO/WHO, in view of the different approaches applied and the different scopes of the assessments.

RESULTS: A framework integrating complexity and scaling up processes was used to conceptually orient the study. Findings are presented by case in four domains: value proposition, actors, technology and organisational context. The scale and use of PPIP and Child PIP were driven by champions; clinicians who developed technically simple tools to digitise clinical audit data. Top-down political will at the national level drove the scaling of MomConnect, supported by ongoing financial and technical support from donors and technical partners. Donor preferences played a significant role in the selection of CommCare as the platform to digitise community health worker service information, with a focus on HIV and TB. A key driver of scale across cases is leadership that recognises and advocates for the value of the digital health solution. The technology need not be complex but must navigate the complexity of operating within an overburdened and fragmented South African health system. Inadequate and unsustained investment from donors and government, particularly in human resource capacity and robust monitioring and evaluation, continue to threaten the sustainability of digital health solutions. CONCLUSIONS: There is no single pathway to achieving scale up or sustainability, and there will be successes and challenges regardless of the configuration of the domains of value proposition, technology, actors and organisational context. While scaling and sustaining digital solutions has its technological challenges, perhaps more complex are the idiosyncratic factors and nature of the relationships between actors involved.

Areas addressed include a brief history of the COVID-19 viral pandemic, a description of the virus, the regulatory response to the pandemic, the screening of employees, the persistence of the virus on inanimate surfaces, cleaning and disinfection of manufacturing facilities, the use of GMP-mandated personal protective equipment to counter the spread of the disease, the role of air changes in viral clearance, and approaches to risk assessment and mitigation. Biological medicinal products have a great record of safety, yet the cell cultures used for production can be susceptible to viruses, and contamination events have occurred. Studies on SARS-CoV-2 for it ability to replicate in various mammalian cell lines used for biopharmaceutical manufacturing suggests that the virus poses a low risk and any contamination would be detected by currently used adventitious virus testing.

METHODS Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for patients who underwent either SPLS (n=21) with SW Kim's technique using a specially designed 3030-cm2-sized 3XL LapBag or laparotomy (n=22) for a huge ovarian tumor from December 2008 to May 2016. Perioperative surgical outcomes were compared. RESULTS In 19/21 (90.5%) patients, SPLS was successfully performed without any tumor spillage or conversion to multi-port laparoscopy or laparotomy. There was no significant difference in patient characteristics, including tumor diameter and total operation time, between both groups. The postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter for the SPLS group than for the laparotomy group (median, 2 [1 to 5] vs. 4 [3 to 17] days; P<0.001). The number of postoperative general diet build-up days was also significantly shorter for the SPLS group (median, 1 [1 to 4] vs. 3 [2 to 16] days; P<0.001). Immediate post-operative pain score was lower in the SPLS group (median, 2.0 [0 to 8] vs. 4.0 [0 to 8]; P=0.045). Patient-controlled anesthesia was used less in the SPLS group (61.9% vs. 100%). CONCLUSION SPLS was successful in removing most large ovarian tumors without rupture and showed quicker recovery and less immediate post-operative pain in comparison to laparotomy. SPLS using SW Kim's technique could be a feasible solution to removing huge ovarian tumors.","output":"Surgical technique for single-port laparoscopy in huge ovarian tumors: SW Kim's technique and comparison to laparotomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via the original article.","output":"Correction to: ChemoPROphyLaxIs with hydroxychloroquine For covId-19 infeCtious disease (PROLIFIC) to prevent covid-19 infection in frontline healthcare workers: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN: Survey research design.

PURPOSE Our aim was to analyze the outcomes after treatment with braided stents. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of 3 databases was performed for studies published from 2006 to 2017. STUDY SELECTION According to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we included studies reporting patients treated with LEO or LVIS stents. DATA ANALYSIS Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the following: aneurysm occlusion rate, complications, and neurologic outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS Thirty-five studies evaluating 1426 patients treated with braided stents were included in this meta-analysis. Successful stent delivery and complete aneurysm occlusion were 97% (1041/1095; 95% CI, 95%-98%) (I2 = 44%) and 88.3% (1097/1256; 95% CI, 85%-91%) (I2 = 72%), respectively. Overall, treatment-related complications were 7.4% (107/1317; 95% CI, 5%-9%) (I2 = 44%). Ischemic/thromboembolic events (48/1324 = 2.4%; 95% CI, 1.5%-3.4%) (I2 = 27%) and in-stent thrombosis (35/1324 = 1.5%; 95% CI, 0.6%-1.7%) (I2 = 0%) were the most common complications. Treatment-related morbidity was 1.5% (30/1324; 95% CI, 0.9%-2%) and was comparable between the LEO and LVIS groups. Complication rates between the anterior (29/322 = 8.8%; 95% CI, 3.4%-12%) (I2 = 41%) versus posterior circulation (10/84 = 10.5%; 95% CI, 4%-16%) (I2 = 0%) and distal (30/303 = 8%; 95% CI, 4.5%-12%) (I2 = 48%) versus proximal aneurysms (14/153 = 9%; 95% CI, 3%-13%) (I2 = 46%) were comparable (P > .05). LIMITATIONS Limitations were selection and publication biases. CONCLUSIONS In this analysis, treatment with the LEO and LVIS stents was relatively safe and effective. The most common complications were periprocedural thromboembolisms and in-stent thrombosis. The rate of complications was comparable among anterior and posterior circulation aneurysms, as well as for proximal and distally located lesions.","output":"Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms with Self-Expandable Braided Stents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aside from typical pneumonia, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) has shown several extra\\\\pulmonary manifestations.

A broad spectrum of effects from softening has to be considered in relation to e.g. health and corrosion when selecting softening technology and design, otherwise adverse effects may be overlooked in the attempt to increase consumer convenience. We here provided a framework for evaluating softening technologies using water quality indicators for lime scaling, soap use, corrosion, human health, taste and removal of contaminants. None of the evaluated softening technologies scored positive on all the included water quality indicators. Precipitation technologies (lime/soda-ash softening and pellet softening) reduce the predicted copper and lead release, but negatively affect stainless steel corrosion expressed by the Larson Ratio. Pellet softening does not remove magnesium, which may limit the achievable softening depth, but maintains a protective effect against cardio-vascular diseases. Strong-acid cation exchange is not expected to affect the included corrosion indicators, whereas the effects from membrane separation (nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) and weak-acid cation exchange depend on the specific source water and process design. All the evaluated technologies reduce hardness, calcium carbonate precipitation potential (CCPP) and atopic eczema, but have potential adverse effects on dental carries (expressed by DMF-S).

HAIs can prolong the length of stay and increase the hospitalization costs, but only a few studies have been conducted in Sichuan province, China. We evaluated the hospitalization costs and length of stay due to HAI in Sichuan province based on the prevalence survey, and provided data reference for China's medical insurance reform. Methods In the hospitals surveyed on the prevalence of HAI, a multi-center nested case-control study was performed by a paired method. The study period was from 6 September 2016 to 30 November 2016. Binary outcomes were tested using 2 test, continuous outcomes were tested using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, intra-group comparisons were tested using multiple linear regression analysis. Results A total of 225 pairs/450 patients were selected in 51 hospitals, and 170 pairs/350 patients were successfully matched. The case fatality rate was 5.14% for the HAIs patients and 3.43% for non-HAs patients, there was no significant difference (2 = 0.627, P = 0.429); the median length of stay in patients with HAIs was 21 days, longer than that of patients with non-HAI 16 days, the median of the difference between matched-pairs was 5 days, the difference was statistically significant (Z = 4.896, P = 0.000). The median hospitalization costs of patients with HAI were 1732.83, higher than that of patients with non-HAI 1095.29, the median of the difference between matched-pairs were 431.34, the difference was statistically significant (Z = 6.413, P = 0.000). Multiple linear regression results showed that HAIs at different sites have caused different economic burdens, but in different economic regions, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions In Sichuan, the hospitalization costs and length of stay caused by HAI should be given special attention in the current medical insurance reform. The proportion and scope of medical payment for patients with HAI at different sites should be different. Efforts need to be taken to incentivize reduction of HAI rates which will reduce hospitalization costs and length of stay.","output":"A multi-center nested case-control study on hospitalization costs and length of stay due to healthcare-associated infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to determine the vector competence of bat-associated nycteribiid flies (Eucamsipoda africana) for Marburg virus (MARV) in the Egyptian Rousette Bat (ERB), Rousettus aegyptiacus.

Seroconversion did not occur in control bats in contact with MARV-infected bats infested with bat flies up to 43 days post exposure. In flies inoculated intra-coelomically with MARV and tested on days 0C29 post inoculation, only those assayed on day 0 and day 7 after inoculation were positive by q-RT-PCR, but the virus concentration was consistent with that of the inoculum. Bats remained MARV-seronegative up to 38 days after infestation and exposure to inoculated flies.

Only 55.8% of women in the United States receive brachytherapy, with even lower proportions in San Diego and Imperial Counties. The purpose of this study was to investigate brachytherapy practice and referral patterns in Western United States border region. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A short survey was sent to 28 radiation oncologists in San Diego and Imperial Counties, who treat patients with gynecologic malignancies. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. RESULTS: Seventeen (61%) physicians responded to the survey. All physicians reported some training in cervical cancer brachytherapy during residency, with median 6 months. Only two physicians reported personally treating all cervical cancer patients with brachytherapy; however, 92% of remaining physicians would recommend brachytherapy for patients if given time and access. The most common reason for referral (78%) was patients deemed to require hybrid or interstitial brachytherapy implants. Barriers to referral included patients preference, insurance status, their resources, or logistics. No changes were reported for brachytherapy practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, except the addition of pre-procedural testing for SARS-CoV-2. Ninety-two percent of physicians identified inadequate maintenance of skills as a barrier to performing brachytherapy, but 77% were not interested in additional training. External beam radiation therapy boosts were rarely recommended in case scenarios describing potentially curable patients. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of brachytherapy is widely recognized for conferring a survival benefit, but barriers to implementation include inadequate training or maintenance of skills, and larger systematic issues related to reimbursement policy, social support, and financial hardship. As most established providers were uninterested in additional brachytherapy training, future approaches to improve patients access should be multidimensional and reflect the value of brachytherapy in definitive treatment of patients with LACC.","output":"Brachytherapy utilization for cervical cancer in Western United States border counties: seeking to understand referral patterns for outcome improvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW Laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) are essential for the clinical care of immunocompromised individuals.

We hypothesized that while asymptomatic carriage would not increase the risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and graft loss, severe infection would. METHODS All lung transplant cases between January 2000 and July 2013 performed at our center were reviewed for respiratory viral samples. Each isolation of virus was classified according to clinical level of severity: asymptomatic, symptomatic without pneumonia, and viral pneumonia. Multivariate Cox modeling was used to assess the impact of CARV isolation on progression to CLAD and graft loss. RESULTS Four thousand four hundred eight specimens were collected from 563 total patients, with 139 patients producing 324 virus-positive specimens in 245 episodes of CARV infection. Overall, the risk of CLAD was elevated by viral infection (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; P < 0.01). This risk, however, was due to viral pneumonia alone (HR, 3.94; P < 0.01), without significant impact from symptomatic viral infection (HR, 0.97; P = 0.94) nor from asymptomatic viral infection (HR, 0.99; P = 0.98). The risk of graft loss was not increased by asymptomatic CARV infection (HR, 0.74; P = 0.37) nor symptomatic CARV infection (HR, 1.39; P = 0.41). Viral pneumonia did, however, significantly increase the risk of graft loss (HR, 2.78; P < 0.01).

This practice tends to inflate the apparent benefits of interventions with a high risk of mortality. Assessing a composite QoL-death outcome is a potential solution to this problem. OBJECTIVES To determine the effect of lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) on a composite endpoint consisting of the occurrence of death or a clinically meaningful decline in QoL defined as an increase of at least eight points in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score from the National Emphysema Treatment Trial. METHODS In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema randomized to receive medical treatment (n = 610) or LVRS (n = 608), we analyzed the survival to the composite endpoint, the hazard functions and constructed prediction models of the slope of QoL decline. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The time to the composite endpoint was longer in the LVRS group (2 years) than the medical treatment group (1 year) (P < 0.0001). It was even longer in the subsets of patients undergoing LVRS without a high risk for perioperative death and with upper-lobe-predominant emphysema. The hazard for the composite event significantly favored the LVRS group, although it was most significant in patients with predominantly upper-lobe emphysema. The beneficial impact of LVRS on QoL decline was most significant during the 2 years after LVRS. CONCLUSIONS LVRS has a significant effect on the composite QoL-survival endpoint tested, indicating its meaningful palliative role, particularly in patients with upper-lobe-predominant emphysema.","output":"Integrating health status and survival data: the palliative effect of lung volume reduction surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Syncope and presyncope episodes that occur during work could affect ones safety and impair occupational performance. Few data are available regarding the prevalence of these events among workers. The possible role of sleep quality, mental stress, and metabolic disorders in promoting syncope, presyncope, and falls in workers is unknown. In the present study, 741 workers (male 35.4%; mean age 47  11 years), employed at different companies, underwent clinical evaluation and blood tests, and completed questionnaires to assess sleep quality, occupational distress, and mental disorders. The occurrence of syncope, presyncope, and unexplained falls during working life was assessed via an ad hoc interview. The prevalence of syncope, presyncope, and falls of unknown origin was 13.9%, 27.0%, and 10.3%, respectively. The occurrence of syncope was associated with an increased risk of occupational distress (adjusted odds ratio aOR: 1.62, confidence intervals at 95%: 1.05C2.52), low sleep quality (aOR: 1.79 CI 95%: 1.16C2.77), and poor mental health (aOR: 2.43 CI 95%: 1.52C3.87). Presyncope was strongly associated with occupational distress (aOR: 1.77 CI 95%: 1.25C2.49), low sleep quality (aOR: 2.95 CI 95%: 2.08C4.18), and poor mental health (aOR: 2.61 CI 95%: 1.78C3.84), while no significant relationship was found between syncope or presyncope and metabolic syndrome.

METHODS: ACS participants complete a questionnaire on sexual behaviour and are tested for HIV/STI biannually. They may also be tested at the sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinic in-between study visits. On May 29, 2020, ACS participants were invited to complete an online questionnaire on health, COVID-19 risk perceptions and sexual behavior. Determinants of reporting casual sex partners (CSP) during COVID-19 restrictions were examined using logistic regression. RESULTS: 353/683 MSM (52%; median age 47; IQR 38-53) completed the questionnaire. Since COVID-19, 73% reported a reduction in number of CSP. CSP during COVID-19 restrictions were reported by 133 (38%) MSM and, in multivariable analysis, was associated with not having a college/university degree, being single, lower perceived importance of avoiding COVID-19, number of CSP before COVID-19 and current PrEP use (p<0.05 for all). During COVID-19 restrictions, no HIV infections were diagnosed and the STI positivity rate was 8%. CONCLUSION: Since COVID-19, the number of CSP decreased among MSM and there may have been a temporary reduction in HIV/STI transmission. Some MSM were not fully compliant to social distancing regulations and reported CSP, which was related to prior sexual behavior and low perceived importance of avoiding COVID-19.

Here, we evaluated whether a mobile technology-based personalized epilepsy SM education intervention, PAUSE to Learn Your Epilepsy (PAUSE), improves SM measures such as self-efficacy, epilepsy SM behaviors, epilepsy outcome expectations, quality of life (QOL), and personal impact of epilepsy in adults with epilepsy. METHODS: Recruitment for the PAUSE study occurred from October 2015 to March 2019. Ninety-one PWE were educated using an Internet-enabled computer tablet application that downloads custom, patient-specific educational programs from Epilepsy.com. Validated self-reported questionnaires were used for outcome measures. Participants were assessed at baseline (T0), the first follow-up at completion of the PWE-paced 8C12-week SM education intervention (T1), and the second follow-up at least 3 months after the first follow-up (T2). Multiple linear regression was used to assess within-subject significant changes in outcome measures between these time points. RESULTS: The study population was diverse and included individuals with a wide variety of SM educational needs and abilities. The median time for the first follow-up assessment (T1) was approximately 4 months following the baseline (T0) and 8 months following baseline for the second follow-up assessment (T2). Participants showed significant improvement in all SM behaviors, self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, QOL, and personal impact of epilepsy measures from T0 to T1. Participants who scored lower at baseline tended to show greater improvement at T1. Similarly, results showed that participant improvement was sustained in the majority of SM measures from T1 to T2. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a mobile technology-based personalized SM intervention is feasible to implement. The results provide evidence that epilepsy SM behavior and practices, QOL, outcome expectation for epilepsy treatment and management, self-efficacy, and outcome expectation and impact of epilepsy significantly improve following a personalized SM education intervention. This underscores a greater need for a pragmatic trial to test the effectiveness of personalized SM education, such as PAUSE to Learn Your Epilepsy, in broader settings specifically for the unique needs of the hard-to-reach and hard-to-treat population of PWE.","output":"Enhancing epilepsy self-management and quality of life for adults with epilepsy with varying social and educational backgrounds using PAUSE to Learn Your Epilepsy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Estimates of health capacities in the context of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic indicate that most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are not operationally ready to manage this health emergency.

Our objective was to model the cost-per-HIV infection averted by CVCT in six African countries guided by an HIV prevention cascade framework. The HIV prevention cascade as yet to be applied to evaluating CVCT effectiveness or cost-effectiveness. METHODS We defined a priority population for CVCT in Africa as heterosexual adults in stable couples. Based on our previous experience nationalizing CVCT in Rwanda and scaling-up CVCT in 73 clinics in Zambia, we estimated HIV prevention cascade domains of motivation for use, access and effectiveness of CVCT as model parameters. Costs-per-couple tested were also estimated based on our previous studies. We used these parameters as well as country-specific inputs to model the impact of CVCT over a five-year time horizon in a previously developed and tested deterministic compartmental model. We consider six countries across Africa with varied HIV epidemics (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Tanzania, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone). Outcomes of interest were the proportion of HIV infections averted by CVCT, nationwide CVCT implementation costs and costs-per-HIV infection averted by CVCT. We applied 3%/year discounting to costs and outcomes. Univariate and Monte Carlo multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS We estimated that CVCT could avert between 54% (Sierra Leone) and 62% (South Africa) of adult HIV infections. Average costs-per-HIV infection averted were lowest in Zimbabwe ($550) and highest in South Africa ($1272). Nationwide implementations would cost between 7% (Kenya) and 21% (Ivory Coast) of a country's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) budget over five years. In sensitivity analyses, model outputs were most sensitive to estimates of cost-per-couple tested; the proportion of adults in heterosexual couples and HIV prevention cascade domains of CVCT motivation and access. CONCLUSIONS Our model indicates that nationalized CVCT could prevent over half of adult HIV infections for 7% to 21% of the modelled countries' five-year PEPFAR budgets. While other studies have indicated that CVCT motivation is high given locally relevant promotional and educational efforts, without required indicators, targets and dedicated budgets, access remains low.","output":"Cost-effectiveness of couples' voluntary HIV counselling and testing in six African countries: a modelling study guided by an HIV prevention cascade framework."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease-19 has a wide range of clinical presentations and varied outcomes.

Only studies reporting on data collected after October 2020, when the first VOC was reported, were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Titles, abstracts and full-text articles were screened by two independent reviewers. Data extraction was completed by two independent reviewers using a standardised form. Data synthesis and reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 37 included studies, the majority assessed the impact of Alpha (n=32) and were conducted in Europe (n=12) or the UK (n=9). Most were modelling studies (n=28) and preprints (n=28). The majority of studies reported on infection control measures (n=17), followed by modifying approaches to vaccines (n=13), physical distancing (n=6) and either mask wearing, testing or hand washing (n=2). Findings suggest an accelerated vaccine rollout is needed to mitigate the spread of VOC. CONCLUSIONS: The increased severity of VOC requires proactive public health measures to control their spread. Further research is needed to strengthen the evidence for continued implementation of public health measures in conjunction with vaccine rollout. With no studies reporting on Delta, there is a need for further research on this and other emerging VOC on public health measures.","output":"Public health implications of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: a rapid scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anemia is present in over two-thirds of patients with malignant hematological disorders. The etiology of anemia predominates from ineffective erythropoiesis from marrow infiltration, cytokine related suppression, erythropoietin suppression, and vitamin deficiency; ineffective erythropoiesis is further exacerbated by accelerated clearance due to antibody mediated hemolysis and thrombotic microangiopathy. As the anemia is chronic in nature, symptoms are generally well tolerated and often non-specific. Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is a balance between providing benefit for patients while avoiding risks of transfusion. Conservative/restrictive RBC transfusion practices have shown equivalent patient outcomes compared to liberal transfusion practices, and meta-analysis has shown improved in-hospital mortality, reduced cardiac events, re-bleeding, and bacterial infections. The implications for a lower threshold for transfusion in patients with malignancies are therefore increasingly being scrutinized. Alternative management strategies for anemia with IV iron and erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) should be considered in the appropriate settings.","output":"Transfusions for anemia in adult and pediatric patients with malignancies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Economic crises carry a substantial impact on population health and health systems, but little is known on how these transmit to health workers (HWs). Addressing such a gap is timely as HWs are pivotal resources, particularly during pandemics or the ensuing recessions. Drawing from the empirical literature, we aimed to provide a framework for understanding the impact of recessions on HWs and their reactions. We use a systematic review and best-fit framework synthesis approach to identify the relevant qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods evidence, and refine an a priori, theory-based conceptual framework. Eight relevant databases were searched, and four reviewers employed to independently review full texts, extract data and appraise the quality of the evidence retrieved. A total of 57 peer-reviewed publications were included, referring to six economic recessions. The 2010-15 Great Recession in Europe was the subject of most (52%) of the papers. Our consolidated framework suggests that recessions transmit to HWs through three channels: (1) an increase in the demand for services; (2) the impacts of austerity measures; and (3) changes in the health labour market. Some of the evidence appeared specific to the context of crises; demand for health services and employment increased during economic recessions in North America and Oceania, but stagnated or declined in Europe in connection with the austerity measures adopted. Burn-out, lay-offs, migration and multiple jobholding were the reactions observed in Europe, but job opportunities never dwindled for physicians during recessions in North America, with nurses re-entering labour markets during such crises. Loss of motivation, absenteeism and abuse of health systems were documented during recessions in low-income countries. Although the impacts of recessions may vary across economic events, health systems, labour markets and policy responses, our review and framework provide an evidence base for policies to mitigate the effects on HWs.","output":"The impact of economic recessions on health workers: a systematic review and best-fit framework synthesis of the evidence from the last 50 years."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the 2019 novel coronavirus has rapidly spread throughout China The medical staff at dermatology departments of some hospitals in Hubei province also participated in the fight against coronavirus disease 2019 However, many problems emerged during this period Some medical staff at dermatology departments lacked abilities to deal with emergencies, self-protect, and to conduct surveys on skin diseases occurring in this period In this article, the authors highlight common problems in and give advice on dermatology teaching about national public health emergencies to healthcare workers, undergraduate students, graduate students and senior residents, hoping that healthcare workers at dermatology departments will calmly deal with public health emergencies in the future Copyright ? 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association","output":"Some considerations in dermatology teaching about national public health emergencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The privacy and confidentiality of our data are more fundamental to our existence than ever, especially with our growing dependence on online services and the transfer of information, be it for convenience or the unfortunate COVID 19 pandemic. Traditional security measures such as cryptography and steganography are essential. However, they are not sufficient anymore as when one party maintains complete control over the data, they may intentionally, or not, lose or reveal it. Thus, secret sharing schemes were introduced to address applications that require collective agreement by authorized personnel to access or modify, such as missile launching, sophisticated medical agreements, or high-level bank transfers. In standard secret sharing, the target key is distributed among several authorized participants in a way that only the intended group of them are needed to reconstruct the original target key. These schemes became popular as they fortified the security of both cryptography and steganography and accomplished extraordinary results combined with each. This work focuses on two particular secret sharing techniques known as counting-based secret sharing and matrix-based secret sharing, which is based on the former. These methods are simple and intuitive. Consequently, they are prone to attacks that may result in the successful guessing of the key. In this work, not only are the shares hidden but they are also encrypted beforehand so that should they be intercepted, the adversary cannot decipher them. In other words, two layers of security are added to the secret-sharing method: steganography and cryptography. We studied two image steganography methods: least significant bit (LSB) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT), each combined with XOR encryption for security and robustness acceptability verification.

Neutralizing antibodies present in CP generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and directed against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein are considered to play a major role in the viral clearance. CP infusion may also contribute to the modulation of the immune response through its immunomodulatory effect. We describe for the first time the effectiveness of a CP collection protocol from repeated donations in young patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled health service workers who experienced mild to moderate COVID-19 and from whom several donations have been collected. No minimal severity threshold and no biological cure criteria were required. Donors could return to a second plasma donation 14 days after the first donation. A minimal neutralizing antibody titer of 1:40 was considered for clinical use. RESULTS: Eighty-eight donors were included (median age 35 [28C48] years, 41 women), and 149 plasma products were collected. COVID-19 were mainly WHO stage 2 infections (96%). Among the 88 first donations, 76% had neutralizing antibody titers higher than or equal to 1:40. Eighty-eight percent of donors who came for a second donation had a neutralizing antibody titer of 1:40. Median durations were 15 (15C19) and 38 (33C46) days from the first to the second donation and from recovery to the second donation, respectively. Sixty-nine percent of donors who came for a third donation had a neutralizing antibody titer of 1:40. Median durations were 16 (13C37) and 54 (49C61) days from the second to the third donation and from recovery to the third donation, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the IgG ratio and the age of the donors or the time between recovery and donation. The average IgG ratio did not significantly vary between donations. When focused on repeated blood donors, no significant differences were observed either. CONCLUSION: The recruitment of young patients with a mild to moderate CO-VID-19 course is an efficient possibility to collect CP with a satisfactory level of neutralizing antibodies.

Given the contemporary limitations of the supply chain, it is imperative to identify effective means of decontaminating, reusing, and thereby conserving N95 respirator stockpiles. To be effective, decontamination must result in sterilization of the N95 respirator without impairment of respirator filtration or user fit. Although numerous methods of N95 decontamination exist, none are universally accessible. In this work, we describe a microwave-generated steam decontamination protocol for N95 respirators for use in health care systems of all sizes, geographies, and means. Using widely available glass containers, mesh from commercial produce bags, a rubber band, and a 1,100-W commercially available microwave, we constructed an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators. Employing this methodology against MS2 phage, a highly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination, we report an average 6-log10 plaque-forming unit (PFU) (99.9999%) and a minimum 5-log10 PFU (99.999%) reduction after a single 3-min microwave treatment. Notably, quantified respirator fit and function were preserved, even after 20 sequential cycles of microwave steam decontamination. This method provides a valuable means of effective decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators by frontline providers facing urgent need.IMPORTANCE Due to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is an increasing shortage of protective gear necessary to keep health care providers safe from infection. As of 9 April 2020, the CDC reported 9,282 cumulative cases of COVID-19 among U.S. health care workers (CDC COVID-19 Response Team, MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 69:477-481, 2020, https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e6). N95 respirators are recommended by the CDC as the ideal method of protection from COVID-19. Although N95 respirators are traditionally single use, the shortages have necessitated the need for reuse. Effective methods of N95 decontamination that do not affect the fit or filtration ability of N95 respirators are essential. Numerous methods of N95 decontamination exist; however, none are universally accessible. In this study, we describe an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators using widely available materials. The N95 decontamination method described in this work will provide a valuable resource for hospitals, health care centers, and outpatient practices that are experiencing increasing shortages of N95 respirators due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Microwave-Generated Steam Decontamination of N95 Respirators Utilizing Universally Accessible Materials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is associated with a high rate of thrombosis, the pathophysiology of which is not well defined.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to undertake viscoelastic evaluation of the coagulation state in critically ill adults with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure METHODS: This was a single-centre observational point prevalence cohort study of adults with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure requiring respiratory support in the intensive care unit. Coagulation status was evaluated using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM?) in conjunction with laboratory markers of coagulation. RESULTS: Six patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Each patient had one ROTEM? performed. All patients had supranormal clot amplitude at 10 min (A10) and supranormal clot firmness (maximal clot firmness) measured in at least one ROTEM? pathway, and five were supranormal on all pathways. Minimal clot lysis was present on all analyses. Fibrinogen and D-dimer were elevated and routine markers of coagulation within normal ranges in all patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure admitted to the intensive care unit exhibit a hypercoagulable state which is not appreciable on conventional tests of coagulation.

The current study aimed to examine the moderator role of PTSD on the relationship between TE and AP, and then to investigate whether this moderator role is influenced by gender. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A sample of Chinese students (n=235) who had experienced the major earthquake of Wenchuan was chosen. PTSD and TE were measured by the Impact of Event Scale C Revised (IES-R) and an earthquake-related experience questionnaire, respectively. AP was collected from their up-to-date general examination. Data for 221 participants (53.4% female; mean age=14.03 years, SD=0.824) were finally included in the analysis. Parsimonious latent-variable interaction analysis and hierarchical regression analysis were adopted to examine the moderator role of PTSD. RESULTS: The average IES-R score was 27.57 (SD=13.265, range 0C67). The average score for earthquake exposure was 5.86 (SD=2.069, range 1C12). The results showed that both TE and the interaction term of PTSD*TE had significant negative correlations with AP, while PTSD was not associated with AP. Subsequent hierarchical regression analysis found that the relationship of the interaction term and AP was only significant in female students, and a simple slope plot showed a distinct pattern of the moderating effect of PTSD in both genders.

In this work, we propose a model based on sentence Transformer to detect the main topics of Tweets in recent months. The proposed model first learns sentence-level representation of tweets, and then group them based on their embedding similarities into some groups, and then detect the most important words in each cluster based on their frequency and average similarity to other words. Through experimental results, we show that our model can detect very informative topics, by processing the tweets on sentence level (which can preserve the overall meaning of the tweets). The proposed model is trained in an unsupervised fashion, and can be applied to any dataset our textual data from social media websites.","output":"Deep-COVID: Predicting COVID-19 From Chest X-Ray Images Using Deep Transfer Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maintaining an exchange between the disoriented elderly patient and his family circle is essential to help reduce patient anxiety.

However, only a subset of patients benefits from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. As a negative regulator of anti-tumor immunity, TGF- impairs the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and induces drug resistance. Developing a novel treatment strategy to simultaneously block PD-1/PD-L1 and TGF- would be valuable to enhance the effect of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and relieve drug resistance. METHODS: Based on the Check-BODY? technology platform, we developed an anti-TGF-/PD-L1 bispecific antibody YM101. The bioactivity of the anti-TGF- moiety was determined by Smad-luciferase reporter assay, transwell assay, western blotting, CCK-8, and flow cytometry. The bioactivity of the anti-PD-L1 moiety was measured by T cell activation assays. EMT-6, CT26, and 3LL tumor models were used to investigate the anti-tumor activity of YM101 in vivo. RNA-seq, immunohistochemical staining, and flow cytometry were utilized to analyze the effect of YM101 on the tumor microenvironment. RESULTS: YM101 could bind to TGF- and PD-L1 specifically. In vitro experiments showed that YM101 effectively counteracted the biological effects of TGF- and PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, including activating Smad signaling, inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and immunosuppression. Besides, in vivo experiments indicated the anti-tumor activity of YM101 was superior to anti-TGF- and anti-PD-L1 monotherapies. Mechanistically, YM101 promoted the formation of hot tumor: increasing the numbers of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and dendritic cells, elevating the ratio of M1/M2, and enhancing cytokine production in T cells. This normalized tumor immune microenvironment and enhanced anti-tumor immune response might contribute to the robust anti-tumor effect of YM101. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that YM101 could simultaneously block TGF- and PD-L1 pathways and had a superior anti-tumor effect compared to the monotherapies.","output":"The construction, expression, and enhanced anti-tumor activity of YM101: a bispecific antibody simultaneously targeting TGF- and PD-L1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Individuals born extremely preterm are at significant risk for impaired neurodevelopment. After discharge from the neonatal intensive care, associations between the childs well-being and factors in the home and social environment become increasingly apparent. Mothers prenatal health and socioeconomic status are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes, and emotional and behavioral problems. Research on early life risk factors and on mechanisms underlying inter-individual differences in neurodevelopment later in life can inform the design of personalized approaches to prevention. Here, we review early life predictors of inter-individual differences in later life neurodevelopment among those born extremely preterm. Among biological mechanisms that mediate relationships between early life predictors and later neurodevelopmental outcomes, we highlight evidence for disrupted placental processes and regulated at least in part via epigenetic mechanisms, as well as perinatal inflammation. In relation to these mechanisms, we focus on four prenatal antecedents of impaired neurodevelopment, namely, (1) fetal growth restriction, (2) maternal obesity, (3) placental microorganisms, and (4) socioeconomic adversity. In the future, this knowledge may inform efforts to detect and prevent adverse outcomes in infants born extremely preterm.

Amyloid fibrils form above the solubility of amyloidogenic proteins or peptides upon breaking supersaturation, followed by a nucleation and elongation mechanism, which is similar to the crystallization of solutes. Many additives, including salts, detergents, and natural compounds, promote or inhibit amyloid formation. However, the underlying mechanisms of the opposing effects are unclear. We examined the effects of two polyphenols, i.e., epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and kaempferol-7-O-glycoside (KG), with high and low solubilities, respectively, on the amyloid formation of &#945;-synuclein (&#945;SN). EGCG and KG inhibited and promoted amyloid formation of &#945;SN, respectively, when monitored by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence or transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis revealed that, although interactions of &#945;SN with soluble EGCG increased the solubility of &#945;SN, thus inhibiting amyloid formation, interactions of &#945;SN with insoluble KG reduced the solubility of &#945;SN, thereby promoting amyloid formation.

Here, we perform a large-scale, spatiotemporal analysis of human mobility during the COVID-19 epidemic. We derive human mobility from anonymized, aggregated telecommunication data in a nationwide setting (Switzerland; 10 February to 26 April 2020), consisting of [Formula: see text] 1.5 billion trips. In comparison to the same time period from 2019, human movement in Switzerland dropped by 49.1%. The strongest reduction is linked to bans on gatherings of more than five people, which are estimated to have decreased mobility by 24.9%, followed by venue closures (stores, restaurants, and bars) and school closures. As such, human mobility at a given day predicts reported cases 7 to 13 d ahead. A 1% reduction in human mobility predicts a 0.88 to 1.11% reduction in daily reported COVID-19 cases. When managing epidemics, monitoring human mobility via telecommunication data can support public decision makers in two ways.

OBJECTIVE: This manuscript aims to advance knowledge on COVID-19 preventive perceptions and behaviors and their main predictors, including digital health information-seeking behavior (HISB), political party identification, and COVID-19 testing status. METHODS: Two cross-sectional online surveys of US millennials were conducted from April 10 to 14, 2020 (N=274) (ie, Study 1), and from April 27 to May 7, 2020 (N=1037) (ie, Study 2). In the regression models, dependent variables included preventive behaviors (eg, wearing a face mask and social distancing) as well as four preventive perceptions: severity (ie, a person's conception of the seriousness of COVID-19), susceptibility (ie, a person's conception of the likelihood of being infected with COVID-19), self-efficacy (ie, a person's perception that he or she can wear a face mask and perform social distancing to prevent COVID-19 infection), and response efficacy (ie, a person's perception of whether wearing a face mask and social distancing can prevent COVID-19 infection). Key independent variables included digital HISB for self, digital HISB for another person, political party identification, and COVID-19 testing status. RESULTS: Millennials reported lower levels of perceived susceptibility than the other three preventive perceptions (ie, severity, self-efficacy, and response efficacy), as well as fairly high levels of preventive behaviors. Unlike HISB for another person, digital HISB for self was positively associated with preventive perceptions and behaviors. In Study 1, respondents with higher levels of digital HISB for self had significantly higher perceptions of severity (?=.22, P<.001), self-efficacy (?=.15, P=.02), and response efficacy (?=.25, P<.001) as well as, at nearing significance, higher perceptions of susceptibility (?=.11, P=.07). In Study 2, respondents with higher levels of digital HISB for self had significantly higher perceptions of severity (?=.25, P<.001), susceptibility (?=.14, P<.001), and preventive behaviors (?=.24, P<.001). Preventive behaviors did not vary significantly according to political party identification, but preventive perceptions did. In Study 1, respondents who identified as being more Republican had significantly lower perceptions of self-efficacy (?=-.14, P=.02) and response efficacy (?=-.13, P=.03) and, at nearing significance, lower perceptions of severity (?=-.10, P=.08) and susceptibility (?=-.12, P=.06). In Study 2, respondents who identified as being more Republican had significantly lower perceptions of severity (?=-.08, P=.009). There were mixed effects of COVID-19 testing status on preventive perceptions, with respondents who had tested positive for COVID-19 having significantly higher perceptions of susceptibility in Study 1 (?=.17, P=.006) and significantly lower perceptions of severity in Study 2 (?=-.012, P<.001).

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Among a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed. Data were collected until 28 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms. RESULTS: The median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years). Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%). Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)). Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)). The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days. Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively. Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%). Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients. CONCLUSION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.","output":"Clinical characteristics of 113 deceased patients with coronavirus disease 2019: retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) as bridge to recovery in critically ill COVID-19 continues to be commonly utilized strategy in cases with persistent respiratory failure refractory to traditional ventilation support Case Report We report 5 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection (SARS-CoV-2) who were treated with ECMO (Table 1). All 5 cases presented with fever, cough and shortness of breath and a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 on admission. Case 1, 2, 3 and 5 patients were hypoxemic with saturation less than 90% on admission and decompensated rapidly, whereas Case 4 decompensated after day 14. Mechanical ventilation failed to provide adequate oxygenation in all 5 cases; case 2,3 and 5 were started on recruitment measures with proning while it was not possible for case 1 owing to morbid obesity. Proning was not possible in the case 4 as patient became severely hypoxemic while patient was undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. The case 1-4 remained on ECMO for 19, 17, 17 and 2 days respectively. All except case 2 had improvement in APACHEII and SOFA score after ECMO initiation. All 5 patients had elevated inflammatory markers of serum ferritin, D-dimer, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) which trended down after a few days of ECMO initiation All 5 patients received high dose steroids during their stay in the ICU. Case 4 and 5 passed away after compassionate extubation. Case 1-3 had prolonged hospital course with complication of hospital acquired pneumonia requiring multiple courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Summary Our observational report of 5 patients reports the use of ECMO in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 with ARDS and difficult to maintain saturation despite mechanical ventilation and proning with recovery for 3 patients.

Notably, individuals with mental disorders have been reported to have a higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Personality traits could represent an important determinant of preventative health behavior and, therefore, the risk of contracting the virus. AimsWe examined overlapping genetic underpinnings between major psychiatric disorders, personality traits, and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. MethodsLinkage disequilibrium score regression was used to explore the genetic correlations of COVID-19 susceptibility with psychiatric disorders and personality traits based on data from the largest available respective genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In two cohorts (the PsyCourse (n=1346) and the HeiDE (n=3266) study), polygenic risk scores were used to analyze if a genetic association between, psychiatric disorders, personality traits, and COVID-19 susceptibility exists in individual-level data. ResultsWe observed no significant genetic correlations of COVID-19 susceptibility with psychiatric disorders. For personality traits, there was a significant genetic correlation for COVID-19 susceptibility with extraversion (p=1.47x10-5; rg=0.284). Yet, this was not reflected in individual-level data from the PsyCourse and HeiDE studies. ConclusionsWe identified no significant correlation between genetic risk factors for severe psychiatric disorders and genetic risk for COVID-19 susceptibility.

However, the association between NRS-2002 and the prognosis of heart failure has not been fully addressed. This study aimed to explore the association of NRS-2002 with 1-year re-hospitalization and the length of initial hospital stay in heart failure patients. Methods: This retrospective study included 2,830 heart failure patients. The primary endpoint was 1-year re-hospitalization for heart failure. The secondary endpoint was the length of initial hospital stay. The Log-binomial regression analysis was performed to determine the association between NRS-2002 and re-hospitalization. The Cox regression model was fitted to estimate hazard of discharge. The cumulative incidence curves of discharge were plotted using Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test was performed. Exploratory analysis was also conducted according to the classification of heart failure and the level of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) fold-elevation. Results: Among 2,830 heart failure patients, the mean age was 64.3 years and 66.4% were male. A total of 122 (4.3%) patients were considered at high nutritional risk. Log-binomial regression analysis demonstrated that higher NRS-2002 score was an independent risk factor of re-hospitalization ([1 vs. 0]: relative risks [RR] = 1.383, 95% CI = 1.152 to 1.660; [2 vs. 0]: RR = 1.425, 95% CI = 1.108 to 1.832; [3-7 vs. 0]: RR = 1.770, 95% CI = 1.310 to 2.393). Kaplan-Meier curve showed that the cumulative incidence of discharge was lower in high nutritional risk group (Log rank p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis also found that higher NRS-2002 score (2 or 3) was strongly associated with longer length of initial hospital stay ([2 vs. 0]: Hazard ratios [HR] = 0.854, 95% CI = 0.748 to 0.976; [3-7 vs. 0]: HR = 0.609, 95% CI = 0.503 to 0.737).

It is tested on daily new cases in six major countries in Europe, in the first wave of epidemic in spring, 2020. Results The calculations show that even if the infectivity starts two days before the onset of symptoms and stops immediately when they appear, the value of R0 is larger than that from the classical, Markovian approach. For more realistic cases, when only individuals with mild symptoms spread the virus for few days after onset of symptoms, the respective values are even larger. Conclusions The calculations of R0 and other characteristics of spreading of COVID-19 based on the classical, Markovian approaches should be taken very cautiously. Instead, non-Markovian models with general distribution functions of transition between compartments should be considered as more appropriate.","output":"Estimation of the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 from the incubation period distribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIMS: To quantify the longitudinal changes of the macular microvasculature and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) parameters in patients recovered from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) analysis. METHODS: This observational, longitudinal study was performed on patients recovered from COVID-19. The OCTA images were recorded at baseline and after 1 and 3 months at the follow-up examination. Vessel density (VD) of the retinal superficial (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP), as well as the area of the FAZ of patients who had recovered from COVID-19, were measured. RESULTS: In total, 36 eyes of 18 patients (62.2% female) with a mean age of 34.5  7.5 years old were included. Regarding SCP, while the VDs of the whole image, fovea, and parafovea were comparable at different time points, the mean VDs in inferior hemifield, as well as superior and inferior regions of perifovea, underwent significant reductions at month 3, compared to the baseline. In DCP, the mean of VD in the whole image was 54.3  2.7 at the first visit which significantly decreased to 52.1  3.8(P = 0.003) and 51.4  2.7(P = 0.001) after 1 and 3 months, respectively. The VDs in all regions of parafovea and perifovea revealed a significant reduction after 1 and 3 months, compared to the first visit.

It is a structured document containing several key components pertaining to the interpretation of radiological examinations and may require the addition of follow-up imaging recommendations to optimize patient outcomes. This study aims to determine whether follow-up imaging recommendations are being acknowledged and acted upon by referrers. Methods This retrospective study was conducted at a single tertiary hospital. Prerecorded BESTCare data of patients who underwent abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans between October 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017, and received recommendations for further evaluation were collected after obtaining ethical approval from the local authority. Data of patients younger than 14 years old, patients who did not receive a recommendation, and patients who had CT scans that were uploaded to the BESTCare system but were performed outside the institution were excluded. The collected data were recorded in a password-protected Microsoft Excel file for further analysis. Results A total of 523 report recommendations from 422 abdominal and pelvic CT reports were analyzed. The most common organs indicated for CT scan evaluation were the breast (N = 54, 10.33%), kidney (N = 46, 8.80%), lymph node (N = 36, 6.88%), and colon (N = 33, 6.31%). The most common type of further evaluation recommended was further imaging (N = 410, 78.39%). A total of 278 (53.15%) recommendations were not performed, with 199 (71.58%) not having a documented rationale for noncompliance. Conclusion The majority of the follow-up imaging recommendations to ordering physicians were not carried out. This study highlights the need for notification and audit systems to monitor compliance with follow-up recommendations.

The pandemic introduces a significant degree of uncertainly to the grid operation in the presence of other extreme events like natural disasters, unprecedented outages, aging power grids, high proliferation of distributed generation, and cyber-attacks. This situation increases the need for measures for the resiliency of power grids to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic as well as simultaneous extreme events. Solutions to manage such an adverse scenario will be multi-fold: a) emergency planning and organizational support, b) following safety protocol, c) utilizing enhanced automation and sensing for situational awareness, and d) integration of advanced technologies and data points for ML-driven enhanced decision support. Enhanced digitalization and automation resulted in better network visibility at various levels, including generation, transmission, and distribution.

Systemic inflammation accompanied by a \\"cytokine storm,\\" hemostasis alterations and severe vasculitis have all been reported to occur with COVID-19, and emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of lipid transport may contribute to some of these complications. Here, we aim to summarize the current understanding of the potential mechanisms related to COVID-19 dyslipidemia and propose possible adjunctive type therapeutic approaches that modulate lipids and lipoproteins. Specifically, we hypothesize that changes in the quantity and composition of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that occurs with COVID-19 can significantly decrease the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative functions of HDL and could contribute to pulmonary inflammation. Furthermore, we propose that lipoproteins with oxidized phospholipids and fatty acids could lead to virus-associated organ damage via overactivation of innate immune scavenger receptors. Restoring lipoprotein function with ApoA-I raising agents or blocking relevant scavenger receptors with neutralizing antibodies could, therefore, be of value in the treatment of COVID-19. Finally, we discuss the role of omega-3 fatty acids transported by lipoproteins in generating specialized proresolving mediators and how together with anti-inflammatory drugs, they could decrease inflammation and thrombotic complications associated with COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19-Associated dyslipidemia: Implications for mechanism of impaired resolution and novel therapeutic approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vang focuses on race, politics, and community in the global pandemic.

Its advantages cover both analytical performance as well as ecological greenness. The quality control of pharmaceuticals requires sensitive, fast and economic methodologies to provide a high throughput at desirable costs. The low energy and decreased solvent consumption make this technique green as well as economic, and hence it is much preferred by pharmaceutical industries. Remdesivir is a recent antiviral, previously used for the treatment of Ebola virus infections, which was approved by the US-FDA in 2020 for treatment of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Formulation and wide-scale production of this drug started recently and hence methodologies related to its quality control are highly required. A smart spectrofluorimetric method was validated as per the US-FDA guidelines for the facile estimation of Remdesivir. The assay of Remdesivir was based on its native fluorescence measurements at pH 4 and wavelengths of 244/405 nm. Calibration was achieved over the range of 1.0-65.0 ng mL-1. Different variables affecting the proposed methodology were studied to achieve maximum sensitivity, at limits of detection and quantification of 0.287 and 0.871 ng mL-1, respectively. The developed method is regarded as the first spectrofluorimetric one for the estimation of Remdesivir. The developed method was also utilized for the determination of the drug in its formulated IV infusion and in spiked human plasma. Statistical analysis verified that this method is accurate and reproducible. Moreover, the ecological impact of the developed procedures was evaluated on two recently reported assessment metrics, the Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI) and AGREE-analytical greenness metric, to emphasize the greenness of the procedure.","output":"Green and sensitive spectrofluorimetric determination of Remdesivir, an FDA approved SARS-CoV-2 candidate antiviral; application in pharmaceutical dosage forms and spiked human plasma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging zoonotic disease, which causes high fever, thrombocytopenia, and death in humans and animals in East Asian countries. The pathogenicity of SFTS virus (SFTSV) remains unclear.

Weight loss is an established strategy to improve metabolic risk, including dyslipidemia. We aimed to determine weight loss goals for resolution of serum lipid abnormalities, by measuring improvements during progressive weight loss in obese individuals. METHODS We performed a prospective cohort study of obese individuals with the metabolic syndrome undergoing adjustable gastric banding. Lipid levels were monitored monthly for 9 months, then three monthly until 24 months. RESULTS There were 101 participants included, age 47.4  10.9 years with body mass index 42.6  5.9 kg/m2. At 24 months, total body weight loss (TBWL) was 18.3  7.9%. This was associated with significant improvements in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (1.18 vs 1.47, p < 0.001), triglyceride (2.0 vs 1.4, p < 0.001), and total cholesterol to HDL ratio (TC:HDL) (4.6 vs 3.6, p < 0.001). Over this time, progressive and linear improvements in HDL, triglycerides, and TC:HDL were seen with incremental weight loss (observed at 2.5% TBWL intervals). Significant improvements occurred after a threshold weight loss of 7.5-12.5% TBWL was achieved, with odds ratio (OR) 1.48-2.50 for normalization. These odds improved significantly with increasing weight loss (OR 18.2-30.4 with > 25% TBWL). Despite significant weight loss, there was no significant change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL). CONCLUSION Significant improvements in triglycerides, HDL, and TC:HDL occur after 7.5-12.5% TBWL, with ongoing benefit after greater weight loss. LDL needs to be addressed independently, as this was not observed to respond to weight loss alone.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing combined with WGS data analysis revealed frequent resistance to fluoroquinolones and the sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination that are among the most used treatments for invasive Salmonella. In contrast, resistance to the historical first-line drugs chloramphenicol and ampicillin, and to cephalosporins was rare. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was lower in clinical isolates compared to chicken strains pointing to the concern posed by the excessive use of antimicrobials in farming. Phylogenetic analysis suggested possible transmission of the emerging multidrug resistant (MDR) Kentucky ST198 and serotype Schwarzengrund from chicken to human.

Although widely used, long time survival analysis of treated liver metastases is still pending while also analysing the patients' experience of MR-based radiofrequency. METHODS Monocentric, retrospective analysis of long-time overall and progression free survival (OS; PFS) of 109 patients, treated with MRI-guided hepatic RFA between 1997 and 2010, focusing on colorectal cancer patients (CRC). Complimentary therapies were evaluated and Kaplan Meier-curves were calculated. Patients' experience of RFA was retrospectively assessed in 28 patients. RESULTS 1-, 3-, 5-, 10-year OS rates of 109 patients with different tumour entities were 83.4%, 53.4%, 31.0% and 22.9%, median 39.2 months, with decreasing survival rates for larger metastases size. For 72 CRC patients 1-, 3-, 5-, 10-year OS rates of 90.2%, 57.1%, 36.1% and 26.5% were documented (median 39.5 months). Thereof, beneficial outcome was detected for patients with prior surgery of the CRC including chemotherapy (median 53.0 months), and for liver metastases up to 19 mm (28.5% after 145 months).

Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully demonstrated to detect human IgG in serum samples, and the detection results were not statistically different (P > 0.05) from commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. This method is sensitive, fast, and accurate, which could be expanded to detect the specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Highly Sensitive Fluorescence-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Determination of Human IgG in Serum Using Quantum Dot Nanobeads and Magnetic Fe(3)O(4) Nanospheres"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging of infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which is a present major menace to public health, although intense research efforts, how, when, and where new diseases are appearing which still a source of considerable uncertainty is A serious respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, china At least 1,975cases had been reported till 25 January 2020, since the patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019 Epidemiology research has suggested that the beginning of the virus was associated with seafood contact in Wuhan Here we considered a single patient who was one of the workers in the market and was admitted to Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December of 2019 He was experiencing severe respiratory syndrome which is included with dizziness and cough After analysis, it was identified as a new RNA virus strain, from the family Coronaviridae, which is generally designated as WH-Human 1 Corona virus is also referred to 2019 CnCoV The phylogenetic analysis started that this virus was mostly closely selected to a group of SARS and MERS like corona virus these are previously been found in bats in China","output":"Corona virus-An upadated review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate the levels of self-disclosure in men undergoing in vitro fertilization and analyze the effects of communication and personality on self-disclosure.

Fimbria-assisted display of heterologous sequences is a paradigm for chimeric organelle display on bacteria. Fimbriae are particularly attractive candidates for epitope display for several reasons: (1) they are present in extremely high numbers at the cell surface, (2) they are strong immunogens, (3) they possess inherent adhesive properties, and (4) they can be easily purified. The majority of work dealing with fimbria-assisted peptide display has been focused on the development of recombinant vaccines. A number of different fimbrial types have been used to display immune-relevant sectors of various foreign proteins. Chimeric fimbrial vaccines can be used in the context of purified proteins, however the potential also exists to exploit this technology for the development of live recombinant vaccines. Work has also been performed demonstrating the amenability of fimbriae towards the powerful technology of random peptide display.

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, IL-10, and PAF), cortisol, and IgE in the pathogenesis of croup and the factors determining its clinical severity. Patients diagnosed with croup at the Pediatric Emergency Department were included and thirty healthy children were included as a control group. Patients\` demographic characteristics, clinical findings, recurrent croup history, and patient-family atopy history were recorded. Patients were grouped according to the Westley croup scoring system. Blood samples were taken from the control group and the patients for cytokines and cortisol. Respiratory pathogens were studied with PCR. Sixty-nine pediatric cases who were diagnosed as croup were included in the study (34 mild, 31 moderate, 4 severe). Group comparisons were made in terms of mild and moderate/severe groups. In the moderate/severe group, IL-10 and cortisol levels were higher than the mild group. The moderate/severe cortisol levels between 12:00 am-6:00 pm were found to be higher. PAF and TNF-alpha levels were detected to be higher in patients with a history of atopy. Viral agents were isolated in 45 patients; rhinovirus PCR tests were positive in 22 patients. In this study, rhinovirus was the most common etiology for croup. Increased levels of IL-10 and cortisol in the moderate/severe group indicate that different systemic and local mechanisms may play a role in the pathogenesis of croup.","output":"Are cytokines and cortisol important predictors for the severity of pediatric croup: A case control study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maximum likelihood (ML) estimators of the model parameters in multiple linear regression are obtained using genetic algorithm (GA) when the distribution of the error terms is long-tailed symmetric.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire consisting of 22 questions was delivered to 250 ophthalmologists via e-mail and a smartphone messaging application. A total of 113 ophthalmologists completed the survey. The questions included the participants demographic data (age, years in practice, institution, and city), changes in their working conditions and institutional preventive measures implemented during the pandemic, their personal COVID-19 experiences, the prevalence of telemedicine applications, and their attitudes toward these practices. RESULTS: Nearly half (47.8%) of the 113 ophthalmologists were 36 to 45 years old. In terms of years in practice, the largest proportion of respondents (28.3%) had 6-10 years of experience. Most of the participants worked in private/foundation universities (37.2%), while 22.1% worked in education and research clinics. Participants working at public universities most often reported that they or a close contact had to work in COVID wards (89.5%). Triage was performed in 51.5% of ophthalmology outpatient clinics, with 88.0% of these participants reporting that patients with fever, cough, or dyspnea were directed to the pandemic clinic without ophthalmological examination. All participants working in public hospitals, education and research clinics, and public university hospitals had postponed elective surgeries, whereas 12.5% of those working in private practice and 20.5% of those working in private/foundation universities reported that they continued elective surgeries. While 80.8% of the participants did not conduct online interviews or examinations, 40.4% stated that they considered telemedicine applications beneficial. Seventy-seven percent of participants expressed concern about a decrease in their income during the pandemic, with this being especially common among participants working in private practice (87.5%) and private/foundation university hospitals (85.7%). CONCLUSION: Ophthalmologists across our country have been affected by this pandemic at a level that will change their clinical approach. We think that ophthalmologists impacted by the difficulty of providing personal protective equipment and economic concerns should be supported more during the pandemic.","output":"Survey of the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Ophthalmology Clinical Practice in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a critical determinant to assess the severity of chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus. It has a close association with complications, comorbidities, and medical aid. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of medical comorbidities and determine the relationship between comorbidities and HRQoL among type 2 diabetic patients of southern Bangladesh. METHOD: This study was a cross-sectional study conducted through face to face interviews using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and by reviewing patients health records with prior written consent. The study was conducted on 2,136 patients with type 2 diabetes attending five hospitals of Chattogram, Bangladesh, during the tenure of November 2018 to July 2019. Quality of life was measured using the widely-used index of EQ-5D that considers 243 different health states and uses a scale in which 0 indicates a health state equivalent to death and 1 indicates perfect health status. The five dimensions of the quality index included mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. RESULTS: Patients with three comorbidities and with four or more comorbidities had a higher probability of reporting extreme problem or some problem in all five dimensions of the EQ-5D index compared with those without comorbidity (Odds ratio: mobility, 3.99 [2.72C5.87], 6.22 [3.80C10.19]; usual activity, 2.67 [1.76C4.06], 5.43 [3.28C8.98]; self-care, 2.60 [1.65C4.10], 3.95 [2.33C6.69]; pain or discomfort, 2.22 [1.48C3.33], 3.44 [1.83C6.45]; anxiety or depression, 1.75 [1.07C2.88], 2.45 [1.19C5.04]). The number of comorbidities had a negative impact on quality of life. CONCLUSION: Prevalent comorbidities were found to be the significant underlying cause of declined HRQoL. To raise diabetes awareness and for better disease management, the exposition of comorbidities in regards to HRQoL of people with diabetes should be considered for type 2 diabetes management schemas.","output":"The relationship between medical comorbidities and health-related quality of life among adults with type 2 diabetes: The experience of different hospitals in southern Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mandeep Dhaliwal and colleagues call for urgent correction of the response to covid-19 to safeguard the development of children and young people","output":"Covid-19 as a long multiwave event: implications for responses to safeguard younger generations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that has infected various countries in the world including Indonesia.

Patients were divided into two groups according to hospital mortality as survivors (n=43) and non-survivors (n=55). Results: The non-survivors group was statistically significantly older (67.3 +/- 9.7 versus 62.5 +/- 10.9;p=0.023). HT and DM were detected more in the non-survivors group than in the survivors group (p=0.031, p=0.018, respectively).

Although the mutation at the population level had been extensively investigated, how the mutations evolve at the individual level is largely unknown. Eighteen time-series fecal samples were collected from nine patients with COVID-19 during the convalescent phase. The nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 were enriched by the hybrid capture method. First, we demonstrated the outstanding performance of the hybrid capture method in detecting intra-host variants. We identified 229 intra-host variants at 182 sites in 18 fecal samples. Among them, nineteen variants presented frequency changes >0.3 within 1-5 days, reflecting highly dynamic intra-host viral populations. Moreover, the evolution of the viral genome demonstrated that the virus was probably viable in the gastrointestinal tract during the convalescent period. Meanwhile, we also found that the same mutation showed a distinct pattern of frequency changes in different individuals, indicating a strong random drift. In summary, dramatic changes of the SARS-CoV-2 genome were detected in fecal samples during the convalescent period; whether the viral load in feces is sufficient to establish an infection warranted further investigation.","output":"Dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 genome variants in the feces during convalescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Community\\\\based primary\\\\level workers (PWs) are an important strategy for addressing gaps in mental health service delivery in low\\\\ and middle\\\\income countries.

This study aims to evaluate the association between first-line antihypertensive drug class and medication adherence in a large Chinese population. METHODS: All patients prescribed  one antihypertensive drug in 2001C2003 and 2005 who have paid at least two consecutive clinic visits in the public healthcare system of Hong Kong were included. We excluded patients who have followed-up in the clinics for  30 days. Interval-based Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) was used to assess medication adherence. All patients were followed-up for up to 5 years. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the factors associated with optimal adherence, defined as PDC  80%. RESULTS: From 147,914 eligible patients, 69.2% were adherent to the antihypertensive prescriptions. When compared with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), patients initially prescribed -blockers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.234, 95% C.I. 0.215C0.256), -blockers (AOR = 0.447, 95% C.I. 0.420, 0.477), thiazide diuretics (AOR = 0.431 95% C.I. 0.399, 0.466) and calcium channel blockers (AOR = 0.451, 95% C.I. 0.423, 0.481) were significantly less likely to be drug adherers.

Methods & Materials Our laboratory developed a core set of ten questions that focused on common features found in major disease epidemics, including the affected populations, the response parameters and dynamics of governments, the natural source of the infectious agent, and the impacts of epidemics on societies as a whole. We utilized contemporary accounts including news coverage, written descriptions, documentary accounts, and primary literatures to determine full answers to the core questions. Results Eight of the ten questions identified commonalities between the AIDS and COVID-19 pandemics. These include slow government policy responses that negatively impacted the timing and the epidemic trajectory, involvement of marginalized populations of societies who were disproportionately affected by the diseases, discovery of existence of persistent economic and social inequalities, and introduction of lifelong morbidities in patients. Most importantly, this analysis found the importance of collaborative, scientifically driven political leadership as evidenced by the improved pace of disease control measures and research for therapeutic and vaccine discovery following adoption of evidence-based policy. Conclusion This analysis identifies multiple factors that paralleled the trajectory of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. In order to prepare for potential pandemics or large-scale outbreaks in the future, policies mindful of these lessons outlined will help provide guidance for future responses to emerging pathogens.","output":"Pandemic Parallels: Common Threads between the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health systems have become financially fragile owing to the economic recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, small primary care businesses have received less policy attention than public health and secondary care. We aimed to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the number of active small primary care businesses in South Korea. METHODS: We selected clinics, dental clinics, oriental clinics, and pharmacies as primary care businesses. Our estimation took advantage of regional variations in COVID-19 cases in South Korea. We determined the number of active primary care businesses from 2019 1Q to 2021 1Q on a quarterly basis, and conducted interrupted time series analysis to estimate the effects of COVID-19 on this sector. RESULTS: This study found no significant increase or decrease in the number of clinics, dental clinics, and oriental clinics immediately after the pandemic began or in the time trends after the pandemic. However, there was a significant increase in the number of pharmacies immediately after the pandemic. The most affected area presented different trends in the number of pharmacies, dental clinics, and oriental clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Impact of the pandemic on the number of active small primary care business were low in South Korea.

Understanding infection dynamics has important implications for methods employed in hospitals to prevent nosocomial-transmission events. Methods In this case series report we describe a cluster of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) in a tertiary care university hospital, in the early phases of the epidemic, after hospital visiting had been stopped and when the UK lockdown was in place. Findings A 48 year old patient developed COVID-19 31 days post-admission and four days after admission to a medical ward from ITU. Infection was likely acquired from an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic healthcare worker (HCW). Subsequent investigation over a 14 day period revealed symptoms in 23 staff members and five linked cases in patients on the same ward. Nine of the 23 affected staff members provided care for and had direct exposure with the index case. Four staff reported caring for the index case without use of personal protective equipment. One was coughed on directly by the patient 24 hours prior to the onset of symptoms. Conclusion SARS CoV2 infection can be introduced to a ward area by asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic healthcare workers. Staff members and patients can act as Trojan horses carrying infection into and around the hospital, setting up unexpected transmission events. Transmission of infection from pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic individuals means that universal use of measures to prevent transmission is required for successful reduction of transmission events in the hospital setting.","output":"Health Care Workers and Patients as Trojan Horses: a COVID19 ward outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many industries, including pharmacy, rapidly expanded the use of telecommuting workers to assure business continuity and address social distancing needs. The purpose of this commentary is to identify potential benefits of telecommuting in pharmacy practice and provide implementation recommendations for its use in pharmacy practice. SUMMARY Advances in electronic health records and telepharmacy over the past 2 decades enabled pharmacy leaders to easily adapt their practice models to allow for telecommuting alternatives during the pandemic. While these changes were generally intended to be part of the short-term response, the sustained expansion of telecommuting within the pharmacy profession merits further exploration. Documented experience with telepharmacy and telehealth indicate a wide array of clinical and operational pharmacist activities that could be conducted by telecommuters. In addition, experience with telecommuters in other industries suggests potential benefits ranging from improving pharmacists' work-life balance to mitigating postpandemic financial burden. CONCLUSION Healthcare organizations should consider integrating part-time telecommuter pharmacists into contemporary practice models to address other frontline issues and facilitate ongoing expansion of clinical pharmacy services to meet emerging patient needs.","output":"Leveraging telecommuting pharmacists in the post-COVID-19 world."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the first phase of the Movement Control Order, many medical lecturers had difficulty adapting to the online teaching and learning methods that were made compulsory by the institutional directives Some of these lecturers are clinicians who need to juggle between clinical work and teaching, and consider a two-week adaptation during this period to be not enough Furthermore, converting traditional face-to-face learning to online formats for undergraduate and postgraduate clinical programmes would reduce the learning outcomes, especially those related to clinical applications and the acquisition of new skills This editorial discusses the impact that movement restrictions have had on medical teaching and learning, the alternatives and challenges and the way forward","output":"Sustainable Medical Teaching and Learning During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Surviving the New Normal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding what influences the ability of some arthropods to harbor and transmit pathogens may be key for controlling the spread of vector-borne diseases. Arthropod immunity has a central role in dictating vector competence for pathogen acquisition and transmission. Microbial infection elicits immune responses and imparts stress on the host by causing physical damage and nutrient deprivation, which triggers evolutionarily conserved stress response pathways aimed at restoring cellular homeostasis. Recent studies increasingly recognize that eukaryotic stress responses and innate immunity are closely intertwined. Herein, we describe two well-characterized and evolutionarily conserved mechanisms, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), and examine evidence that these stress responses impact immune signaling. We then describe how multiple pathogens, including vector-borne microbes, interface with stress responses in mammals. Owing to the well-conserved nature of the UPR and ISR, we speculate that similar mechanisms may be occurring in arthropod vectors and ultimately impacting vector competence. We conclude this Perspective by positing that novel insights into vector competence will emerge when considering that stress-signaling pathways may be influencing the arthropod immune network.","output":"Arthropods Under Pressure: Stress Responses and Immunity at the Pathogen-Vector Interface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are well described in P. falciparum (PF) and to a lesser extent in other malaria species.

Also they impact religious practices particularly those performed by Muslims in Indonesia. This paper will discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of Islamic law. There are two main issues to analyze. First, what is the impact of COVID-19 on community activities in the view of Islamic law? Second, what is the impact of COVID-19 on religious communities in carrying out worship? This paper finds that the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted religious worship activities in public places by considering this virus rapid transmission. It is followed by the closure of worship places to encourage citizens to practice their religious activities at home. Thus the whole community was urged and some were prohibited following the mapping zone experienced by each region.

The impact of COVID-19 on urological services in different geographical areas is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the global impact of COVID-19 on urological providers and the provision of urological patient care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted from March 30, 2020 to April 7, 2020. A 55-item questionnaire was developed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of urological services. Target respondents were practising urologists, urology trainees, and urology nurses/advanced practice providers. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was the degree of reduction in urological services, which was further stratified by the geographical location, degree of outbreak, and nature and urgency of urological conditions. The secondary outcome was the duration of delay in urological services. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 1004 participants responded to our survey, and they were mostly based in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. Worldwide, 41% of the respondents reported that their hospital staff members had been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, 27% reported personnel shortage, and 26% had to be deployed to take care of COVID-19 patients. Globally, only 33% of the respondents felt that they were given adequate personal protective equipment, and many providers expressed fear of going to work (47%). It was of concerning that 13% of the respondents were advised not to wear a surgical face mask for the fear of scaring their patients, and 21% of the respondents were advised not to discuss COVID-19 issues or concerns on media. COVID-19 had a global impact on the cut-down of urological services, including outpatient clinic appointments, outpatient investigations and procedures, and urological surgeries. The degree of cut-down of urological services increased with the degree of COVID-19 outbreak. On average, 28% of outpatient clinics, 30% of outpatient investigations and procedures, and 31% of urological surgeries had a delay of >8 wk. Urological services for benign conditions were more affected than those for malignant conditions. Finally, 47% of the respondents believed that the accumulated workload could be dealt with in a timely manner after the COVID-19 outbreak, but 50% thought the postponement of urological services would affect the treatment and survival outcomes of their patients. One of the limitations of this study is that Africa, Australia, and New Zealand were under-represented. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a profound global impact on urological care and urology providers. The degree of cut-down of urological services increased with the degree of COVID-19 outbreak and was greater for benign than for malignant conditions. One-fourth of urological providers were deployed to assist with COVID-19 care. Many providers reported insufficient personal protective equipment and support from hospital administration. PATIENT SUMMARY: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has led to significant delay in outpatient care and surgery in urology, particularly in regions with the most COVID-19 cases. A considerable proportion of urology health care professionals have been deployed to assist in COVID-19 care, despite the perception of insufficient training and protective equipment.","output":"A Global Survey on the Impact of COVID-19 on Urological Services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundA spiral fracture of the tibia with no injury to the fibula is known as a toddlers fracture.

When other types of fracture were excluded, 74 patients were identified, and their notes were retrospectively analysed. Two children were eliminated as they had followed the pre-COVID pathway. Three children had two attendances and their second presentation was directly related to the first, so the second presentation was removed for each. This gave a total of 69 attendances.Results68% of children were male;there was no pattern of age or date of presentation. 68 children with a suspected toddler fracture had an x-ray and fractures were seen in 37% of them. 94% of children were placed in a soft wrap and 100% were referred to Fracture Clinic. 75% of children were seen in virtual fracture clinic;time until follow-up varied from 1 to 91 days, with 56% being reviewed between 8 and 35 days after presentation. 7% had appointments made but no letters from these were available so it is not known whether the appointment occurred. 12 children (17%) had no follow-up appointment;8 were given advice about cast removal and where to seek help if the child did not recover, 2 had no further information, 1 had multiple unsuccessful attempts to contact the family documented and 1 had no appointment made. No children reattended ED for advice about cast removal or follow-up;3 children reattended after a second injury or ongoing refusal to weight-bear after cast removal.ConclusionsMoving to a virtual follow-up system has been broadly successful, with most children being followed-up in a timely fashion.

OBJECTIVE: This review addresses how humans typically regulate interpersonal distances, in order to highlight the challenges of enforcing atypically large interpersonal distances. METHOD: To understand the challenges posed by social distancing requirements, we integrate relevant contributions from visual perception, social perception, and human factors. RESULTS: To date, research on preferred interpersonal distances suggests that social distancing could induce discomfort, heighten arousal, and decrease social signaling in the short term. While the protracted effects of social distancing are unclear, we propose hypotheses on the mid- to long-term consequences of violating preferred norms of interpersonal distances. CONCLUSION: We suggest that enforcing a physical distance of 1.5-2 m presents a serious challenge to behavioral norms.

In recent years, infections with this bacteria have been reported in Central Europe, especially in the German Baltic coast but also in France and Italy. Climate warming causes the sea temperature to increase every year, which translates to an increased risk of infections from the Vibrio group. Most of these are mild and present as wound infections, but some patients develop life-threatening sepsis from either ingestion of infected mollusks or wound lesions that develop into generalized infections. Illness may be associated with necrotizing fasciitis and may require several weeks of therapy, often based on a surgical operation, demarcation of necrosis or limb amputation. A case such as the one described in this manuscript has not been previously described in Poland and demonstrates the need for a multidisciplinary approach to infection with Vibrio vulnificus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old patient was pricked with an unknown object in the side of a lower limb during his stay at the Polish seaside. He developed a life-threatening infection in the form of severe sepsis with multiple organ failure. He required broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and after obtaining results for Vibrio vulnificus targeted therapy, a surgical operation with skin lesion decompression and fasciotomy was performed. Finally, hyperbaric chamber therapy was given. The patients general condition improved, and local changes and his vital parameters stabilized. CONCLUSION: Vibrio vulnificus infection may be confused with other causes of skin and subcutaneous tissue infection, although it requires a different approach and different targeted antibiotic therapies.

SARS n-CoV2 is known to affect the lungs of the COVID-19 positive patients. Chest x-rays are the most widely used imaging technique for clinical diagnosis due to fast imaging time and low cost. The purpose of this study is to use deep learning technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 using chest x-rays. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a data set containing confirmed COVID-19 positive, common bacterial pneumonia and healthy cases (no infection). A collection of 1,428 x-ray images is used in this study. The authors used a pre-trained VGG-16 model for the classification task. Transfer learning with fine-tuning was used in this study to effectively train the network on a relatively small chest x-ray data set. Initial experiments show that the model achieves promising results and can be greatly used to expedite COVID-19 detection. Findings: The authors achieved an accuracy of 96% and 92.5% in two and three output class cases, respectively. Based on these findings, the medical community can access using x-ray images as possible diagnostic tool for faster COVID-19 detection to complement the already testing and diagnosis methods.

Gordon et al. previously conducted a review of medical education developments in response to COVID-19; however, the field has rapidly evolved in the ensuing months. This scoping review aims to map the extent, range and nature of subsequent developments, summarizing the expanding evidence base and identifying areas for future research. METHODS: The authors followed the five stages of a scoping review outlined by Arskey and O'Malley. Four online databases and MedEdPublish were searched. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. Included articles described developments in medical education deployed in response to COVID-19 and reported outcomes. Data extraction was completed by two authors and synthesized into a variety of maps and charts. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven articles were included: 104 were from North America, Asia and Europe; 51 were undergraduate, 41 graduate, 22 continuing medical education, and 13 mixed; 35 were implemented by universities, 75 by academic hospitals, and 17 by organizations or collaborations. The focus of developments included pivoting to online learning (n = 58), simulation (n = 24), assessment (n = 11), well-being (n = 8), telehealth (n = 5), clinical service reconfigurations (n = 4), interviews (n = 4), service provision (n = 2), faculty development (n = 2) and other (n = 9). The most common Kirkpatrick outcome reported was Level 1, however, a number of studies reported 2a or 2b. A few described Levels 3, 4a, 4b or other outcomes (e.g. quality improvement). CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review mapped the available literature on developments in medical education in response to COVID-19, summarizing developments and outcomes to serve as a guide for future work. The review highlighted areas of relative strength, as well as several gaps. Numerous articles have been written about remote learning and simulation and these areas are ripe for full systematic reviews.

Study design: High-speed photographic evaluation of aerosol and smoke generated in simulated surgical fields. Materials and methods: Surgical site aerosol clearance was evaluated using a model of the anterior neck and prototypes for surgical site evacuator ports created using 3D printing. A commercially available electrocautery handpiece fitted with an evacuator was tested on animal tissue for smoke clearance. Both systems were connected to a commercial vacuum powered evacuation system. High speed photography was used to record videos of the aerosols and plumes. Fields were recorded with and without evacuation. Results: Efficient aerosol clearance from an open surgical field using an evacuator port is dependent upon the port design, airflow velocity, and placement relative to the aerosol generating site. The size and surface geometry of the surgical field are also important. Surgical smoke generated with electrocautery is cleared from the field by the evacuation enclosure around the handpiece, even at high electrocautery power settings. Except for device noise, there appears to be no reason for using evacuator flow rates below the maximum setting. Conclusions: Bioaerosol and smoke generated during surgery are potential sources of respiratory pathogens and pose a threat to operating room personnel. Surgical site evacuation can significantly reduce the volume of airborne particles in the field but requires careful design and deployment considerations.","output":"High Speed Photographic Detection of Particle Distribution During Aerosol and Smoke Generating Surgical Procedures: Effects of Surgical Site Evacuation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Of the approximately 1 million people living with multiple sclerosis in the United States, more than half receive informal, unpaid care or support from family or friends (caregivers). These caregivers report high levels of stress, anxiety, and negative emotions. Few researchers have conducted psychoeducational interventions for these caregivers. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a protocol for a randomized clinical trial that aims to test the efficacy of two interventions for improving stress, anxiety, depression, and negative emotions for caregivers of persons with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: Participants included any self-identified family or friend caregiver of a person with multiple sclerosis. Data collection began in April 2021 and is expected to continue until November 2021. Participants will be randomized to receive either a website-only or a website-coaching intervention delivered for 6 weeks. Data will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline (after delivery of intervention), and 6 weeks later. RESULTS: The protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Case Western Reserve University on January 21, 2021 (protocol 20201484). As of May 2021, 66 participants were enrolled.

Global reports of HIV/SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 coinfection are limited. To better understand the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic on persons with HIV and improve their care, we present an outpatient and inpatient clinical experience of HIV/SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 coinfection from Rhode Island, US. METHODS: We describe outpatient and inpatient preparedness for the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, and present a case series of all known patients with HIV/SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 coinfection at The Miriam Hospital and Rhode Island Hospital, and The Miriam Hospital Infectious Diseases and Immunology Center, in Providence, Rhode Island, US. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The Infectious Diseases and Immunology Center rapidly prepared for outpatient and inpatient care of persons with HIV and SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. Between 30 March and 20 May 2020, 27 patients with HIV were diagnosed with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. Twenty were male, six female and one transgender female; average age was 49 years; 13/27 were Hispanic and 6/27 were African American. All had HIV viral load <200 copies/mL and were on antiretroviral therapy with CD4 count range 87 to 1441 cells/L. Twenty\\\\six of the 27 had common COVID\\\\19 symptoms for one to twenty\\\\eight days and most had other co\\\\morbidities and/or risk factors. Nine of the 27 were hospitalized for one to thirteen days; of those, three lived in a nursing home, six received remdesivir through a clinical trial or emergency use authorization and tolerated it well; eight recovered and one died. Overall, 17% of known Center people had HIV/SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 coinfection, whereas the comparable state\\\\wide prevalence was 9%. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight challenges of outpatient and inpatient HIV care in the setting of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and present the largest detailed case series to date from the United States on HIV/SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 coinfection, adding to limited global reports. The aggregated clinical findings suggest that the clinical presentation and outcomes of COVID\\\\19 appear consistent with those without HIV.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of the lockdown on the air quality of Nanjing, China. The off-axis measurements from state-of-the-art remote-sensing Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscope (MAX-DOAS) were used to observe the trace gases, i.e., Formaldehyde (HCHO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), along with the in-situ time series of NO2, SO2 and Ozone (O3). The total dataset covers the span of five months, from 1 December 2019, to 10 May 2020, which comprises of four phases, i.e., the pre lockdown phase (1 December 2019, to 23 January 2020), Phase-1 lockdown (24 January 2020, to 26 February 2020), Phase-2 lockdown (27 February 2020, to 31 March 2020), and post lockdown (1 April 2020, to 10 May 2020). The observed results clearly showed that the concentrations of selected pollutants were lower along with improved air quality during the lockdown periods (Phase-1 and Phase-2) with only the exception of O3, which showed an increasing trend during lockdown. The study concluded that limited anthropogenic activities during the spring festival and lockdown phases improved air quality with a significant reduction of selected trace gases, i.e., NO2 59%, HCHO 38%, and SO2 33%. We also compared our results with 2019 data for available gases. Our results imply that the air pollutants concentration reduction in 2019 during Phase-2 was insignificant, which was due to the business as usual conditions after the Spring Festival (Phase-1) in 2019. In contrast, a significant contamination reduction was observed during Phase-2 in 2020 with the enforcement of a Level-II response in lockdown conditions i.e., the easing of the lockdown situation in some sectors during a specific interval of time. The observed ratio of HCHO to NO2 showed that tropospheric ozone production involved Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) limited scenarios.","output":"Investigating the impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on trace gases using ground-based MAX-DOAS observations in Nanjing, China.

This study explores maternal obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) as a potentially modifiable risk factor for FGR. We hypothesise that, in pregnancies complicated by FGR, treating mothers who have OSA using positive airway pressure (PAP) will improve birth weight and neonatal outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Sleep Apnea and Fetal Growth Restriction study is a prospective, block-randomised, single-blinded, multicentre, pragmatic controlled trial. We enrol pregnant women aged 18C50, between 22 and 31 weeks of gestation, with established FGR based on second trimester ultrasound, who do not have other prespecified known causes of FGR (such as congenital anomalies or intrauterine infection). In stage 1, participants are screened by questionnaire for OSA risk. If OSA risk is identified, participants proceed to stage 2, where they undergo home sleep apnoea testing. Participants are determined to have OSA if they have an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) 5 (if the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) is also 5) or if they have an AHI 10 (even if the ODI is <5). These participants proceed to stage 3, where they are randomised to nightly treatment with PAP or no PAP (standard care control), which is maintained until delivery. The primary outcome is unadjusted birth weight; secondary outcomes include fetal growth velocity on ultrasound, enrolment-to-delivery interval, gestational age at delivery, birth weight corrected for gestational age, stillbirth, Apgar score, rate of admission to higher levels of care (neonatal intensive care unit or special care nursery) and length of neonatal stay. These outcomes are compared between PAP and control using intention-to-treat analysis.

Furthermore, no clear recommendation was made for patients with a previous COVID-19 infection and a favorable outcome who were seeking bariatric surgery. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the risks of specific complications for patients with previous COVID-19 infection who were admitted for bariatric surgery. SETTING: Eight high-volume private centers from 5 countries. METHODS: All patients with morbid obesity and previous COVID-19 infection admitted for bariatric surgery were included in the current study. Patients were enrolled from 8 centers and 5 countries, and their electronic health data were reviewed retrospectively. The primary outcome was to identify early (<30 d) specific complications related to COVID-19 infection following bariatric surgery, and the secondary outcome was to analyze additional factors from work-ups that could prevent complications. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with a mean age of 40 years (range, 21-68 yr) and a mean body mass index of 44.3 kg/m2 (7.4 kg/m2) with previous COVID-19 infection underwent different bariatric procedures: 23 cases of sleeve (65.7 %), 7 cases of bypass, and 5 other cases. The symptomatology of the previous COVID-19 infection varied: 15 patients had no symptoms, 12 had fever and respiratory signs, 5 had only fever, 2 had digestive symptoms, and 1 had isolated respiratory signs. Only 5 patients (14.2 %) were hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, for a mean period of 8.8 days (range, 6-15 d). One patient was admitted to an intensive care unit and needed invasive mechanical ventilation. The mean interval time from COVID-19 infection to bariatric surgery was 11.3 weeks (3-34 wk). The mean hospital stay was 1.7 days (1 d), and all patients were clinically evaluated 1 month following the bariatric procedure. There were 2 readmissions and 1 case of complication: that case was of a gastric leak treated with laparoscopic drainage and a repeated pigtail drain, with a favorable outcome. No cases of other specific complications or mortality were recorded. CONCLUSION: Minor and moderate COVID-19 infections, especially the forms not complicated with invasive mechanical ventilation, should not preclude the indication for bariatric surgery.

The analysis concludes that despite the substantial recent inflow of third country nationals into Hungary, it remains to be seen whether this has a real substitution effect for the lost domestic labour force.","output":"Key features of intra-EU labour mobility and its impact from a sending country perspective: Addressing the consequences in Hungary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, gradual improvements in communication and connectivity technologies have enabled new technical possibilities for the adoption of chatbots across diverse sectors such as customer services, trade, and marketing.

The regulation of autophagy has been elucidated through the combined study of yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, mice, Drosophila melanogaster, and humans. MTOR, the major negative regulator of autophagy, and activating nutrient kinases, such as 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), interact with the autophagy regulatory complex: ULK1/2, RB1CC1, ATG13, and ATG101. The ULK1/2 complex induces autophagy by phosphorylating downstream autophagy complexes, such as the BECN1 PIK3 signaling complex that leads to the creation of LC3+ autophagosomes. We highlight in this review various reports of autophagy induction that are independent of these regulators. We discuss reports of MTOR-independent, AMPK-independent, ULK1/2-independent, and BECN1-PIK3C3-independent autophagy. We illustrate that autophagy induction and the components required vary by the nature of the induction signal and type of cell and do not always require canonical members of the autophagy signaling pathway. We illustrate that rather than thinking of autophagy as a linear pathway, it is better to think of autophagy induction as an interconnecting web of key regulators, many of which can induce autophagy through different requirements depending on the type and length of induction signals.","output":"So Many Roads: the Multifaceted Regulation of Autophagy Induction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STEAM is the term given to a growing field of research and practice that integrates arts into traditional science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects.

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to described the clinical outcomes and further explored risk factors of in-hospital death for COVID-19 classified as critical type. METHODS This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. From February 5, 2020 to March 4, 2020, 98 consecutive patients classified as critical COVID-19 were included in Huo Shen Shan Hospital. The final date of follow-up was March 29, 2020. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Multivariable Cox regression model was used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS Of the 98 patients, 43 (43.9%) died in hospital, 37(37.8%) discharged, and 18(18.4%) remained in hospital. The mean age was 68.5 (63, 75) years, and 57 (58.2%) were female. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (68.4%), followed by diabetes (17.3%), angina pectoris (13.3%). Except the sex (Female: 68.8% vs 49.1%, P=0.039) and angina pectoris (20.9% vs 7.3%, P = 0.048), there was no difference in other demographics and comorbidities between non-survivor and survivor groups. The proportion of elevated alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, D-dimer and cardiac injury marker were 59.4%, 35.7%, 87.5% and 42.9%, respectively, and all showed the significant difference between two groups. The acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury (AKI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were observed in 42.9%, 27.8% and 26.5% of the patients. Compared with survivor group, non-survivor group had more acute cardiac injury (79.1% vs 14.5%, P<0.0001), AKI (50.0% vs 10.9%, P<0.0001), and ARDS (37.2% vs 18.2%, P=0.034). Multivariable Cox regression showed increasing hazard ratio of in-hospital death associated with acute cardiac injury (HR, 6.57 [95% CI, 1.89-22.79]) and AKI (HR, 2.60 [95% CI, 1.15-5.86]).

The aim of this study was to compare Psychology and Veterinary Science undergraduate students academic performance with their responses on a self-reported questionnaire regarding their digital capabilities, individuals characteristics, and the role of environment on their independent learning process over the first COVID-19 lockdown period. Social-Cognitive Theory was adopted to conceptualise students behaviour, individuals characteristics, and learning environment with their academic performance to a learning framework. A total of 303 students from both disciplines (133 Psychology and 170 Veterinary Science undergraduate students) participated in this study by completing an online questionnaire after following the teaching shift from blended learning to full remote online approach at a UK University during the 2019C2020 academic year. Differences between students responses were identified due to their disciplines curricular structure, students study behaviours (i.e., being exposed to unrelated learning activities), and students cognitive effort to think critically in the search, evaluation and managing of digital information. Students with high level of self-regulation and digital capabilities were able to keep focused and engaged during the lockdown. Although universities and teachers were forced to shift their teaching approach due to the unfortunate disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, most students have coped with the changed teaching delivery mode relatively easy with minimum guidance.

METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 64 patients who underwent surgery for TOF and 60 normal children. The angle between the left pulmonary artery and main pulmonary artery was measured using echocardiography and computed tomography angiography (CTA). Furthermore, STI was used to record the global longitudinal strain of the four-chamber view (GLS4), the global longitudinal strain of the two-chamber view (GLS2), and the global longitudinal strain of the right ventricle (RVGLS). RESULTS: The GLS4, GLS2, and RVGLS values in the TOF groups with different pulmonary artery branch angles were significantly lower than those in the control group. Furthermore, the GLS2 and RVGLS values were significantly lower for angles of 90-100 and <90 (vs >100). Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that pulmonary regurgitation and the angle between the left and main pulmonary arteries were two important factors affecting RVGLS. The Bland-Altman consistency test revealed good agreement regarding the pulmonary artery branch angles measured using echocardiography and CTA. CONCLUSION: In patients with TOF, the RVGLS was lower for acute left pulmonary artery angulation than for round and blunt left pulmonary artery angulation. The angle of the pulmonary artery branches was an important factor affecting RVGLS. Echocardiography can be used to measure the angle of the pulmonary artery branches, which provides valuable information for surgical correction of pulmonary artery morphology.","output":"Assessing right ventricular systolic function using ultrasonic speckle-tracking imaging in repaired Tetralogy of Fallot with different pulmonary artery branch angles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Radiation therapy (RT), an essential treatment of cancer, involves multiple hospital visits. We hypothesized that radiation departments would adjust their work patterns and RT protocols in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Materials and methods: An electronic survey was sent during April 2020 to an international sample of radiation oncologists. The survey explored various aspects of departmental preparedness, and changes to their institutional RT protocols. Results: A total of 68 radiation oncologists from 13 countries answered the survey. Healthcare systems were at least moderately affected in 76%. Most institutes appeared well prepared for the outbreak: regarding the availability of personal protective equipment, tests, and telemedicine/videoconference facilities. Screening for SARS-CoV-2 was applied in 59% of responders. Modification of RT protocols were minor in 66%, significant in 19% and no changes made in 15%. The extent to which protocols were modified correlated with overall healthcare disruption (p = 0.028). Normal fractionation was recommended to continue in 83% and 85% of head & neck, and cervical cancers vs. 64% of lung cancers (p = 0.001). In case the pandemic worsens, there was strong agreement to prioritize RT for aggressive cancers (80%), delay RT for slow-growing tumors (78%) and change to evidance-based hypofractionations protocols (79.4%). The option of delayed/omitted adjuvant RT (not site specific) was selected in 47%. Conclusion: This international survey concludes that, by making significant organizational adjustments and minor protocol modifications, RT may be safely continued during this pandemic.

In this study we looked at the effect of M2 macrophages on HSV-1 infectivity using mice either lacking M2 (M2(-/-)) or overexpressing M2 (M2-OE) macrophages. While presence or absence of M2 macrophages had no effect on eye disease, we found that over expression of M2 macrophages was associated with increased phagocytosis, increased primary virus replication, increased latency, and increased expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, in mice lacking M2 macrophages following infection phagocytosis, replication, latency, and cytokine expression were similar to wild type mice.

As successful recanalization has been suggested as major determinant of outcome, the early identification of modifiable factors associated with successful recanalization could be of importance to improve functional outcome. Hyperglycemia has been associated with enhanced thrombin generation and unfavorably altered clot features. OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that serum baseline glucose is associated with likelihood of vessel recanalization mediated by collateral quality and clot burden in BAO stroke. METHODS BAO stroke patients who received multimodal CT on admission were analyzed. The association of vessel recanalization defined using modified Thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scale (mTICI) scores 2b-3, and baseline imaging and clinical parameters were tested in logistic regression analyses. Collateral quality and clot burden were evaluated using the Basilar Artery on CT-Angiography (BATMAN) score. RESULTS Out of 117 BAO patients, 91 patients (78%) underwent MT. In 70 patients (77%), successful recanalization could be achieved (mTICI 2b/3). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, only a higher BGL (aOR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.99, p = 0.03) and higher BATMAN score (aOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.11-2.82, p = 0.02) were independently associated with vessel recanalization. Application of alteplase, or time from symptom onset-imaging revealed no independent association with recanalization status. CONCLUSION Higher BGL was significantly associated with reduced likelihood for recanalization success besides BATMAN score as a measure of collateral quality and clot burden.

Lower coping self-efficacy and social support levels increase this risk. Although highly relevant, it is unknown if the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic amplifies these risks. AIMS: To examine if the prevalence, incidence and/or mean scores for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression symptoms, general mental health problems, coping self-efficacy, lack of emotional support and social acknowledgement are higher among adults victimised in the year after the COVID-19 outbreak compared with adults victimised in a similar period before the outbreak. Also, to compare symptoms, problems and support within non-victims during the same period. METHOD: Data was extracted from four surveys of the VICTIMS study (March 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021), based on a random sample of the Dutch population. Multivariate logistic regression analyses and mixed-effects models were used to examine differences between the two victim groups (2019: n = 421, 2021: n = 319) and non-victims (n = 3245). RESULTS: Adults victimised after the outbreak more often had PTSD, anxiety and depression symptoms, general mental health problems and lower coping self-efficacy than those victimised before. They did not differ in lack of support and acknowledgement. Both victim groups differed from non-victims, where mental health problems and lack of support levels were much lower and almost stable.

Although there are several promising drug candidates in clinical trials, none is available clinically. Thus, the drug repurposing approach may help to overcome the current pandemic. Methods The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for cleaving nascent polypeptide chains. Here, FDA-approved antiviral and anti-infection drugs were screened by high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) followed by re-docking with standard-precision (SP) and extra-precision (XP) molecular docking. The most potent drug's binding was further validated by free energy calculations (Prime/MM-GBSA) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Results Out of 1397 potential drugs, 157 showed considerable affinity towards Mpro. After HTVS, SP, and XP molecular docking, four high-affinity lead drugs (Iodixanol, Amikacin, Troxerutin, and Rutin) with docking energies -10.629 to -11.776kcal/mol range were identified. Among them, Amikacin exhibited the lowest Prime/MM-GBSA energy (-73.800kcal/mol). It led us to evaluate other aminoglycosides (Neomycin, Paramomycin, Gentamycin, Streptomycin, and Tobramycin) against Mpro. All aminoglycosides were bound to the substrate-binding site of Mpro and interacted with crucial residues. Altogether, Amikacin was found to be the most potent inhibitor of Mpro. MD simulations of the Amikacin-Mpro complex suggested the formation of a complex stabilized by hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals interactions. Conclusion Aminoglycosides may serve as a scaffold to design potent drug molecules against COVID-19.

The dataset used was large and comprehensive to develop robust profiles of vulnerable households. This is executed employing the sustainable livelihoods framework. The findings show that human and financial capital plays a critical role in making rural households resilient from vulnerability to food insecurity. The failure of natural resources to support agricultural livelihoods emerged as an important factor for rural household vulnerability to food insecurity. Gender-based imbalances still prevail, explaining most of the rural household vulnerability to food insecurity. Female-dominated households still endure most of the prevailing vulnerabilities to food insecurity, and this is even worse for households headed by younger females. Policies, strategies, and institutions in South Africa have not been able to address household vulnerability to food insecurity.

Methods: From December 2018 to March 2019, 10 inpatients with mild and 10 inpatients with severe influenza pneumonia admitted to the Department of Infection and Clinical Microbiology of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital were included. Clariom&#8482; D gene chip was used to explore the circRNA expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from the patients. The absolute value of the fold change (FC value)>2 and P<0.05 were used as the criteria to screen the differentially expressed circRNA, and the gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome database (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, KEGG) signal pathway enrichment analysis were also performed. Results: The age of mild patients [M (P25, P75)] was 62.0 (34.5, 69.8) years old, including 4 males; the age of severe patients [M (P25, P75)] was 50.0 (37.0, 60.0) years old, all were males. A total of 137 differentially expressed circRNAs in PBMCs of mild and severe patients were screened. The numbers of up-regulated and down-regulated circRNAs in mild patients were 101 and 36, respectively. Among them, hsa_circ_0091073 (FC value=160.898, P<0.05) was the most significantly up-regulated circRNA and hsa_circ_0092219 (FC value =-17.630, P<0.05) was the most significantly down-regulated circRNA. GO enrichment analysis showed that a total of 111 secondary GO items were significantly associated with related differential expression of circRNA (P<0.05). The GO terms associated with upregulated circRNAs included DNA-templated transcription, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase a ? promoter, etc.; The GO terms associated with downregulated circRNAs included neutrophil degranulation, killing of cells of other organism, defense response to fungus, etc. KEGG signaling pathway analysis showed that there were 37 metabolic pathways related to differentially expressed circRNAs (P<0.05). Signaling pathways related to up-regulated circRNAs included nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, etc. Signaling pathways related to down-regulation of circRNAs included cancer transcription disorders, folate carbon pool, and other types of O-glycan biosynthesis. Conclusion: The expression of circRNA in PBMC of mild and severe influenza pneumonia patients is significantly different, and it may play a role in the pathogenic mechanism of influenza pneumonia through multiple signal pathways.","output":"[Differential circRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells among mild and severe influenza-associated pneumonia patients]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This study investigated viruses in bovine respiratory disease (BRD) cases in feedlots, including bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine coronaviruses (BoCV) and parainfluenza-3 virus (PI3V). Nasal swabs were collected from 114 cattle on initial BRD treatment. Processing included modified live virus (MLV) vaccination. Seven BRD necropsy cases were included for 121 total cases. Mean number of days on feed before first sample was 14.9 days. Swabs and tissue homogenates were tested by gel based PCR (G-PCR), quantitative-PCR (qPCR) and quantitative real time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and viral culture. There were 87/114 (76.3%) swabs positive for at least one virus by at least one test. All necropsy cases were positive for at least one virus. Of 121 cases, positives included 18/121 (14.9%) BoHV-1; 19/121 (15.7%) BVDV; 76/121 (62.8%) BoCV; 11/121 (9.1%) BRSV; and 10/121 (8.3%) PI3V. For nasal swabs, G-PCR (5 viruses) detected 44/114 (38.6%); q-PCR and qRT-PCR (4 viruses) detected 81/114 (71.6%); and virus isolation detected 40/114 (35.1%). Most were positive for only one or two tests, but not all three tests. Necropsy cases had positives: 5/7 G-PCR, 5/7 q-PCR and qRT-PCR, and all were positive by cell culture. In some cases, G-PCR and both real time PCR were negative for BoHV-1, BVDV, and PI3V in samples positive by culture. PCR did not differentiate field from vaccines strains of BoHV-1, BVDV, and PI3V.

The mask prices came down quickly, ensuring public health and suppressing the spread of the pandemic, and the sales of KF94 masks reverted to the free market system on July 12, 2020. This paper aims to evaluate the unintended consequence of public masks to mitigate any negative effects for future deployment. METHODS: The relationship between the offline and online prices of KF94 masks and the production quantity of medical masks was estimated using the data after July 12, 2020 (the free market period), and, given the regression results, counterfactual analyses were conducted to predict what the offline and online prices of KF94 masks would have been before July 12, 2020 (the public masks period) had the sales of medical masks reverted to the free market system a month earlier than July 12, 2020. RESULTS: The prolonged deployment of public masks distorted the ratio of offline and online prices of KF94 masks and kept the prices artificially high at its later stage. How much higher? The online price of privately sold KF94 masks would have been roughly thirty to forty percent lower and the offline price roughly three to four percent lower if public masks ended four weeks earlier. CONCLUSION: The government intervention achieved its intended consequence of controlling the surging prices of KF94 masks at the early days of Covid-19, but the prolonged use of public masks had the unintended consequence of distorting market outcomes. The lesson? The government intervention should be kept brief, and the free market system should return as soon as the crisis subsides.","output":"Government Intervention and the Price of KF94 Masks in the Covid-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Salicylic acid (SA) has been shown to ameliorate drought stress.

Our study showed that SA application increased 13.5% plant growth and recovered 41.9% AN and 40.7% gs in drought-stressed plants on day 3 compared to drought-stressed plants without SA application. Interestingly, SOD and APX activities were increased 85% and 60%, respectively, in drought-stressed SA-treated plants on day 3.

As a result, they need to make tactical planning decisions such as whether to partner with online platforms, to form their own delivery team, or both. In this paper, we develop an integrated prediction-decision model to analyze the profit of combining the two approaches and to decide the needed number of drivers under stochastic demand. We first employ the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to forecast future infected cases in a given region and then construct an autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) regression model to predict food-ordering demand. Using predicted demand samples, we formulate a stochastic integer program to optimize food delivery plans. We conduct numerical studies using COVID-19 data and food-ordering demand data collected from local restaurants in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, from April to October 2020, to show results for helping restaurants build contingency plans under rapid market changes. Our method can be used under unexpected demand surges, various infection/vaccination status and demand patterns. Our results show that a restaurant can benefit from partnering with third-party delivery platforms when (i) the subscription fee is low, (ii) customers can flexibly decide whether to order from platforms or from restaurants directly, (iii) customers require more efficient delivery, (iv) average delivery distance is long, or (v) demand variance is high.","output":"Partner with a Third-Party Delivery Service or Not? -- a Prediction-and-Decision Tool for Restaurants Facing Takeout Demand Surges During a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dans quelle mesure la rsilience entrepreneuriale peut-elle constituer un nouvel enjeu de formation des tudiants-entrepreneurs ?

We have introduced a 2-site modified single-incision laparosopic surgery technique for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). METHODS We used the umbilical site incision to place 2 ports (12 and 10 mm) to serve as the video port and working port for the stapler. Another small skin incision was placed at a left lateral abdominal site for the 5-mm working port. Through these working channels, we could use conventional laparoscopic instruments to perform LRYGB. The data from 100 consecutive 2-site LRYGB procedures (February 2009 to September 2009) were compared with the data from 100 traditional LRYGB procedures (September 2008 to January 2009). RESULTS The mean body mass index for the study group was 43 kg/m(2) (range 32-61), and mean age was 34 years (range 18-55). The procedures were successfully performed in all but 18 patients. These 18 patients had required an extra skin incision for a 5-mm port to complete the procedures. The mean operating time was 144 minutes (range 95-160), and blood loss was 56 mL (range 20-150). A total of 3 perioperative major complications (3%) occurred, and 6 patients (6%) had minor complications. The 2-site LRYGB group had a significantly longer operating time and more blood loss than the traditional LRYGB group but less pain and better cosmesis. CONCLUSION Two-site LRYGB generated minimal somatic pain and achieved excellent cosmetic results.

We have identified IFN?-1a as the most promising drug to be repurposed for COVID-19. The rationale relies on the evidence of IFN? anti-viral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 and animal models resembling SARS-CoV-2 infection and on a recent clinical trial where IFN? was indicated as the key component of a successful therapeutic combination. METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, monocentric, phase II trial (INTERCOP trial). One hundred twenty-six patients with positive swab detection of SARS-CoV-2, radiological signs of pneumonia, and mild-to-moderate disease will be randomized 2:1 to IFN?-1a in addition to standard of care vs standard of care alone. No other anti-viral drugs will be used as part of the regimens, both in the control and the intervention arms. IFN?-1a will be administered subcutaneously at the dose of 44 mcg (equivalent to 12 million international units) three times per week, at least 48 h apart, for a total of 2 weeks. The primary outcome is the time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs. Secondary outcomes include improvement or worsening in a clinical severity score measured on a 7-point ordinal scale (including transfer to intensive care unit and death), oxygen- and ventilator-free days, mortality, changes in pulmonary computed tomography severity score, hospital stay duration, reduction of viral load measured on nasopharyngeal swabs, number of serious adverse events, and changes in biochemical markers of organ dysfunction. Exploratory outcomes include blood cell counts, cytokine and inflammatory profile, peripheral mRNA expression profiles of interferon-stimulated genes, and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and to IFN?-1a. INTERCOP is the first study to specifically investigate the clinical benefits of IFN?-1a in COVID-19 patients. DISCUSSION: Potential implications of this trial are multifaceted: should the primary outcome be fulfilled and the treatment be safe, one may envisage that IFN?-1a be used to reduce the infectivity of patients with mild-to moderate disease.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need to understand variation in immunosenescence at the population-level. Thus far, population patterns of immunosenescence are not well described. METHODS. We characterized measures of immunosenescence from newly released venous blood data from the nationally representative U.S Health and Retirement Study (HRS) of individuals ages 56 years and older. FINDINGS. Median values of the CD8+:CD4+, EMRA:Na?ve CD4+ and EMRA:Na?ve CD8+ ratios were higher among older participants and were lower in those with additional educational attainment. Generally, minoritized race and ethnic groups had immune markers suggestive of a more aged immune profile: Hispanics had a CD8+:CD4+ median value of 0.37 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.39) compared to 0.30 in Whites (95% CI: 0.29, 0.31). Blacks had the highest median value of the EMRA:Na?ve CD4+ ratio (0.08; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.09) compared to Whites (0.03; 95% CI: 0.028, 0.033). In regression analyses, race/ethnicity and education were associated with large differences in the immune ratio measures after adjustment for age and sex. For example, each additional level of education was associated with roughly an additional decade of immunological age, and the racial/ethnic differences were associated with two to four decades of additional immunological age. INTERPRETATION. Our study provides novel insights into population variation in immunosenescence. This has implications for both risk of age-related disease and vulnerability to novel pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV-2). FUNDING.

Recently, studies have also analyzed the outcome of DMEK in so-called high-risk eyes. MATERIAL AND METHODS The relevant literature and own data on DMEK for graft failure after penetrating keratoplasty and in vascularized high-risk eyes are presented and discussed. RESULTS A DMEK for the treatment of transplant failure after penetrating keratoplasty can be considered for eyes without stromal scars and without high astigmatism. A retrospective analysis of 52 patients with failed penetrating grafts showed that DMEK leads to a significant increase in visual acuity, albeit to a lesser extent than after primary DMEK. Rejection and transplant failure rates seem to be similar those seen after penetrating re-keratoplasty and are thus higher than after primary DMEK. A DMEK might also be a feasible option for eyes with corneal neovascularization and stromal edema without stromal scars. A retrospective analysis of 24 eyes with at least 2 vascularized corneal quadrants demonstrated that DMEK leads to a significant improvement in visual acuity and regression of corneal neovascularization. The rejection rate in this cohort was 4.2% and is therefore slightly higher than after low-risk DMEK in eyes without corneal neovascularization but still much better compared to penetrating keratoplasty. CONCLUSION Indications for DMEK are expanding and it can be a therapeutic option for transplant failure after penetrating keratoplasty with acceptable outcomes.

Blood glucose level is an important risk factor for the prognosis of infection and critically ill patients. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of blood glucose level in patients with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We collected clinical and survival information of 2041 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from two medical centers in Wuhan. Patients without available blood glucose level were excluded. We performed multivariable Cox regression to calculate HRs of blood glucose-associated indexes for the risk of progression to critical cases/mortality among non-critical cases, as well as in-hospital mortality in critical cases. Sensitivity analysis were conducted in patient without diabetes. RESULTS: Elevation of admission blood glucose level was an independent risk factor for progression to critical cases/death among non-critical cases (HR=1.30, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.63, p=0.026). Elevation of initial blood glucose level of critical diagnosis was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in critical cases (HR=1.84, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.98, p=0.013). Higher median glucose level during hospital stay or after critical diagnosis (&#8805;6.1 mmol/L) was independently associated with increased risks of progression to critical cases/death among non-critical cases, as well as in-hospital mortality in critical cases. Above results were consistent in the sensitivity analysis in patients without diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of blood glucose level predicted worse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Our findings may provide a simple and practical way to risk stratify COVID-19 inpatients for hierarchical management, particularly where medical resources are in severe shortage during the pandemic.","output":"Elevation of blood glucose level predicts worse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARSCCoV-2 (COVID-19) infection can cause a severe respiratory distress syndrome. The risk of severe manifestations and mortality characteristically increase in the elderly and in the presence of non-COVID-19 comorbidity. We and others previously demonstrated that the low molecular weight (LMW) and protein thiol/disulfide ratio declines in human plasma with age and such decline is even more rapid in the case of inflammatory and premature aging diseases, which are also associated with the most severe complications of COVID-19 infection. The same decline with age of the LMW thiol/disulfide ratio observed in plasma appears to occur in the extracellular fluids of the respiratory tract and in association with many pulmonary diseases that characteristically reduce the concentrations and adaptive stress response of the lung glutathione. Early evidence in literature suggests that the thiol to disulfide balance of the COVID-19 spike protein and the ACE-2 receptor of host cells could influence the risk of infection and the severity of the disease, with a more oxidizing environment producing the worst prognosis. With this hypothesis paper we propose that the age-dependent decline of LMW thiol/disulfide ratio of the extracellular fluids, produces the oxidizing conditions of Cys residues that promote the physical (protein-protein) interaction of CoV-2 and the host cell in the airways. This redox-dependent interaction is expected to affect the risk of infection and the severity of the disease. The hypothesis can be verified in experimental models of in vitro CoV-2 infection and at the clinical level in that LMW thiols and protein thiolation can now be investigated with standardized, reliable and versatile laboratory protocols.

However, little is known about which groups among the general population have been more affected. In this report, we present the overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated factors from the DETECTCoV-19 cohort. Methods: A convenience sampling strategy via online advertising recruited 3046 adults. Sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19-related symptoms, COVID-19 testing, self-medication and prescribed medications were recorded. Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG antibodies were measured with an in-house ELISA. Prevalence ratios (PR) were obtained using cluster-corrected and adjusted Poissons regression models. Findings: A crude positivity rate among asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, was estimated at 2910%, with a maximum seroprevalence of 4153% corrected by test characteristics and an antibody decay rate of 27%. Regression models demonstrated a strong association towards marginalized low-income and vulnerable residents with limited health access. Presence of a COVID-19 case (PR 139, 124-157) or death (PR 214, 174-262) in a household increased greatly the risk of other household members acquiring infection. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was higher among those who self-medicated to prevent infection (PR 136, 127-146). Interpretation: High SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity reveals a much burdensome scenario than estimations based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Manaus. Overall, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody response demonstrated a disproportionate social and economic disparity among the study participants. The syndemic nature of COVID-19 in the Amazon region needs differential policies and urgent solutions to control the pandemic. Funding: Research was funded by Ministry of Education (MEC), Brazil.

Objective: To evaluate baseline QTc interval on 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and ensuing changes among patients with and without COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included 3050 patients aged 18 years and older who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had ECGs at Columbia University Irving Medical Center from March 1 through May 1, 2020. Patients were analyzed by treatment group over 5 days, as follows: hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, and neither hydroxychloroquine nor azithromycin. ECGs were manually analyzed by electrophysiologists masked to COVID-19 status. Multivariable modeling evaluated clinical associations with QTc prolongation from baseline. Exposures: COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean QTc prolongation, percentage of patients with QTc of 500 milliseconds or greater. Results: A total of 965 patients had more than 2 ECGs and were included in the study, with 561 (58.1%) men, 198 (26.2%) Black patients, and 191 (19.8%) aged 80 years and older. There were 733 patients (76.0%) with COVID-19 and 232 patients (24.0%) without COVID-19. COVID-19 infection was associated with significant mean QTc prolongation from baseline by both 5-day and 2-day multivariable models (5-day, patients with COVID-19: 20.81 [95% CI, 15.29 to 26.33] milliseconds; P < .001; patients without COVID-19: -2.01 [95% CI, -17.31 to 21.32] milliseconds; P = .93; 2-day, patients with COVID-19: 17.40 [95% CI, 12.65 to 22.16] milliseconds; P < .001; patients without COVID-19: 0.11 [95% CI, -12.60 to 12.81] milliseconds; P = .99). COVID-19 infection was independently associated with a modeled mean 27.32 (95% CI, 4.63-43.21) millisecond increase in QTc at 5 days compared with COVID-19-negative status (mean QTc, with COVID-19: 450.45 [95% CI, 441.6 to 459.3] milliseconds; without COVID-19: 423.13 [95% CI, 403.25 to 443.01] milliseconds; P = .01). More patients with COVID-19 not receiving hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin had QTc of 500 milliseconds or greater compared with patients without COVID-19 (34 of 136 [25.0%] vs 17 of 158 [10.8%], P = .002). Multivariable analysis revealed that age 80 years and older compared with those younger than 50 years (mean difference in QTc, 11.91 [SE, 4.69; 95% CI, 2.73 to 21.09]; P = .01), severe chronic kidney disease compared with no chronic kidney disease (mean difference in QTc, 12.20 [SE, 5.26; 95% CI, 1.89 to 22.51; P = .02]), elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels (mean difference in QTc, 5.05 [SE, 1.19; 95% CI, 2.72 to 7.38]; P < .001), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (mean difference in QTc, 5.31 [SE, 2.68; 95% CI, 0.06 to 10.57]; P = .04) were associated with QTc prolongation. Torsades de pointes occurred in 1 patient (0.1%) with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, COVID-19 infection was independently associated with significant mean QTc prolongation at days 5 and 2 of hospitalization compared with day 0.

METHODS Fourteen patients were included in the study. All patients underwent a whole body and SPECT-CT imaging with both (99m)Tc- EDDA/HYNIC-octreotate and (111)In-pentetrotide. Images were evaluated both visually and semiquantitatively. RESULTS On patient basis, the diagnostic results of both studies were similar. The number of lesions detected by (99m)Tc- EDDA/HYNICOctreotate were higher than the number of lesions detected by (111)In-pentetrotide however the difference was not significant (40/43( 93%), 36/43 (83%) p=0.109). Semiquantitative analysis showed higher tumor/organ count ratios for both whole-body and SPECT (99m)Tc- EDDA/HYNIC-Octreotate scans. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggested that, (99m)Tc- EDDA/HYNIC-Octreotate may be a better alternative to (111)In- pentetrotide due to high image quality and lower radiation dose.

The nociceptive flexion reflex threshold (NFRT) has become the established basis for measuring the level of analgesia in the perioperative context. However, it remains unclear whether NFRT measurement can be usefully applied to mechanically ventilated, analgosedated critically ill patients who are unable to communicate. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether there is an association between the NFRT measurement and the Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) in critically ill, analgosedated, and mechanically ventilated patients and whether the NFRT measurement can also detect potential excessive analgesia. METHODS: This prospective, observational, randomized single-center pilot study included patients admitted to the surgical Intensive Care Unit of University Hospital Ulm, Germany, all of whom were analgosedated and intubated. Major exclusion criteria were defined as the need for the administration of neuromuscular blocking agents or neurological diseases associated with peripheral nerve conduction restriction. Initial NFRT and BPS measurements were conducted within 12 h after admission. A structured pain assessment was performed at least twice daily until extubation throughout the observation period thereafter (Group A: BPS + NFRT, Group B: BPS). RESULTS: 114 patients were included in the study. NFRT is associated negatively with BPS. NFRT was almost twice as high in patients with a Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) score of -5 than in patients with a RASS score  -4 (RASS -5 C NFRT: 59.40 vs. RASS -4 C NFRT: 29.00, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: NFRT measurement is associated negatively with the BPS in critically ill patients. NFRT measurement provides guidance for the evaluation of nociceptive processes in patients with RASS scores  ?4, in whom analgesia level is often difficult to assess. However, in order to identify excessive analgesia and derive therapeutic consequences, it is necessary to gradually decrease analgesics and sedatives until a stimulus threshold is reached at which the patient does not feel pain.

We searched keywords, subject headings, and MESH terms to locate studies of CRC outcomes/treatment and DM. Studies were evaluated by two oncologists. Of 14,332, 48 met inclusion criteria. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method, we extracted study location, design, DM definition, covariates, comparison groups, outcomes, and relative risks and/or hazard ratios. We utilized a random-effects model to pool adjusted risk estimates. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality (ACM), disease-free survival (DFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS). The secondary outcome was treatment patterns. RESULTS Forty-eight studies were included, 42 in the meta-analysis, and 6 in the descriptive analysis, totaling > 240,000 patients. ACM was 21% worse (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.15-1.28) and DFS was 75% worse (OR 1.75, 95% CI: 1.33-2.31) in patients with DM.

Video and chat consultations were used for symptomatic patient assessments through private telehealth providers in all countries. In the USA, the Telehealth Services During Certain Emergency Periods Act of 2020 was voted by the Congress on 4 March 2020 to suspend restrictive rules of Medicare funding for telehealth home consultations. Triage via online auto-questionnaires were created by private providers and public authorities.

The gag and env co-option events share a generally similar temporal pattern with less frequent retroviral gene co-option identified in the deep branches, suggesting that retroviral gene co-option might have not been maintained for very long time periods. Moreover, we find co-opted retroviral genes are subject to different selection pressure, implying potentially diverse cellular functionality.

Penurunan tingkat engagement pengguna sebesar 05% pada bulan Juni. Twitter users in Indonesia quite a lot. From Twitter users can get information about various things as well as information about COVID-19. In this study research was conducted on the level of user engagement on tweets that discussed COVID-19. The study was conducted on tweet data from April 2020 to June 2020. The tweet data was obtained from accounts specifically discussing COVID and government-owned accounts by filtering on tweets which specifically discussed COVID only. The purpose of this study is to determine the level of user engagement which can be interpreted by the level of user interaction with tweets that discuss COVID-19 at the beginning of the COVID-19 virus spread until it was introduced to the term New Normal. This term is introduced to people to encourage them wearing mask and implementing health protocol during their activities. From the research conducted it was found that the level of user interaction with tweets about COVID decreased in June when COVID cases increased and the implementation of the work from home policy had been carried out for about two months.","output":"Pengumpulan data Twitter tentang COVID-19 di Indonesia untuk menghitung tingkat engagement pengguna"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has caused extensive damage to society. The characterization of SARS-CoV-2 profiles has been addressed by researchers globally with the aim of resolving this disruptive crisis. This investigation process is indispensable to understand how SARS-CoV-2 behaves in human host cells. However, little is known about the systematic molecular mechanisms involved in the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human host cells. Here, we present gene-to-gene regulatory networks in response to SARS-CoV-2 using a Bayesian network. We examined the dynamic changes in the SARS-CoV-2-purturbated networks established by our proposed framework for gene network analysis, thus revealing that interferon signaling gradually switched to the subsequent inflammatory cytokine signaling cascades. Furthermore, we succeeded in capturing a COVID-19 patient-specific network in which transduction of these signals was concurrently induced. This enabled us to explore the local regulatory systems influenced by SARS-CoV-2 in host cells more precisely at an individual level. Our panel of network analyses has provided new insights into SARS-CoV-2 research from the perspective of cellular systems.","output":"Dynamic changes in gene-to-gene regulatory networks in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the neurosurgical workforce. Methods A survey consisting of twenty-two questions assessing respondents operative experience, location, type of practice, subspecialty, changes in clinic and operative volumes, changes to staff, and changes to income since the pandemic began was distributed electronically to neurosurgeons throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Results There were 457 respondents throughout the United States and Puerto Rico representing all practices types and subspecialties. Nearly all respondents reported hospital restrictions on elective surgeries. Most reported a decline in clinic and operative volume. Nearly 70% of respondents saw a decrease in the work hours of their ancillary providers, and almost half (49.1%) of respondents had to downsize their practice staff, office assistants, nurses, schedulers, etc. Overall, 43.6% of survey responders had experienced a decline in income, while 27.4% expected a decline in income in the upcoming billing cycle. More senior neurosurgeons and those with a private practice, whether solo or as part of a group, were more likely to experience a decline in income as a result of the pandemic as compared to their colleagues. Conclusion The COVID pandemic will likely have a lasting effect on the practice of medicine. Our survey results describe the early impact on the neurosurgical workforce. Nearly all neurosurgeons experienced a significant decline in clinical volume which leads to many downstream effects. Ultimately, analysis of the effects of such a pervasive pandemic will allow the neurosurgical workforce to be better prepared for similar events in the future.","output":"An Evaluation of Neurosurgical Practices During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A study was performed with 33 Modern Foreign Language (MFL) teachers to afford insight into how classroom practitioners interact with Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) in Second Language (L2) pedagogy.

While most medical resources are allocated to treat COVID-19 patients, fractures still need to be treated, as some patients with non-deferrable pathologies. The aim of this paper is to report the early experience of an integrated team of orthopaedic surgeons during this period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a mono-geographic, observational, retrospective, descriptive study. We collected data from the beginning of the epidemic (1 March 2020), during the pandemic lockdown period (declared in the country on March 16, 2020) until the end of our study period on April 15, 2020. All the 140 patients presented to the Emergency Department of the hospital during this period with a diagnosis of fracture, or trauma (sprains, dislocations, wounds) were included in the cohort. In addition, 12 patients needing hospitalization for planning a non-deferrable elective surgical treatment were included. A group of patients from the two same hospitals and treated during the same period (1st March 2018 to April 15, 2018) but previously was used as control. RESULTS: Of these 152 patients (mean age 45.5 years; range 1 to 103), 100 underwent a surgical procedure and 52 were managed non-operatively. Twenty-eight were children and 124 were adults. The COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed for four patients. The frequency of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis among this population treated in emergency was ten fold higher (2.6%; 4 among 152) than in the general population (0.30%) of the country. The mortality rate for patients with surgery was 2% (2 of 100 patients) and 50% (2 of 4) for those older than 60 years with COVID-19; it was null for patients who were managed non-operatively. As compared to the year 2018, the number of patients seen with trauma had decreased of 32% during the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Staying home during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased trauma frequency of 32%. The structural organization in our hospital allowed us to reduce the time to surgery and ultimately hospital stay, thereby maximizing the already stretched medical resources available to treat all the patients who needed orthopedic care during this period.","output":"Staying home during \\"COVID-19\\" decreased fractures, but trauma did not quarantine in one hundred and twelve adults and twenty eight children and the \\"tsunami of recommendations\\" could not lockdown twelve elective operations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 may boost tuberculosis given infection and mortality, further studies are needed","output":"On Tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading in Japan.

Based on numerous evidences indicating that the lipid composition of host membranes is dramatically affected by COVID-19, and in the fact that our endogenous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are sensitive to the membrane composition of pathogenic agents, we propose that such destructive immune response is due to the direct action of AMPs. In a scenario where most host cell membranes are dressed by a pathogenic lipid composition, AMPs can indiscriminately attack them. This is why we use the \\"AMP betrayal\\" term to describe this mechanism. Previously proposed cytokine/bradykinin storm mechanisms are not incompatible with this new proposal.

DESIGN: Rapid systematic review. PARTICIPANTS: Humans with viral respiratory infections, exposed to systemic NSAIDs. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Acute severe adverse outcomes, healthcare utilisation, quality of life and long-term survival. RESULTS: We screened 10 999 titles and abstracts and 738 full texts, including 87 studies. No studies addressed COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; none examined inpatient healthcare utilisation, quality of life or long-term survival. Effects of NSAIDs on mortality and cardiovascular events in adults with viral respiratory infections are unclear (three observational studies; very low certainty). Children with empyema and gastrointestinal bleeding may be more likely to have taken NSAIDs than children without these conditions (two observational studies; very low certainty). In patients aged 3 years and older with acute respiratory infections, ibuprofen is associated with a higher rate of reconsultations with general practitioners than paracetamol (one randomised controlled trial (RCT); low certainty). The difference in death from all causes and hospitalisation for renal failure and anaphylaxis between children with fever receiving ibuprofen versus paracetamol is likely to be less than 1 per 10 000 (1 RCT; moderate/high certainty). Twenty-eight studies in adults and 42 studies in children report adverse event counts. Most report that no severe adverse events occurred. Due to methodological limitations of adverse event counts, this evidence should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: It is unclear whether the use of NSAIDs increases the risk of severe adverse outcomes in patients with viral respiratory infections. This absence of evidence should not be interpreted as evidence for the absence of such risk. This is a rapid review with a number of limitations.

This study was conducted to assess the effect of reclassification of C3 glomerulopathies on renal outcomes, mortality, and response to therapy. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective analysis of 857 renal biopsies collected at The Canberra Hospital. Samples with predominant C3 staining were reviewed by a renal histopathologist. Of 31 biopsies with predominant C3 staining, 10 fulfilled histological criteria for C3 glomerulonephritis, while the remaining 21 cases were used as C3 Controls. RESULTS: Aside from a higher incidence of C3 glomerulonephritis in Torres Strait islanders (40% vs 5% C3 Controls, p = 0.04), presentation demographics were similar between the two groups. Median creatinine at diagnosis was higher in patients with C3 glomerulonephritis (253 umol/L IQR 103C333 vs 127 umol/L C3 Controls, IQR 105C182, p = 0.01). Prior to reclassification, a majority of C3 glomerulonephritis cases were diagnosed as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (60% vs 5% (C3 Controls) p < 0.01). Electron microscopy demonstrated all C3 glomerulonephritis patients had C3 deposition (100% vs 38% p = 0.02), these deposits were amorphous in nature (50% vs 5% respectively p = 0.007).

Given this, the reflexive team is an important organizational tool for protecting workers' well-being. The non-profit organization Maestri di Strada (MdS) (Street Teachers) conducts action research (AR) in the area of socio-education. The main tool used by the group to protect the well-being of its members is a guided reflexivity group, inspired by the Balint Group and termed the Multi-Vision Group (MG). In March 2020, because of the COVID-19 lockdown, the MdS team had to quickly revamp its working model, and MGs were held online for the first time. Aim: Through qualitative research that takes a longitudinal approach, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the MG in supporting the team's reflexivity in this new online format. Methods: This article considers MGs during two different time periods: pre-pandemic (T1) and early pandemic (T2). During T1, the MdS team met 18 times in person, while during T2 the team met 12 times through an online platform (always under the guidance of a psychotherapist). During all sessions in both time periods, a silent observer was present in the meetings, and they subsequently compiled narrative reports. The textual corpora of the reports were submitted for a Thematic Analysis of Elementary Contexts through T-Lab Plus, in order to examine the main content of the groups' discourse. Results: The results (five clusters in T1; and five in T2) show that, during T2, the group devoted considerable time to experiences tied to the pandemic (T21: schools facing the pandemic crisis; T2.2: the pandemic: death, inner worlds, and thought resistance; T2.3: kids' stories involving physical distancing and emotional proximity). The group also came up with innovative educational initiatives that defied the lockdown (T2.4: fieldwork: the delivery of packages of food for thought; T2.5: the MdS group: identity and separation). Based on these findings, the MG most likely contributed to the emergence of MdS as a resilient community, capable of absorbing the shock of the pandemic and realizing a fast recovery response.","output":"Supporting Team Reflexivity During the COVID-19 Lockdown: A Qualitative Study of Multi-Vision Groups In-person and Online"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Immobilization of hindlimb muscles in a shortened position results in an accelerated rate of inactivity-induced muscle atrophy and contractile dysfunction. Similarly, prolonged controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) results in diaphragm inactivity and induces diaphragm muscle atrophy and contractile dysfunction. Further, the application of positive end-expiratory airway pressure (PEEP) during mechanical ventilation would result in shortened diaphragm muscle fibers throughout the respiratory cycle. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that, compared to CMV without PEEP, the combination of PEEP and CMV would accelerate CMV-induced diaphragm muscle atrophy and contractile dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, we combined PEEP with CMV or with assist-control mechanical ventilation (AMV) and determined the effects on diaphragm muscle atrophy and contractile properties. METHODS The PEEP level (8 cmH2O) that did not induce lung overdistension or compromise circulation was determined. In vivo segmental length changes of diaphragm muscle fiber were then measured using sonomicrometry. Sedated rabbits were randomized into seven groups: surgical controls and those receiving CMV, AMV or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with or without PEEP for 2 days. We measured in vitro diaphragmatic force, diaphragm muscle morphometry, myosin heavy-chain (MyHC) protein isoforms, caspase 3, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and muscle ring finger protein 1 (MuRF1) mRNA. RESULTS PEEP shortened end-expiratory diaphragm muscle length by 15%, 14% and 12% with CMV, AMV and CPAP, respectively. Combined PEEP and CMV reduced tidal excursion of segmental diaphragm muscle length; consequently, tidal volume (VT) decreased. VT was maintained with combined PEEP and AMV. CMV alone decreased maximum tetanic force (Po) production by 35% versus control (P < 0.01). Combined PEEP and CMV did not decrease Po further. Po was preserved with AMV, with or without PEEP. Diaphragm muscle atrophy did not occur in any fiber types. Diaphragm MyHC shifted to the fast isoform in the combined PEEP and CMV group. In both the CMV and combined PEEP and CMV groups compared to controls, IGF-1 mRNAs were suppressed, whereas Caspase-3, MAFbx and MuRF1 mRNA expression were elevated.

As nurses and midwives have the most contact with patients and as an important first step in improving compliance, this study sought to explore nurses' and midwives' knowledge on the role of the environment in infection prevention and control and identify challenges in maintaining clean patient environments. METHODS: Cross-sectional online survey of 96 nurses (RN/EN) and midwives (RW) employed in clinical settings (e.g. hospital, aged care, medical centre, clinic) in Australia. RESULTS: Nurses and midwives broadly stated that they understood the importance of cleaning. However, cleaning responsibilities varied and there was confusion regarding the application of different disinfectants when cleaning after patients with a suspected or diagnosed infection post-discharge. Most would not be confident being placed in a room where a previous patient had a diagnosed infection such as multi-drug resistant organism. CONCLUSION: Greater organisational support and improving applied knowledge about infection control procedures is needed.

No study to date has reported upon risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among people who inject drugs or sex workers. Methods and FindingsBetween October, 2020 and June, 2021, participants aged []18 years from San Diego, California, USA and Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico who injected drugs within the last month underwent interviews and testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies. Binomial regressions identified correlates of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Of 386 participants, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 36.3% (95% CI: 31.5%-41.1%); 92.1% had detectable IgM antibodies. Only 37.5% had previously been tested. Seroprevalence did not differ by country of residence. None tested RNA-positive. Most (89.5%) reported engaging in []1 protective behavior [e.g., facemasks (73.5%), social distancing (46.5%), or increasing handwashing/sanitizers (22.8%)]. In a multivariate model controlling for sex, older age, and Hispanic/Latinx/Mexican ethnicity were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as was engaging in sex work (AdjRR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.18-2.27) and having been incarcerated in the past six months (AdjRR: 1.49; 95% CI: 0.97-2.27).

One such regulator is Krppel-associated box (KRAB)-associated protein 1 (KAP1: also named TRIM28 or TIF1), which has been extensively studied in the past three decades. Here we offer an up-to date review of its various functions in a diversity of contexts. We first summarize the discovery of KAP1 repression of endogenous retroviruses during development. We then deliberate evidence in the literature suggesting KAP1 is both an activator and repressor of HIV-1 transcription and discuss experimental differences and limitations of previous studies. Finally, we discuss KAP1 regulation of DNA and RNA viruses, and then expand on KAP1 control of cellular responses and immune functions. While KAP1 positive and negative regulation of viral and cellular transcriptional programs is vastly documented, our mechanistic understanding remains narrow.

Although coronaviruses undergo evolution by mutating themselves, it is also essential to know the host genetic factors. Here, we describe the single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in human ACE2 and TMPRSS2. METHODS: The genetic variants derived from five population-sequencing projects were classified by variant type, allele frequency (AF), ethnic group and estimated pathogenicity. The SNVs in SARS-CoV-2/hACE2 contact residues were investigated. The genetic variability was normalised using non-linear regression and the total number of SNVs was estimated by the derived formulas. RESULTS: We detected 349 and 551 SNVs in ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively, in a total of 156 513 individuals. The vast majority (>97%) of the SNVs were very rare (AF <0.1%) and population-specific, and were computationally estimated to be more frequently deleterious than the SNVs with high AF. These SNVs were distributed throughout the coding regions; some ACE2 variants were located in the SARS-CoV-2/hACE2 contact residues, with a hemizygous state occurring in males. Using regression analysis, the total numbers of genetic variations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were 1.1103 and 1.5103, respectively, for a population of one million people. CONCLUSION: The majority of SNVs in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are rare, population-specific and deleterious, and a multitude of very rare SNVs may explain different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Genetic variations in the human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor ACE2 and serine protease TMPRSS2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiovascular disease causes almost one third of deaths worldwide, and more than half are related to primary arterial hypertension (PAH). The occurrence of several deleterious events, such as hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and oxidative and inflammatory stress, contributes to the development of small vessel disease in PAH. Small resistance arteries are found at various points through the arterial tree, act as the major site of vascular resistance, and actively regulate local tissue perfusion. Experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that alterations in small resistance artery properties are important features of PAH pathophysiology. Diseased small vessels in PAH show decreased lumens, thicker walls, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress and inflammation. These events may lead to altered blood flow supply to tissues and organs, and can increase the risk of thrombosis. Notably, PAH is prevalent among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, in whom evidence of small vessel disease leading to cardiovascular pathology is reported. The SARS-Cov2 virus, responsible for COVID-19, achieves cell entry through an S (spike) high-affinity protein binding to the catalytic domain of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the RAS pathway. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the relationship between small resistance artery disease, ACE2, and PAH, to understand COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The scope of the present review is to briefly summarize available knowledge on the role of small resistance artery disease and ACE2 in PAH, and critically discuss their clinical relevance in the context of cardiovascular pathology associated to COVID-19.","output":"Small Resistance Artery Disease and ACE2 in Hypertension: A New Paradigm in the Context of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: COVID-19 is the most challenging public health crisis in decades in the United States.

Efflux pumps are of known main mechanisms in biocide tolerance which have been rarely addressed in enterococci - members of gut microbiota which can cause serious problems particularly in hospitalized patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of enterococci from different sources (clinical and fecal isolates) toward BCC and CHX, and its correlation with efflux associated genes. Also, possible link between biocide tolerance and antibiotic resistance was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and four enterococcus isolates including clinical (n = 54) and fecal isolates (n = 50) were studied for susceptibility toward BCC, CHX, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and vancomycin. Twelve efflux associated genes were investigated by polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: In clinical isolates, reduced susceptibility to CHX and resistance to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were significantly higher than fecal isolates. Vancomycin resistance was associated with increasing minimum inhibitory concentration of CHX. Among all investigated genes, only three ones, efrA, efrB and emeA were detected which were significantly associated with reduced susceptibility to CHX and were more frequent among clinical isolates. Also, high level resistance to gentamicin was significantly associated with the presence of efrA/B as well as with reduced susceptibility to CHX. CONCLUSION: As expected, reduced susceptibility to CHX, was significantly higher in clinical isolates. However, the presence of a vancomycin-resistant enterococci among fecal isolates of healthy people which showed resistance/tolerance to studied antimicrobial agents, was unexpected and highlights the need to investigate other non-hospital environments to avoid dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. Correlation between reduced susceptibility to CHX and high level resistance to gentamicin, substantiates monitoring of biocide tolerance particularly in the healthcare settings to control the establishment of antimicrobial resistant strains.","output":"Reduced Susceptibility to Biocides among Enterococci from Clinical and Non-Clinical Sources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originated in China has now covered around 213 countries globally.

However, clinical decision-making and health management policies often are based additionally on cycle threshold (Ct) values (i.e., quantitative results) to guide patient care, segregation and discharge management of individuals testing positive. Therefore, an analysis of inter-protocol variability is needed to assess the comparability of the quantitative results. Methods Ct values reported in a SARS-CoV-2 virus genome detection external quality assessment challenge were analyzed. Three positive and two negative samples were distributed to participating test laboratories. Qualitative results (positive/negative) and quantitative results (Ct values) were assessed. Results A total of 66 laboratories participated, contributing results from 101 distinct test systems and reporting Ct values for a total of 92 different protocols. In all three positive samples, the means of the Ct values for the E-, N-, S-, RdRp-, and ORF1ab-genes varied by less than two cycles. However, 7.7% of reported results deviated by more than 4.0 (maximum 18.0) cycles from the respective individual means. These larger deviations appear to be systematic errors. Conclusions In an attempt to use PCR diagnostics beyond the identification of infected individuals, laboratories are frequently requested to report Ct values along with a qualitative result.

These populations have an underlying predisposition to deficient insulin secretion, which has a key role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Indian and Chinese people might be more susceptible to hepatic or skeletal muscle insulin resistance, respectively, than other populations, resulting in specific forms of insulin deficiency. Cluster-based phenotypic analyses demonstrate a higher frequency of severe insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus and younger ages at diagnosis, lower -cell function, lower insulin resistance and lower BMI among Indian and Chinese people compared with European people. Individuals diagnosed earliest in life have the most aggressive course of disease and the highest risk of complications. These characteristics might contribute to distinctive responses to glucose-lowering medications.

This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) in hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: MP IgM antibody and CP IgM antibody were detected in all hospitalized children due to acute respiratory tract infection in the Childrens Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University from January 2019 to December 2020. These data were compared between 2019 and 2020 based on age and month. RESULTS: The overall detection rate of MP and CP in 2020 was significantly lower than that in 2019 (MP: 21.5% vs 32.9%, P<0.001; CP: 0.3% vs 0.9%, P<0.001). This study found a 4-fold reduction in the number of children positive for MP and a 7.5-fold reduction in the number of children positive for CP from 2019 to 2020. The positive cases were concentrated in children aged >1 year old. In 2019, the positive rate of MP was detected more commonly in children 3 years of age or older than in younger children. In 2020, the higher positive rate of MP reached a peak in the 3- to 6-year age group (35.3%). CP was detected predominantly in children aged 6 years older in 2019 and 2020, with positive rates of 4.8% and 2.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, the positive rates of MP in 2019 were detected more commonly in July, August and September, with 47.2%, 46.7% and 46.3%, respectively. Nevertheless, the positive rates of MP from February to December 2020 apparently decreased compared to those in 2019. The positive rates of CP were evenly distributed throughout the year, with 0.5%-1.6% in 2019 and 0.0%-2.1% in 2020.

A structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was utilized to analyze the hypothesized SEM model and the causal paths among the constructs. The direct and indirect path analyses of the hypothesized model indicated that EBs and WSE accounted for 43% of the variance in L2WA. Although both constructs (i.e., EBs and WSE) had a significant effect on L2WA, EBs turned out to be a robust predictor of increasing L2WA. Notably, it was revealed that learners EBs directly and significantly influenced their L2WA. Besides, the results indicated that WSE had a unique effect in reducing L2WA. More precisely, students who had a higher level of EBs seemed to have a greater L2WA, and those who had a higher level of WSE experienced less L2WA.

The spray replicates the presence of both large-sized and small-sized droplets similar to an actual cough, which makes the observations relevant to real-life situations. The spray is impinged on different mask samples with varying properties like porosity, pore size, fabric thickness, and their combinations in multilayer configuration. The effect of mask properties on the droplet penetration volume is studied as it leads to the release of higher pathogen loading into the surroundings. A two step penetration criteria based on viscous dissipation and capillary effects have been applied along with a third criteria based on the porosity of the mask sample that is specifically applicable for the spray impingement. The droplets present in the impinging cough can penetrate through the mask, atomizing into the aerosolization range and thus increasing the infection potential. Hence the effect of mask properties on the droplet size distribution as well as the velocity distribution of the penetrated droplets has been investigated, which will be essential for estimating the range of infection spread.

To evaluate whether peak or prebreakthrough RBD values were associated with breakthrough infection, a nested caseCcontrol analysis matched each breakthrough case patient to 5 control patients by age, sex, and vaccination month and adjusted for diabetes status and region of residence. RESULTS: Of the 4791 patients followed with monthly RBD assays, 2563 were vaccinated as of 14 September 2021. Among the vaccinated patients, the estimated proportion with an undetectable RBD response increased from 6.6% (95% CI, 5.5% to 7.8%) 14 to 30 days after vaccination to 20.2% (CI, 17.0% to 23.3%) 5 to 6 months after vaccination.

Aim: To determine quantitatively the levels of ferritin and D-dimer in COVID-19 infected patients with mucormycosis. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 84 Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) positive for COVID-19 Virus in oropharyngeal swab patients from June 2021 to August 2021 at Sri Devaraj Urs Medical College, Kolar, Karnataka, India. A total of 84 COVID-19 infected patients were included in the study. D-dimer and ferritin levels were measured in the patient's blood sample using Latex Enhanced Immunoturbidimetric method in Vitros 5.1 FS and Vitros Eci Immunodiagnostics respectively. Continuous data represented as mean and standard error of mean, Kruskal-Wallis Test and Mann-Whitney U test was used to test significance, p-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Of the 84 COVID-19 Infected patients, 40 were included in group 1, 25 patients in group 2 and 19 patients in Group 3. A total of 21 patients were aged between 20-40 years, 48 patients between 41-60 years age group and 15 patients were in 61-80 years of age group. The number of male patients was 63 and female patients were 21. The D-dimer levels were 1259.37 +/- 258. 9, 2632.60 +/- 472.6 and 229.53 +/- 18.4 (p-value <0.001) and ferritin levels were 528.58 +/- 45.03, 511.48 +/- 74.4, and 256.89 +/- 51.8 (p-value <0.007), respectively. Conclusion: Serum ferritin and plasma D-dimer were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients with mucormycosis. Mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients without pre-existing co morbidities may be attributed to the use of steroid therapy in these patients for COVID-19 infection.

CONTEXT: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, between February 23 and March 8, 2020, some areas of Italy were declared \\"red zones,\\" with citizens asked to stay home and avoid unnecessary interpersonal contacts. Such measures were then extended, between March 10 and May 4, 2020, to the whole country. However, compliance with such behaviors had an important impact on citizens' personal, psychological, and economic well-being. This could result in reduced trust in authorities and lowered compliance. Keeping citizens engaged in their own health and in preventive behaviors is thus a key strategy for the success of such measures. This paper presents the results from a study conducted in Italy to monitor levels of people's health engagement, sentiment, trust in authorities, and perception of risk at two different time points. METHODS: Two independent samples (n = 968 and n = 1,004), weighted to be representative of the adult Italian population, were recruited in two waves corresponding to crucial moments of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic: between February 28 and March 4 (beginning of \\"phase 1,\\" after the first regional lockdowns), and between May 12 and May 18 (beginning of \\"phase 2,\\" after the national lockdown was partially dismissed). Respondents were asked to complete an online survey with a series of both validated measures and ad hoc items. A series of t-tests, general linear models, and contingency tables were carried out to assess if and how our measures changed over time in different social groups. FINDINGS: Although sense of self and social responsibility increased between the two waves, and trust toward authorities remained substantially the same, trust in science, consumer sentiment, and health engagement decreased. Our results showed that while both the level of general concern for the emergency and the perceived risk of infection increased between the two waves, in the second wave our participants reported being more concerned for the economic consequences of the pandemic than the health risk. CONCLUSIONS: The potentially disruptive psychological impact of lockdown may hamper citizens' compliance with, and hence the effectiveness of, behavioral preventive measures. This suggests that preventive measures should be accompanied by collaborative educational plans aimed at promoting people's health engagement by making citizens feel they are partners in the health preventive endeavor and involved in the development of health policies.","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 Emergency and National Lockdown on Italian Citizens' Economic Concerns, Government Trust, and Health Engagement: Evidence From a Two-Wave Panel Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Xylem has extended its Partner Community Grants Program to support community-level responses to Covid-19.","output":"Xylem supports community-based responses to Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is widely used in various fields to detect specific biomarkers. However, ELISA tests have limited detection sensitivity ( 1 pM), which is insufficiently sensitive for the detection of small amounts of biomarkers in the early stages of disease or infection.

A proof-of-concept study using biotinylated TLip and a streptavidin-immobilized microwell plate showed that the TLip bound to the plate via specific molecular recognition could be distinguished from unbound TLip within 1 min because of the difference in the heating time required for the fluorescence emission of TLip.

METHODS: From August 2019 to January 2020, we conducted 11 telephone interviews with 18 participants representing state and local health departments and community health centers that responded to US measles outbreaks in 2017-19, with a focus on outbreaks among insular communities. We conducted qualitative, thematic coding to identify and characterize key operational challenges and lessons identified by the interviewees. RESULTS: We categorized principal insights into 5 topic areas: scale of the response, vaccination operations, exclusion policies, community engagement, and countering anti-vaccine efforts. These topics address resource-intensive aspects of these outbreak responses, including personnel demands; guidance needed to support response operations and reduce transmission, such as excluding exposed or at-risk individuals from public spaces; operational challenges and barriers to vaccination and other response activities; and effectively engaging and educating affected populations, particularly with respect to insular and vulnerable communities. CONCLUSIONS: Measles outbreak responses are resource intensive, which can quickly overwhelm existing public health capacities. Early and effective coordination with trusted leaders and organizations in affected communities, including to provide vaccination capacity and facilitate community engagement, can promote efficient response operations. The firsthand experiences of public health and healthcare personnel who responded to measles outbreaks, including among insular communities, provide evidence-based operational lessons that can inform future preparedness and response operations for outbreaks of highly transmissible diseases.","output":"Outbreak response operations during the US measles epidemic, 2017-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundDespite high levels of vaccination in the adult population, cases of COVID-19 have risen exponentially in England since the start of May 2021 driven by the Delta variant. However, with far fewer hospitalisations and deaths per case during the recent growth in cases compared with 2020, it is intended that all remaining social distancing legislation in England will be removed from 19 July 2021. MethodsWe report interim results from round 13 of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study in which a cross-sectional sample of the population of England was asked to provide a throat and nose swab for RT-PCR and to answer a questionnaire. Data collection for this report (round 13 interim) was from 24 June to 5 July 2021. ResultsIn round 13 interim, we found 237 positives from 47,729 swabs giving a weighted prevalence of 0.59% (0.51%, 0.68%) which was approximately four-fold higher compared with round 12 at 0.15% (0.12%, 0.18%). This resulted from continued exponential growth in prevalence with an average doubling time of 15 (13, 17) days between round 12 and round 13. However, during the recent period of round 13 interim only, we observed a shorter doubling time of 6.1 (4.0, 12) days with a corresponding R number of 1.87 (1.40, 2.45). There were substantial increases in all age groups under the age of 75 years, and especially at younger ages, with the highest prevalence in 13 to 17 year olds at 1.33% (0.97%, 1.82%) and in 18 to 24 years olds at 1.40% (0.89%, 2.18%). Infections have increased in all regions with the largest increase in London where prevalence increased more than eight-fold from 0.13% (0.08%, 0.20%) in round 12 to 1.08% (0.79%, 1.47%) in round 13 interim. Overall, prevalence was over 3 times higher in the unvaccinated compared with those reporting two doses of vaccine in both round 12 and round 13 interim, although there was a similar proportional increase in prevalence in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals between the two rounds. DiscussionWe are entering a critical period with a number of important competing processes: continued vaccination rollout to the whole adult population in England, increased natural immunity through infection, reduced social mixing of children during school holidays, increased proportion of mixing occurring outdoors during summer, the intended full opening of hospitality and entertainment and cessation of mandated social distancing and mask wearing.

In this study, we developed a novel and safe LM-based vaccine vector platform, by engineering a triple attenuated mutant (Lm3Dx) (actA, inlA, inlB) of the wild-type LM strain JF5203 (CC 1, phylogenetic lineage I). We demonstrated the strong attenuation of Lm3Dx while maintaining its capacity to selectively infect antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in vitro. Furthermore, as proof of concept, we introduced the immunodominant Neospora caninum (Nc) surface antigen NcSAG1 into Lm3Dx. The NcSAG1 protein was expressed by Lm3Dx_SAG1 during cellular infection. To demonstrate safety of Lm3Dx_SAG1 in vivo, we vaccinated BALB/C mice by intramuscular injection. Following vaccination, mice did not suffer any adverse effects and only sporadically shed bacteria at very low levels in the feces (<100 CFU/g). Additionally, bacterial load in internal organs was very low to absent at day 1.5 and 4 following the 1(st) vaccination and at 2 and 4 weeks after the second boost, independently of the physiological status of the mice. Additionally, vaccination of mice prior and during pregnancy did not interfere with pregnancy outcome. However, Lm3Dx_SAG1 was shed into the milk when inoculated during lactation, although it did not cause any clinical adverse effects in either dams or pups. Also, we have indications that the vector persists more days in the injected muscle of lactating mice. Therefore, impact of physiological status on vector dynamics in the host and mechanisms of milk shedding requires further investigation. In conclusion, we provide strong evidence that Lm3Dx is a safe vaccine vector in non-lactating animals. Additionally, we provide first indications that mice vaccinated with Lm3Dx_SAG1 develop a strong and Th1-biased immune response against the Lm3Dx-expressed neospora antigen. These results encourage to further investigate the efficiency of Lm3Dx_SAG1 to prevent and treat clinical neosporosis.","output":"Safety of a Novel Listeria monocytogenes-Based Vaccine Vector Expressing NcSAG1 (Neospora caninum Surface Antigen 1)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Direct carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCFs) are high flow lesions that can be challenging to treat.

Ideally by colonoscopy in addition to CT staging of chest, abdomen & pelvis (CT CAP), or alternatively CT colonography (CTC) and CT thorax if complete colonoscopy not possible. In the literature, approximately 3.5% of patients had synchronous CRC. Scheduling colonoscopy may delay treatment and be onerous for patients. Access to prompt colonoscopy can be challenging due to capacity issues, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic era. Methods Data were retrospectively analysed from electronic endoscopy, radiology and pathology records from patients diagnosed with CRC at f-sig and colonoscopy over 11 years (2010-2020 inclusive). Results Analysis 1: 680 patients who had CRC diagnosed at fsig: 230 underwent pre-treatment colonoscopy (33.8%). Interval between f-sig and colonoscopy;mean 17.5 days/ median 15.0 days. Two synchronous cancers identified at colonoscopy;0.9% 1. 57 years old man with primary rectal cancer and synchronous transverse colon cancer - both lesions reported on staging imaging scans. ? 69 years old woman with a primary rectal cancer and synchronous sigmoid colon cancer (not seen at f-sig due to poor preparation) - both lesions reported on staging imaging scans. Analysis 2: 796 patients who had CRC diagnosed at colonoscopy: 48/796 have a significant 2nd finding (6.0%) ? 24 had synchronous CRC (3.0%)/24 had a significant polyp >20 mm (3.0%) In these 48 cases, if F-sig was performed instead of colon, what would have been the outcome? ? Only in one case would a significant lesion be missed. 72 years old man with a primary rectal cancer and a 30 mm ascending colon polyp (not seen on staging CT scan). ? In the other 47 cases;staging CT scans pick up lesions or metastases, or lesions are all left sided and would be seen at F-sig, or lesions are all right sided and would not be seen at f-sig, or missed lesion was a benign polyp. Conclusions This is a large analysis of 1476 patients diagnosed with CRC. Of the 796 diagnosed at colonoscopy, 6.0% had a synchronous lesion (48 patients), 3.0% had a synchronous CRC, only 1 patient would have had a missed lesion if they'd had a f-sig alone. Of the 680 patients diagnosed with CRC at f-sig, 230 had a colonoscopy (33.5%), the rest were precluded due to advanced disease/obstruction or weren't fit due to advanced age/co-morbidity. Colonoscopy was undertaken at a median of 15.0 days. The yield of identifying a synchronous cancer at colonoscopy in this cohort is < 1%, in both cases these lesions were reported on staging imaging scans. British Society of Gastroenterology and ACPGBI guidelines from 2019 suggest that in patients who are fit/suitable they should undergo a surveillance colonoscopy at 12 months post CRC diagnosis. Given the capacity issues affecting colonoscopy services in the pandemic era, a proposed pathway for patients diagnosed with CRC at sigmoidoscopy;if staging imaging scans shows resectable CRC without synchronous lesion, is to consider undergoing surgery and to utilise 12-month colonoscopy to clear any adenomas. Alternatively CTC and CT thorax could be utilised though capacity issues may limit this approach. This data supports the consideration of alternative approaches as the likelihood of a synchronous cancer not seen at sigmoidoscopy and staging imaging scan appears to be very low.","output":"Colorectal cancer diagnosed at sigmoidoscopy, is colonoscopy necessary to assess for synchronous cancer?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the defining global health emergency of this century.

Importantly, it is crucial that we gain deeper insights into the mechanism of DILI so that patients can receive appropriate management. In general, it has been demonstrated that the mechanism of ART-induced liver injury is driven by four main mechanisms: mitochondrial toxicity, metabolic host-mediated injury, immune reconstitution, and hypersensitivity reactions.

First of all, 34 groups of COVID-19 lung tissues and 17 other diseases' lung tissues were selected from the GSE151764 gene expression profile for research. According to the analysis of the DEGs (differentially expressed genes) in the samples using the limma software package, 84 upregulated DEGs and 46 downregulated DEGs were obtained. Later, by the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), they were enriched in the Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. It was found that the upregulated DEGs were enriched in the type I interferon signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, coronavirus disease, etc. Downregulated DEGs were in cellular response to cytokine stimulus, IL-17 signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, etc. Then, based on GSEA, the enrichment of the gene set in the sample was analyzed in the GO terms, and the gene set was enriched in the positive regulation of myeloid leukocyte cytokine production involved in immune response, programmed necrotic cell death, translesion synthesis, necroptotic process, and condensed nuclear chromosome. Finally, with the help of STRING tools, the PPI (protein-protein interaction) network diagrams of DEGs were constructed.

The fact that we are currently facing a genuine global pandemic (COVID-19) brings about even more uncertainty. The social and political institutions, which emerged and consolidated during the 20th century, and which created stability, have become fragile. The young generation born in the 1990s and onwards have experienced 9/11 and the war against terrorism, the financial crisis of 2008, changes to climate, environmental degradation, and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic. The generation born between 1960 and 1990 have had the same experiences along with severe economic crises in the 1970s and 1980s and the Cold War. Some of these challenges are in different ways intertwined with capitalism and its crises, while others are linked to the rapid development of new technologies, in particular innovations within communication and information technologies.

To identify factors that contribute to rSARS-CoV-E attenuation, gene expression in cells infected by SARS-CoV with or without E gene was compared. Twenty-five stress response genes were preferentially upregulated during infection in the absence of the E gene. In addition, genes involved in signal transduction, transcription, cell metabolism, immunoregulation, inflammation, apoptosis and cell cycle and differentiation were differentially regulated in cells infected with rSARS-CoV with or without the E gene. Administration of E protein in trans reduced the stress response in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-E or with respiratory syncytial virus, or treated with drugs, such as tunicamycin and thapsigargin that elicit cell stress by different mechanisms. In addition, SARS-CoV E protein down-regulated the signaling pathway inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1) of the unfolded protein response, but not the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) or activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6) pathways, and reduced cell apoptosis. Overall, the activation of the IRE-1 pathway was not able to restore cell homeostasis, and apoptosis was induced probably as a measure to protect the host by limiting virus production and dissemination. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines was reduced in rSARS-CoV-E-infected cells compared to rSARS-CoV-infected cells, suggesting that the increase in stress responses and the reduction of inflammation in the absence of the E gene contributed to the attenuation of rSARS-CoV-E.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Envelope Protein Regulates Cell Stress Response and Apoptosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the rapid and serious nature of acute cardiovascular disease (CVD) especially ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a leading cause of death worldwide, prompt diagnosis and treatment is of crucial importance to reduce both mortality and morbidity.

Many of the children and adolescents surviving cancer will have a healthy life; however, many others will suffer from physical, cognitive, psychological, and social sequelae. During treatment, many children experience multiple temporary and permanent side effects which negatively impact their quality of life. Low- and middle-income countries where childhood cancer treatment outcomes are improving are facing the reality of a growing population of teenagers and young adults suffering from long-term disease- and treatment-related consequences. In Chile, 500 children are diagnosed with cancer each year. Treatment is granted for all through public health policies and NGO collaboration.

Most studies were retrospective, and results may not be generalizable due to differences in demographics, healthcare organization and surge capacity. We present a cohort of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients from a resource-rich, publicly financed healthcare system. METHODS: Prospective study from a tertiary hospital. Consecutive SARS-CoV-2 positive adult patients admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation from 10 March 2020 to 04 May 2020 were included. Triage and treatment were protocolized. High-dose dalteparin was adjusted by D-dimer. Demographics, treatments and high-resolution physiological variables were collected. Outcomes were 30-day and hospital mortality. Data are medians (quartiles). RESULTS: Of the 1484 persons in the hospital catchment area testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, 201 (13.5%) were hospitalized. Thirty-eight (19%) patients were mechanically ventilated, of whom five (13%) died. Of the 163 patients treated with supplemental oxygen, eight (5%) died. In ventilated patients (75% males, age 61 (53-70) years), severe, moderate and mild ARDS was present in 25%, 70% and 5%.

We aimed to evaluate serological response to BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with haematological malignancies by type of treatment. METHODS: Our national prospective cohort study was done in Lithuania and assessed serological response to one and two BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine doses in healthy health-care workers and in patients with haematological malignancies. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had received both vaccine doses, and had available biobanked blood samples from before vaccination and after the second dose. Biobanked samples and health data were obtained from Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos Biobank. Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Quant II chemiluminescent microparticle assay was used to quantify serum anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 IgG antibody (anti-S1 IgG antibody) concentrations 0-10 days before the first BNT162b2 vaccine, on the day of second immunisation (around day 21), and 7 to 21 days after the second immunisation. Adverse events were assessed by a standardised questionnaire. Breakthrough infections were characterised clinically and by SARS-CoV-2 genotyping whenever possible. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04871165. FINDINGS: Between Jan 8 and April 21, 2021, 885 participants with haematological malignancies were included in the study. 857 patients were anti-S1 IgG seronegative at timepoint 0 and constituted the main analysis cohort. The age-matched comparison was made between 315 patients with haematological malignancies who were aged 18-60 years and 67 healthy health-care workers in the same age group. Patients aged 18-60 years with haematological malignancies had lower median anti-S1 IgG antibody responses after two BNT162b2 vaccine doses than did health-care workers of the same age group (median 6961 AU/mL [IQR 1292-20 672] vs 21 395 AU/mL [14 831-33 553]; p<00001). Compared with untreated patients with haematological malignancies (n=53; median 5761 AU/mL [629-16 141]), patients actively treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKIs; n=44; 0 AU/mL [0-7]; p<00001), ruxolitinib (n=16; 10 AU/mL [0-45]; p<00001), venetoclax (n=10; 4 AU/mL [0-1218]; p=00005), or anti-CD20 antibody therapy (n=87; 17 AU/mL [1-2319]; p<00001) showed particularly poor anti-S1 IgG antibody responses following two BNT162b2 doses. Patients being treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (n=41; 10 537 AU/mL [IQR 2335-19 388]) or patients who received autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT; n=192; 6203 AU/mL [1451-16 834]) or allogeneic HSCT (n=122; 6304 AU/mL [1120-16 913]) were among the subgroups with the highest numerical responses. Nine SARS-CoV-2 infections and three COVID-19 deaths were observed among fully vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies. INTERPRETATION: Patients with haematological malignancies mount blunted and heterogeneous antibody responses to the full course of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. Patients who are actively treated with BTKIs, ruxolitinib, venetoclax, or anti-CD20 antibody therapies seem to be the most negatively affected and might be left unprotected from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Breakthrough severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in fully vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies emphasise the importance of ongoing strict adherence to non-pharmacological interventions and household vaccination while SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in the community.

The rapid shift to adoption of video consultations in March 2020, due to COVID restrictions, necessitated a shift in assessment and treatment approaches across many branches of healthcare and brought the challenge of how to effectively deliver assessment and interventions remotely. While goniometry over video had been shown to be reliable for assessment of other joints, there was no literature testing the reliability of measurement of finger range using goniometry performed over video. We sought to evaluate the reliability of using on-screen goniometry for the measurement of finger range to determine the value of using this as an outcome measure and inform clinical practice. Methods: One hundred and thirty-three pairs of measurements (in-person, and over video) were collected, including measures of extension and flexion at each finger joint. Pairs of measurements were compared and Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) and Coefficient of Reproducibility (CR) were calculated on the difference between each pair. Results: Across all pairs of measurements r = 0.98 showing a very high degree of agreement between measurements taken face to face or over video. The reproducibility coefficient (CR), indicating a smallest accurately detectable change, was 11.8?. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that while measuring finger range over video introduces an additional element of variability compared to measuring face to face (likely due to additional difficulty of standardising orientation of the hand relative to the screen) it appears only marginally less consistent than the accepted inter-rater reliability for standard finger goniometry (7C9?). We find that this data supports the use of goniometry as a standard part of hand therapy assessment in video consultations, but recommend that care is taken to reduce variability as far as possible (by maintaining therapist continuity, standardising position and measurement protocol), and interpret findings appropriately for the reliability of this measurement. Impact: Improved understanding of the reliability of goniometry during remote consultations allows effective assessment and interpretation of findings C strengthening reliability of assessment measures and improving remote assessment and treatment.

The reasons for the spectrum of differences in the severity of the disease across the population, and in particular why the disease affects more severely the aging population and those with specific preconditions are unclear. We developed machine learning models to mine 240,000 scientific papers openly accessible in the CORD-19 database, and constructed knowledge graphs to synthesize the extracted information and navigate the collective knowledge in an attempt to search for a potential common underlying reason for disease severity. The literature repeatedly pointed to elevated blood glucose as a key facilitator in the progression of COVID-19. Indeed, when we retraced the steps of the SARS-CoV-2 infection we found evidence linking elevated glucose to each step of the life-cycle of the virus, progression of the disease, and presentation of symptoms. Specifically, elevations of glucose provide ideal conditions for the virus to evade and weaken the first level of the immune defense system in the lungs, gain access to deep alveolar cells, bind to the ACE2 receptor and enter the pulmonary cells, accelerate replication of the virus within cells increasing cell death and inducing an pulmonary inflammatory response, which overwhelms an already weakened innate immune system to trigger an avalanche of systemic infections, inflammation and cell damage, a cytokine storm and thrombotic events. We tested the feasibility of the hypothesis by analyzing data across papers, reconstructing atomistically the virus at the surface of the pulmonary airways, and performing quantitative computational modeling of the effects of glucose levels on the infection process. We conclude that elevation in glucose levels can facilitate the progression of the disease through multiple mechanisms and can explain much of the variance in disease severity seen across the population. The study proposes diagnostic recommendations, new areas of research and potential treatments, and cautions on treatment strategies and critical care conditions that induce elevations in blood glucose levels.","output":"Elevated blood glucose levels as a primary risk factor for the severity of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobial peptides have been extensively described as bioactive agents, mainly considering their selective toxicity towards bacteria but not to healthy mammalian cells.

Using the WHO 'Standards for improving quality of care for children and young adolescents in health facilities' as a reference standard, we aimed to evaluate existing tools that assess quality of care for children. METHODS We undertook a systematic literature review of publications/reports between 2008 and 2020 that reported use of quality of care assessment tools for children (<15 years) in health facilities. Identified tools were reviewed against the 40 quality statements and 510 quality measures from the WHO Standards to determine the extent each tool was consistent with the WHO Standards. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO ID: CRD42020175652. RESULTS Nine assessment tools met inclusion criteria. Two hospital care tools developed by WHO-Europe and WHO-South-East Asia Offices had the most consistency with the WHO Standards, assessing 291 (571%) and 208 (408%) of the 510 quality measures, respectively. Remaining tools included between 33 (65%) and 206 (404%) of the 510 quality measures. The WHO-Europe tool was the only tool to assess all 40 quality statements. The most common quality measures absent were related to experience of care, particularly provision of educational, emotional and psychosocial support to children and families, and fulfilment of children's rights during care. CONCLUSION Quality of care assessment tools for children in health facilities are missing some key elements highlighted by the WHO Standards. The WHO Standards are, however, extensive and applying all the quality measures in every setting may not be feasible. A consensus of key indicators to monitor the WHO Standards is required. Existing tools could be modified to include priority indicators to strengthen progress reporting towards delivering quality health services for children.

The same suppression and mitigation measures have been implemented homogeneously, ignoring the differences between urban and rural areas. We propose an epidemiological model and simulate the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in urban and rural areas considering the interaction between these regions. Study design: Population modeling study. Methods: A compartmental epidemiological model was formulated to simulate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in urban and rural areas. We use the model to investigate the impact of control strategies focused on the urban-rural interface to contain the epidemic size of SARS-CoV-2 in rural areas. Results: Considering five different levels for the exposition rate in urban areas and keeping intra-rural and urban-rural exposition rates fixed, the preventive measures reduce the size and delay the peak for the urban infectives. The response of infected individuals and cumulative deaths in rural areas upon changes in the urban dynamics was small but not negligible. On the other hand, preventive measures focused on the urban-rural interface impact the number of infected individuals and deaths in rural areas. Conclusions: The maintenance of SARS-CoV-2in rural areas depends on the interaction of individuals at the urban-rural interface.

The current study aimed to address the role of benefit-finding, defined as the capacity to derive meaning and positive aspects from stressful situations, in late midlife and older adults' adaptation to the effects of home confinement and centralized quarantine (HCCQ).Methods: 421 participants aged 50 or above in mainland of China participated in an online survey to study the effects of HCCQ on loneliness, stress, anxiety, depression and life satisfaction, as well as the moderating role of benefit-finding.Results: Correlational analysis showed that a history of HCCQ was basically unrelated to any outcome. However, the effect actually varied by levels of benefit-finding. Among late midlife and older people with lower benefit-finding, those who had experienced HCCQ reported more loneliness, perceived stress, as well as more anxiety and depressive symptoms; no such relationships were found when benefit-finding was moderate or high.Conclusion: The findings extended our understanding of the role of benefit-finding in buffering the negative impact of adversity.

This study may shed light on whether a severe economic contraction following a natural disaster, such as that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will further contribute to that decline, using data on hurricanes followed by economic contraction or growth. For the analysis, U.S. counties hit by severe hurricanes between 2004 and 2012 are identified and differentiated according to whether there was substantial employment decline from the year prior to the year after the hurricane. Bank offices in these counties are tracked for seven years in terms of stayers, leavers, and new offices owned by community or large banks. The results reveal that areas with substantial employment decline are associated with higher rates of persistence and new openings among the community banks. Where hurricanes were followed by less severe contraction or economic growth, larger banks held an advantage in terms of both persistence and new offices. It is suggested that the value of soft information held by community banks is enhanced by severe adversity.","output":"After the Hurricane: Economic Adversity, Bank Offices, and Community Banks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the relationship between statistical classifications and comparisons in German colonial statistics between 1885 and 1914.

In response to the pandemic, this teaching was suspended to reduce disruption in service provision and support social distancing. There was a clear need to reintroduce teaching for continued professional development and trainee progression. METHODS: In July 2020, Geriatric Medicine trainees in Wessex completed a questionnaire survey to identify their desire for socially distanced teaching and an acceptable format for delivery. Two half-day pilot teaching sessions via MS Teams were organised in September and October 2020. Trainees provided feedback via a questionnaire survey about the relevance and quality of teaching, and to identify any barriers to attendance. Subsequently, a monthly full-day virtual teaching programme was implemented. We reported reflections of our experiences on our trainee website to support future sessions. RESULTS: All trainees (n = 15) were eager for regional teaching to recommence through socially distanced education. Trainees had a preference for MS Teams, which can support interactive teaching. Attendance to the pilot sessions exceeded previous face-to-face sessions. 19 trainees attended the first session; 17 provided feedback. 28 trainees attended the second session; 12 provided feedback. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive; all reported the sessions were interesting and 82% (n = 14) that they would lead to changes in their practice. Some trainees expressed that full-day sessions would enhance curriculum coverage. 94% (n = 16) were positive of the virtual platform; it reduced travel and sessions could be recorded. Local trainees attended the second session in-person, which enhanced interactivity. CONCLUSION: Virtual teaching has been successful in Wessex Deanery, with high attendance and positive feedback. Trainees can engage remotely without the need for travel and disruption. After the pandemic we hope to develop a regional teaching programme integrating virtual and face-to-face sessions to improve attendance and accessibility.","output":"483 IMPROVING THE PROVISION OF REGIONAL GERIATRIC MEDICINE TEACHING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper will examine in detail (a) the norms that can be featured under the category \\"Green Deal\\" connected to the European Commission, (b) their application to Spain and (c) the different patterns of action and development models that have been shaped by this framework over the last 20 years.

From May 2020 a significant decline of the epidemic has been observed (phase 2); National Health Service protocols permitted elective BMS' resumption. A new, more severe COVID-19 surge, the \\"second wave\\", started on October 2020 (phase 3). AIM: The primary end point was to analyze the outcomes of any Sars-Cov-2 infection and related morbidity/mortality within 30 POD after laparoscopic BMS during phase 2-3; secondary end points were readmission and reoperation rates. METHODS: Study design prospective, multicenter, observational. SETTING: Eight Italian high-volume bariatric centers. All patients undergoing BMS from July 2020 through January 2021 were enrolled according to the following criteria: no Sars-Cov-2 infection; primary procedures; no concomitant procedure; age > 18 < 60 years; compensated comorbidities; informed consent including COVID-19 addendum; adherence to specific admission, in-hospital and follow-up protocols. Data were collected in a prospective database. Patients undergone BMS during July-December 2019 were considered a control group. RESULTS: 1258 patients were enrolled and compared with 1451 operated on in 2019, with no differences for demographics, complications, readmission, and reintervention rates. Eight patients (06%) tested positive for Sars-Cov-2 infection after discharge, as well as and 15 healthcare professionals, with no related complications or mortality.

DESIGN: Pre-post observational study. SETTING: and Participants: 623 nursing homes in Ontario, Canada, between March 2020 and June 2020. METHODS: We used GPS location data from mobile devices to approximate connectivity between all 623 nursing homes in Ontario during the 7 weeks before (March 1-April 21) and after (April 22-June 13) the policy restricting staff movement was implemented. We constructed a network diagram visualizing connectivity between nursing homes in Ontario and calculated the number of homes that had a connection with another nursing home and the average number of connections per home in each period. We calculated the relative difference in these mobility metrics between the 2 time periods and compared within-home changes using McNemar test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: In the period preceding restrictions, 266 (42.7%) nursing homes had a connection with at least 1 other home, compared with 79 (12.7%) homes during the period after restrictions, a drop of 70.3% (P < .001). Including all homes, the average number of connections in the before period was 3.90 compared to 0.77 in the after period, a drop of 80.3% (P < .001). In both periods, mobility between nursing homes was higher in homes located in larger communities, those with higher bed counts, and those part of a large chain. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Mobility between nursing homes in Ontario fell sharply after an emergency order by the Ontario government limiting long-term care staff to a single home, though some mobility persisted.

Although COVID-19 is a mainly respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are not uncommon. The aim of this review is to report on the etiology, clinical profile, location, and outcome of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and COVID-19. This review includes 36 studies examining ICH in the clinical presentation of COVID-19. Overall, 217 cases with intracranial hemorrhage, of which 188 ICHs, were reported. Generally, a low incidence of both primary and secondary ICH was found in 8 studies [106 (0.25%) out of 43137 hospitalized patients with COVID-19]. Available data showed a median age of 58 years (range: 52 - 68) and male sex 64%, regarding 36 and 102 patients respectively. Furthermore, 75% of the patients were on prior anticoagulation treatment, 52% had a history of arterial hypertension, and 61% were admitted in intensive care unit. Location of ICH in deep structures/basal ganglia was ascertained in only 7 cases making arterial hypertension an improbable etiopathogenetic mechanism. Mortality was calculated at 52.7%. Disease related pathophysiologic mechanisms support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV2 can cause ICH, however typical ICH risk factors such as anticoagulation treatment, or admission to ICU should also be considered as probable causes. Physicians should strongly suspect the possibility of ICH in individuals with severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU and treated with anticoagulants.

Caused by pathogens in the family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus, and distributed globally, this viral zoonosis results in tens of thousands of human fatalities and millions of exposures annually. All mammals are believed susceptible, but only certain taxa act as reservoirs. Dependence upon direct routing to, replication within, and passage from the central nervous system serves as a basic viral strategy for perpetuation. By a combination of stealth and subversion, lyssaviruses are quintessential neurotropic agents and cause an acute, progressive encephalitis. No treatment exists, so prevention is the key. Although not a disease considered for eradication, something of a modern rebirth has been occurring within the field as of late with regard to detection, prevention, and management as well as applied research. For example, within the past decade, new lyssaviruses have been characterized; sensitive and specific diagnostics have been optimized; pure, potent, safe, and efficacious human biologics have improved human prophylaxis; regional efforts have controlled canine rabies by mass immunization; wildlife rabies has been controlled by oral rabies vaccination over large geographic areas in Europe and North America; and debate has resumed over the controversial topic of therapy. Based upon such progress to date, there are certain expectations for the next 10 years. These include pathogen discovery, to uncover additional lyssaviruses in the Old World; laboratory-based surveillance enhancement by simplified, rapid testing; anti-viral drug appearance, based upon an improved appreciation of viral pathobiology and host response; and improvements to canine rabies elimination regionally throughout Africa, Asia, and the Americas by application of the best technical, organizational, economic, and socio-political practices. Significantly, anticipated Gavi support will enable improved access of human rabies vaccines in lesser developed countries at a national level, with integrated bite management, dose-sparing regimens, and a 1 week vaccination schedule.","output":"Update on lyssaviruses and rabies: will past progress play as prologue in the near term towards future elimination?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Our case is unique because the differential diagnosis was a challenge. At first, the patient presented with septic shock and multi-organ failure in the context of a suspected lymphoproliferative syndrome. Once the lymphoproliferative process had been ruled out, hemophagocytic syndrome due to COVID-19 infection was suspected, so he is probably one of the few patients with such an exhaustive study that could contribute to our understanding of COVID-19. We followed therapeutic guidelines that differ from the usual, using adrenalin and levosimendan. Corticosteroids helped to modulate the cytokine storm. Case report: A 16-year-old adolescent was admitted to the intensive care unit with fever, diarrhea, multiorgan failure and septic shock. He was IgG positive for COVID-19 and IgM negative. Thoraco-abdominal computed tomography demonstrated multiple para-aortic and peripancreatic lymphadenopathy and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The first suspected diagnosis was a lymphoproliferative syndrome and bacterial infection. The second possibility was a hemophagocytic syndrome in a patient recovering from COVID-19. He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics because the differential diagnosis was difficult, and we removed them when the microbiological screening was negative. During the course of the disease he presented with severe biventricular dysfunction, probably due to the cytokine storm, so we used inotropic drugs (adrenaline, levosimendan). Infection with Salmonella species group B was diagnosed later, when the patient was in the Internal Medicine ward, although he was asymptomatic. Conclusion: The severity of COVID-19 infection ranges from mild to severe, causing serious disease in some people. Although the pathophysiology is not well known, it seems that in some cases an immune storm is triggered, and it is related to more serious and prolonged disease. In our case, heart failure was important, because it could have worsened the prognosis.

We aimed to retrospectively evaluate the safety of remdesivir in older patients with COVID-19 who required hospitalization in our institute. METHODS: We reviewed patients with COVID-19 who were treated with remdesivir at our institute between July 2020 and May 2021. We defined older patients as those aged 80 years or older at admission; all other patients were defined as younger patients. We evaluated the safety of remdesivir by examining the incidence of discontinuation of remdesivir treatment because of adverse events and the incidence of any adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 80 patients were included in this study. Compared with younger patients, fewer older patients were treated with remdesivir for more than 5 days: 4 (15.4%) vs 23 (42.6%). Discontinuation of remdesivir because of adverse events occurred in one older patient (3.9%) and four younger patients (7.4%) [p > 0.99]. Remdesivir-induced liver dysfunction was the most frequent adverse event, which occurred in 29 (36.3%) patients. There were no significant differences in the incidence of remdesivir-induced liver dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and fatigue.

The most common symptoms include lymphadenopathy, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, low-grade fevers, night sweats that are classified as B symptoms and a mediastinal mass that may cause dysphagia dyspnea orthopnea cough stridor or superior vena cava syndrome. Though occasionally identified as an incidental finding on chest x-ray, it is crucial to identify and differentiate from other mediastinal masses as they have a favorable prognosis. We present a 19-year-old Navy recruit found to have a large mediastinal mass on routine chest x-ray that was later diagnosed to be Hodgkin's lymphoma with extensive mediastinal, hilar and paratracheal and pericardiac lymphadenopathy. Case report:A 19-year-old recruit with no significant past medical history was being evaluated during military intake, was found to a mediastinal mass on routine chest x-ray. He denied any symptoms, and had a normal physical examination without any abnormal heart or lung sounds. His labs showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 33 mm/hr, lactate dehydrogenase 231 U/L, ferritin 140 ng/mL, covid 19 negative. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed large multilobulated hypo enhancing mass in the superior mediastinum, paratracheal region, pericardiac region, cardio phrenic region consistent with a lymphoid mass, without splenomegaly, or evidence of enlarged abdominal or pelvic lymph nodes ( Figure 1). PET scan showed extensive hypermetabolic mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with largest nodal conglomerate measuring 8 cm in the anterior mediastinum with an SUV max of 13.1, additional large nodal conglomerate in the right paratracheal region measures up to 5.6 cm, hypermetabolic pericardiac lymph nodes extends along the pericardium identified both anteriorly and inferiorly without any aggressive osseous or other metabolically active lesions. Flow cytometry analysis showed predominantly T cells with some polytypic B cells that exhibit no immunophenotypic abnormalities. The mediastinal mass was biopsied and showed classic Hodgkin's lymphoma, nodular sclerosing subtype. He was subsequently started on Adriamycin bleomycin vinblastine, dacarbazine [ABVD] regimen. Discussion: The mediastinum is divided into various compartments namely the anterior middle and posterior compartments. Mass in the mediastinum mediastinal masses have a broad differential and can vary based on location in the compartments. The differential can include thymomas, teratomas, germ cell tumors, enlarged or ectopic thyroid, lymphomas.

As a result, many cancer patients had their treatment deferred during the pandemic, increasing the time-to-treatment initiation, the number of untreated patients (which will alter the dynamics of healthcare delivery in the post-pandemic era) and increasing their risk of death. Hence, we analyzed the impact on global cancer mortality considering the decline in oncology care during the COVID-19 outbreak using head and neck cancer, a known time-dependent disease, as a model. METHODS: An online practical tool capable of predicting the risk of cancer patients dying due to the COVID-19 outbreak and also useful for mitigation strategies after the peak of the pandemic has been developed, based on a mathematical model. The scenarios were estimated by information of 15 oncological services worldwide, given a perspective from the five continents and also some simulations were conducted at world demographic data. RESULTS: The model demonstrates that the more that cancer care was maintained during the outbreak and also the more it is increased during the mitigation period, the shorter will be the recovery, lessening the additional risk of dying due to time-to-treatment initiation.

The development of game-changing vaccines that induce broadly protective immunity against a wide variety of influenza viruses is an unmet need, in which recombinant viral vectors may provide. Use of viral vectors allows the delivery of any influenza virus antigen, or derivative thereof, to the immune system, resulting in the optimal induction of virus-specific B- and T-cell responses against this antigen of choice.

States cancelled in-person classes and campus activities quickly shifted to remote and virtual learning. The pandemic, along with its economic impact, altered education for community college students, creating a traumatic event that exasperated mental health conditions. In addition, job loss increased food insecurities drastically during COVID-19 and students across the country turned to their colleges for wraparound services. In this proposal, the authors review the impact of COVID-19 on marginalized college students, specifically Latinx students in a South Texas college. The findings revealed that Latinx students navigated virtual learning differently and were impacted by their access to technology, as well as their access to mental health services and food pantries.

Computational methods that provide large-scale analysis of the interactions between miRNAs and their competitive targets can contribute to the understanding of ceRNA regulations and critical regulatory functions. Recent reports showed that viral RNAs can compete with host RNAs against host miRNAs. Regarding SARS-CoV-2 RNA, no comprehensive study had been reported about its competition with cellular ceRNAs. In this study, for the first time, we used the ceRNAnetsim package to assess ceRNA network effects per individual cell and competitive behavior of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the infected cells using single-cell sequencing data. Our computations identified 195 genes and 29 miRNAs which vary in competitive behavior specifically in presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We also investigated 18 genes that are affected by genes that lost perturbation ability in presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the human miRNA:ceRNA network. These transcripts have associations with COVID-19-related symptoms as well as many dysfunctions such as metabolic diseases, carcinomas, heart failure. Our results showed that the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 genome on host ceRNA interactions and consequent dysfunctions can be explained by competition among various miRNA targets. Our perturbation ability perspective has the potential to reveal yet to be discovered SARS-CoV-2 induced effects invisible to conventional approaches.","output":"Effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host competing endogenous RNA and miRNA network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses have led to severe emergencies in the world since the outbreak of SARS CoV in 2002, followed by MERS CoV in 2012.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S., Massachusetts has been leading other states in the total number of COVID-19 cases. Racial residential segregation is a fundamental cause of racial disparities in health. Moreover, disparities of access to health care have a large impact on COVID-19 cases. Thus, this study estimates racial segregation and disparities in testing site access and employs economic, demographic, and transportation variables at the city/town level in Massachusetts. Spatial regression models are applied to evaluate the relationships between COVID-19 incidence rate and related variables. This is the first study to apply spatial analysis methods across neighborhoods in the U.S. to examine the COVID-19 incidence rate. The findings are: (1) Residential segregations of Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black/African Americans have a significantly positive association with COVID-19 incidence rate, indicating the higher susceptibility of COVID-19 infections among minority groups. (2) Non-Hispanic Black/African Americans have the shortest drive time to testing sites, followed by Hispanic, Non-Hispanic Asians, and Non-Hispanic Whites. The drive time to testing sites is significantly negatively associated with the COVID-19 incidence rate, implying the importance of the accessibility of testing sites by all populations. (3) Poverty rate and road density are significant explanatory variables. Importantly, overcrowding represented by more than one person per room is a significant variable found to be positively associated with COVID-19 incidence rate, suggesting the effectiveness of social distancing for reducing infection. (4) Different from the findings of previous studies, the elderly population rate is not statistically significantly correlated with the incidence rate because the elderly population in Massachusetts is less distributed in the hotspot regions of COVID-19 infections.

Due to population and urbanization growth and an increase in healthcare waste disposals according to the growing number of diseases and pandemics like COVID-19, disposal of healthcare waste has become a critical issue. Authorities in big cities require reliable decision support systems to empower them to make strategic decisions to provide safe disposal methods with a prospective vision. Since inappropriate healthcare waste management systems would definitely bring up dangerous environmental, social, health, and economic issues for every city. Therefore, this paper attempts to address the landfill location selection problem for healthcare waste using a novel decision support system. Novel decision support model integrates K-means algorithms with Stratified Best-Worst Method (SBWM) and a novel hybrid MARCOS-CoCoSo under grey interval numbers. The proposed decision support system considers waste generate rate in medical centers, future unforeseen but potential events, and uncertainty in experts opinion to optimally locate required landfills for safe and economical disposal of dangerous healthcare waste. To investigate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed methodology, a real case study is performed for Mazandaran province in Iran. Our proposed methodology could efficiently deal with 79 medical centers within 4 clusters addressing 9 criteria to prioritize candidate locations. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of weight coefficients is carried out to evaluate the results. Finally, the efficiency of the methodology is compared with several well-known methods and its high efficiency is demonstrated. Results recommend adherence to local rules and regulations, and future expansion potential as the top two criteria with importance values of 0.173 and 0.164, respectively.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence and pattern of mental health issues and substance use in the migrant population and highlight the association with the reverse migration of migrant workers. METHODOLOGY: The field staff visited the shelter homes for migrant population in four cities of Northern India (Chandigarh (UT), Bhatinda (Punjab), Panchkula (Haryana) and Jaipur (Rajasthan). After maintaining the social distance and wearing masks by the staff and migrants, written informed consent was taken for participation in the study. The socio-demographic details of reverse migrants were noted down and Hindi version of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for mental health problems and screening tool for pattern of substance abuse was administered. Geographically matched undisplaced were also administered these tools. RESULTS: A total of 275 reverse migrants and 276 undisplaced were included in the study. The prevalence of ever use for all the substances among reverse migrants was 44.4% (122/275) and among undisplaced, it was 45.3%. The prevalence of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis was higher than the general population. The prevalence of at least one diagnosis on PHQ-9 is 13.45% (reverse migrants 19.3% and undisplaced 7.6) and the prevalence of other depressive disorder is significantly higher in reverse migrants (17.1%) than undisplaced (4.0%).

We aimed to describe histological features of cutaneous eruptions occurring concomitantly to SARS-CoV-2 infection and assess by immunochemistry and in situ hybridization using RNAscope validation techniques the presence of the virus in skin lesions. We retrieved all skin biopsies received in the departments of pathology and dermatopathology, University Hospital of Strasbourg, performed in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients presenting concomitant cutaneous manifestations since March 2020. In situ hybridization and immunostaining using a polyclonal SARS nucleocapsid protein antibody were performed on each sample. Skin biopsies from six patients presenting morbilliform eruption concomitant to SARS-CoV-2 infection were available for evaluation. All six samples showed varying degrees of spongiosis, perivascular inflammatory infiltrates of the dermis, and, for some of them, discrete interface dermatitis. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were negative in all cutaneous samples. Morbilliform rash concomitant to SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by mild and unspecific histopathological features with no detectable viral RNA and protein and appears then not to be directly caused by the virus.

We examined if corticosteroids and tocilizumab reduce risk for death in patients with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in a single university hospital. All adult patients admitted with confirmed severe COVID-19 pneumonia from 9 March to 9 April 2020 were included. Severe pneumonia was defined as multi-lobar or bilateral pneumonia and a ratio of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry to the fraction of inspired oxygen (SpFi)<315. All patients received antiviral and antibiotic treatment. From March 26, patients also received immunomodulatory treatment with corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 250 mg/day for 3 days), or tocilizumab or both. In-hospital mortality in the entire cohort and in a 1:1 matched cohort sub-analysis was evaluated. RESULTS: 255 patients were included, 118 received only antiviral and antibiotic treatment while 137, admitted after March 26, also received immunomodulators. In-hospital mortality of patients on immunomodulatory treatment was significantly lower than in those without [47/137(34.3%) vs. 69/118(58.5%), (p < .001)]. The risk of death was 0.44 (CI, 0.26C0.76) in patients receiving corticosteroids alone and 0.292 (CI, 0.18C0.47) in those treated with corticosteroids and tocilizumab.

Invulnerability is the fundamental choice to prevent the ruining event of COVID-19, as the drugs and antibodies are in the phase of preliminary clinical trials. Within this brief period, a few strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been recognized by the vaccine manufacturers, which could be an incorrect guess about the strain that will end up spreading. Since the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains continue to mutate, immunizations, if at all works, might be for a restricted time. We have not put sufficient time in research to understand the immune responses that correlate with protection as this could help refine vaccines. Here, we have summed up the adequacy of the immunomodulatory component of probiotics for the prevention against viral infections. Furthermore, an in silico data have been provided in support of the probiotics-derived lipopeptides role in inactivating spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and its host receptor molecule, ACE2. Among well characterized lipopeptides derived from different probiotic strains, subtilisin (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens), curvacin A (Lactobacillus curvatus), sakacin P (Lactobacillus sakei), lactococcin Gb (Lactococcus lactis) was utilized in this study to demonstrate a higher binding proclivity to S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE2. The outcome revealed noteworthy capabilities of the lipopeptides, due to their amphiphilic nature, to bind spike protein and receptor molecule, which may act to competitively inhibit the mandatory interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the host epithelial cell expressing ACE2 for its entry into the cell for reproduction. In the current situation, probiotic treatment alongside chemotherapy may assist in bringing about substantial improvement of the health of COVID-19 patients. At the same time, probiotics may aid towards building up the immune defenses in people to evade COVID-19.

Up to 57% of patients with ehrlichiosis require hospitalization and 11% develop a life-threatening complication; however, risk factors for serious disease are not well documented. OBJECTIVE: To examine risk factors associated with severe ehrlichiosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An analytic cross-sectional study of patients diagnosed with ehrlichiosis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2017, was conducted in a single tertiary-care center in a region endemic for ehrlichiosis. Analysis was performed from February 27, 2018, to September 9, 2020. A total of 407 positive Ehrlichia PCR results were identified from 383 unique patients, with 155 unique patients meeting study criteria. Patients hospitalized at other institutions who had a positive Ehrlichia PCR performed as a reference test (n = 222) were excluded as no clinical data were available. Electronic medical record review was performed to collect demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcomes data. Cases were excluded when there were insufficient clinical data to assess the severity of illness (n = 3) and when the clinical illness did not meet the case definition for ehrlichiosis (n = 3). EXPOSURES: Date of presentation, onset of symptoms, date of PCR testing, date of treatment initiation, site of care, age, birth sex, race/ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity Index, trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole use within the prior 2 weeks, and immunosuppression. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Requirement for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: Of the 155 patients who met inclusion criteria, 99 patients (63.9%) were men, and 145 patients (93.5%) identified as non-Hispanic White; median age was 50 years (interquartile range, 23-64 years). Intensive care unit admission was indicated in 43 patients (27.7%), 94 patients (60.6%) were hospitalized on general medical floors, and 18 patients (11.6%) received care as outpatients. In adjusted analysis, time to treatment initiation was independently associated with an increased risk for ICU admission (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04-1.14; P < .001). Documentation of tick exposure was independently associated with a decreased risk for ICU admission (aPR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34-0.86; P = .01).

We also review the recommended management of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and the various pharmacological agents that are being investigated and may have a role in the treatment of this disease. At present, it does not appear that pregnant women are at increased risk of severe infection than the general population, although there are vulnerable groups within both the pregnant and nonpregnant populations, and clinicians should be cognizant of these high-risk groups and manage them accordingly. Approximately 85% of women will experience mild disease, 10% more severe disease and 5% critical disease. The most common reported symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea. Neither vaginal delivery nor cesarean section confers additional risks, and there is minimal risk of vertical transmission to the neonate from either mode of delivery. We acknowledge that the true effect of the virus on both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality will only be evident over time.

We then attempt to minimise an expected bias in these signals caused by public interest -- as opposed to infections -- using the proportion of news media coverage devoted to COVID-19 as a proxy indicator. Our analysis indicates that models based on online searches precede the reported confirmed cases and deaths by 16.7 (10.2 - 23.2) and 22.1 (17.4 - 26.9) days, respectively. We also investigate transfer learning techniques for mapping supervised models from countries where the spread of disease has progressed extensively to countries that are in earlier phases of their respective epidemic curves. Furthermore, we compare time series of online search activity against confirmed COVID-19 cases or deaths jointly across multiple countries, uncovering interesting querying patterns, including the finding that rarer symptoms are better predictors than common ones. Finally, we show that web searches improve the short-term forecasting accuracy of autoregressive models for COVID-19 deaths.

The incidence of adverse events after each dose of vaccine was investigated. Propensity score matching was used to compare the incidence of adverse reactions after the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA and mRNA-1273 vaccines. RESULTS: After the first and second doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, and the first and second doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, 890, 853, 6401, and 3965 individuals, respectively, provided complete responses. Systemic reactions, including fever, fatigue, headache, muscle/joint pain, and nausea were significantly more common in females, individuals aged <50 years, and after the second dose. The incidence of injection site pain did not differ significantly according to the dose. The incidence of delayed injection site reactions after the first dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine was 3.9% and 0.8% among females and males, respectively, and 10.6% among females aged 30C69 years.

However, the pandemic has also ushered in increased administrative, teaching and out of work commitments for many researchers, leading to concerns that academics will become less willing to invest time in obtaining resources to undertake non-Covid-related projects. Using a large-scale survey of business, economics and management researchers, coupled with their publication histories and additional institutional data, we examine how far individuals experienced the focus on the pandemic as crowding out interest in, and undermining their confidence in applying for grants for work not focused on the pandemic. We found 40% of the sample agree that the pandemic has impaired their confidence in applying for non-pandemic-related grants and crowded out other projects. Researchers with current and prior grants, particularly those with the most experience of holding grants, scholars whose work impacted beyond academia, and early career researchers, disproportionately considered themselves to be most affected.

In small intestinal mucosa, ACE2 mRNA expression appears to increase with age and to display higher levels in patients taking ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I). There, ACE2 protein heterodimerizes with the neutral amino acid transporter Broad neutral Amino acid Transporter 1 (B0AT1) (SLC6A19) or the imino acid transporter Sodium-dependent Imino Transporter 1 (SIT1) (SLC6A20), associations that are required for the surface expression of these transport proteins. These heterodimers can form quaternary structures able to function as binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins. The heterodimerization of the carboxypeptidase ACE2 with B0AT1 is suggested to favor the direct supply of substrate amino acids to the transporter, but whether this association impacts the ability of ACE2 to mediate viral infection is not known. B0AT1 mutations cause Hartnup disorder, a condition characterized by neutral aminoaciduria and, in some cases, pellagra-like symptoms, such as photosensitive rash, diarrhea, and cerebellar ataxia. Correspondingly, the lack of ACE2 and the concurrent absence of B0AT1 expression in small intestine causes a decrease in l-tryptophan absorption, niacin deficiency, decreased intestinal antimicrobial peptide production, and increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. Thus, the abundant expression of ACE2 in small intestine and its association with amino acid transporters appears to play a crucial role for the digestion of peptides and the absorption of amino acids and, thereby, for the maintenance of structural and functional gut integrity.","output":"ACE2 and gut amino acid transport."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is more than a public health crisis. Lockdown measures have substantial societal effects, including a significant impact on parents with (young) children. Given the existence of persistent gender inequality prior to the pandemic, particularly among parents, it is crucial to study the societal impact of COVID-19 from a gender perspective. The objective of this paper is to use representative survey data gathered among Dutch parents in April 2020 to explore differences between mothers and fathers in three areas: paid work, the division of childcare and household tasks, and three dimensions of quality of life (leisure, work-life balance, relationship dynamics). Additionally, we explore whether changes take place in these dimensions by comparing the situation prior to the lockdown with the situation during the lockdown. METHOD: We use descriptive methods (crosstabulations) supported by multivariate modelling (linear regression modelling for continuous outcomes; linear probability modelling (LPM) for binary outcomes (0/1 outcomes); and multinomial logits for multinomial outcomes) in a cross-sectional survey design. RESULTS: Results show that the way in which parents were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a complex gendered reality. Mothers work in essential occupations more often than fathers, report more adjustments of the times at which they work, and experience both more and less work pressure in comparison to before the lockdown. Moreover, mothers continue to do more childcare and household work than fathers, but some fathers report taking on greater shares of childcare and housework during the lockdown in comparison to before. Mothers also report a larger decline in leisure time than fathers. We find no gender differences in the propensity to work from home, in perceived work-life balance, or in relationship dynamics. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we find that gender inequality in paid work, the division of childcare and household work, and the quality of life are evident during the first lockdown period. Specifically, we find evidence of an increase in gender inequality in relation to paid work and quality of life when comparing the situation prior to and during the lockdown, as well as a decrease in gender inequality in the division of childcare and household work. We conclude that the unique situation created by restrictive lockdown measures magnifies some gender inequalities while lessening others. DISCUSSION: The insights we provide offer key comparative evidence based on a representative, probability-based sample for understanding the broader impact of lockdown measures as we move forward in the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the limitations in this study is the cross-sectional design. Further study, in the form of a longitudinal design, will be crucial in investigating the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gender inequality.","output":"Intelligent lockdown, intelligent effects?

In our report, we have performed a comparative yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening approach to search direct cellular targets of the NS4 virulence factor encoded by two different serotypes of BTV: BTV8 and BTV27. This led to identifying Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) as a new interactor of the BTV-NS4. In contrast to BTV8, 1, 4 and 25, NS4 proteins from BTV27 and BTV30 are unable to interact with WTAP. This interaction with WTAP is carried by a peptide of 34 amino acids (NS4(22?55)) within its putative coil-coiled structure. Most importantly, we showed that binding to WTAP is restored with a chimeric protein where BTV27-NS4 is substituted by BTV8-NS4 in the region encompassing residue 22 to 55. We also demonstrated that WTAP silencing reduces viral titers and the expression of viral proteins, suggesting that BTV-NS4 targets a cellular function of WTAP to increase its viral replication.","output":"Comparative Virus-Host Protein Interactions of the Bluetongue Virus NS4 Virulence Factor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), the virus that causes COVID\\\\19, is highly infectious and variable, and given that we now understand a large proportion of asymptomatic carriers can be still infectious [1], it is expected that a normalization of epidemic prevention and control measures will be required for a long time worldwide.

Until the 1980s, oral and transdermal formulations providing therapeutic durations up to 24 h for small molecules dominated the drug delivery field and the market. The introduction of Lupron Depot? in 1989 opened the door for long-acting injectables and implantables, extending the drug delivery duration from days to months and occasionally years. Notably, the new technologies allowed long-term delivery of peptide and protein drugs, although limited to parenteral administration. The introduction of the first PEGylated protein, Adagen?, in 1990 marked the new era of PEGylation, resulting in Doxil? (doxorubicin in PEGylated liposome) in 1995, Movantik? (PEGylated naloxone - naloxegol) in 2014, and Onpattro? (Patisiran - siRNA in PEGylated lipid nanoparticle) in 2018. Drug-polymer complexes were introduced, e.g., InFed? (iron-dextran complex injection) in 1974 and Abraxane? (paclitaxel-albumin complex) in 2005. In 2000, both Mylotarg? (antibody-drug conjugate - gemtuzumab ozogamicin) and Rapamune?

The year 2000 also marked the launching of the National Nanotechnology Initiative by the U.S. government, which was soon followed by the rest of the world. Extensive work on nanomedicine, particularly formulations designed to escape from endosomes after being taken by tumor cells, along with PEGylation technology, ultimately resulted in the timely development of lipid nanoparticle formulations for COVID-19 vaccine delivery in 2020.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study protocol describes the methods of a scoping review of peer-reviewed literature related to social integration and loneliness among LTC home residents. A literature search was developed by an Information Specialist and will be conducted in MEDLINE(R) ALL (in Ovid, including Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily) and then translated into CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus, Sociological Abstracts (Proquest), Embase and Embase Classic (Ovid), Emcare Nursing (Ovid) and AgeLine (EBSCO). Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts of articles identified in the search. Two reviewers will then independently review full text articles for inclusion. Data extraction will also be carried out in duplicate. We will engage LTC home community members, including residents, family and staff, to refine the review questions, assist in interpreting the results and participate in knowledge translation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required. We will present findings at conferences and publish in a peer-reviewed journal. Ultimately, we hope to inform future observational and interventional research aimed at improving the health and quality of life of LTC home residents.","output":"Social integration and loneliness among long-term care home residents: protocol for a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether famotidine improved inflammation and symptomatic recovery in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19. DESIGN: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fully remote, phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04724720) enrolling symptomatic unvaccinated adult outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 between January 2021 and April 2021 from two US centres. Patients self-administered 80 mg famotidine (n=28) or placebo (n=27) orally three times a day for 14 consecutive days. Endpoints were time to (primary) or rate of (secondary) symptom resolution, and resolution of inflammation (exploratory). RESULTS: Of 55 patients in the intention-to-treat group (median age 35 years (IQR: 20); 35 women (64%); 18 African American (33%); 14 Hispanic (26%)), 52 (95%) completed the trial, submitting 1358 electronic symptom surveys. Time to symptom resolution was not statistically improved (p=0.4). Rate of symptom resolution was improved for patients taking famotidine (p<0.0001). Estimated 50% reduction of overall baseline symptom scores were achieved at 8.2 days (95% CI: 7 to 9.8 days) for famotidine and 11.4 days (95% CI: 10.3 to 12.6 days) for placebo treated patients. Differences were independent of patient sex, race or ethnicity. Five self-limiting adverse events occurred (famotidine, n=2 (40%); placebo, n=3 (60%)). On day 7, fewer patients on famotidine had detectable interferon alpha plasma levels (p=0.04). Plasma immunoglobulin type G levels to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid core protein were similar between both arms. CONCLUSIONS: Famotidine was safe and well tolerated in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Famotidine led to earlier resolution of symptoms and inflammation without reducing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity.

Controversies remain regarding the identity, proportion, and effects of adaptive mutations as SARS-CoV-2 evolves from a bat-to a human-adapted virus. The potential for vaccine-escape mutations poses additional challenges in pandemic control. Despite being of great interest to therapeutic and vaccine development, human-adaptive mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are masked by a genome-wide linkage disequilibrium under which neutral and even deleterious mutations can reach fixation by chance or through hitchhiking. Furthermore, genome-wide linkage equilibrium imposes clonal interference by which multiple adaptive mutations compete against one another. Informed by insights from microbial experimental evolution, we analyzed close to one million SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and identified putative human-adaptive mutations according to the rates of synonymous and missense mutations, temporal linkage, and mutation recurrence. Furthermore, we developed a forward-evolution simulator with the realistic SARS-CoV-2 genome structure and base substitution probabilities able to predict viral genome diversity under neutral, background selection, and adaptive evolutionary models. We conclude that adaptive mutations have emerged early, rapidly, and constantly to dominate SARS-CoV-2 populations despite clonal interference and purifying selection. Our analysis underscores a need for genomic surveillance of mutation trajectories at the local level for early detection of adaptive and immune-escape variants. Putative human-adaptive mutations are over-represented in viral proteins interfering host immunity and binding host-cell receptors and thus may serve as priority targets for designing therapeutics and vaccines against human-adapted forms of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Following the Trail of One Million Genomes: Footprints of SARS-CoV-2 Adaptation to Humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed a disproportionate infection rate among marginalized and low-income groups. Despite empirical evidence suggesting that structural inequalities in society contribute to health disparities, there has been little attempt to offer a computational and theoretical explanation to establish its plausibility and quantitative impact. This paper combines an agent-based network model and a compartmental susceptible-infectious-removed model (SIR) to explain how socioeconomic inequalities affect the dynamics of disease spreading. Specifically, we focus on two aspects of structural inequalities: wealth inequality and social segregation. Our computational model demonstrates that under high income inequality, the infection gap widens between the low-income and high-income groups, and also the overall infected cases increase. We also observed that social segregation between different socioeconomic status (SES) groups intensifies the spreading and hence mortality rates. Furthermore, we explain the second peak of the infectious cases during a pandemic as a result of a false sense of safety and loosening the quarantine, among the higher SES individuals. These findings send a strong message to policymakers; confinement measures must be accompanied by substantial financial assistance to those from lower-income groups so that the people regardless of their socioeconomic status can afford to stay in. Without financial assistance, lower-income individuals will remain in circulation, which will prolong the duration and magnitude of the infection.","output":"Structural inequalities exacerbate infection disparities: A computational approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polarizing opinions have recently arisen in hepatology on the name and redefinition of fatty liver disease associated with metabolic dysfunction. In spite of growing and robust evidence of the superior utility of the term metabolic (dysfunction) associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) definition for clinical and academic practice, controversy abounds. It should therefore come, as no surprise that the most common arguments used in contrarian op-eds is that there is no consensus on any name change. In this context, we suggest that discourse on an accurate understanding of what scientific consensus means, the various methods of achieving consensus, as well as other alternative models for reaching agreement is pivotal for the field. In this opinion piece, we provide an overview of these aspects as it applies to the case for fatty liver disease. We provide evidence that consensus on a change from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to MAFLD has already been achieved.

Currently, the world is suffering from the outbreak of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in which the COVID-19 virus has infected more than one hundred and twenty million people worldwide with more than two million deaths. Consequently, people tend to share COVID-19-related content on social media extensively. As a new pandemic, only a small number of studies have been conducted to analyze COVID-19-related tweets, and even fewer were meant for Arabic tweets. This research explores the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on Saudi users' tweeting behavior. In particular, the research adopts a social network analysis (SNA) for COVID-19 Arabic tweets. This approach is interesting, as it is based on analysis of social structures, such as Twitter users and the relationships among them, through the use of networks and graph theory without the contents of the tweets themselves. Based on 8905 collected Arabic tweets, this research resulted in three main contributions: 1) a visualization of the social network for COVID-19 tweets of Saudi users, 2) an identification of information sources that Twitter users employ during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 3) an identification of the most popular influencers among users of COVID-19 tweets.

STUDY DESIGN: A survey of caregivers accompanying their children aged 1-19 years old in 17 pediatric emergency departments in 6 countries at the peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Anonymous online survey included caregiver and child demographic information, vaccination history and future intentions, and concern about the child and caregiver having COVID-19 at the time of emergency department visit. RESULTS: Of 2422 surveys, 1314 (54.2%) caregivers stated they plan to vaccinate their child against influenza next year, an increase of 15.8% from the previous year. Of 1459 caregivers who did not vaccinate their children last year, 418 (28.6%) plan to do so next year. Factors predicting willingness to change and vaccinate included child's up-to-date vaccination status (aOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.29-3.32, P = .003); caregivers' influenza vaccine history (aOR 3.26, 95% CI 2.41-4.40, P < .010), and level of concern their child had COVID-19 (aOR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.17, P = .022).

Instructor methodologies allow for reflective practice through debriefing; however, this is limited to real-time audiences. Few studies have described education via supplemental materials. OBJECTIVE This educational initiative demonstrates the reception and use of a postsimulation newsletter for both participating and nonparticipating trauma team members. METHODS After each case, the Trauma Takeaways newsletter was distributed to all trauma team members at our Level I pediatric trauma center. The newsletter included a brief case summary, objectives, and debrief highlights regarding communication, medical management, and practical logistics. A survey was conducted to assess its utility 6 months after its introduction. RESULTS Of 69 interdisciplinary respondents, 46 reviewed the newsletter. The majority (69%) reported their trauma education is directly from simulation sessions. Thirty-nine percent of respondents found the newsletter most useful as a review when unable to attend, and 35% found it equally useful as compared with being an active participant. The majority of respondents found the newsletter either very helpful or extremely helpful. CONCLUSIONS Medical simulation cases traditionally capture a select audience during educational debriefing sessions. However, because the majority of our respondents receive their trauma education from simulation sessions, the need for supplementation is paramount. Our team members found the Takeaways similarly useful both as a direct participant or as an indirect participant as a helpful reference for communication, management, and practical logistics in pediatric trauma care.","output":"Trauma Takeaways: Reception and Utilization of a Postsimulation Newsletter."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Social prescribing (SP) allows health professionals to refer primary care patients toward health and wellbeing interventions and activities in the local community. Now widely implemented across the UK and adopted in other nations, questions arise concerning the modelling of present and future schemes, including challenges to full engagement encountered by stakeholders, which lie beyond the scope of traditional evaluations. Critical Systems Thinking (CST) allows for holistic analysis of fields where multiple stakeholders hold diverse interests and unequal power. METHODS: We use CST to (a) critically examine a developing rural social prescribing scheme from multiple stakeholder perspectives and (b) present a relational model for local social prescribing schemes. Our fieldwork included 24 in-depth interviews, regular planning meetings with key stakeholders, and discussions with those involved with national and international SP landscaping. A modified grounded theory approach was used for the analysis, and to consider the core elements of social prescribing sustainability. RESULTS: Our study confirms that local social prescribing schemes must operate with numerous stakeholder interests in mind, seeking to address real life social complexity and offer integrated solutions to multifaceted issues. Three main areas are discussed: holistic vision and boundary judgments; barriers and facilitators; relational issues and emotional buy in. Problems for staff include selecting suitable clients, feedback and technological issues and funding and evaluation pressures. Barriers for clients include health, transport and expense issues, also lack of prior information and GP involvement. Emotional buy-in emerged as essential for all stakeholders, but hard to sustain. Based on our findings we propose a positive relational model comprising shared vision, confidence and commitment; motivation and encouragement, support and wellbeing focus, collaborative relationships, communication and feedback, access to information /resources, learning in and from action, with emotional buy-in at its heart. CONCLUSION: Those implementing social prescribing in different localities inevitably face hard choices about what and whom to include. Research on the sustainability of social prescribing remains limited, studies are required to ascertain which holistic models of social prescribing work best for which communities, who are the main beneficiaries of these approaches and how buy-in is best sustained.","output":"Applying critical systems thinking to social prescribing: a relational model of stakeholder buy-in"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Replacing face-to-face lessons by remote teaching due to COVID-19 led to a markedly reduced interaction between students and lecturers. In our opinion, one of the main reasons for this is the raise hand function of the respective web conference systems, which (independent of the system used) results in an unobtrusive signal that can easily be missed by the lecturer. Given the necessary focus on one's own presentation, questions can therefore only be perceived with a considerable time delay and can only be integrated into the lessons to a limited extent. Thus, the idea arose to display question requests of the auditorium by a clear visual signal in PowerPoint? itself. Methodology: With Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), Microsoft PowerPoint? holds an integrated programming language that extends its functionality. Accordingly, VBA was used to program a routine running in the background of the presentation, which periodically retrieves the contents of a web-based \\"signal file\\" in a cycle of a few seconds. The content of this signal file, in turn, can be modified by the students by calling up an URL (i.e. from any Internet-capable device) - this results in a (customizable) visual signal in PowerPoint? that is temporarily visible and does not further interfere with the presentation. Conclusion: With the concept presented here, a raise hand function was realized in PowerPoint?, which manifests itself as a clear visual signal independent of the web conferencing system used.

We investigated whether use of low-dose aspirin, through initiation of LGIB, may lead patients to undergo colonoscopy and polypectomy before manifest CRC. DESIGN: We conducted a historical cohort study (2005-2013) of all Danish residents who initiated low-dose aspirin treatment (n=412 202) in a setting without screening for CRC. Each new aspirin user was matched with three non-users (n=1 236 560) by age, sex and region of residence on the date of their matched new user's first-time aspirin prescription (index date). We computed absolute risks (ARs), risk differences and relative risks (RRs) of LGIB, lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, colorectal polyps and CRC, comparing aspirin users with non-users. RESULTS: The ARs were higher for new users than non-users for LGIB, lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, colorectal polyps and CRC within 3 months after index. Comparing new users with non-users, the RRs were 2.79 (95% CI 2.40 to 3.24) for LGIB, 1.73 (95% CI 1.63 to 1.84) for lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, 1.56 (95% CI 1.42 to 1.72) for colorectal polyps and 1.73 (95% CI 1.51 to 1.98) for CRC.

This is a multi-center phase II double-blind, 2:1 randomized, parallel group comparison of the efficacy and safety of IV IFN beta-1a vs. placebo for the prevention of death after open surgery for an infra-renal RAAA. All study patients presented a confirmed infra-renal RAAA, survived the primary emergency surgery and were treated with IFN beta-1a (10 g) or matching placebo for 6 days after surgery. Major exclusion criteria included fatal hemorrhagic shock, chronic renal replacement therapy, diagnosed liver cirrhosis, severe congestive heart failure, advanced malignant disease, primary attempt of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), and per-operative suprarenal clamping over 30 min. Main outcome measure was all-cause mortality at day 30 (D30) from initial emergency aortic reconstruction. The study was pre-maturely stopped due to a reported drug-drug interaction and was left under-powered. Out of 40 randomized patients 38 were included in the outcome analyses (27 IFN beta-1a and 11 placebo). There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups at baseline except more open-abdomen and intestinal ischemia was present in the IFN beta-1a arm. D30 all-cause mortality was 22.2% (6/27) in the IFN beta-1a arm and 18.2% (2/11) in the placebo arm (OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.21C8.19). The most common adverse event relating to the IFN beta-1a was pyrexia (20.7% in the IFN beta-1a arm vs. 9.1% in the placebo arm). Patients with high level of serum CD73 associated with survival (P = 0.001) whereas the use of glucocorticoids and the presence of IFN beta-1a neutralizing antibodies associated with a poor CD73 response and survival. The initial aim of the trial, if postoperative INF beta-1a treatment results on better RAAA survival, could not be demonstrated.

Methods to reduce anxiety, such as hospital tours, have not been possible during the COVID-19 pandemic prompting us to reimagine how these can be delivered. Use of Virtual Reality (VR) in Paediatrics has largely focused on distraction during a procedure but VR can be effectively used preoperatively to reduce anxiety. Preadmission use of VR to reduce anxiety has also demonstrated a potential health economic benefit. We describe progress in developing a VR environment to simulate hospital tours in a Paediatric Hospital in the United Kingdom.

The VR environment must be accessible and interactive for CYP aged 8-21 years using a smartphone or device and VR headset at home, the content and design of which is informed by the experience and opinions of CYP at every stage of development. Methods Initial input of CYP was sought at a Young People's Forum. Discussions informing both the content and design were facilitated by healthcare professionals and involved CYP aged 10-18 years. A VR developer then created a digitally rendered anaesthetic room to produce a minimum viable product (MVP) using 'Autodesk Maya' and 'Unity' software. A 360 video of an anaesthetic room was also developed. Information provided within the VR environment was produced by Paediatric Healthcare professionals with input from experts in acute Paediatric anxiety. Focus groups of CYP will provide qualitative feedback to drive improvement cycles of the VR environment on a regular basis along with integration of interactivity and gamification. Following this patients will be invited to experience the virtual environment. Results CYP felt that a VR environment could help reduce preprocedure anxiety. They identified reducing uncertainty, optimising comfort, familiarity and trust in healthcare professionals and understanding medical devices and the physical experience as key factors for consideration when developing the VR environment. A calm environment with a relatable character, interactivity and gamification were identified as design priorities. The initial focus group review of the MVP is scheduled imminently with a plan to complete improvement cycles on a three monthly basis. Patients will be offered the opportunity to explore the VR environment at their pre-assessment appointment if the healthcare team and parent/guardian believe they may benefit. Conclusions Preprocedure anxiety is a major factor affecting the experience of CYP. This project aims to counter that using VR technology. The engagement of key stakeholders to inform throughout development ensures constant relevance is maintained in design and delivery. Reducing uncertainty, optimising familiarity and trust in the healthcare environment and team were identified as key factors in reducing anxiety. Interactivity and gamification are important in enhancing engagement. Ongoing review with CYP will shape and extend this tool with a view to building an interactive VR hospital allowing exploration of the whole hospital journey.","output":"Virtual reality hospital: Developing a patient centred virtual environment to reduce preprocedural anxiety in children and young people"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Bleeding is an important complication in children following tonsillectomy. Screening with coagulation tests prior to procedure is common to assess bleeding risk in the perioperative period, although ASH/ASPHO Choosing Wisely guidelines recommend against routine PT/PTT testing. Our aim was to compare von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) and activity levels among patients with postoperative bleeding following tonsillectomy to evaluate for potential risk for bleeding. PROCEDURE Eligible subjects were aged 0-18 without significant personal or family history of major bleeding. Postoperative bleeding diaries were collected and symptoms measured using a postoperative bleeding score. Plasma VWF levels were drawn at time of anesthesia administration. RESULTS Postoperative bleeding occurred in 248 cases out of 1399 total subjects. Median VWF:Ag was 86 in patients with postoperative bleeding scores of 1-2, 86 for scores 3-4, 84 for scores 5-6, and 83 for scores >6, with no significant difference among groups (p = .98). Additionally, no difference was observed for subjects with multiple days of postoperative bleeding as compared to those with only 1 day of postoperative bleeding. Finally, no difference in VWF:Ag was observed for subjects whose first reported bleed occurred early in the postoperative course compared to those whose first reported bleed occurred later. VWF:Ag does not correlate with severity of bleeding, time of onset of first bleeding event, or recurrence of bleeding in healthy children with no personal or family history of bleeding who have postoperative bleeding following tonsillectomy.

Non-Asian pharmaceutical companies were more likely to belong to the two reputation indices than Asian ones, and to occupy the best positions in the Merco ranking. Although no large differences appeared in the firms in both indices, differences were found in the position that pharmaceutical companies occupied in rankings and in the variables that contribute to them occupying these positions.

Although detailed evaluation on phylogenetic analysis of HMPV has been described in other countries, there are no data from Turkey on this subject. The aim of this study was to demonstrate for the first time, the phylogenetic diversity of HMPV strains circulating in Turkey during two consecutive epidemic seasons. A total of 2900 upper respiratory tract samples collected from patients with respiratory illness were evaluated between January 2011 and December 2013, without any special selection criteria. The presence of respiratory viruses in the samples were detected by real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (FTD? Respiratory Pathogens 21 Multiplex RT-PCR, Fast Track Diagnostics, Luxemburg), and 76 (2.6%) samples positive for HMPV were included in the study. HPMV nucleocapsid (N) (nt: 454-878) and fusion (F) (nt: 3624-4130) genes were selected for phylogenetic analysis. In sequence analysis, F and N gene sequences could only be obtained successfully from 46 out of 76 HMPV positive samples. According to sequences obtained, 54.3% belonged to B2, 17.4% to B1, 4.3% to A1, 4.3% to A2a, and 20% to A2b. In 2011, the A2b sublineage was predominant, while in 2012 and 2013, B2 lineages were predominant together with the B1 lineage. The A1 lineage was observed only in 2013. For the F gene fragment, nucleotide distance between group A and B was in the range of 0.138-0.168, however aminoacid distance amongst Turkish HMPV sequences were in the range of 0.028-0.042. For the N gene fragment, nucleotide distance between group A and B was in the range of 0.141-0.163, but aminoacid distance between group A and B was in the range of 0.037-0.050. Nucleotide diversity was higher than aminoacid diversity between and within lineages found in this study. This result indicated that the functional constraints on F and N genes prevent dramatic aminoacid changes, and indicated that the evolution of HMPV was slow. The seasonal peaks were observed from April to July in 2011, from January to June in 2012 and from January to May in 2013. In addition, our data emphasized that the HMPV prevalence was high in children 0-5 years old, and coinfections were common with the other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus 3, rhinovirus and enterovirus. In conclusion, this study showed that HMPV strains circulating in Turkey were similar to those circulating in Europe.","output":"[Phylogenetic variability of human metapneumovirus strains circulating in Turkey during two consecutive epidemic seasons]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The early identification of fragile populations in the Covid-19 era would help governments to allocate resources and plan strategies to contain consequences of the pandemic. Beyond frailty, social vulnerability to environmental stressors, such as the social distancing enforced to reduce the SARS-CoV2 contagion, can modify long-term disease risk and induce health status changes in the general population. Methods: We assessed frailty and social vulnerability indices in 1258 Italian residents during the lockdown phase (March 14-31, 2020) via an on-line survey. We compared indices taking into account age categories (young, middle, older adults and elders) and gender. Results: While frailty showed a linear increase with age and was greater in females than in males, social vulnerability was higher in young adults and elders compared to middle aged and older adults, and in males than females. Both frailty and social vulnerability contributed in explaining the individual perception of the impact of Covid-19 emergency on health, which was further modulated by proactive attitudes/behaviors and social isolation. Conclusions: Social isolation and loneliness following the Covid-19 outbreak may exert dramatic psychosocial effects in the general population. The early detection of vulnerable categories, at risk to become ill and develop long-lasting health status changes, would help in the next future to prevent consequences on general well-being by allocating resources to targeted interventions managing psychosocial distress and increasing young adults and elderly resilience towards the post-Covid-19 crisis.","output":"Identifying frail populations for disease risk prediction and intervention planning in the Covid-19 era: a focus on social isolation and psychosocial vulnerability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detailed immunological analysis in a new study provides insight into the mechanisms of immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in people who are receiving B cell-depleting therapy for multiple sclerosis.

Expression of TMPRSS2 is essential for the spread and pathogenesis of H1N1 influenza viruses in mice. In contrast, H3N2 viruses are less dependent on TMPRSS2 for viral amplification, suggesting that these viruses might employ other TTSPs for their activation. Here, we analyzed TTSPs, reported to be expressed in the respiratory system, for the ability to activate influenza viruses and coronaviruses. We found that MSPL and, to a lesser degree, DESC1 are expressed in human lung tissue and cleave and activate the spike proteins of the Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses for cell-cell and virus-cell fusion. In addition, we show that these proteases support the spread of all influenza virus subtypes previously pandemic in humans. In sum, we identified two host cell proteases that could promote the amplification of influenza viruses and emerging coronaviruses in humans and might constitute targets for antiviral intervention. Importance: Activation of influenza viruses by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity and the enzymes responsible are potential targets for antiviral intervention. The present study demonstrates that two cellular serine proteases, DESC1 and MSPL, activate influenza viruses and emerging coronaviruses in cell culture and, because of their expression in human lung tissue, might promote viral spread in the infected host.

In this study, we performed a survey study of virtual lecture attendees and presenters to determine current usage and general consensus on virtual lectures in plastic surgery education. METHODS: An electronic survey was sent to attendees and presenters of virtual lectures using Google Forms. Demographic data, webinar usage patterns, and views on virtual lectures were collected. RESULTS: A total of 417 surveys were received. Prior to the COVID-19 era, 39.1percent of attendees did not use virtual lectures and 45.6percent of presenters did not give webinars at all. Both groups reported that the lack of opportunities and need were the most common cause of no use of lectures or webinars. After the outbreak, 35.4percent of attendees now use virtual lectures daily and 51.4percent of presenters give lectures weekly. Over 90percent of the study population reported a positive experience with the virtual lectures due to increased interaction, convenience, outreach, and usability. Finally, over 75percent stated that virtual lectures might replace classroom lectures in the future. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that a majority of plastic surgeons have begun to use and give virtual lectures daily after the COVID-19 outbreak.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 1,000 digital bitewing radiographs were randomly selected from the database. Of these, 800 were augmented and annotated as decay by two experienced dentists using a labeling tool developed in Python programming language. The 800 radiographs were consisted of 11,521 approximal surfaces of which 1,847 were decayed (lesion prevalence for train data was 16.03%). A CNN model known as you only look once (YOLO) was modified and trained to detect caries lesions in bitewing radiographs. After using the other 200 radiographs to test the effectiveness of the proposed CNN model, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. RESULTS: The lesion prevalence for test data was 13.89%. The overall accuracy of the CNN model was 94.59% (94.19% for premolars, 94.97% for molars), sensitivity was 72.26% (75.51% for premolars, 68.71% for molars), specificity was 98.19% (97.43% for premolars, 98.91% for molars), PPV was 86.58% (83.61% for premolars, 90.44% for molars), and NPV was 95.64% (95.82% for premolars, 95.47% for molars).

In this study, we addressed the problem of contactless estimation of RR and classification of RP of one person or two persons in a confined space under realistic conditions. We used three impulse radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB) radars and a 3D depth camera (Kinect) to avoid any blind spot in the room and to ensure that at least one of the radars covers the monitored subjects. This article proposes a subject localization and radar selection algorithm using a Kinect camera to allow the measurement of the respiration of multiple people placed at random locations. Several different experiments were conducted to verify the algorithms proposed in this work. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the estimated RR and reference RR of one-subject and two-subjects RR estimation are 0.610.53 breaths/min and 0.680.24 breaths/min, respectively. A respiratory pattern classification algorithm combining feature-based random forest classifier and pattern discrimination algorithm was developed to classify different respiration patterns including eupnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, Kussmaul respiration and apnea.

While small molecule docking simulations are often applied in conjunction with cheminformatic methods to reduce the number of candidate molecules to be tested experimentally, the current approaches suffer from high false positive rates and are computationally expensive. Here, we present a novel in silico approach for drug discovery and repurposing, dubbed connectivity enhanced Structure Activity Relationship (ceSAR) that improves on current methods by combining docking and virtual screening approaches with pharmacogenomics and transcriptional signature connectivity analysis. ceSAR builds on the landmark LINCS library of transcriptional signatures of over 20,000 drug-like molecules and ~5,000 gene knock-downs (KDs) to connect small molecules and their potential targets. For a set of candidate molecules and specific target gene, candidate molecules are first ranked by chemical similarity to their concordant LINCS analogs that share signature similarity with a knock-down of the target gene. An efficient method for chemical similarity search, optimized for sparse binary fingerprints of chemical moieties, is used to enable fast searches for large libraries of small molecules. A small subset of candidate compounds identified in the first step is then re-scored by combining signature connectivity with docking simulations. On a set of 20 DUD-E benchmark targets with LINCS KDs, the consensus approach reduces significantly false positive rates, improving the median precision 3-fold over docking methods at the extreme library reduction. We conclude that signature connectivity and docking provide complementary signals, offering an avenue to improve the accuracy of virtual screening while reducing run times by multiple orders of magnitude.","output":"Accelerating Drug Discovery and Repurposing by Combining Transcriptional Signature Connectivity with Docking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"College students worldwide and in Turkey face many biopsychosocial spiritual and economic issues, in part due to developmental and contextual factors.

We tested the effect of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) VPgPro on translation of reporter RNAs in in vitro translation systems. The presence of VPgPro in either wheat germ extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems lead to inhibition of translation. The inhibition did not appear to be mediated by the interaction of VPg with the eIF(iso)4E translation initiation factor since a VPg mutant that does not interact with eIF(iso)4E still inhibited translation. Monitoring the fate of RNAs revealed that they were degraded as a result of addition of TuMV VPgPro or of Norwalk virus (NV) VPg protein. The RNA degradation was not the result of translation being arrested and was heat labile and partially EDTA sensitive. The capacity of TuMV VPgPro and of (NV) VPg to degrade RNA suggests that these proteins have a ribonucleolytic activity which may contribute to the host RNA translation shutoff associated with many virus infections.","output":"The VPgPro protein of Turnip mosaic virus: In vitro inhibition of translation from a ribonuclease activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major reason of cerebrovascular and neurological damage.

In this context, temporal aggregation and reconciliation techniques have been useful in improving forecasts, reducing model uncertainty, and providing a coherent forecast across different time horizons. However, an underlying assumption spanning all these techniques is the complete availability of data across all levels of the temporal hierarchy, while this offers mathematical convenience but most of the time low frequency data is partially completed and it is not available while forecasting. On the other hand, high frequency data can significantly change in a scenario like the COVID pandemic and this change can be used to improve forecasts that will otherwise significantly diverge from long term actuals. We propose a dynamic reconciliation method whereby we formulate the problem of informing low frequency forecasts based on high frequency actuals as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) allowing for the fact that we do not have complete information about the dynamics of the process. This allows us to have the best long term estimates based on the most recent data available even if the low frequency cycles have only been partially completed. The MDP has been solved using a Time Differenced Reinforcement learning (TDRL) approach with customizable actions and improves the long terms forecasts dramatically as compared to relying solely on historical low frequency data. The result also underscores the fact that while low frequency forecasts can improve the high frequency forecasts as mentioned in the temporal reconciliation literature (based on the assumption that low frequency forecasts have lower noise to signal ratio) the high frequency forecasts can also be used to inform the low frequency forecasts.","output":"Dynamic Temporal Reconciliation by Reinforcement learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This article focuses on the critical care nurses role in the management of patients with COVID-19 who require invasive ventilation in order to improve outcomes and prevent complications.

In order to reduce the risk of complications and an overview of invasive ventilation, including commonly used modes, potential complications, nursing care, weaning and extubation are all described. COVID-19 presents several challenges as the disease progresses, hypoxemia may worsen, and the patient can develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Therefore, additional treatment strategies including the use of the prone position and the use of nitric oxide and prostacyclin nebulisers have been included. The strategies presented in this article are relevant to both critical care nurses and those re-deployed to intensive care units where nurses will inevitably be involved in the management of patients requiring invasive ventilation. Weaning these patients off invasive ventilation is multi-factorial and may be short or long term. A multi-disciplinary weaning plan, the principles, stages/phases, and speed of weaning with expected parameters prior extubation are explained.

These variants included a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of pHu-E16 fused to the heavy chain (HC) constant domains (C(H) (1-3)) of human IgG (pHu-E16scFv-C(H) (1-3)) and a tetravalent molecule (Tetra pHu-E16) assembled from pHu-E16scFv-C(H) (1-3) with a second pHu-E16scFv fused to the light chain (LC) constant region. pHu-E16scFv-C(H) (1-3) and Tetra pHu-E16 were efficiently expressed and assembled in plants. To assess the impact of differences in N-linked glycosylation on pHu-E16 variant assembly and function, we expressed additional pHu-E16 variants with various combinations of HC and LC components. Our study revealed that proper pairing of HC and LC was essential for the complete N-glycan processing of antibodies in both plant and animal cells. Associated with their distinct N-glycoforms, pHu-E16, pHu-E16scFv-C(H) (1-3) and Tetra pHu-E16 exhibited differential binding to C1q and specific Fc receptors (FcR). Notably, none of the plant-derived Hu-E16 variants showed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity in CD32A(+) human cells, suggesting the potential of plant-produced antibodies to minimize the adverse effect of ADE. Importantly, all plant-derived MAb variants exhibited at least equivalent in vitro neutralization and in vivo protection in mice compared to mammalian cell-produced Hu-E16. This study demonstrates the capacity of plants to express and assemble a large, complex and functional IgG-like tetravalent mAb variant and also provides insight into the relationship between MAb N-glycosylation, FcR and C1q binding, and ADE. These new insights may allow the development of safer and cost effective MAb-based therapeutics for flaviviruses, and possibly other pathogens.","output":"Generation and Analysis of Novel Plant-Derived Antibody-Based Therapeutic Molecules against West Nile Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: India has been severely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to shortcomings in disease surveillance, the burden of mortality associated with COVID-19 remains poorly understood. We aimed to assess changes in mortality during the pandemic in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, using data on all-cause mortality within the district. METHODS: For this observational study, we analysed comprehensive death registrations in Chennai, from Jan 1, 2016, to June 30, 2021. We estimated expected mortality without the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by fitting models to observed mortality time series during the pre-pandemic period, with stratification by age and sex. Additionally, we considered three periods of interest: the first 4 weeks of India's first lockdown (March 24 to April 20, 2020), the 4-month period including the first wave of the pandemic in Chennai (May 1 to Aug 31, 2020), and the 4-month period including the second wave of the pandemic in Chennai (March 1 to June 30, 2021). We computed the difference between observed and expected mortality from March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021, and compared pandemic-associated mortality across socioeconomically distinct communities (measured with use of 2011 census of India data) with regression analyses. FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, 87 870 deaths were registered in areas of Chennai district represented by the 2011 census, exceeding expected deaths by 25 990 (95% uncertainty interval 25 640C26 360) or 518 (511C525) excess deaths per 1000 people. Stratified by age, excess deaths numbered 2102 (2054C2149) excess deaths per 1000 people for individuals aged 60C69 years, 3974 (3873C4069) for those aged 70C79 years, and 9690 (9335C10016) for those aged 80 years or older. Neighbourhoods with lower socioeconomic status had 07% to 28% increases in pandemic-associated mortality per 1 SD increase in each measure of community disadvantage, due largely to a disproportionate increase in mortality within these neighbourhoods during the second wave. Conversely, differences in excess mortality across communities were not clearly associated with socioeconomic status measures during the first wave. For each increase by 1 SD in measures of community disadvantage, neighbourhoods had 36% to 86% lower pandemic-associated mortality during the first 4 weeks of India's country-wide lockdown, before widespread SARS-CoV-2 circulation was underway in Chennai. The greatest reductions in mortality during this early lockdown period were observed among men aged 20C29 years, with 58% (54C62) fewer deaths than expected from pre-pandemic trends. INTERPRETATION: Mortality in Chennai increased substantially but heterogeneously during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the greatest burden concentrated in disadvantaged communities. Reported COVID-19 deaths greatly underestimated pandemic-associated mortality. FUNDING: National Institute of General Medical Sciences, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, National Science Foundation.

This review focuses on two related classes of short non-coding RNA: microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). miRNAs are endogenous short RNAs that bind multiple messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and prevent the production of their gene-products, whereas siRNAs are exogenous RNAs that target a single and specific mRNA for degradation. This review describes the development, challenges, and clinical successes of short RNA-based drugs. We provide several examples of how these RNA drugs are designed, chemically modified and delivered for treatment of different cancer types, cardiovascular disease, and rare genetic disorders. We highlight the similarities, differences, and considerations to maximize the treatment efficacy of miRNA-based vs. siRNA-based drugs. ABSTRACT: Traditional targeted therapeutic agents have relied on small synthetic molecules or large proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies. These agents leave a lot of therapeutic targets undruggable because of the lack or inaccessibility of active sites and/or pockets in their three-dimensional structure that can be chemically engaged. RNA presents an attractive, transformative opportunity to reach any genetic target with therapeutic intent. RNA therapeutic design is amenable to modularity and tunability and is based on a computational blueprint presented by the genetic code. Here, we will focus on short non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) as a promising therapeutic modality because of their potency and versatility. We review recent progress towards clinical application of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for single-target therapy and microRNA (miRNA) activity modulators for multi-target therapy. siRNAs derive their potency from the fact that the underlying RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism is catalytic and reliant on post-transcriptional mRNA degradation. Therapeutic siRNAs can be designed against virtually any mRNA sequence in the transcriptome and specifically target a disease-causing mRNA variant. Two main classes of microRNA activity modulators exist to increase (miRNA mimics) or decrease (anti-miRNA inhibitors) the function of a specific microRNA. Since a single microRNA regulates the expression of multiple target genes, a miRNA activity modulator can have a more profound effect on global gene expression and protein output than siRNAs do. Both types of sncRNA-based drugs have been investigated in clinical trials and some siRNAs have already been granted FDA approval for the treatment of genetic, cardiometabolic, and infectious diseases. Here, we detail clinical results using siRNA and miRNA therapeutics and present an outlook for the potential of these sncRNAs in medicine.","output":"Clinical Applications of Short Non-Coding RNA-Based Therapies in the Era of Precision Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen El asma es una de las enfermedades crnicas ms prevalentes en Espa?a.

OBJECTIVES: Delineate the different patterns of olfactory disorders recovery in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional cohort study included 96 patients with olfactory complaint confirmed to be COVID-19 positive with recent onset of anosmia. All patients were inquired for smell recovery patterns using self-assessment questionnaires. RESULTS: Ninety six patients completed the study with mean age 34.26a?a?11.91a?years. Most patients had sudden anosmia 83%. Loss of smell was accompanied by nonspecific inflammatory symptoms as low-grade fever (17%) and generalized body ache (25%). Nasal symptoms were reported by 33% of patients. Some patients reported comorbidities as D.M (16%), hypertension (8%) or associated allergic rhinitis (25%), different patterns of olfactory recovery showed 32 patients experiencing full recovery (33.3%) while, 40 patients showed partial recovery (41.7%) after a mean of 11a?days while 24 patients (25%) showed no recovery within one month from onset of anosmia. CONCLUSION: The sudden olfactory dysfunction is a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. Hyposmia patients recover more rapidly than anosmic ones while the middle age group carried the best prognosis in olfactory recovery.

ABSTRACT: The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) is one of the most frequently killed species on Lithuanian roads. As an invasive species, up-to-date knowledge of population size, trends and spatial distribution is critically important both for species assessment and for the planning of control measures. In Lithuania, however, raccoon dog surveys have not been carried out since 1997. We investigated, therefore, whether roadkill counts on predefined routes could be used as a proxy for a survey. Our dataset includes survey numbers for the period 1956C1997, hunting bag sizes for 1965C2020 (including the spatial distribution of the hunting bag in 2018C2020) and roadkill data relating to 1551 individuals between 2002C2020. At the most local scale, that of the hunting areas of hunting clubs, correlations between the numbers of hunted and roadkilled individuals were negative and insignificant or absent. At the country scale, however, we found significant correlation both between the numbers surveyed and hunted in 1965C1997 (r = 0.88), and between those hunted and the number of roadkills in 2002C2020 (r = 0.56C0.69).

METHODS: We performed proteomic analysis and immunostaining of postmortem lung tissues from COVID-19 patients and patients with other lung pathologies. We further compared coagulation factor XII (FXII) and DNase activities in plasma samples from COVID-19 patients and healthy control donors and determined NET-induced FXII activation using a chromogenic substrate assay. FINDINGS: FXII expression and activity were increased in the lung parenchyma, within the pulmonary vasculature and in fibrin-rich alveolar spaces of postmortem lung tissues from COVID-19 patients. In agreement with this, plasmaaac acafajf?eFXII activation (FXIIa) was increased in samples from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, FXIIa colocalized with NETs in COVID-19 lung tissue indicating that NETs accumulation leads to FXII contact activation in COVID-19. We further showed that an accumulation of NETs is partially due to impaired NET clearance by extracellular DNases as DNase substitution improved NET dissolution and reduced FXII activation in vitro.

AIMS The aim of this study is to examine gut microbiota changes after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) surgery in obese patients with T2D. METHODS Whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing of DNA fragments using Illumina HiSeq2000 was obtained from stool samples collected from 14 obese T2D patients pre-operatively (while on very low calorie diet) and 1 year after randomisation to laparoscopic SG (n = 7) or RYGB (n = 7). Resulting shotgun reads were annotated with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). RESULTS Body weight reduction and dietary change was similar 1 year after both surgery types. Identical proportions (n = 5/7) achieved diabetes remission (HbA1c < 48 mmol/mol without medications) 1 year after RYGB and SG. RYGB resulted in increased Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phyla but decreased Bacteroidetes phyla. SG resulted in increased Bacteroidetes phyla. Only an increase in Roseburia species was observed among those achieving diabetes remission, common to both surgery types. KEGG Orthology and pathway analysis predicted contrasting and greater gut microbiota metabolism changes after diabetes remission following RYGB than after SG. Those with persistent diabetes post-operatively had higher Desulfovibrio species pre-operatively. CONCLUSIONS Overall, RYGB produces greater and more predicted favourable changes in gut microbiota functional capacity than SG. An increase in Roseburia species was the only compositional change common to both types of surgery among those achieving diabetes remission.","output":"Differential Changes in Gut Microbiota After Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy Bariatric Surgery Vary According to Diabetes Remission."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic forced many people to abruptly shift to remote work in early 2020.

This study evaluated patient demographic factors associated with delayed breast imaging or procedure appointments due to COVID-19. Methods: Patients attending a breast imaging or procedure appointment at the Pennsylvania Hospital Breast Center from December 28, 2020 to January 31, 2021 were asked to complete a voluntary and anonymous survey on the impact of COVID-19. Chi-squared and two-sample t-tests were used to analyze correlations between having a delayed appointment and various demographic variables. Results: Five hundred seventy patients completed the survey. Participants were more likely to have delayed a breast imaging or procedure appointment if they were younger (53.9 versus 57.4 years old, p=0.014), had more total household residents (2.7 versus 2.2, p=0.019) or children (0.8 versus 0.4, p=0.016), personally had COVID-19 (p=0.04), or personally had to quarantine (p<0.01).

Evidently, identifying and addressing every single vulnerability is an arduous, if not impossible, task. Attack taxonomies can assist in classifying attacks and their corresponding vulnerabilities. Security countermeasures and best practices can then be leveraged to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities before they emerge into catastrophic attacks and ensure overall secure IoT operation. Therefore, in this paper, we provide an attack taxonomy which takes into consideration the different layers of IoT stack, i.e., device, infrastructure, communication, and service, and each layer's designated characteristics which can be exploited by adversaries. Furthermore, using nine real-world cybersecurity incidents, that had targeted IoT devices deployed in the consumer, commercial, and industrial sectors, we describe the IoT-related vulnerabilities, exploitation procedures, attacks, impacts, and potential mitigation mechanisms and protection strategies.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study including all patients with SLE (ACR-1997 criteria) included in the Spanish Society of Rheumatology Lupus Register (RELESSER), based on historically gathered data. Patients with CHF prior to diagnosis of SLE were excluded. A multivariable analysis exploring factors associated with CHF was conducted. RESULTS: The study population comprised 117 patients with SLE (ACR-97 criteria) and CHF and 3,506 SLE controls. Ninety percent were women. Patients with CHF were older and presented greater SLE severity, organ damage, and mortality than those without CHF. The multivariable model revealed the factors associated with CHF to be ischemic heart disease (7.96 [4.01-15.48], p<0.0001), cardiac arrhythmia (7.38 [4.00-13.42], p<0.0001), pulmonary hypertension (3.71 [1.84-7.25], p<0.0002), valvulopathy (6.33 [3.41-11.62], p<0.0001), non-cardiovascular damage (1.29 [1.16-1.44], p<0.000) and calcium/vitamin D treatment (5.29 [2.07-16.86], p=0.0015).

Evolutionary distinct categories of TE represent nucleic acid sequences that are repeatedly copied from and pasted into chromosomes at multiple genomic locations and acquired a multitude of regulatory functions. Here, genomics-guided maps of stemness regulatory signatures were drawn to dissect the contribution of TE to clinical manifestations of malignant phenotypes of human cancers. From patients and physicians perspectives, the clinical definition of a tumors malignant phenotype could be restricted to the early diagnosis of sub-types of malignancies with the increased risk of existing therapy failure and high likelihood of death from cancer. It is the viewpoint from which the understanding of stemness and malignant regulatory signatures is considered in this contribution. Genomics-guided analyses of experimental and clinical observations revealed the pivotal role of human stem cell-associated retroviral sequences (SCARS) in the origin and pathophysiology of clinically-lethal malignancies. SCARS were defined as the evolutionary- and biologically-related family of genomic regulatory sequences, the principal physiological function of which is to create and maintain the stemness phenotype during human preimplantation embryogenesis. For cell differentiation to occur, SCARS expression must be silenced and SCARS activity remains repressed in most terminally-differentiated human cells which are destined to perform specialized functions in the human body. Epigenetic reprogramming, de-repression, and sustained activity of SCARS results in various differentiation-defective phenotypes. One of the most prominent tissue- and organ-specific clinical manifestations of sustained SCARS activities is diagnosed as a pathological condition defined by a consensus of morphological, molecular, and genetic examinations as the malignant growth. Here, contemporary evidence are acquired, analyzed, and reported defining both novel diagnostic tools and druggable molecular targets readily amenable for diagnosis and efficient therapeutic management of clinically-lethal malignancies. These diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are based on monitoring of high-fidelity molecular signals of continuing SCARS activities in conjunction with genomic regulatory networks of thousands functionally-active embryonic enhancers affecting down-stream phenotype-altering genetic loci. Collectively, reported herein observations support a model of SCARS-activation triggered singular source code facilitating the intracellular propagation and intercellular (systemic) dissemination of disease states in the human body.","output":"Genomics-Guided Drawing of Molecular and Pathophysiological Components of Malignant Regulatory Signatures Reveals a Pivotal Role in Human Diseases of Stem Cell-Associated Retroviral Sequences and Functionally-Active hESC Enhancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bovine Rotavirus and Bovine Coronavirus are the most important causes of diarrhea in newborn calves and in some other species such as pigs and sheep.

Sequence data were linked to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms entered by recruiting clinicians. METHODS: Eighty-three prescreened probands were recruited to the 100,000 Genomes Project suspected to have congenital malformations caused by ciliopathies in the following disease categories: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (n=45), Joubert syndrome (n=14) and 'Rare Multisystem Ciliopathy Disorders' (n=24). We implemented a bespoke variant filtering and analysis strategy to improve molecular diagnostic rates for these participants. RESULTS: We determined a research molecular diagnosis for n=43/83 (51.8%) probands. This is 19.3% higher than previously reported by GEL (n=27/83 (32.5%)). A high proportion of diagnoses are due to variants in non-ciliopathy disease genes (n=19/43, 44.2%) which may reflect difficulties in clinical recognition of ciliopathies. n=11/83 probands (13.3%) had at least one causative variant outside the tiers 1 and 2 variant prioritisation categories (GEL's automated triaging procedure), which would not be reviewed in standard 100,000 Genomes Project diagnostic strategies.

Several different infectious agents can cause neurodegenerative conditions, with prominent examples being human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) dementia and prion disorders. Such infections of the central nervous system (CNS) typically have a relatively long incubation period and a chronic progressive course, and are therefore increasing in frequency as more people live longer. Infectious agents may enter the central nervous system in infected migratory macrophages, by transcytosis across bloodCbrain barrier cells or by intraneuronal transfer from peripheral nerves. Synapses and lipid rafts are important sites at which infectious agents may enter neurons and/or exert their cytotoxic effects. Recent findings suggest the possibility that infectious agents may increase the risk of common age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stroke. While scenarios can be envisioned whereby viruses such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, herpes simplex and influenza promote damage to neurons during aging, there is no conclusive evidence for a major role of these pathogens in neurodegenerative disorders.

The abrupt nature of these shifts provides a naturalistic opportunity to examine adaptations for opioid use disorder treatment in primary care. OBJECTIVE: To examine change in medical and behavioral health appointment frequency, visit type, and management of patients with opioid use disorder in response to COVID-19. DESIGN: A 14-item survey queried primary care practices that were enrolled in a medications for opioid use disorder statewide expansion project. Survey content focused on changes in service delivery because of COVID-19. The survey was open for 18 days. PARTICIPANTS: We surveyed 338 clinicians from 57 primary care clinics located in California, including federally qualified health centers and look-alikes. A representative from all 57 clinics (100%) and 118 staff (34.8% of all staff clinicians) participated in the survey. MAIN MEASURES: The survey consisted of seven dimensions of practice: medical visits, behavioral health visits, medication management, urine drug screenings, workflow, perceived patient demand, and staff experience. KEY RESULTS: A total of 52 of 57 (91.2%) primary care clinics reported practice adaptations in response to COVID-19 regulatory changes. Many clinics indicated that both medical (40.4%) and behavioral health visits (53.8%) were now exclusively virtual. Two-thirds (65.4%) of clinics reported increased duration of buprenorphine prescriptions and reduced urine drug screenings (67.3%). The majority (56.1%) of clinics experienced an increase in patient demand for behavioral health services. Over half (56.2%) of clinics described having an easier or unchanged experience retaining patients in care.

This study aimed to determine the predictive role of tendency toward mobile learning (purposeful use of mobile technologies for educational purposes) and emotional intelligence in Internet addiction in healthcare professional students. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out on 403 healthcare professional students at Saveh University of Medical Sciences-Iran in 2021 using convenience sampling method. For data gathering, three questionnaires were used: willingness to use mobile learning, Youngs Internet Addiction Test, and the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal. Data analyses were done using Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Hierarchical Regression in SPSS 16 (Inc SPSS USA, IL, Chicago). RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 21.091.47 years; 125 subjects (31.01%) were boys and 278 (68.99%) girls. As the findings showed, 16.87% of the students had Internet addiction and 33% were on the edge of developing Internet addiction. Internet addiction was significantly negatively correlated with willingness to m-learning (r=-0.45, P=0.001) and emotional intelligence (r=-0.32, P=0.01). In addition, regression analysis results showed that the variables willingness to use learning and emotional intelligence explained 23% of the Internet addiction variance (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: In the present study, a considerable number of the healthcare professional students had excessive and unnecessary use of the Internet.

We present the results of a survey of feasibility and provider experience with the Virtual Team Rounding Program (VTRP), a quality improvement project developed and rapidly scaled at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA, in response to the surge of COVID-19 patients in the spring of 2020. METHODS: We surveyed 777 inpatient providers and 41 providers who served as \\"virtual rounders\\" regarding their experience with the program. Inpatient providers were asked about their overall satisfaction with the program, whether they the program saved them time, and if so, how much, and their interest in working with a similar program in the future. Providers who had worked as virtual rounders were asked about their overall satisfaction with the program, the overall difficulty of the work, and their interest in participating in a similar program in the future. RESULTS: We find that among both groups the program was well-received, with 72.5% of inpatient providers and 85.7% of virtual rounders reporting they were \\"satisfied\\" or \\"very satisfied\\" with their experience with the program. Among inpatient providers who worked with the program, two-thirds reported the program saved them time on a daily basis. Inpatient respondents who had worked with virtual rounders were more likely to say that they would be interested in working with the VTRP in the future compared with respondents who never worked with a virtual rounder (75.3% vs 52.5%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: As the pandemic continues, rapidly implementing and studying virtual care delivery programs is crucial for hospitals and health systems. We demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of a \\"virtual rounding\\" program assisting inpatient providers.

Anemia and blood transfusions are associated with an increased risk of delirium. The aim of this research was to assess the effectiveness and safety of using IVIS in a prehabilitation program. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients &#8805;70 y who underwent abdominal surgery between November 2015 and June 2018 were included in this single-center prospective cohort study. All patients were prehabilitated; however, only anemic patients received a single dose of 1000 mg intravenous iron (ferric carboxymaltose) to increase preoperative hemoglobin levels (IVIS group). Nonanemic patients received standard care (SC). The hemoglobin levels (primary outcome) were assessed at the outpatient clinic visit, at admission, and at discharge. Secondary outcomes were postoperative delirium, postoperative anemia, blood transfusion, complications other than delirium, and length of hospital stay. All outcomes were compared between the IVIS group and SC group. RESULTS: Of all patients (n = 248), 97 anemic patients received IVIS (39%). Of the anemic patients, 50 patients (52%) had iron deficiency. Initial differences in hemoglobin concentrations between the IVIS group and SC group at T1 and T2 (7.2 versus 8.8; P < 0.001 and 7.4 versus 8.6; P = 0.023, respectively) were no longer present at discharge (6.6 versus 7.2; P = 0.35). No statistically significant differences were observed for all secondary outcomes between the IVIS group and the SC group. No infusion-related adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Adding IVIS to prehabilitation programs is safe and diminishes differences in these concentrations between preoperatively anemic and nonanemic patients. IVIS may be worthwhile as an additional component of prehabilitation programs.

The respiratory tract is the structure most affected by COVID-19, and the serious form of the disease is characterized by severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and hypercoagulation. However, accumulating evidence shows that other organs could be reached by the virus, thus causing further comorbidities. To date, the exact route/routes of transmission of COVID-19 are still unclear. The respiratory tract is probably not the only route of transmission for this viral infection and some authors have also speculated that COVID-19 droplets, or infected hands, could contaminate the conjunctiva, which could therefore represent the initial site of an infection spread. Theoretically, the role of the ocular surface, a biological site still relatively unexplored, appears scientifically relevant in understanding the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the current literature in order to elucidate the potential role of tear and conjunctival sampling to detect SARS-CoV-2 for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to monitor patients during follow-up.","output":"There is a Role in Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Conjunctiva and Tears: a comprehensive review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Features of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) overlap with other febrile illnesses, hindering prompt and accurate diagnosis. The objectives of this study were to identify clinical and laboratory findings that distinguished MIS-C from febrile illnesses in which MIS-C was considered but ultimately excluded, and to examine the diseases that most often mimicked MIS-C in a tertiary medical centre. STUDY DESIGN: We identified all children hospitalised with fever who were evaluated for MIS-C at our centre and compared clinical signs and symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 status and laboratory studies between those with and without MIS-C. Multivariable logistic LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression was used to identify the most discriminative presenting features of MIS-C. RESULTS: We identified 50 confirmed MIS-C cases (MIS-C(+)) and 68 children evaluated for, but ultimately not diagnosed with, MIS-C (MIS-C(-)). In univariable analysis, conjunctivitis, abdominal pain, fatigue, hypoxaemia, tachypnoea and hypotension at presentation were significantly more common among MIS-C(+) patients. MIS-C(+) and MIS-C(-) patients had similar elevations in C-reactive protein (CRP), but were differentiated by thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated ferritin, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, BNP and troponin. In multivariable analysis, predictors of MIS-C included age, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, platelets, conjunctivitis, oral mucosa changes, abdominal pain and hypotension. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalised children undergoing evaluation for MIS-C, children with MIS-C were older, more likely to present with conjunctivitis, oral mucosa changes, abdominal pain and hypotension, and had higher neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios and lower platelet counts.

Objective: To examine changes in health care use during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in March and April of 2020 relative to March and April of 2019 and 2018, and to examine whether changes in use differ by patient's zip code-level race/ethnicity or income. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed health insurance claims for patients from all 50 US states who receive health insurance through their employers. Changes in use of preventive services, nonelective care, elective procedures, prescription drugs, in-person office visits, and telemedicine visits were examined during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 relative to existing trends in 2019 and 2018. Disparities in the association of the pandemic with health care use based on patient's zip code-level race and income were also examined. Results: Data from 5.6, 6.4, and 6.8 million US individuals with employer-sponsored insurance in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, were analyzed. Patient demographics were similar in all 3 years (mean [SD] age, 34.3 [18.6] years in 2018, 34.3 [18.5] years in 2019, and 34.5 [18.5] years in 2020); 50.0% women in 2018, 49.5% women in 2019, and 49.5% women in 2020). In March and April 2020, regression-adjusted use rate per 10a?000 persons changed by -28.2 (95% CI, -30.5 to -25.9) and -64.5 (95% CI, -66.8 to -62.2) for colonoscopies; -149.1 (95% CI, -162.0 to -16.2) and -342.1 (95% CI, -355.0 to -329.2) for mammograms; -60.0 (95% CI, -63.3 to -54.7) and -118.1 (95% CI, -112.4 to -113.9) for hemoglobin A1c tests; -300.5 (95% CI, -346.5 to -254.5) and -369.0 (95% CI, -414.7 to -323.4) for child vaccines; -4.6 (95% CI, -5.3 to -3.9) and -10.9 (95% CI, -11.6 to -10.2) for musculoskeletal surgery; -1.1 (95% CI, -1.4 to -0.7) and -3.4 (95% CI, -3.8 to -3.0) for cataract surgery; -13.4 (95% CI, -14.6 to -12.2) and -31.4 (95% CI, -32.6 to -30.2) for magnetic resonance imaging; and -581.1 (95% CI, -612.9 to -549.3) and -1465 (95% CI, -1496 to -1433) for in-person office visits. Use of telemedicine services increased by 227.9 (95% CI, 221.7 to 234.1) per 10a?000 persons and 641.6 (95% CI, 635.5 to 647.8) per 10a?000 persons. Patients living in zip codes with lower-income or majority racial/ethnic minority populations experienced smaller reductions in in-person visits (&#8805;80% racial/ethnic minority zip code: 200.0 per 10a?000 [95% CI, 128.9-270.1]; 79%-21% racial/ethnic minority zip code: 54.2 per 10a?000 [95% CI, 33.6-74.9]) but also had lower rates of adoption of telemedicine (&#8805;80% racial/ethnic minority zip code: -71.6 per 10a?000 [95% CI, -87.6 to -55.5]; 79%-21% racial/ethnic minority zip code: -15.1 per 10a?000 [95% CI, -19.8 to -10.4]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of a large US population with employer-sponsored insurance, the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with dramatic reductions in the use of preventive and elective care. Use of telemedicine increased rapidly but not enough to account for reductions in in-person primary care visits.

The first case of this virus was observed in China and then this virus got spread in the many countries and different strategies were made to stop the spread of this virus. Since no particular vaccine was available to cure this so different strategies were made. Due to the emergence of pandemic diseases, drug development and control strategies have been re-examined. One of the most important factors that scientists have to consider is the effectiveness of their drugs. This virus causes the respiratory tract infections which can range from mild to lethal. COVID-19 is a major cause of death in advanced countries. It is due to the absence of any particular vaccine that can effectively treat this condition. So in this review we will discuss about the therapeutic approaches followed to combat this deadly virus. Ayurveda, nitric oxide, nanoparticles and enzymes played a very important role in boosting the immunity and treatment of corona. Many herbs and some tips of using a combination of herbs proved to be very efficient while facing problems in breathing. Giving the dose of nitric oxide at some particular level and chloroquine the drug showed the antiviral activity against the virus. Developing methods to identify and contain COVID-19 is essential to successfully manage the virus. Various strains of the SARS-COV-2 were detected and were found more dangerous.

There have been different names for the greater China area, such as the Chinese circle, the Chinese community, the greater China community, China economic circle, Chinese economic area, China economic zone, and so on. Probably first used by George Cressey at least as far back as the 1930s, the term Greater China was to refer to the entire Chinese empire, as opposed to China proper (Harding, 1993, p. 660). The term Greater China is now generally used for referring to the cultural and economic ties between the relevant territories, and is not intended to imply sovereignty. Sometimes, to avoid any political connotation, the term Chinese-speaking world is often used instead of the Greater China. Despite the common historical, cultural, and linguistic homogeneity, the greater China economic area has followed different routes of economic developments. Hong Kong and Macau have been under the colonial administrations of the UK and of Portugal, respectively. Taiwan was a Japanese colony between 1895 and 1945 and, following a short period of reunification with mainland China, has been operating independently from the rest of the world. As a result, significant social and economic differences have been present in the four parts of the area, especially since 1949. The Taiwan Strait became a forbidden boundary in 1949 when the Nationalist-led government fled to Taiwan and, at the same time, the Communist-led government was founded on the mainland. Since then, Taiwan and mainland China have been two divergent regimes. Against the common cultural and linguistic homogeneity, mainland China chose essentially to pursue a socialist line, while Taiwan followed the route of market-oriented capitalism. Furthermore, the two sides have also treated each other antagonistically, particularly during the high tide of military confrontation, when the mainland claimed that it would liberate the Taiwan compatriots from the black society sooner or later, while in turn Taiwan maintained that they would use the three democratisms to reoccupy the mainland eventually. The Chinese people have a long history of migrating overseas. One of the migrations dates back to the Ming dynasty when Zheng He (1371C1435) became the envoy of the Ming emperor. He sent people C many of them Cantonese and Hokkien C to explore and trade in the South China Sea and in the Indian Ocean. Different waves of immigration led to subgroups among overseas Chinese such as the new and old immigrants in Southeast Asia, North America, Oceania, the Caribbean, Latin America, South Africa, and Russia. From the mid-nineteenth century onward, emigration has been directed primarily to Western countries (such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and Western Europe). Many of these emigrants were themselves overseas Chinese or were from Taiwan or Hong Kong, particularly from the 1950s to the 1970s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, USA, Latin America, and the other parts of the world. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 further accelerated the migration. The wave calmed after Hong Kongs transfer of sovereignty in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.

Away from the earlier free radical concept, telomere attrition, cellular senescence, proteostasis loss, mitochondrial dysfunction, stem cell exhaustion, and epigenetic and genomic alterations have emerged as biological hallmarks of aging. Moreover, nutrient-sensing metabolic pathways are critical to an organisms ability to sense and respond to nutrient levels. Pharmaceutical, genetic, and nutritional interventions reverting physiological declines by targeting nutrient-sensing metabolic pathways can promote healthy aging and increase lifespan. On this basis, biological aging hallmarks and nutrient-sensing dependent and independent pathways represent evolving drug targets for many age-linked diseases.

The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19-dependent inflammation is thought to occur via increased cytokine production and hyperactivity of RAGE in several cell types, a phenomenon observed for other disorders and diseases. Metabolic reprogramming has been shown to contribute to inflammation and is considered a hallmark of cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral infections. Malfunctioning glycolysis, which normally aims to convert glucose into pyruvate, leads to the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Being aberrantly generated, AGEs then bind to their receptor, RAGE, and activate several pro-inflammatory genes, such as IL-1b and IL-6, thus, increasing hypoxia and inducing senescence. Using the lung epithelial cell (BEAS-2B) line, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 proteins reprogram the cellular metabolism and increase pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (PKM2). This deregulation promotes the accumulation of AGEs and senescence induction. We showed the ability of the PKM2 stabilizer, Tepp-46, to reverse the observed glycolysis changes/alterations and restore this essential metabolic process.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Causes Lung Inflammation through Metabolic Reprogramming and RAGE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present paper is based on a photovoice study conducted with sixteen undergraduate social work students in their third year of study, examining their real-time lived experience of their fieldwork training in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.

In addition to providing drug-related services, community pharmacies must take measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission to customers and technicians in pharmacy. Therefore, a study was designed to assess community pharmacists performance and community pharmacies preparedness during COVID-19 outbreak. Materials & MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. A 20-item checklist consisting of nine items assessing the practice of pharmacists regarding use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and education of people about routes of transmission, prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 and eleven items evaluating the adherence of pharmacies to principles of reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission in public places was used. ResultsOf 95 enrolled pharmacists, 55 (57.9%) were female and 78.9% had work experience [] 10 years. More than 90% of pharmacists used appropriate PPE and provided information about medications for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and routs of its transmission to the pharmacy customers.

We aimed to establish whether imaging assessments of irreversibly injured ischaemic core and potentially salvageable penumbra volumes were associated with functional outcome and whether they interacted with the treatment effect of endovascular thrombectomy on functional outcome. METHODS In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the HERMES collaboration pooled patient-level data from all randomised controlled trials that compared endovascular thrombectomy (predominantly using stent retrievers) with standard medical therapy in patients with anterior circulation ischaemic stroke, published in PubMed from Jan 1, 2010, to May 31, 2017. The primary endpoint was functional outcome, assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days after stroke. Ischaemic core was estimated, before treatment with either endovascular thrombectomy or standard medical therapy, by CTP as relative cerebral blood flow less than 30% of normal brain blood flow or by MRI as an apparent diffusion coefficient less than 620 m2/s. Critically hypoperfused tissue was estimated as the volume of tissue with a CTP time to maximum longer than 6 s. Mismatch volume (ie, the estimated penumbral volume) was calculated as critically hypoperfused tissue volume minus ischaemic core volume. The association of ischaemic core and penumbral volumes with 90-day mRS score was analysed with multivariable logistic regression (functional independence, defined as mRS score 0-2) and ordinal logistic regression (functional improvement by at least one mRS category) in all patients and in a subset of those with more than 50% endovascular reperfusion, adjusted for baseline prognostic variables. The meta-analysis was prospectively designed by the HERMES executive committee, but not registered. FINDINGS We identified seven studies with 1764 patients, all of which were included in the meta-analysis. CTP was available and assessable for 591 (34%) patients and diffusion MRI for 309 (18%) patients. Functional independence was worse in patients who had CTP versus those who had diffusion MRI, after adjustment for ischaemic core volume (odds ratio [OR] 047 [95% CI 030-072], p=00007), so the imaging modalities were not pooled. Increasing ischaemic core volume was associated with reduced likelihood of functional independence (CTP OR 077 [069-086] per 10 mL, pinteraction=029; diffusion MRI OR 087 [081-094] per 10 mL, pinteraction=094). Mismatch volume, examined only in the CTP group because of the small numbers of patients who had perfusion MRI, was not associated with either functional independence or functional improvement. In patients with CTP with more than 50% endovascular reperfusion (n=186), age, ischaemic core volume, and imaging-to-reperfusion time were independently associated with functional improvement. Risk of bias between studies was generally low. INTERPRETATION Estimated ischaemic core volume was independently associated with functional independence and functional improvement but did not modify the treatment benefit of endovascular thrombectomy over standard medical therapy for improved functional outcome. Combining ischaemic core volume with age and expected imaging-to-reperfusion time will improve assessment of prognosis and might inform endovascular thrombectomy treatment decisions.

We aimed to describe the clinical course and final outcomes of adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the full spectrum of disease severity. We also aimed to identify potential predictive factors for COVID-19 pneumonia. We conducted a retrospective study among adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand, between January 8 and April 16, 2020. One-hundred-and-ninety-three patients were included. The median (IQR) age was 37.0 (29.0C53.0) years, and 58.5% were male. The median (IQR) incubation period was 5.5 (3.0C8.0) days. More than half (56%) of the patients were mild disease severity, 22% were moderate, 14% were severe, and 3% were critical. Asymptomatic infection was found in 5%. The final clinical outcomes in 189 (97.9%) were recovered and 4 (2.1%) were deceased. The incidence of pneumonia was 39%. The median (IQR) time from onset of illness to pneumonia detection was 7.0 (5.0C9.0) days. Bilateral pneumonia was more prevalent than unilateral pneumonia. In multivariable logistic regression, increasing age (OR 2.55 per 10-year increase from 30 years old; 95% CI, 1.67C3.90; p<0.001), obesity (OR 8.74; 95%CI, 2.06C37.18; p = 0.003), and higher temperature at presentation (OR 4.59 per 1C increase from 37.2C; 95% CI, 2.30C9.17; p<0.001) were potential predictive factors for COVID-19 pneumonia.

The aetiology is usually bacterial or viral, but malaria can cause a syndrome indistinguishable from clinical pneumonia. There is no method with high sensitivity to detect a bacterial infection in these patients and, as result, antibiotics are frequently overprescribed. Conversely, unrecognised concomitant bacterial infection in patients with malarial infections occur with omission of antibiotic therapy from patients with bacterial infections. Previously, we identified two combinations of blood proteins with 96% sensitivity and 86% specificity for detecting bacterial disease. The current project aimed to validate and improve these combinations by evaluating additional biomarkers in paediatric patients with clinical pneumonia. Our goal was to describe combinations of a limited number of proteins with high sensitivity and specificity for bacterial infection to be incorporated in future point-of-care tests. Furthermore, we seek to explore signatures to prognosticate clinical pneumonia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Patients (n=900) aged 2C59 months presenting with clinical pneumonia at two Gambian hospitals will be enrolled and classified according to criteria for definitive bacterial aetiology (based on microbiological tests and chest radiographs). We will measure proteins at admission using Luminex-based immunoassays in 90 children with definitive and 160 with probable bacterial aetiology, and 160 children classified according to the prognosis of their disease.

High-quality, consistent images are required for accurate telediagnoses when monitoring lesions over time. To date there are no tools to assess the quality of sequential images taken by consumers using mobile teledermoscopy. The purpose of this study was to develop a tool to assess the quality of images acquired by consumers. METHODS Participants imaged skin lesions that they felt were concerning at baseline, 1-, and 2-months. A checklist to assess the quality of consumer sequential imaging of skin lesions was developed based on the International Skin Imaging Collaboration guidelines. A scale was implemented to grade the quality of the images: 0 (low) to 18 (very high). Intra- and inter-reliability of the checklist was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. Using this checklist, the consistency with which 85 sets of images were scored by 2 evaluators were compared using Kappa statistics. Items with a low Kappa value <0.4 were removed. RESULTS After reliability testing, 5 of the items were removed due to low Kappa values (<0.4) and the final checklist included 13 items surveying: lesion selection; image orientation; lighting; field of view; focus and depth of view. Participants had a mean age of 41 years (range 19-73), and 67% were female. Most participants (84%, n = 71/85) were able to select and image the correct lesion over time for both the dermoscopic and overview images. Younger participants (<40 years old) scored significantly higher (8.1  2.1) on the imaging checklist compared to older participants (7.1  2.4; p = 0.037). Participants had most difficulty with consistent image orientation. CONCLUSIONS This checklist could be used as a triage tool to filter images acquired by consumers prior to telediagnosis evaluation, which would improve the efficiency and accuracy of teledermatology and teledermoscopy processes.

This study aimed to collect the views of OAs on social isolation; to identify the determinants of the use or not of DTs, in particular in the context of a lockdown; and the role of DTs in the strategy to reduce social isolation. This qualitative study was based on 27 semi-structured individual interviews with OAs  80 years, in C?te-dOr and Haute-Marne (French departments), from March to May 2021. A total of 96.3% of participants had already owned one or more DTs (mobile phone, tablet, or computer) for several years. The lockdown had not prompted the population to equip themselves more.

Utilising data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry on provisional cancer diagnoses between 6 January 2020 and 4 October 2020, we assessed the impact of the temporary halt of national population screening programmes on the diagnosis of breast and colorectal cancer in the Netherlands. A dynamic harmonic regression model with ARIMA error components was applied to assess the observed versus expected number of cancer diagnoses per calendar week. Fewer diagnoses of breast and colorectal cancer were objectified amid the early stages of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands. This effect was most pronounced among the age groups eligible for cancer screening programmes, especially in breast cancer (age group 50-74 years). Encouragingly enough, the observed number of diagnoses ultimately reached and virtually remained at the level of the expected values. This finding, which emerged earlier in age groups not invited for cancer screening programmes, comes on account of the decreased demand for critical COVID-19 care since early April 2020, which, in turn, paved the way forward to resume screening programmes and a broad range of non-critical health care services, albeit with limited operating and workforce capacity. Collectively, transient changes in health-seeking behaviour, referral practices, and cancer screening programmes amid the early stages of the initial COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands conjointly acted as an accelerant for fewer breast and colorectal cancer diagnoses in age groups eligible for cancer screening programmes. Forthcoming research is warranted to assess whether the decreased diagnostic scrutiny of cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in stage migration and altered clinical management, as well as poorer outcomes.","output":"The impact of the temporary suspension of national cancer screening programmes due to the COVID-19 epidemic on the diagnosis of breast and colorectal cancer in the Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the COVID shock, supervisors encouraged banks to use capital buffers to support the recovery.

In this study, we investigated the effects of tocilizumab, adalimumab, and methylprednisolone in LPS-induced acute lung injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lung injury was established by intratracheal instillation of LPS. The rats were randomly divided into six groups: LPS, control, and treatment groups (adalimumab, tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, adalimumab + tocilizumab). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissues were collected at 48 h and 96 h following LPS administration from each group. For histological analysis, hematoxylinCeosin (H&E) staining was performed. The sections were obtained for immunohistochemical analysis. IL-6 and TNF-alpha immunoreactivity were measured. RESULTS: Intratracheal LPS application resulted in inflammatory cell infiltration of interstitial and alveolar spaces and thickening of the alveolar wall. All treatment groups showed signi?cantly amelioration compared to LPS at 48 h. Interestingly, adalimumab and adalimumab + tocilizumab groups showed a significant amelioration of the lung histoarchitecture, compared to the prednisolone group at 96 h (p = 0.028, p = 0.025, respectively). Compared to the control group, LPS stimulation resulted in a significant increase in IL-6 and TNF-alpha immunoreactivity (p < 0.001). IL-6 and TNF-alpha expression were markedly reduced in all treatment groups at 48 h but the reduction was greater in the adalimumab and tocilizumab group than in the steroid. Administration with adalimumab and/or tocilizumab effectively decreased expression of TNF-alpha (p = 0.001) and IL-6 (p < 0.001) at 96 h, but prednisolone did not exert an effective decrease (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Adalimumab and/or tocilizumab significantly reduce the release of proinflammatory cytokines and improve the tissue inflammation in the experimental model of ALI. Our results suggest that adalimumab and/or tocilizumab have a more potent antiinflammatory effect on lung injury than the steroid.","output":"Antiinflammatory effects of adalimumab, tocilizumab, and steroid on lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the lung has been recognized as the key receptor of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as people may get infected","output":"More Than Pneumonia, The Potential Occurrence of Multiple Organ Failure in 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Metrics and their weaker forms are used to measure the difference between two data (or other things). There are many metrics that are available but not desired by a practitioner. This paper recommends in a plausible reasoning manner an easy-to-understand method to construct desired distance-like measures: to fuse easy-to-obtain (or easy to be coined by practitioners) pseudo-semi-metrics, pseudo-metrics, or metrics by making full use of well-known t-norms, t-conorms, aggregation operators, and similar operators (easy to be coined by practitioners). The simple reason to do this is that data for a real world problem are sometimes from multiagents. A distance-like notion, called weak interval-valued pseudo-metrics (briefly, WIVP-metrics), is defined by using known notions of pseudo-semi-metrics, pseudo-metrics, and metrics;this notion is topologically good and shows precision, flexibility, and compatibility than single pseudo-semi-metrics, pseudo-metrics, or metrics. Propositions and detailed examples are given to illustrate how to fabricate (including using what material) an expected or demanded WIVP-metric (even interval-valued metric) in practical problems, and WIVP-metric and its special cases are characterized by using axioms. Moreover, some WIVP-metrics pertinent to quantitative logic theory or interval-valued fuzzy graphs are constructed, and fixed point theorems and common fixed point theorems in weak interval-valued metric spaces are also presented.

This paper presents an immersive and interactive virtual reality simulator that can aid in the teaching of the memory management functionality of operating systems, including single, fixed and dynamic contiguous techniques, and the non-contiguous technique of paging. Learners are immersed inside a computer motherboard to learn memory management functionality of operating systems. They use a head-mounted display such as 3D virtual reality headsets and can interact with the environment using eye-gaze tracking and a joystick. We also present a case study in which 80 students were divided into two groups to evaluate the simulator.

Among selected articles,10 attributed psychosis to COVID-19 infection. In 3 articles, psychosis was diagnosed despite concurrent delirium. In 8 and 3 articles respectively, a clear temporal demarcation of psychosis and COVID-19 infection and steroid use was not described. Psychosis can occur secondary to GMC, or exposure to medication. Due process should be followed to ascertain the same. INTRODUCTION: Neurotropic coronavirus infection is associated with numerous neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Such presentations before, during and after the infection have been reported. Among these presentations, acute exacerbations of psychosis have been reportedly linked with COVID-19 infection and medications used for its treatment. METHODOLOGY: Search engines PubMed AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR were searched using specific search terms during June 2021. Out of 84 articles that came up, we selected 14 articles based on pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Selected articles were analysed and discussed in the departmental journal club. RESULTS: In 10 articles, diagnosis of psychosis was attributed to COVID-19 infection. In 3 of those articles, despite reporting concurrent delirium like presentation, diagnosis was still reported as psychosis. In 8 articles, the temporal correlation between onset of psychosis, onset of COVID-19 was not clearly demarcated. In 3 articles, clear demarcation between psychosis associated with steroid use and with a general medical condition (COVID-19) was not clearly presented. Only 2 articles did mention using a structured diagnostic system. In patients (3/17) with prior history of psychiatric illness, diagnosis was reported as relapse of psychosis (2/17), without specifying the criteria used for diagnosing a relapse. CONCLUSION: Acute exacerbation of psychosis can occur secondary to a general medical condition (GMC), or after exposure to a medication. However, due process should be followed to ascertain that the psychosis is indeed secondary to a GMC, or a medication, and not a de-novo presentation, or delirium.","output":"A qualitative analysis of literature reporting and linking psychosis to COVID-19 infection.

We present a rational and dynamic virus nomenclature that uses a phylogenetic framework to identify those lineages that contribute most to active spread. Our system is made tractable by constraining the number and depth of hierarchical lineage labels and by flagging and declassifying virus lineages that become unobserved and hence are likely inactive.

METHODS We searched PubMed database using all available keyword for COVID-19. All related studies between January 1st, 2020 to May 22nd, 2020 were reviewed. Only studies published in English language were considered. Articles were screened based on titles and abstract. All reports of confirmed COVID-19 patients who have associated clinical evidence of autoimmune disease were selected. RESULTS Among 10006 articles, searches yielded, Thirty-two relevant articles for full-text assessment. Twenty studies meet the eligibility criteria. The twenty eligible articles reported 33 cases of confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis who developed an autoimmune disease after the onset of covid-19 symptoms. Ages of patients varied from a 6 months old infant to 89 years old female (Mean=53.9 years of 28 cases); five cases had no information regarding their age. The time between symptoms of viral illness and onset of autoimmune symptoms ranged from 2 days to 33 days (Mean of the 33 cases=9.8 days). Autoimmune diseases were one case of subacute thyroiditis (3%), two cases of Kawasaki Disease (6.1%), three cases of coagulopathy and antiphospholipid syndrome (9.1%), three cases of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (9.1%), eight cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (24.2%), and sixteen cases of Guillain-Barr syndrome (48.5%).

METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Meta-analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 0.891 (95% CI: 0.818, 0.945), the incidence of cough was 0.722 (95% CI: 0.657, 0.782), and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 0.425 (95% CI: 0.213, 0.652). The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 0.148 (95% CI: 0.046, 0.296), the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 0.966 (95% CI: 0.921, 0.993), the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 0.181 (95% CI: 0.127, 0.243), and the case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.043 (95% CI: 0.027, 0.061).

METHODS: The COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) network includes 10 Italian university sites and the National Institute of Health. The whole study has three different phases. The first phase includes an online survey conducted between March and May 2020 in the Italian population. Recruitment took place through email invitation letters, social media, mailing lists of universities, national medical associations, and associations of stakeholders (e.g., associations of users/carers). In order to evaluate the impact of lockdown on depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms, multivariate linear regression models were performed, weighted for the propensity score. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 20,720 participants. Among them, 12.4% of respondents (N = 2,555) reported severe or extremely severe levels of depressive symptoms, 17.6% (N = 3,627) of anxiety symptoms and 41.6% (N = 8,619) reported to feel at least moderately stressed by the situation at the DASS-21.According to the multivariate regression models, the depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms significantly worsened from the week April 9-15 to the week April 30 to May 4 (p < 0.0001).

Because of the abrupt change, faculties did not have time to develop strategies for implementing online study, so faculty were busy finding new ways to teach their courses. As it turned out, many of them were not prepared for such a change. They lacked the technical understanding of how to use online tools and platforms, as well as the pedagogical knowledge of the dynamics of online teaching. In this paper we discuss how students from the Faculty of Arts at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, experienced the changes in the way they study. We conducted an anonymous online survey among 1,827 students from the largest faculty at the University of Ljubljana. The survey took place in February and March 2021. The results show that there were differences between students in their assessment of the appropriateness of different teaching approaches regarding various factors, which highlights the conditions students had at home to study. The conditions at home affected students' attitudes towards distance learning, their assessment of competence for distance learning, as well as their motivation to study and their sense of being overwhelmed. Thus, more study difficulties, negative attitudes and motivation problems were observed among students who were not provided with adequate study conditions. Nevertheless, the results of the study show that distance learning also has potential, but this potential can only be realised if all those involved in the process are provided with the right conditions. We conclude the study with four main recommendations, namely that the quality of distance learning requires (1) adequate conditions for students to participate in distance learning;(2) an appropriate choice of teaching methods is important;(3) teachers need to be didactically trained for distance learning;and (4) during distance learning, cooperation between the teacher and the students and between the students themselves should be encouraged. ?

We conducted a quality improvement study to improve rates of fertility preservation counseling at the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) in Baltimore, MD. Methods: We formed a multidisciplinary team as part of the ASCO Quality Training Program. We aimed to increase the rate of fertility preservation counseling for patients of reproductive age (18-40 years) with newly diagnosed cancer who were initiating systemic therapy from a baseline (June 2019-January 2020) of 36.7% (25/68) to 70.0% by February, 2021. Data sources included the electronic medical record and direct verification with patients by phone. We surveyed patients, oncologists, and experts in reproductive endocrinology and urology to identify barriers to optimal care. After considering a prioritization matrix, we implemented Plan-DoStudy-Act (PDSA) cycles. Results: We identified the following improvement opportunities: (1) oncologist under confidence about counseling, (2) oncologist lack of knowledge about local fertility preservation options/processes, and (3) lack of a standardized referral mechanism to reproductive endocrinology/urology. The first PDSA cycle was disrupted due to COVID-19;from February 2020-August 2020, we introduced the initiative at oncology disease site meetings (e.g., leukemia). In September 2020, we implemented a second PDSA cycle. Our interventions included (1) presenting the baseline data and fellow-led initiative at Oncology Grand Rounds (attended by 150 staff members), (2) creating and distributing paper and electronic informative pamphlets to oncologists and patients, and (3) implementing an electronic medical record order set. This order set included instructions for providers and patients, necessary laboratory studies, and a referral to reproductive endocrinology or orders for cryopreservation of sperm. It also added the following to a patient's after visit summary: Contact information for a dedicated fertility coordinator, estimated costs of services, and financial assistance programs.

We examined the impact of COVID-19 on concern for medical neglect in this population. METHODS: Qualitative interview study of multi-disciplinary health care providers (HCPs) from critical care, palliative care, and complex care services on the topic of medical neglect in children with LT-CCCs. We used inductive thematic analysis to generate themes. Findings presented herein are derived from a sub-analysis of the larger study that focused specifically on discussion of COVID-19 by HCPs. RESULTS: 9 of the 20 HCPs interviewed mentioned COVID-19 as influencing situations of potential medical neglect. These 9 represent all disciplines and teams. Interviewees reported COVID-19 increased burden on parents and likelihood of medical neglect due to: 1) Familial distancing from medical and social support and, 2) Changes to medical care delivery that impaired the medical communitys ability to engage and support families. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of the medical and social systems that supports families of children with LT-CCCs. These findings are consistent with previous literature that suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk for child maltreatment.

Filtration efficiency (FE) of these materials against virus is critical in the assessment of their use in disease prevention. Due to the high cost and biosafety laboratory required for conducting research using actual virus samples, surrogates for virus are commonly used in the filtration test. Here, we explore the employment of polymersomes (polymeric vesicles) as a new type of surrogate. The polymersomes are hollow shell nanoparticles with amphiphilic bilayer membranes, which can be fabricated in nanosized, and possess similar size and structural features to virus. The performance of commercial KN95 mask and surgical mask with micro-sized fibers, and electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers were chosen to be evaluated. The filtration tests against fluorescent-labeled virus-surrogate particles (VSPs), i.e. polymersomes, allowed the determination of the FE of the multilayered filter materials in a layer-specific manner. The results suggested the importance of hydrophobicity in designing the nanofibrous filter materials. The employment of VSPs in filtration performance evaluation allows a cost-effective way to estimate the FE against virus, providing guidance on future development of air filter materials.","output":"Polymersomes as virus-surrogate particles for evaluating the performance of air filter materials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current Covid-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) corresponds to a highly contagious viral zoonosis that has required to extreme measures in order to decrease the transmission of the virus in hospital settings and outside of them, requiring adoption of strict isolation methods, both contact and aerosols.

METHODS: Six national, matched, test-negative case-control studies were conducted to estimate effectiveness of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine, natural immunity due to prior infection with pre-Omicron variants, and hybrid immunity from prior infection and vaccination. RESULTS: Effectiveness of only prior infection against symptomatic BA.2 infection was 46.1% (95% CI: 39.5-51.9%). Effectiveness of only two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was negligible at -1.1% (95% CI: -7.1-4.6), but nearly all individuals had received their second dose several months earlier. Effectiveness of only three-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 52.2% (95% CI: 48.1-55.9%). Effectiveness of hybrid immunity of prior infection and two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 55.1% (95% CI: 50.9-58.9%). Effectiveness of hybrid immunity of prior infection and three-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 77.3% (95% CI: 72.4-81.4%).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a digital DSMES program on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A single-arm, nonrandomized trial was performed to evaluate a digital DSMES program that includes remote monitoring and lifestyle change, in addition to comprehensive diabetes education staffed by a diabetes specialist. A sample of 195 participants were recruited using an online research platform (Achievement Studies, Evidation Health Inc). The primary outcome was change in laboratory-tested HbA1c from baseline to 4 months, and secondary outcomes included change in lipids, diabetes distress, and medication adherence. RESULTS: At baseline, participants had a mean HbA1c of 8.9% (SD 1.9) and mean BMI of 37.5 kg/m2 (SD 8.3). The average age was 45.1 years (SD 8.9), 70% were women, and 67% were White. At 4-month follow up, the HbA1c decreased by 0.8% (P<.001, 95% CI -1.1 to -0.5) for the total population and decreased by 1.4% (P<.001, 95% CI -1.8 to -0.9) for those with an HbA1c of >9.0% at baseline.

Although the emotional maladjustment and memory impairment following interpersonal stress are well documented, the mechanisms of complex cerebral dysfunctions have neither been outlined nor studied in depth in the context of childhood bullying victimization. As a contribution to the cross-disciplinary field of developmental psychology and neuroscience, we review the neuropathophysiology of early life stress, as well as general psychological stress to synthesize the data and clarify the versatile dynamics within neuronal networks linked to bullying victimization. The stress-induced neuropsychological cascade and associated cerebral networks with a focus on cognitive and emotional convergence are described. The main findings are that stress-evoked neuroendocrine reactivity relates to neuromodulation and limbic dysregulation that hinder emotion processing and executive functioning such as semantic cognition, cognitive flexibility, and learning. Developmental aspects and interacting neural mechanisms linked to distressed cognitive and emotional processing are pinpointed and potential theory-of-mind nuances in targets of bullying are presented. The results show that childhood stress psychopathology is associated with a complex interplay where the major role belongs to, but is not limited to, the amygdala, fusiform gyrus, insula, striatum, and prefrontal cortex. This interplay contributes to the sensitivity toward facial expressions, poor cognitive reasoning, and distress that affect behavioral modulation and emotion regulation.

Interventional pain fellows must develop a minimum number of skills during their training in order to achieve the competences without neglecting radiological safety. However, medical training in fluoroscopic-guided interventions is being affected by the current COVID-19 situation. METHODS: The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of a phantom model for lumbar injection as a training strategy during COVID-19 pandemic in fellows of interventional pain. The study was divided into theoretical and practical modules. The hands-on practice was performed in a lumbar model phantom where fellows were evaluated in four fluoroscopically guided approaches: intraarticular facet block (IAFB), medial branch block (MBB), transforaminal block (TFB) and interlaminar block (ILB) divided in five sessions. The aim was to make as many punctures as possible in every session. We measured total procedural performance (TPP), total needle hand time (TNH) and total radiation dose generated by the fluoroscopic machine (TRD) during each procedure. Additionally, a survey was applied to evaluate confidence and satisfaction before and after training. RESULTS: A total of 320 lumbar punctures were completed. The results were statistically significant in all approaches attempted (p<0.01).

Mean differences (95% CI) indicated a small to moderate increase in VO2 (0.84 mL/min/kg; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.31), decrease in HR (-3.56 beats per minute; 95% CI -5.60 to -1.52) and DBP (-4.10 mm Hg; 95% CI -4.82 to -3.38) and no change in SBP (-0.36 mm Hg; 95% CI -3.88 to 3.16) and IL-6 (0.37 pg/mL; 95% CI -0.11 to 0.85). Within-group differences were also small to moderate. CONCLUSIONS In studies of aerobic exercise in patients with knee OA, very few interventions met guideline-recommended dose; there were small to moderate changes in markers of cardiovascular health and no decrease in markers of systemic inflammation. These findings question whether aerobic exercise is being used to its full potential in patients with knee OA. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER CRD42018087859.","output":"Are we missing the target?

resultados en la salud de los pacientes, aumentando el acceso a la atencin mdica y la informacin (Castillejo y Antonio 2013) La Organizacin Mundial de la Salud (OMS) define a la telemedicina, como el aporte de servicios de salud, donde la distancia es un factor crtico, por cualquier profesional de salud, usando las nuevas tecnologas de la comunicacin para el intercambio vlido de informacin en el diagnstico, tratamiento y la prevencin de enfermedades o lesiones, investigacin y evaluacin, y educacin continuada de los proveedores de salud, todo con el inters de mejorar la salud de los individuos y sus comunidades (World Health Organization 2010;WHO Group Consultation on Health Telematics (1997: Geneva 1998) En el contexto de la pandemia del COVID-19, su rpida diseminacin y la alta probabilidad de contagio dentro de las instituciones de salud, han generado que se preste atencin al uso de la telemedicina Las ventajas del uso de la telemedicina, en la pandemia del COVID-19,son: 1) puede limitar la exposicin del personal de salud a pacientes potencialmente infectados, 2) puede reducir la exposicin de pacientes con morbilidades, como asma, inmunodeficiencias, a pacientes infectados y 3) puede permitir una rpida evaluacin de infecciones potenciales de COVID-19, reduciendo de esta manera, la probabilidad que estos pacientes infectados vayan al centro de salud y expongan a ms personas al virus (Shaker et al , s f ) La telemedicina permitira una comunicacin de 24/7 entre los mdicos y los pacientes, empleando cualquier dispositivo tecnolgico disponible (Hollander y Carr 2020) Finalmente, se debe tener en claro, que esta aproximacin virtual, como la telemedicina, no debe reemplazar el manejo cnico en-persona en todos los casos METODOS: Con la finalidad de evitar el contacto persona-persona entre los mdicos y los pacientes, en un escenario como el de la pandemia de COVID-19, se ha propuesto el uso videoconsultas mdicas (Greenhalgh et al 2020) De esta manera, luego, de la confirmacin de un caso positivo, la telemedicina puede emplearse en la monitorizacin remota de estos casos, empleando video conferencias entre el mdico y el paciente, cuando este ltimo se encuentre en cuarentena domiciliaria (Zhai et al 2020) Las video consultas tambin podran emplearse para realizar un &quot;triaje hacia adelante&quot;al paciente (en ingls forward triage), es decir hacer una evaluacin anticipada antes de que el paciente llegue al servicio de emergencia A esto se le conoce como telemedicina directa al consumidor, esto permitira, en el caso del COVID-19,

Consequently, many producers were diversifying their production to meet local demand. Some farmers were also de-intensifying by reducing commercial aquafeed inputs and reverting to more traditional methods of dyke-crop culture to optimise trade-offs between input costs and labour, and manage their risk more effectively. In addition, analysis of local data showed that wholesale changes were occurring to aquaculture production as environmental protection legislation took effect which reduced the growing area for carps considerably.

However, asthma has not been suggested to be a risk factor in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, in asthmatic patients some potential protective mechanisms against SARS-COV-2 have been hypothesized, like type 2 immune response, number of eosinophils, overproduction of mucus, and asthma treatment, along with behavioral factors not strictly related to asthma, such as social distancing, hygiene measures and wearing facemasks, that contribute to reduce the individual susceptibility to SARS-COV-2 infection.

However, some individuals reportedly remain SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive by pharyngeal swabs weeks after recovery. Whether viral RNA in these persistent carriers is contagious and stimulates SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses is unknown. METHODS: This cohort study was conducted between April 3rd-July 9th 2020, recruiting COVID-19 recovered individuals that were symptom-free for at least 14 days. We collected serum for SARS-CoV-2-specific total Ig, IgA and IgM detection by ELISA, pharyngeal swabs (two time points) for ddPCR and PBMCs for anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T-cell dextramer analyses. FINDINGS: We enrolled 203 post-symptomatic participants with a previous RT-PCR-verified SARS-CoV-2 infection. At time point 1, a median of 23 days (range 15-44) after recovery, 26 individuals (12a? 8%) were PCR positive. At time point 2, 90 days (median, range 85-105) after recovery, 5 (5a? 3%) were positive. There was no difference in SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels between the PCR negative and positive group. The persistent PCR positive group however, had SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T-cell responses of significantly increased breadth and magnitude. Assisted contact tracing among persistent PCR positive individuals revealed zero new COVID-19 diagnoses among 757 close contacts. INTERPRETATION: Persistent pharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity in post-symptomatic individuals is associated with elevated cellular immune responses and thus, the viral RNA may represent replicating virus. However, transmission to close contacts was not observed indicating that persistent PCR positive individuals are not contagious at the post-symptomatic stage of the infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 persistence is associated with antigen-specific CD8 T-cell responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Mainland China has adopted the most decisive and proactive measures to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, which helps control the spread of the virus across the country. Objectives: Early epidemiological investigations found that the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was more critical in Hubei province (Hubei) than in rest parts of mainland China (Rest of China). A cross-sectional study was conducted to answer this urgent question and provide implications for the world. Methods: Infected cases from Mainland China were divided into two groups: Hubei and the Rest of China. Prevention, quarantine, and treatment were basedonThe Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards. Totalconfirmedcases, daily severe cases, total deaths, and total discharged cases were collected from January 20 to March 4 for statistical analysis. Results: Hubei accounted for 83.9% of China's total confirmed cases and 96.3% of China's total deaths. The percentage of severe cases and the rate of fatality in Hubei were higher than those in the Rest of China (P &lt; 0.01). Daily severe cases in Hubei hit the peak at 11, 246 cases on February 18, compared to 989 cases on February 10 in the Rest of China. The percentages of daily severe cases in both regions declined throughout the epidemic, from 23.3% to 8.6% in Hubei compared to 15.0% to 1.3% in the Rest of China. The latest fatality rate in Hubei was 4.30%, which was much higher than 0.85% in the Rest of China. Up to March 4, 64.7% of China's total confirmed cases were cured, 3.86% died, and 31.5% were under treatment.

METHODS: This qualitative study utilized a thematic analysis approach. During January and February 2021, we conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with 15 board-certified palliative care physicians who participated in the program. Codes and emerging themes were identified through iterative discussion and comparison. RESULTS: Five overarching themes (with sub-themes in parentheses) were identified: 1) motivations for participating in the program, 2) logistical evaluation of the program (integration, telehealth model, dyad structure and debriefing sessions), 3) barriers to delivery (language and cultural differences, culture of high-intensity care, legal and administrative differences), 4) emotional burden (moral distress, burnout), and 5) ideas for improvements. Notably, participants observed institutional and cultural differences that posed challenges to delivery of care. Many expressed feelings of distress related to the uncertainty and scarcity caused by the pandemic, although volunteering may have been protective against burnout.

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey (ECLB-COVID19) was launched on April 6, 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing. METHODS: The ECLB-COVID19 electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists, following a structured review of the literature. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online-survey-platform and was promoted by thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western-Asia and the Americas. All participants were asked for their mental wellbeing (SWEMWS) and depressive symptoms (SMFQ) with regard to during and before home confinement. RESULTS: Analysis was conducted on the first 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%). The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on both mental-wellbeing and on mood and feelings. Specifically, a significant decrease (p < .001 and % = 9.4%) in total score of the SWEMWS questionnaire was noted.

The drone immediately transfers the picture to the commercial platform that operates it, such as Amazon or Uber. The platform in turn targets you with personalized advertisements for merchandise or food, in real time, customized to your lifestyle, at the time when you are most susceptible, manipulating you to make a purchase. How should the law react to this? And what if a drone were to collect information on private individuals in public using sophisticated cameras, sensors and facial recognition software? What if the platform that operates drones were to collect and use information on consumers and third parties? Should the law limit such invasions of privacy? The use of drones is growing rapidly and their technological capabilities are growing exponentially. Drones differ from existing surveillance technology. Their low cost and their ability to fly, equipped with high-resolution cameras, recording systems and sensors, enable them to take in information over longer periods of time and much more effectively than the human eye or ear. Such capabilities are liable to give rise to pervasive surveillance of a kind never known before. Making matters worse, invasion of privacy has serious consequences. By using a network of drone fleets at the service of a single commercial platform, such surveillance could allow the platform to effectively aggregate and analyze tremendous amounts of high-quality information on the parties under surveillance, gain valuable insight on consumers and influence their decisions to order merchandise or food. While much of the scholarship on drone surveillance and invasion of privacy focuses on governmental use and the Fourth Amendment, this Article focuses on the use of drones by private entities engaged in commercial deliveries. Drone deliveries are relatively new;only a few companies have recently overcome the regulatory obstacles to receive Federal Aviation Administration approval for U.S. deliveries. COVID-19 has pushed companies to utilize drones for deliveries and has increased demand for it. Since drones are unmanned, they can deliver food and other products without close contact with the recipient. Such delivery can be safer, faster, cheaper and more efficient than traditional emissaries;yet alongside the benefits, the use of delivery drones can lead to invasion of privacy and can result in abuse of personal data for manipulation, raising significant challenges.This Article addresses the challenges drones pose to privacy and proposes solutions. It aims to contribute to the literature in several ways. First, it outlines a roadmap of the different types of invasion of privacy and harm that can be caused by drones. It demonstrates that the physical boundaries of invasion no longer matter in light of advanced technology. In identifying types of invasion and harm, this Article takes the first step towards creating a legal policy for delivery drones. Second, this Article addresses existing law, arguing that currently there is a gap between the capacity of drones to observe and aggregate personal information and privacy protections under U.S. law. Third, it proposes solutions under privacy law, and even a duty of loyalty for platforms that operate drones. Finally, this Article accounts for possible First Amendment objections to the proposed solutions.","output":"The Eye in the Sky Delivers (and Influences) What You Buy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyzes the stock market reaction towards the Covid-19 pandemic by using a sample of Indonesian listed firms.

Design, Setting, and Participants: CANCOVID-Preg is an observational surveillance program for SARS-CoV-2-affected pregnancies in Canada. This analysis presents exploratory, population-level data from 6 Canadian provinces for the period of March 1, 2020, to October 31, 2021. A total of 6012 pregnant persons with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test result at any time in pregnancy (primarily due to symptomatic presentation) were included and compared with 2 contemporaneous groups including age-matched female individuals with SARS-CoV-2 and unaffected pregnant persons from the pandemic time period. Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Incident infections in pregnancy were reported to CANCOVID-Preg by participating provinces/territories. Main Outcomes and Measures: Maternal and perinatal outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as risk factors for severe disease (ie, disease requiring hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit/critical care unit, and/or oxygen therapy). Results: Among 6012 pregnant individuals with SARS-CoV-2 in Canada (median age, 31 [IQR, 28-35] years), the greatest proportion of cases were diagnosed at 28 to 37 weeks' gestation (35.7%).

Traditional Chinese medicine has played an important role in the whole process. It is of great significance to discuss the rules and characteristics of the prescription of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, information was collected from 444 severe COVID-19 patients who were admitted to a hospital designated to treat patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan before March 20, 2020. We collected traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions for patients with severe COVID-19, referred to Chinese Pharmacopoeia to standardize the names of traditional Chinese medicine, and extract the property, flavor and channel tropism of traditional Chinese medicines to analyze the rules of the prescriptions. IBM SPSS Modeler 18.0 software was used to conduct correlation analysis of traditional Chinese medicine. Effective traditional Chinese medicines against COVID-19 was identified by the TCMATCOV platform. In the end, 1 532 effective prescriptions were included.

Previous studies suggest that the NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) has a dual role in hematologic malignancies, acting as a tumor suppressor or tumor promoter depending on the tumor type. However, little is known about the expression and functions of SIRT1 in T-ALL leukemogenesis. METHODS: Public RNA-seq data, a Notch1 driven T-ALL mouse model and ?3-secretase inhibitor were used to identify SIRT1 expression in T-ALL. We knocked down SIRT1 expression with ShRNAs and assessed the impacts of SIRT1 deficiency on cell proliferation, colony formation, the cell cycle and apoptosis. Transgenic SIRT1 knockout mice were used to determine the function of SIRT1 in vivo. RT-PCR, western blot, co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination analyses were used to detect SIRT1, p27 and CDK2 expression and their interactions. RESULTS: SIRT1 protein expression was positively correlated with the activation of Notch1. Downregulation of SIRT1 expression suppressed the proliferation and colony formation of T-ALL cell lines, which was reversed by SIRT1 overexpression. SIRT1 silencing prolonged the lifespan of T-ALL model mice. We demonstrated that p27 was involved in the downstream mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by silencing SIRT1.

Vaccination is a critical part of controlling community spread, but vaccine acceptance has varied, with some research reporting that Black individuals in the US are less willing to be vaccinated than other racial/ethnic groups. Medical mistrust informed by experiences of racism may be associated with this lower willingness. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between race/ethnicity and rejection of COVID-19 vaccine trial participation and vaccine uptake and to investigate whether racial/ethnic groupCbased medical mistrust is a potential mediator of this association. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional survey study was conducted from June to December 2020 using a convenience sample of 1835 adults aged 18 years or older residing in Michigan. Participants were recruited through community-based organizations and hospital-academic networks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Separate items assessed whether respondents, if asked, would agree to participate in a research study to test a COVID-19 vaccine or to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants also completed the suspicion subscale of the Group-Based Medical Mistrust Scale. RESULTS: Of the 1835 participants, 1455 (79%) were women, 361 (20%) men, and 19 (1%) other gender. The mean (SD) age was 49.4 (17.9) years, and 394 participants (21%) identified as Black individuals. Overall, 1376 participants (75%) reported low willingness to participate in vaccine trials, and 945 (52%) reported low willingness to be vaccinated. Black participants reported the highest medical mistrust scores (mean [SD], 2.35 [0.96]) compared with other racial/ethnic groups (mean [SD] for the total sample, 1.83 [0.91]). Analysis of path models revealed significantly greater vaccine trial and vaccine uptake rejection among Black participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], 0.51 [0.08]; vaccine uptake: B [SE], 0.51 [0.08]; both P < .001) compared with the overall mean rejection. The association was partially mediated by medical mistrust among Black participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], 0.04 [0.01]; P = .003; vaccine uptake: B [SE], 0.07 [0.02]; P < .001) and White participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], ?0.06 [0.02]; P = .001; vaccine uptake: B [SE], ?0.10 [0.02]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of US adults, racial/ethnic groupCbased medical mistrust partially mediated the association between individuals identifying as Black and low rates of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine trial participation and actual vaccination. The findings suggest that partnerships between health care and other sectors to build trust and promote vaccination may benefit from socially and culturally responsive strategies that acknowledge and address racial/ethnic health care disparities and historical and contemporary experiences of racism.","output":"Factors Associated With Racial/Ethnic GroupCBased Medical Mistrust and Perspectives on COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Participation and Vaccine Uptake in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on several lines of evidence, numerous investigators have suggested that paracetamol exposure during early development can induce neurological disorders. We had previously postulated that paracetamol exposure early in life, if combined with antioxidants that prevent accumulation of NAPQI, the toxic metabolite of paracetamol, might be innocuous. In this study, we administered paracetamol at or below the currently recommended therapeutic dose to male laboratory rat pups aged 4-10 days. The antioxidants cysteine and mannitol were included to prevent accumulation of NAPQI. In addition, animals were exposed to a cassette of common stress factors: an inflammatory diet, psychological stress, antibiotics, and mock infections using killed bacteria. At age 37-49 days, observation during introduction to a novel conspecific revealed increased rearing behavior, an asocial behavior, in animals treated with paracetamol plus antioxidants, regardless of their exposure to oxidative stress factors (2-way ANOVA; P < 0.0001). This observation would suggest that the initial hypothesis is incorrect, and that oxidative stress mediators do not entirely eliminate the effects of paracetamol on neurodevelopment. This study provides additional cause for caution when considering the use of paracetamol in the pediatric population, and provides evidence that the effects of paracetamol on neurodevelopment need to be considered both in the presence and in the absence of oxidative stress.","output":"Therapeutic doses of paracetamol with co-administration of cysteine and mannitol during early development result in long term behavioral changes in laboratory rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent events highlight how emerging and re-emerging pathogens are actually becoming global challenges for public health. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged. This has suddenly turned out into a global health concern which has led to a very high number of papers published in the scientific literature. Aim of this research is to focus on the bibliometric aspects in order to give researchers a glimpse on what is published in the first 30-days of a global epidemic outbreak. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database in order to find all relevant studies in the first 30-days from the first publication (which appeared on Pubmed at 14/01/2020), meaning the period 15/01/2020-13/02/2020. We used the following search string: coronavirus* OR Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology OR Covid-19 OR nCoV. We placed a language restriction for English, but no publication status or study design limit was put in place for our search. RESULTS: From the initial 462 identified articles, 234 articles were found as pertinent and read in extenso in order to classify them. The vast majority of papers come from China, UK and USA. 66.2% of the papers were Editorials, comments, letters or other kind of mainly reported data. 10.7% of papers were secondary literature papers (mainly narrative reviews). The remaining 23.1% were original primary studies. Only 17.5% of the sources used data which were directly collected on the field. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all of data came from China. Even if some preferential channels were guaranteed for publishing those results in the most important journals, it appears that the vast majority of publication in scientific literature in the first 30-days of an epidemic outbreak is based more on reported data and comments, and only a small fraction of the papers have primary data collected in the field. Nevertheless the whole international literature depends on that type of data sources in the early days of the epidemic. KEY MESSAGES: This is the first bibliometric research in Pubmed Database on the first 30 days of publications regarding the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak of 2019. The vast majority of publication in the first 30-days of an epidemic outbreak are reported data or comments, and only a small fraction of the papers has directly collected data.","output":"Scientific literature response in Pubmed for the novel Coronavirus outbreak: a literature analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, we study the environmental and operational factors that influence airborne transmission of nosocomial infections. We link a deterministic zonal ventilation model for the airborne distribution of infectious material in a hospital ward, with a Markovian multicompartment SIS model for the infection of individuals within this ward, in order to conduct a parametric study on ventilation rates and their effect on the epidemic dynamics. Our stochastic model includes arrival and discharge of patients, as well as the detection of the outbreak by screening events or due to symptoms being shown by infective patients. For each ventilation setting, we measure the infectious potential of a nosocomial outbreak in the hospital ward by means of a summary statistic: the number of infections occurred within the hospital ward until end or declaration of the outbreak. We analytically compute the distribution of this summary statistic, and carry out local and global sensitivity analysis in order to identify the particular characteristics of each ventilation regime with the largest impact on the epidemic spread. Our results show that ward ventilation can have a significant impact on the infection spread, especially under slow detection scenarios or in overoccupied wards, and that decreasing the infection risk for the whole hospital ward might increase the risk in specific areas of the health\\\\care facility. Moreover, the location of the initial infective individual and the protocol in place for outbreak declaration both form an interplay with ventilation of the ward.","output":"A Multicompartment SIS Stochastic Model with Zonal Ventilation for the Spread of Nosocomial Infections: Detection, Outbreak Management, and Infection Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper contributes to the emerging literature on the socioeconomic impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic by using a panel fixed effects model for estimating the impact of government policy responses to the pandemic and their spillover effects on the consumer price index for West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries over the period January 2019CJuly 2020. Across various robustness checks, the OLS and IV regressions provide three major pieces of evidence. First, the COVID\\\\19 confirmed cases positively affect the consumer price index while the overall government policy responses index has a negative impact on the consumer price index. Second, we find that government accommodative policies to COVID\\\\19 in other countries has a positive and statistically significant impact on the host country's consumer price index. Finally, the findings indicate that world food prices and oil prices positively affect the consumer price index. These results suggest that policymakers may consider intensifying the implementation of public policies in response to the pandemic for preserving the stability of prices when the sanitary situation of the COVID\\\\19 deteriorates. While confirming that international prices are among the key drivers of inflation in WAEMU countries, our findings also reiterate the importance of regional cooperation and coordination for fighting the adverse socioeconomic impacts of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.","output":"COVID\\\\19 policy responses, inflation and spillover effects in the West African Economic and Monetary Union"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Intraluminal erosion of a laparoscopic gastric band into the stomach has been reported as a complication of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. To our knowledge, however, intraluminal erosion of the band tubing into the duodenum has not been described. PATIENT AND METHODS We report a 46-year-old man in whom a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band tubing eroded into the duodenal lumen, causing recurrent port-site infections. This complication was diagnosed on upper endoscopy and also, in retrospect, on an upper gastrointestinal barium study and computed tomography. RESULTS The patient underwent surgical removal of the band and tubing, with a primary duodenal repair, and made a complete recovery without complications. CONCLUSION Erosion of laparoscopic band tubing into the duodenum should be included in the differential diagnosis for recurrent port-site infections after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Radiographic or endoscopic visualization of the intraluminal portion of the tubing may be required for confirmation.

The intervention group (n = 33) observed the hand hygiene program, whereas another group served as the waitlist control (n = 20). Creative activities were planned for the illustration of hand hygiene concepts in terms of right moments, right steps, and right duration. Hand sanitizer coverage was evaluated using a hand scanner. After the intervention, the experimental group had higher knowledge level toward hand hygiene than the control group (p < 0.001). Significant improvements in hand hygiene performance at the left palm and dorsum (p < 0.05), right palm (p < 0.05), and overall hand coverage (p < 0.05) were observed in the experimental group.

Crowd model outputs have been used for evaluating safety and comfort of pedestrians, inform crowd management and perform forensic investigations. Microscopic crowd models allow the representation of each person and the obtainment of information concerning their location over time and interactions with the physical space/other people. Pandemics such as COVID-19 have posed several questions on safe building usage, given the risk of disease transmission among building occupants. Here we show how crowd modelling can be used to assess occupant exposure in confined spaces. The policies adopted concerning building usage and social distancing during a pandemic can vary greatly, and they are mostly based on the macroscopic analysis of the spread of disease rather than a safety assessment performed at a building level. The proposed model allows the investigation of occupant exposure in buildings based on the analysis of microscopic people movement. Risk assessment is performed by retrofitting crowd models with a universal model for exposure assessment which can account for different types of disease transmissions. This work allows policy makers to perform informed decisions concerning building usage during a pandemic.","output":"EXPOSED: An occupant exposure model for confined spaces to retrofit crowd models during a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Social determinants of health have a significant impact on individual and community health outcomes.

Alongside mechanical tooth cleaning, the adjunctive use of mouthrinses has been widely advocated. Although research on the efficacy of various mouthrinse formulations is very active, there are a lack of conclusive data regarding their adverse effects. Methods We undertook a systematic review in accordance wih PRISMA guidelines of electronic databases of clinical trials of any duration with daily home use of mouthwashes, presenting clinical and subjective side effects (PROSPERO registration: CRD42016054037). Results After evaluating 614 titles and abstracts, 154 studies were selected for full-text analysis; 85 final papers were included. Based on the active ingredient in the test product, nine categories were created: cetyl pyridinium chloride, essential oils, chlorhexidine, triclosan, natural products, diclofenac, fluorides, delmopinol, and miscellaneous active substances. Most of the studies were of short duration (less than 6 months) with a defective 'methods' description; the reporting of adverse events often being overlooked. Both local morphological (oral mucosa and dental-crown staining, mucosal lesions) and functional (taste modifications, abnormal oral sensation) alterations were reported. Tooth staining was the most commonly listed adverse event, but it was quantitatively assessed only in a very small number of papers; most studies relied on patient reports. Staining was time associated; the longer the study, the higher its reported incidence and severity. Conclusions The reduced report of side effects may partly be due to a lack of an objective measure and lack of general guidelines that demand studies report their adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse effect was teeth staining. As in most studies, the effect was associated with trial duration; clinical trials should be of sufficient duration.

Those trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) face the dilemma that attempting to save a life may result in their own harm. This is most of all a problem for drowning, where hypoxia is the cause of cardiac arrest and ventilation is the essential first step in reversing the situation. Objective: To develop recommendations for water rescue organizations in providing their rescuers with safe drowning resuscitation procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence Review: Two consecutive modified Delphi procedures involving 56 participants from 17 countries with expertise in drowning prevention research, resuscitation, and programming were performed from March 28, 2020, to March 29, 2021. In parallel, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify new emerging evidence relevant to each core element, acknowledge previous studies relevant in the new context, and identify knowledge gaps. Findings: Seven core elements, each with their own specific recommendations, were identified in the initial consensus procedure and were grouped into 4 categories: (1) prevention and mitigation of the risks of becoming infected, (2) resuscitation of drowned persons during the COVID-19 pandemic, (3) organizational responsibilities, and (4) organizations unable to meet the recommended guidelines. The common measures of infection risk mitigation, personal protective equipment, and vaccination are the base of the recommendations. Measures to increase drowning prevention efforts reduce the root cause of the dilemma. Additional infection risk mitigation measures include screening all people entering aquatic facilities, defining criteria for futile resuscitation, and avoiding contact with drowned persons by rescuers with a high-risk profile. Ventilation techniques must balance required skill level, oxygen delivery, infection risk, and costs of equipment and training. Bag-mask ventilation with a high-efficiency particulate air filter by 2 trained rescuers is advised. Major implications for the methods, facilities, and environment of CPR training have been identified, including nonpractical skills to avoid being infected or to infect others. Most of all, the organization is responsible for informing their members about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and taking measures that maximize rescuer safety. Research is urgently needed to better understand, develop, and implement strategies to reduce infection transmission during drowning resuscitation. Conclusions and Relevance: This consensus document provides an overview of recommendations for water rescue organizations to improve the safety of their rescuers during the COVID-19 pandemic and balances the competing interests between a potentially lifesaving intervention and risk to the rescuer. The consensus-based recommendations can also serve as an example for other volunteer organizations and altruistic laypeople who may provide resuscitation.","output":"Resuscitation of Drowned Persons During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Consensus Statement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herein, molecular modeling techniques were used with the main goal to obtain candidates from a drug database as potential targets to be used against SARS-CoV-2. This novel coronavirus, responsible by the COVID-19 outbreak since the end of 2019, became a challenge since there is not vaccine for this disease. The first step in this investigation was to solvate the isolated S-protein in water for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, being observed a transition from up to down conformation of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein with angle of 54.3 and 43.0 degrees, respectively. The RBD region was more exposed to the solvent and to the possible drugs due to its enhanced surface area.

In other words, the Federico Mora oppresses Guatemalans receiving services through violence (action) and those requiring services and not able to access them (inaction). This pattern is consistent with that of feminicide. Feminicide implicates the state in the killing of women by men as an act of gendered violence, and as such is a political term (Sanford, 2008; Carney & Torres, 2010; Menjvar, 2011).

RECENT FINDINGS: The severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is greater in pregnant compared to nonpregnant women as measured by rates of admission to intensive care units, mechanical ventilation, mortality, and morbidities including myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolic and other thrombotic events, preeclampsia, preterm labor, and preterm birth. The risk of transmission from mother-to-infant is relatively low (1.5-5%) as quantitated by neonatal SARS-CoV-2 testing. Infants appear to be at higher risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 if the mother has tested positive within 1 week of delivery or is herself symptomatic at the time of maternity admission. The rate of positivity is not higher in infants who room in with the mother compared to infants who are initially separated and cared for in a SARS-CoV-2-free environment. Infants who test positive in the hospital have no or mild signs of disease, most of which may be attributable to prematurity, and rarely require readmission for clinical signs consistent with COVID-19. SUMMARY: Pregnant women should take precautions to avoid infection with SARS-CoV-2. Infants born to mothers who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 can receive normal neonatal care in-hospital with their mothers if mother and staff adhere to recommended infection control practices.","output":"Consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the perinatal period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Artificial intelligence (A.I) driven voice-based assistants may facilitate data capture in clinical care and trials; however, the feasibility and accuracy of using such devices in a healthcare environment are unknown. We explored the feasibility of using the Amazon Alexa (Alexa) A.I. voice-assistant to screen for risk-factors or symptoms relating to SARS-CoV-2 exposure in quaternary care cardiovascular clinics. METHODS: We enrolled participants to be screened for signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 exposure by a healthcare provider and then subsequently by the Alexa. Our primary outcome was interrater reliability of Alexa to healthcare provider screening using Cohens Kappa statistic. Participants rated the Alexa in a post-study survey (scale of 1 to 5 with 5 reflecting strongly agree). This study was approved by the McGill University Health Centre ethics board. RESULTS: We prospectively enrolled 215 participants. The mean age was 46 years (17.7 years standard deviation [SD]), 55% were female, and 31% were French speakers (others were English). In total, 645 screening questions were delivered by Alexa. The Alexa mis-identified one response. The simple and weighted Cohens kappa statistic between Alexa and healthcare provider screening was 0.989 (95% CI: 0.982, 0.997) and 0.992 (955 CI 0.985, 0.999) respectively. The participants gave an overall mean rating of 4.4 (out of 5, 0.9 SD). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of an A.I. driven multilingual voice-based assistant to collect data in the context of SARS-CoV-2 exposure screening. Future studies integrating such devices in cardiovascular healthcare delivery and clinical trials are warranted.

SARS has caused an outbreak in the world during 2003 and 2004, with 8098 individuals being infected and a death toll of 774 in 28 regions around the world. Specific humoral responses to viral infection remain unclear. OBJECTIVE To analyse the antigenicity of the SARS-CoV genome and identify potential antigenic epitopes in the structural proteins. METHODS Potential antigenic epitopes were identified in the structural proteins (nucleocapsid, membrane, spike, and small envelope proteins) and hypothetical proteins (SARS3a, 3b, 6, 7a, and 9b) that are specific for SARS-CoV. A peptide chip platform was created and the profiles of antibodies to these epitopes were investigated in 59 different SARS patients' sera obtained 6-103 days after the onset of the illness. Serial sera from five additional patients were also studied. RESULTS Epitopes at the N-terminus of the membrane protein and the C-terminus of nucleocapsid protein elicited strong antibody responses. Epitopes on the spike protein were only moderately immunogenic but the effects were persistent. Antibodies were also detected for some putative proteins, noticeably the C-termini of SARS3a and SARS6. CONCLUSIONS Important epitopes of the SARS-CoV genome that may serve as potential markers for the viral infection are identified.

The thromboembolic potential appears related to the CaW's morphology and consequent impact on local flow dynamics. We aim to evaluate the reliability of different measurement methods for the quantification of CaW and their relationship to symptomatic status, presence of large vessel occlusion stroke (LVOS), clot burden and final infarct volume. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of the local comprehensive stroke center CaW database (September 2014-July 2019). CT angiograms (CTAs) were reviewed independently by two raters, blinded to the clinical information and laterality of the stroke/transient ischemic attack. CaW were quantified with 1-D (length), 2-D (area) and 3-D (volume) measurements via Osirix software. Final infarct volume was calculated on MRI. Patients with superimposed CaW thrombus and no repeat imaging were excluded. RESULTS: Forty-eight CaW (37 symptomatic and 11 contralateral/asymptomatic) in 38 patients were included. Mean age (SD) was 48.7 (8.5) years, 78.9% were women and 77.1% were black. Inter-rater agreement was 0.921 (p<0.001) for 1-D, 0.930 (p<0.001) for 2-D, and 0.937 (p<0.001) for 3-D CaW measurements. When comparing symptomatic with asymptomatic CaW, mean web length was 3.2 mm versus 2.5 mm (p<0.02), median area was 5.8 versus 5.0 mm2 (p=0.35) and median volume was 15.0 versus 10.6 mm3 (p<0.04), respectively. CaW with a thinner profile (longer intraluminal projection compared with the base) were more likely to be symptomatic (0.670.17 vs 0.880.37; p=0.01). Average CaW 1-D and final infarct volume had a weak but positive association (=0.230, p<0.05), while no association among web measurements and the presence of LVOS or clot burden was observed.

The light illumination enables flexible switching of the quantum transition in monolayer WS2 from an insulator to a superconductor. In contrast to the prevailing picture of photoinduced carriers, we find that in the presence of a strong interfacial electric field conducting electrons could escape from the surface confinement by absorbing photons, mimicking the field emission.

Our local protocol provides thromboprophylaxis to COVID-19 patients during admission only. We report postdischarge VTE data from an ongoing quality improvement program incorporating root-cause analysis of hospital-associated VTE (HA-VTE). Following 1877 hospital discharges associated with COVID-19, 9 episodes of HA-VTE were diagnosed within 42 days, giving a postdischarge rate of 4.8 per 1000 discharges. Over 2019, following 18 159 discharges associated with a medical admission; there were 56 episodes of HA-VTE within 42 days (3.1 per 1000 discharges). The odds ratio for postdischarge HA-VTE associated with COVID-19 compared with 2019 was 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-3.1). COVID-19 hospitalization does not appear to increase the risk of postdischarge HA-VTE compared with hospitalization with other acute medical illness.

The most shared classification of droplets size distribution of sneezes was used. Droplets were modeled through additive heating/evaporation/boiling laws and their impact on the continuous phase was examined. Larger droplets move behind the droplet nuclei front and exhibit greater vertical drop due to the effect of gravity. CFD simulations provided the iso-risk curves extension (i.e., the maximum distance as well as the angle) enclosed by the incident outcome effect zone. To calculate the risk indexes, a fault tree was developed and the probability of transmission assuming as of the top event \\"COVID-19 infection\\" was calculated starting from the virus spread curve, as main base case. Four phases of virus spread evolution were identified: initiation, propagation, generalised propagation and termination. For each phase, the maximum allowable close contact was computed, being fixed the values of the acceptable risk index. In particular, it was found that during the propagation case, the maximum allowable close contacts is two, suggesting that at this point lockdown should be activated.

The distribution of the infected cabins was random, and no spatial cluster of the infected can be identified. We infer that the ship's central air-conditioning system for passenger's cabins did not play a role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, i.e. airborne transmission did not occur between cabins during the outbreak, suggesting that the sufficient ventilation was provided.

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, pathological, and laboratory findings of a series of patients who developed chilblains during the COVID-19 outbreak and to investigate the possible factors that could be involved in the pathogenesis of these lesions. METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study that included 54 patients who presented with chilblains during the highest peak in the incidence of COVID-19 in Cantabria (northern Spain). Skin biopsies were performed on 10 of these patients who presented with recent lesions. Laboratory investigations, including immunological analysis, serological studies, and the assessment of cryoproteins, were also performed. RESULTS Most patients presented erythematous plaques located on the toes and/or purpuric macules located on the feet. Histopathological findings were compatible with those of idiopathic chilblains. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed C3d and C4d deposits in the vessel walls in seven cases. The autoimmunity panel was negative in most of our series. Cryoprotein testing showed positive cryofibrinogen in two-thirds (66.7%) of the patients assessed.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease mainly confined to tropical areas. In both cases, most of those affected are asymptomatic or have only mild respiratory disease. Those who turn critical develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or multiple-organ failure occurs rapidly, with high fatality. METHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective observational study from 2020 involving COVID-19 and leptospirosis patients. The data were collected using a semi-structured proforma, and analysis was performed using Easy R (EZR) software. RESULTS: There were five patients with COVIDC-19 and four patients with leptospirosis; with pulmonary involvement. All the patients were males. There was no significant difference in age, the onset of pulmonary involvement, time of initiation of steroids, duration of steroids, and outcome between the two groups. However, in the case of COVID-19, it took a longer period for clearing of infiltrates. CONCLUSION: Though COVID-19 and leptospirosis are two different diseases, both of them show a similar life-saving response to steroids, the common factor in the pathogenesis being cytokine storm. Primary care physicians in tropical areas of the world should be aware of the similarities between these two diseases, especially the initial clinical presentation, the pathogenesis, and the response to steroids.","output":"Covid-19 and leptospirosis, pulmonary involvement and response to steroids: A comparative observational study from a rural Tertiary care center in Kerala"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic is creating collateral damage to persons with disabling conditions of different aetiology.

The disease is caused by an overreaction of the innate immune system producing a cytokine storm and inflicting multiple organ damage. Our interpretation of IvIg therapy hinges on a recent analysis of the immune dysregulation in Covid-19 infection. Previous infections with common cold coronavirus induce suppressor memory B cells that inhibit an immune response to Covid-19. The repertoire of natural antibodies (IvIg) contains suppressing antibodies in a symmetrically balanced network structure. When this repertoire interacts with the imbalanced network in the infected patient, it can neutralize the suppression of an antibody response against Covid-19. The described scenario for IvIg in Covid-19 infection may also apply in the therapy of autoimmune diseases.","output":"How IvIg Can Mitigate Covid-19 Disease: A Symmetrical Immune Network Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a multi-system disorder resulting from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected 5.0 million individuals in the United States (US) resulting in more than 160,000 deaths. There is currently no proven effective therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond supportive care. Convalescent plasma (CP), collected from individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been safely used to transfer virus-neutralizing antibodies to patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Herein we report on the clinical course and outcomes of patients who received CP for the treatment of COVID-19 across our health system. Methods: Hospitalized patients  18 years of age at 5 hospitals in the Yale-New Haven Health System with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe or life-threatening disease (Figure 1) were enrolled in the US COVID-19 Expanded Access Program (EAP) and transfused 1 unit of CP. Patient outcomes were assessed at 7, 14, and 28 days after CP transfusion. Furthermore, we sought to determine mortality predictors in this patient cohort. Results: 105 patients enrolled in the EAP were transfused CP from 4/12/2020 to 6/14/2020. Median age was 62 years (28-88 years). 62.9% of patients were male. Individuals of a non-white race comprised 56.2% of our cohort and 33.3% identified as Hispanic or Latinx. 47.6% of patients had a body mass index greater than 30, with 13.3% classified as extremely obese. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were highly prevalent in our population. Concomitant therapy for COVID-19 included hydroxychloroquine (79.0%), tocilizumab (79.0%), and remdesivir (23.8%) (Table 1). 91 patients required the intensive care unit (ICU) during their hospital course, with 87 patients in the ICU at the time of CP transfusion. 42.9% of patients had an improvement in their World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale score by day 7 post-CP transfusion (median 4 days to improvement), while 9.5% demonstrated an increase in their WHO score indicating worsening oxygenation during the 7 days following CP (Figure 2). Mortality was 10.48% at 7 days, 20.95% at 14 days, and 28.57% at 28 days post-CP transfusion (Figure 2). Of the patients in the ICU at the time of CP, 56 (64.4%) de-escalated to non-ICU care after a median of 8 days from transfusion and 55 (63.2%) were ultimately discharged from the hospital. The median time from CP transfusion to discharge in survivors was 14 days (2-103 days), while median time from CP to death in non-survivors was 10 days (1-76 days). The mean time in days both from hospital admission to CP and from positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to CP trended slightly longer in non-survivors when compared to survivors (8.6 vs 6.9 days, p=0.218 and 9.7 vs 7.3 days, p=0.85, respectively). D-dimer levels >5 milligrams per liter fibrinogen equivalent units (mg/L FEU) were associated with increased mortality at 24 (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.18-6.72), 48 (OR 3.64, 95% CI 1.44-9.70), and 72 hours (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.23-7.66) post-CP transfusion (Figure 3). Twelve patients (11.4%) on prophylactic or intermediate dose anticoagulation were subsequently escalated to therapeutic dosing during the 7 days after CP transfusion. Furthermore, a ferritin level of >3000 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) on the day of CP was associated with increased mortality (OR 5.14, 95% CI 1.34-19.68). Conclusions: CP therapy was administered through the EAP to COVID-19 patients with severe disease and with advanced age, high frequency of obesity, and extensive co-morbidity. In this COVID-19 population with high expected mortality, 42.9% of patients improved by WHO Ordinal Scale score within 7 days of CP transfusion and 52.4% were alive and discharged at 28 days. Baseline ferritin and d-dimer levels at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-CP were predictors of mortality, the latter raising the possibility that the increased thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 may be exacerbated by administration of blood products from donors potentially in a residual procoagulant state. Further studies by our group are underway to assess hemostatic balance in donor CP, to estimate associations with outcomes by comparing patients who received CP with a matched control cohort of COVID-19 patients who did not receive CP, and to evaluate efficacy of CP in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Previous guidance issued by the FDA regarding investigational use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma included recommendations for the expanded access program as a method by which to facilitate access to this blood product across the nation. Safety data reported thus far from the expanded access program has demonstrated no concerning findings, with a very low rate of serious adverse events. Therefore given the overall tolerability of convalescent plasma and the lack of other proven therapies for COVID-19, we believe it is important to report these findings even in the absence of current approval for convalescent plasma transfusion in the management of COVID-19.","output":"Use of Convalescent Plasma Therapy in Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019: The Yale-New Haven Health System Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: To compare the early impact of COVID-19 infections and mortality from February to July 2020 across the Nordic nations of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland through available public data sources and conduct a descriptive analysis of the potential factors that drove different epidemiological outcomes, with a focus on Sweden's response. Methods: COVID-19 cases, deaths, tests, case age distribution, and the difference between 2020 all-cause mortality and the average mortality of the previous 5 years were compared across nations. Patterns in cell phone mobility data, testing strategies, and seniors' care home deaths were also compared. Data for each nation were based on publicly available sources as of July 31, 2020. Results: Compared with its Nordic peers, Sweden had a higher incidence rate across all ages, a higher COVID-19-related death rate only partially explained by population demographics, a higher death rate in seniors' care, and higher all-cause mortality. Sweden had approximately half as much mobility change as its Nordic neighbours until April and followed similar rates as its neighbours from April to July. Denmark led its Nordic peers in testing rates, while Sweden had the highest cumulative test-positivity rate continuously from mid-March. Conclusions: COVID-19 pushed Sweden's health system to its capacity, exposed systemic weaknesses in the seniors' care system, and revealed challenges with implementing effective contact tracing and testing strategies while experiencing a high case burden. Looser government restrictions at the beginning of the outbreak are likely to have played a role in the impact of COVID-19 in Sweden.

In patients with severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction, even relatively avirulent pathogens, that is, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, may compromise borderline cardiac/heart function and present clinically as severe CAP. Alternately, patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae and impaired humoral immunity/splenic dysfunction may present as severe CAP. With the exception of Legionnaire's disease, influenza, and adenovirus, pathogen virulence is not a key determinant of CAP severity. METHODS: Diagnostically, patients with severe CAP may be approached based on the pattern of infiltrates on chest x-ray together with the severity of hypoxemia (ie, increased A-a gradient: >35). RESULTS: We present the case of an immunocompetent adult who presented with severe CAP during peak influenza season. Direct fluorescent antibody testing of his respiratory secretions was negative for influenza, adenovirus, and other respiratory viruses. Diagnostic bronchoscopy was negative for bacterial and fungal pathogens. The only clues to the cause of his severe CAP was the presence of relative lymphopenia, atypical lymphocytosis and elevated serum transaminases. After influenza and adenovirus were ruled out, cytomegalovirus (CMV) CAP was considered. The diagnosis of CMV CAP was made serologically by demonstrating highly elevated IgM CMV titers. Because the diagnosis was made during the patient's recovery late in hospitalization, he did not receive CMV antiviral therapy. CONCLUSION: This case should remind clinicians that influenza and adenovirus are diagnostic considerations in patients presenting with severe CAP with diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates accompanied by severe hypoxemia in normal hosts. If influenza and adenovirus are ruled out, then CMV CAP, although rare, should be considered, particularly when viral CAP is accompanied by relative lymphopenia, atypical lymphocytosis and increased serum transaminases.","output":"Severe cytomegalovirus (CMV) community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in a nonimmunocompromised host"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social-distancing directives to contain community transmission of the COVID-19 virus can be expected to affect sleep timing, duration or quality. Remote work or school may increase time available for sleep, with benefits for immune function and mental health, particularly in those individuals who obtain less sleep than age-adjusted recommendations. Young adults are thought to regularly carry significant sleep debt related in part to misalignment between endogenous circadian clock time and social time. We examined the impact of social-distancing measures on sleep in young adults by comparing sleep self-studies submitted by students enrolled in a university course during the 2020 summer session (entirely remote instruction, N = 80) with self-studies submitted by students enrolled in the same course during previous summer semesters (on-campus instruction, N = 452; cross-sectional study design). Self-studies included 2C8 week sleep diaries, two chronotype questionnaires, written reports, and sleep tracker (Fitbit) data from a subsample. Students in the 2020 remote instruction semester slept later, less efficiently, less at night and more in the day, but did not sleep more overall despite online, asynchronous classes and ~44% fewer work days compared to students in previous summers. Subjectively, the net impact on sleep was judged as positive or negative in equal numbers of students, with students identifying as evening types significantly more likely to report a positive impact, and morning types a negative impact. Several features of the data suggest that the average amount of sleep reported by students in this summer course, historically and during the 2020 remote school semester, represents a homeostatic balance, rather than a chronic deficit. Regardless of the interpretation, the results provide additional evidence that social-distancing measures affect sleep in heterogeneous ways.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 social-distancing on sleep timing and duration during a university semester"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and has spread throughout China and to 31 other countries and territories, including the United States (1).

Compared to other risks affecting public health such as flooding, EDs attract little attention in terms of risk assessment in the current literature. It does not well respond to the high practical demand for advanced techniques capable of tackling ED risks. To bridge this gap, an adapted fuzzy evidence reasoning method is proposed to realize the quantitative analysis of ED outbreak risk assessment (EDRA) with high uncertainty in risk data. The novelty of this article lies in (1) taking the lead to establish the outbreak risk evaluation system of epidemics covering the whole epidemic developing process, (2) combining quantitative and qualitative analysis in the fields of epidemic risk evaluation, (3) collecting substantial first\\\\hand data by reviewing transaction data and interviewing the frontier experts and policymakers from Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Chinese National Medical Products Administration. This work provides useful insights for the regulatory bodies to (1) understand the risk levels of different EDs in a quantitative manner and (2) the sensitivity of different EDs to the identified risk factors for their effective control. For instance, in the case study, we use real data to disclose that influenza has the highest breakout risk level in Beijing.

Whether such disparities extend to patients with ESKD, who simultaneously are at risk for complications of infection and have extensive contact with health care providers, has not been investigated. METHODS To determine whether the proportion of patients vaccinated at a dialysis facility differs according to the facility's racial and ethnic composition, we examined dialysis facility data reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The main outcome was the proportion of facility patients vaccinated for influenza among 6735 Medicare-certified facilities operating between 2014 and 2017. RESULTS Among dialysis facilities, the mean percentage of patients vaccinated during the influenza season was 72.1%. Facilities with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic patients had significantly lower vaccination percentages than less diverse facilities. The average proportion of patients vaccinated at each facility decreased significantly from 2014 to 2017 (a decrease of 1.05% vaccinated per year) and decreased significantly more so among facilities with higher minority proportions. The share of vaccinated patients in facilities in the quartile with the highest proportion of Black patients decreased 1.21% per year compared with a decrease of 0.88% per year in facilities in the quartile with the lowest proportion of Black patients. We found similar trends for Hispanic patients. CONCLUSIONS Rates of seasonal influenza vaccination are modestly but significantly lower among dialysis facilities with larger proportions of minority patients, and the gap seems to be widening over time. As wide-scale vaccination efforts grow more urgent amid the current COVID-19 pandemic, these disparities must be addressed to protect patients and communities equitably.","output":"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Seasonal Influenza Vaccination among Dialysis Facilities in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the usefulness of the clinical characteristics of cough in the diagnosis of chronic cough. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of clinical characteristics and concomitant symptoms of chronic cough in predicting its cause. METHODS: We recruited adult patients with chronic cough as a primary presenting symptom and identified those with a single underlying cause. Clinical features of cough were recorded with a custom-designed questionnaire and the relationships between clinical features and cause of cough were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1162 patients with a single underlying cause were enrolled. Nocturnal cough alone was a predictor of cough variant asthma (odds ratio [OR], 2.037; 95% CI, 1.003-4.139) with high specificity (97.6%) and low sensitivity (8.1%). Heartburn (OR, 2.671; 95% CI, 1.544-4.620), belching (OR, 2.536; 95% CI, 1.620-3.971), and acid regurgitation (OR, 2.043; 95% CI, 1.299-3.212) indicated gastroesophageal reflux-related cough with high specificity (85.5%-94.9%) and low sensitivity (22.8%-40.7%). Cough after meals had a high specificity (91.2%) and a low sensitivity (24.8%) for gastroesophageal reflux-related cough. Postnasal dripping (OR, 2.317; 95% CI, 1.425-3.767) and history of sinusitis (OR, 4.137; 95% CI, 2.483-6.892) were indicators for upper airway cough syndrome with high specificity (80.8% and 90.2%, respectively). Rhinitis/sinusitis-related symptoms showed moderate sensitivity (72.9%); however, they showed mild specificity (46.1%) for upper airway cough syndrome.

In addition to predisposing to CVD complications, the ongoing pandemic has severely affected the delivery of timely and appropriate care for cardiovascular conditions resulting in increased mortality. The etiology behind the cardiac injury associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is likely varied, including coronary artery disease, microvascular thrombosis, myocarditis, and stress cardiomyopathy. Further large-scale investigations are needed to better determine the underlying mechanism of myocardial infarction and other cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients and to determine the incidence of each type of cardiac injury in this patient population.

The ability to efficiently and accurately classify physiological states based on wearable devices is improving. However, the inherent variability of human behavior within and across individuals makes it challenging to predict how identified states influence human performance outcomes of relevance to military operations and other high-stakes domains. We describe a computational modeling approach to address this challenge, seeking to translate user states obtained from a variety of sources including wearable devices into relevant and actionable insights across the cognitive and physical domains. Three status predictors were considered: stress level, sleep status, and extent of physical exertion; these independent variables were used to predict three human performance outcomes: reaction time, executive function, and perceptuo-motor control. The approach provides a complete, conditional probabilistic model of the performance variables given the status predictors. Construction of the model leverages diverse raw data sources to estimate marginal probability density functions for each of six independent and dependent variables of interest using parametric modeling and maximum likelihood estimation. The joint distributions among variables were optimized using an adaptive LASSO approach based on the strength and directionality of conditional relationships (effect sizes) derived from meta-analyses of extant research. The model optimization process converged on solutions that maintain the integrity of the original marginal distributions and the directionality and robustness of conditional relationships. The modeling framework described provides a flexible and extensible solution for human performance prediction, affording efficient expansion with additional independent and dependent variables of interest, ingestion of new raw data, and extension to two- and three-way interactions among independent variables. Continuing work includes model expansion to multiple independent and dependent variables, real-time model stimulation by wearable devices, individualized and small-group prediction, and laboratory and field validation.","output":"Toward Predicting Human Performance Outcomes From Wearable Technologies: A Computational Modeling Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although research in this area is still in a stage of infancy, it seems likely that the lysosomal degradation pathway of autophagy plays an evolutionarily conserved role in antiviral immunity. The interferon-inducible, antiviral PKR signaling pathway positively regulates autophagy, and both mammalian and plant autophagy genes restrict viral replication and protect against virus-induced cell death. Given this role of autophagy in innate immunity, it is not surprising that viruses have evolved numerous strategies to inhibit host autophagy. Different viral gene products can either modulate autophagy regulatory signals or directly interact with components of the autophagy execution machinery. Moreover, certain RNA viruses have managed to co-apt the autophagy pathway, selectively utilizing certain components of the dynamic membrane rearrangement system to promote their own replication inside the host cytoplasm. In addition to this newly emerging role of autophagy in innate immunity, autophagy plays an important role in many other fundamental biological processes, including tissue homeostasis, differentiation and development, cell growth control, and the prevention of aging. Accordingly, the inhibition of host autophagy by viral gene products has important implications not only for understanding mechanisms of immune evasion, but also for understanding novel mechanisms of viral pathogenesis. It will be interesting to dissect the role of viral inhibition of autophagy in acute, persistent, and latent viral replication, as well as in the pathogenesis of cancer and other medical diseases.","output":"Digesting Oneself and Digesting Microbes: Autophagy as a Host Response to Viral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Syria has suffered for nine years from a conflict that left over 11 1 million inhabitants in need of humanitarian assistance and over 80% in poverty A ten-week-long full lockdown was enforced in Syria and successfully minimized the spread of COVID-19 This study aims to estimate the occurrence of mental health disorders after lockdown termination among the citizens of war-torn Syria METHODS: Online questionnaires, which included demographic and war-related questions, Dimensions of Anger Reactions 5 (DAR-5) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were distributed to different social media groups RESULTS: This study recruited 1445 participants, of which 515 (35 6%) were males, the mean age was 24 8 +/- 6 3 years, 38% had problematic anger, 64% had moderate to very severe depression, 42 9% had moderate to severe anxiety and 39 7% had moderate to severe stress Increased living expenses, not being able to go out and a reduced ability to earn income and provide food were significantly associated with the psychological burden after the lockdown (p &lt; 0 05) The association of war variables with mental disorders was weaker than the effect of the deteriorating economy Other healthcare workers had more severe distress than doctors, who themselves were found to have less distress than the general population (p &lt; 0 05) Anger scores were approximately equal, regardless of the type of work Finally, shisha smoking was associated with worse mental health (p &lt; 0 05) CONCLUSION: The psychological burden of the damaged economy surpassed the direct damage due to COVID-19 and the effect of years of conflict Urgent interventions are required, as this burden may continue for years, if not for decades A full lockdown in countries with fragile economies may delay the spread of the virus, but it will severely damage the economy, which will lead to a deterioration of the mental health of their citizens","output":"Was a forced lockdown adequate for a country in conflict?

Early implementation of prone positioning ventilation improves survival in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, but studies examining the effect of proning on survival in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 are lacking. Our objective was to estimate the effect of early proning initiation on survival in patients with coronavirus disease 2019-associated respiratory failure. DESIGN: Data were derived from the Study of the Treatment and Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients with coronavirus disease 2019, a multicenter cohort study of critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to 68 U.S. hospitals. Using these data, we emulated a target trial of prone positioning ventilation by categorizing mechanically ventilated hypoxemic (ratio of PaO2 over the corresponding FIO2 &#8804; 200 mm Hg) patients as having been initiated on proning or not within 2 days of ICU admission. We fit an inverse probability-weighted Cox model to estimate the mortality hazard ratio for early proning versus no early proning. Patients were followed until death, hospital discharge, or end of follow-up. SETTING: ICUs at 68 U.S. sites. PATIENTS: Critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 receiving invasive mechanical ventilation with ratio of PaO2 over the corresponding FIO2 less than or equal to 200 mm Hg. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 2,338 eligible patients, 702 (30.0%) were proned within the first 2 days of ICU admission. After inverse probability weighting, baseline and severity of illness characteristics were well-balanced between groups. A total of 1,017 (43.5%) of the 2,338 patients were discharged alive, 1,101 (47.1%) died, and 220 (9.4%) were still hospitalized at last follow-up. Patients proned within the first 2 days of ICU admission had a lower adjusted risk of death compared with nonproned patients (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.97).

It was considered that neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) although conventionally given to locally advanced breast cancer may need to also be provided to earlier-stage disease. In addition, due to the temporary closure of breast cancer screening programs during the pandemic, concerns were raised about patients presenting with later-stage disease at initial diagnosis. This project aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the volume of neoadjuvant referrals at a large cancer centre, as well as any stage migration, impact on treatment timelines and impact on outcomes for breast cancer patients compared to the pre-pandemic population. Methods: The BC Cancer Vancouver centre has a neoadjuvant breast cancer program to ensure high quality of care is maintained. This program's prospective database of breast cancer patients referred for and treated with NAT between the years 2012-2021 was queried to assess data on neoadjuvant referrals, clinical stage, receptor status, treatment timelines, and outcomes between January 1, 2019-December 31, 2020. Data from the years 2019 and 2020 were compared to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on NAT. Summary data available from earlier years were also utilized as reference. Results: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 51% increase in Sthe number of patients referred to the neoadjuvant program, with 102 patients referred for NAT in 2019, whereas 154 patients were referred in 2020. This proportional increase in referrals is higher than any other year since the database inception. Of note, during 2020 there were no COVID related closures for cancer surgeries in the province. The proportion of patients referred who received NAT remained similar between 2019 and 2020 (69.1% vs 70.8% in 2020). The trend in referrals by month varied between the two years. In 2019, the majority of patients were referred between April to July with the lowest proportion of referrals in October to December. In 2020, the opposite occurred with the lowest proportion of referrals transpiring between January-June, and the greatest proportion in October to December. The proportion of patients who presented with de-novo metastatic disease was consistent between the two years (7.8% in 2019 vs 9.7% in 2020). Despite the closure of all screening mammography programs between March-June of 2020, the clinical stage and receptor status are equivalent between 2019 and 2020. With regards to treatment timelines, there was a 3 day increase in the median time between referral date and medical oncology consultation in 2020 compared to 2019. No other treatment timeline delays were found between 2019 and 2020. With regards to outcomes, 34.9% of patients achieved pCR in 2019, but only 24.1% achieved pCR in 2020, despite similar stage and receptor subtypes. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a higher volume of patients were referred for NAT than had ever before been referred, despite the fact that there were no closures of operating rooms in our province for COVID-19. From a quality of care perspective there was a delay in referral to consultation for medical oncology, but no delay on referral to treatment, treatment to surgery, or surgery to radiation. However, and a significantly lower pCR rates was seen in 2020 compared to 2019. The 10% decrease in pCR rates may have resulted from increased complexity in breast cancer cases. This trend may continue, as the impact of COVID-19 on breast cancer outcomes will likely take many years to fully appreciate. Attention should be paid to encouraging women to return to regular breast screening programs to decrease the number of patients needing neoadjuvant therapy.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy: A pre/post pandemic analysis and assessment of quality of care delivered"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been widely used for spontaneous pneumothorax (SP).

Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March and May 2020 who presented with neuropathological features with or without respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 were enrolled. Electronic records were studied for age, sex, duration of hospitalization, detailed neurological presentation, history or documented concomitant fever and respiratory features of COVID-19, inflammatory markers, neuroimaging, progress, and disease outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients of 10 nationalities presented with neurological manifestations. Mean (range) age was 51.4 (21C86) years. Twenty-four had comorbidities, and 18 had no prior or concomitant respiratory symptoms. Ten patients presented with encephalopathy and exhibited altered behavior/sensorium: 7 presented with myositis, 8 with stroke, and 4 with seizures, and 4 had peripheral and cranial nerve involvement. The mean (average) duration of hospital stay was 11.4 days (1-38) with the longest observed in stroke patients. Fifteen patients (45%) died and 3 (9%) had residual weakness. Serum ferritin, CRP, and procalcitonin were higher in the severe disease group and correlated with risk of death. Twelve of 22 brain images showed abnormalities including haemorrhage, infarcts, small vessel ischemia, and oedema. Risk of death was higher in older age but did not differ based on the underlying neuropathology.

The aim of this study was to analyze risk factors for COVID-19 prevalence and deaths in all 6 geopolitical regions and 37 States in Nigeria. Methods: we analyzed the data retrieved from various sources, including Nigeria CDC, Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics, Unicef-Nigeria multiple indicator cluster survey and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington. We examined 4 clinical risk factors (prevalence of TB, HIV, smoking and BCG vaccination coverage) and 5 sociodemographic factors (age &#8805;65, population density, literacy rate, unemployment and GDP per capita). Multivariate modeling was conducted using generalized linear model. Results: our analysis showed that the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases differed widely across the 37 States, from 0.09 per 100,000 in Kogi to 83.7 in Lagos. However, more than 70% of confirmed cases were concentrated in just 7 States: Lagos, Abuja, Oyo, Kano, Edo, Rivers and Delta. Case mortality rate (CMR) also varied considerably, with Lagos, Abuja and Edo having CMR above 9 per million population. On bivariate analysis, higher CMR correlated positively with GDP (r=0.53) and to a lesser extent with TB (r=0.36) and population density (r=0.38). On multivariate analysis, which is more definitive, States with higher HIV prevalence and BCG coverage had lower CMR, while high GDP States had a greater CMR. Conclusion: this study indicates that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected certain States in Nigeria.

The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of the bias assessment tool. Articles were further analyzed using Revman5.3 software. Results: A total of 14 articles were considered for systematic review and 9 articles were considered for meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed a significant difference between the laser group and conventional orthodontic treatment with Forest plots showing more tooth movement in the laser group compared to the control group in 2-3 months (mean difference = 1.73; CI: 0.9-2.57; p = 0.00001; I 2 = 89 %). Conclusion: Although the analysis of the results shows that laser PBM favors OTM, the results are inconclusive as the heterogeneity across studies was high. Clinical significance: Laser PBM may be considered as novel, safe, and noninvasive adjuvant therapy for the acceleration of OTM in children.

Recent studies report no effect of (H)CQ on 28-day mortality. We investigated the effect of HCQ and CQ in hospitalized patients on the non-ICU COVID-ward. METHODS: A nationwide, observational cohort study was performed in The Netherlands. Hospitals were given the opportunity to decide independently on the use of three different COVID-19 treatment strategies: HCQ, CQ, or no treatment. We compared the outcomes between these groups. The primary outcomes were 1) death on the COVID-19 ward, and 2) transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The analysis included 1064 patients from 14 hospitals: 566 patients received treatment with either HCQ (n = 189) or CQ (n = 377), and 498 patients received no treatment. In a multivariate propensity-matched weighted competing regression analysis, there was no significant effect of (H)CQ on mortality on the COVID ward. However, HCQ was associated with a significantly decreased risk of transfer to the ICU (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.27-0.82, p = 0.008) when compared with controls. This effect was not found in the CQ group (HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.55-1.15, p = 0.207). CONCLUSION: The results of this observational study demonstrate a lack of effect of (H)CQ on non-ICU mortality. However, we show that the use of HCQ - but not CQ - is associated with a 53% reduction in risk of transfer of COVID-19 patients from the regular ward to the ICU. Recent prospective studies have reported on 28-day, all-cause mortality only; therefore, additional prospective data on the early effects of HCQ in preventing transfer to the ICU are still needed.","output":"Early hydroxychloroquine but not chloroquine use reduces ICU admission in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first reported U.S. case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was detected in January 2020 (1).

The primary outcomes were 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality, and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS). We calculated risk ratios (RRs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data, and weighted mean differences (WMDs) for continuous data using a random-effects model. Seven randomized clinical trials were included, with a total of 529 patients in the DEX group and 520 patients in the SOC group.

These disparate outcomes compound existing health disparities which result in BIPOC patients experiencing larger burdens of disease and decreased life expectancy. The objective of our study was to examine racial and ethnic disparities in hospitalization, medication usage, ICU admission and in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients within an integrated health care system in New York City (NYC). Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed adult patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis within a large urban health system in NYC between February 28, 2020 and August 28, 2020. Primary outcome was the rate of admission from the ED. Secondary outcomes were differences in medication administration, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and in-hospital mortality. We utilized multivariable logistic regression to test for differences by race/ethnicity in the odds of our primary and secondary outcomes accounting for hospital-level clustering. Results: A total of 4,717 adult patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in the ED or inpatient setting were included in the primary analysis;3,219 (68.2%) were admitted to an inpatient setting. Black patients were the largest group (29.1%), followed by Hispanic (29.0%), White (22.9%), Asian (3.86%) and patients of other race-ethnicity (19.0%). Black patients were overrepresented at the community site in Brooklyn, while Asian and Hispanic patients were overrepresented at the community site in Queens. Overall, White patients (24.3%) were disproportionately overrepresented among admitted patients. Hispanic patients had an overall significantly lower adjusted rate of inpatient admission compared to White patients (OR= 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 - 0.76). Black (OR= 0.60, 95% CI, 0.43 - 0.84) and Asian patients (OR= 0.47;95% CI 0.25 - 0.89) were overall less likely to be admitted to an ICU setting. There were lower odds of inpatient admission (OR=0.68, 95% CI 0.46-0.99) at the community site located in Queens, where Asian and Hispanic patients were over-represented. There was significantly higher mortality at the community-based sites in Brooklyn (OR=4.38, 95% CI 2.66 - 7.24) and Queens (OR= 2.96, 95% CI 2.12 - 4.14), where Black, Asian, and Hispanic patients were over represented. Conclusion: BIPOC patients accounted for a larger proportion of COVID patients seeking care in the ED compared to the demographic composition of NYC, but were less likely to be admitted to the ICU or hospitalized. Hospitals serving a high proportion of BIPOC patients had significantly higher mortality even within an integrated health system with shared resources.

Herein, we assess the quality of the water supply (desalinated 95% and groundwater 5%) in Makkah city, Saudi Arabia during a mass gathering event in 2019 (9.6 million people) for religious purposes. Fifty five samples were randomly collected from nine different districts of Makkah city, analyzed for TDS, turbidity, pH, EC, free Cl2, Al, Cd, Pb, Cr, F, major ions, coliform and E.coli bacteria and were finally used to estimate the water quality index (WQI). Major ions, trace elements and heavy metals analyses show values below permissible limits in most of the samples, while a few samples show slightly higher values. No bacterial count found in any sample. WQI values of all fifty-five samples were below 50 and were identified as excellent water.

The results are presented as a percentage of those respondents who are engaged in the relevant activity. Results. The survey involved 582 ophthalmologists from various regions of Russia. In April 2020 (in the first month of non-working days throughout the Russian Federation), the work load as a whole became less than usual for 54.8% of respondents. In addition, 18.4% of respondents stated that they did not work during the entire April 2020. The number of face-to-face consultations decreased in 74.3% of the surveyed ophthalmologists. The number of telemedicine consultations decreased in 27.0% of respondents, and increased in 34.1%. The number of emergency and urgent surgery decreased in 25.0% of respondents, and increased in 23.2%. The number of planned surgery decreased in 80.4% of respondents. 23.9% of respondents began to provide medical care in an additional and new profile of ophthalmological care (which they do not usually do). Salaries in April 2020 decreased for 66.7% of respondents, in August 2020 - in 41.4% of respondents.

For decades, suture-based thoracic aortic constriction has been the preferred method for increasing left ventricular (LV) afterload in rodents, but the degree of stenosis resulting from this method is variable. In an effort to improve this methodology, we subjected mice to constriction of the ascending aorta using o-rings with fixed inner diameters (IDs). Methods and results Mice of C57BL/6J and FVB/N background were subjected to constriction of the ascending aorta using o-rings with fixed IDs of 0.71, 0.66, and 0.61 mm. O-ring aortic banding resulted in 98.7% survival 2 weeks post-surgery, with very low intra- and inter-surgeon variation. When using the narrowest o-ring (0.61 mm), mice developed hypertrophy within 1 week. Over 20 weeks, the mice gradually developed reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and dilatation with increased left atrial dimensions and lung weight, indicating congestion. When using o-rings with IDs of 0.66 mm and 0.71 mm, the mice developed hypertrophy, but maintained a compensated state with stabilized LVEF 8-20 weeks post-surgery. The up-regulation of signature genes associated with HF, hypertrophy, fibrosis, and the level of activation of MAPK and NFAT signalling pathways corresponded to the degree of stenosis.

However, there is limited evidence of the impact of COVID-19 and its related restrictions on people with pre-existent mental health conditions. OBJECTIVES To identify the impact of COVID-19 and its related restrictions on people with pre-existent mental health conditions. METHODS A scoping review of the literature was employed. Eight electronic databases (PsycINFO, Cochrane, Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Academic Search Complete) were searched and 2566 papers identified. 30 papers met the criteria for this review and findings were summarised under three key review questions. RESULTS COVID-19 and its related restrictions have had a notable effect on people with pre-existent mental health conditions. Public health restrictions have contributed to increased levels of social isolation, loneliness, and reduced opportunities for people to connect with others. Reduced access to health services and treatments has compounded matters for those seeking support. Exacerbation and deterioration of symptoms are commonly reported and can lead to greater susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. IMPLICATIONS The importance of proactive planning, alternative accessible healthcare services and supports for vulnerable and at-risk groups is illuminated. Increased monitoring, early intervention and individually tailored care strategies are advocated.

The mixture of these extracts could be incorporated into a polymer matrix to obtain a foil with antibacterial and antiviral properties. The initial goal of this work was to obtain active LDPE films containing a mixture of CO(2) extracts of the aforementioned plants, incorporated into an LDPE matrix via an extrusion process. The second aim of this study was to demonstrate the antibacterial properties of the active films against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and to determine the antiviral effect of the modified material on 6 bacteriophage. In addition, an analysis was made on the influence of the active mixture on the polymer physicochemical features, e.g., mechanical and thermal properties, as well as its color and transparency.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: NHS hospitals in England. PARTICIPANTS: 47 780 individuals (mean age 65, 55% men) in hospital with covid-19 and discharged alive by 31 August 2020, exactly matched to controls from a pool of about 50 million people in England for personal and clinical characteristics from 10 years of electronic health records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of hospital readmission (or any admission for controls), all cause mortality, and diagnoses of respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, kidney, and liver diseases until 30 September 2020. Variations in rate ratios by age, sex, and ethnicity. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 140 days, nearly a third of individuals who were discharged from hospital after acute covid-19 were readmitted (14 060 of 47 780) and more than 1 in 10 (5875) died after discharge, with these events occurring at rates four and eight times greater, respectively, than in the matched control group. Rates of respiratory disease (P<0.001), diabetes (P<0.001), and cardiovascular disease (P<0.001) were also significantly raised in patients with covid-19, with 770 (95% confidence interval 758 to 783), 127 (122 to 132), and 126 (121 to 131) diagnoses per 1000 person years, respectively. Rate ratios were greater for individuals aged less than 70 than for those aged 70 or older, and in ethnic minority groups compared with the white population, with the largest differences seen for respiratory disease (10.5 (95% confidence interval 9.7 to 11.4) for age less than 70 years v 4.6 (4.3 to 4.8) for age &#8805;70, and 11.4 (9.8 to 13.3) for non-white v 5.2 (5.0 to 5.5) for white individuals).

Some will arise from existing ones by either predictable evolutionary and adaptation changes or by unpredictable changes involving a variety of biotic and abiotic mechanisms. Many, and perhaps most, emerging waterborne human pathogens will be zoonotic agents or come from other non-human reservoirs. The emergence of some waterborne pathogens will be related to antibiotic use, resulting in emerging antibiotic-resistant waterborne pathogens. Reliably predicting pathogen emergence and human health effects based on VFARs or other properties of microbes and their hosts is not possible at this time. This is because of (1) the diversity of microbes and their virulence and pathogenicity properties, (2) their ability to change unpredictably, (3) their intimate and diverse interrelationships with a myriad of hosts and dynamic natural and anthropogenic environments and (4) the subtle variations in the immune status of individuals.

ACE2 protein can play a pivotal role to regulate the pathological changes of several diseases including COVID-19. TMPRSS2 gene is expressed in many human tissues and plays a critical role in spreading the infection of the viruses including coronavirus and progression of prostate cancer, and hence could be used as a potential drug target. There are limited reports on occurrence of genetic polymorphism of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in general population, expressions in pathological conditions, and its impact on COVID-19 disease. Hence we comprehended the occurrence of ACE2, TMPRSS2 polymorphism in general population, expression in various diseases and its impact on COVID-19 disease. METHOD: We utilized multiple databases, PubMed (Medline), EMBASE and Google Scholar for literature search. DESCRIPTION: ACE2 polymorphisms have significant linkages with various diseases, including severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Genetic variations of these genes contribute to individual's genetic susceptibility to viral infection and its subsequent clearance. The diversity and variations in the population distribution of these genes, might greatly influence and in turn reflect into the observed population and gender differences of the severity and clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: There are diversities in distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 polymorphisms among different populations. Analyzing the genetic variants and expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, in a population may provide the genetic marker for susceptibility or resistance against the coronavirus infection, which might be useful for identifying the susceptible population groups for targeted interventions and for making relevant public health policy decisions.","output":"ACE2 and TMPRSS2 polymorphisms in various diseases with special reference to its impact on COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the paper, by virtue of the binomial inversion formula, a general formula of higher order derivatives for a ratio of two differentiable function, and other techniques, the authors compute several sums in terms of the beta function and its partial derivatives, polygamma functions, the Gauss hypergeometric function, and a determinant.

Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) represents more than 70% of all diagnosed bladder malignancies; therefore, we aimed to evaluate the relationship of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), and risk of thrombosis by using the International Medical Prevention Registry on Venous Thromboembolism (IMPROVE) score as well as the risk of bleeding by using the IMPROVE Bleeding Risk Assessment Score in a study cohort. Material and Methods: This was a retrospective observational study involving 130 patients who met the inclusion criteria: age > 18 years, stage pTa-pT1 NMIBC. The exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; stage pT2 or higher; or a presentation of metastasis, inflammatory, liver or autoimmune diseases, or other systemic neoplasms. In order to evaluate the risk of thromboembolic events as well as those of bleeding, the IMPROVE scores were calculated for each patient. Subjects were categorized in a Low IMPROVE group (< 4 points) or a High IMPROVE group. By using uni- and multivariate regression models, we analyzed CBC-derived parameters which could be associated with a higher risk of venous thrombosis in subjects with low or high IMPROVE scores. Results: Patients with IMPROVE score greater than 4 were associated with higher NLR, LMR and lymphocyte values (p < 0.05). In a multivariate regression model, the IMPROVE score was significantly influenced by lymphocyte count (p = 0.007) as well as the NLR value (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: In our study population, subjects with NMIBC with low lymphocytes and NLR > 3 were at a higher risk of developing venous thromboembolic events, reflected by an IMPROVE score of greater than 4. The IMPROVE and IMPROVE Bleeding Risk Assessment Scores are easy to use, and, complemented with the CBC-derived lymphocyte to monocyte ratio as a prothrombotic marker, could aid in the decision of prophylactic anticoagulation therapy during admission.","output":"Inflammatory Markers and Thromboembolic Risk in Patients with Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the portable Ceribell(?) electroencephalograph (EEG) (Mountain View, CA) used for suspected status epilepticus (SE) can reduce time to diagnosis and on\\\\call workforce demands and whether it can be applied to patients in respiratory isolation.

Limited information exists on ROX index in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure. One study in such patients reported ROX-Index of  5.37 at four hours after admission was significantly associated with a lower risk for intubation after hour four. AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: 1. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ROX index at admission as an early marker of outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with acute respiratory failure. 2. To study if this index can be effectively used as an rescue alarm system so as to effectively triage patients requiring immediate attention. METHODS: 100 patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 and ARDS were retrospectively studied. Age, gender, admission ROX index, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), hospital length of stay (LOS), and mortality were studied. Pearsons Correlation analysis was performed to determine the impact of ROX Index on need for MV, hospital LOS and mortality. RESULTS: 1. Of the hundred (100) patients, fifty-two patients were male (52%) 2. Mean age was 47.7 + 16.7 years. 3. Twenty-three percent (23%) of patients required MV;4. The mean LOS was 8.6 + 6 days, twenty-two (22%) patients expired. 5. Mean Admission ROX index in subjects was 15 + 6.5 with ROX index 11.7 + 6 in non-survivors compared to 16 + 6 in survivors (p =0.018, independent t-test) [Figure 1]. 6. Pearsons correlation analysis indicated a significant correlation between admission ROX index and survival (r = 0.28;p= 0.01), but not with hospital LOS (r=-0.02, p=0.8). 7.A dmission ROX index in patients requiring MV was 11 + 7 and 15 + 6 in those not requiring MV (p =0.06, independent t-test). CONCLUSIONS: Higher ROX index at admission is associated with higher mortality and need for MV. Further studies are required to delineate if there is a specific value that can predict need for MV and mortality. Future studies are also needed to determine whether ROX index progression from admission in the first 48 hours can predict outcome in these patients. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: ROX index is thus a promising non-invasive index and can be efficiently use especially when the healthcare system is oversaturated in the times of covid.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop and implement a simplified Mechanistic-Empirical (M-E) pavement design method based on the 1993 American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) 9-22, and NCHRP 1-37A and 1-40D projects. This simplified methodology is implemented into a computer code and a user-friendly software called ME-PAVE. In this methodology, only two equivalent temperatures, as per the NCHRP 9-22 project, are estimated to adjust the dynamic modulus of the asphalt layer(s) for Asphalt Concrete (AC) rutting and AC fatigue cracking prediction instead of using the hourly climatic data, as in the AASHTOWare Pavement ME. In ME-PAVE, the structural responses at critical locations in the pavement structure are determined by a Finite Element Module (FEM), which is verified by a Multi-layer Elastic Analysis (MLEA) program. To ensure that the simplified methodology is practical and accurate, the incorporated transfer functions in the proposed simplified methodology are calibrated based on the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) data. Based on statistical analyses, the built-in FEM results exhibit very similar trends to those yielded by MLEA, with a coefficient of determination, R2 of 1.0. For all practical purposes, the proposed methodology, despite all simplifications, yields acceptable prediction accuracy with R2 of 0.317 for the rut depth compared to the current practices, NCHRP 1-37A and 1-40D (R2 = 0.399 and 0.577, respectively);while the prediction accuracy for fatigue cracking with R2 of 0.382 is comparable to the NCHRP 1-40D with R2 of 0.275. Nonetheless, the standard error for both distresses is in good agreement based on the investigated data and the developed methodology. Finally, the conducted sensitivity analysis demonstrate that the proposed methodology produces rational pavement performance.","output":"A Simplified Mechanistic-Empirical Flexible Pavement Design Method for Moderate to Hot Climate Regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the months of April and May 2021, South Africa has witnessed several outbreaks of highly infective avian influenza (H5N1) in different poultry farms.

Effective targeting of tumor cells without accompanying toxicity has started to be realized with the introduction of signal transduction therapies and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Small molecule examples of the former drugs include imatinib (which inhibits both the ABL and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinases); gefitinib and erlotinib; mTOR inhibitors; histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs); all-trans retinoic acid (tRA) and arsenic trioxide that target PML; the synthetic retinoic X receptor agonist bexarotene for T cell lymphoma; some hormone therapies; and proteosome inhibitors including bortezomib and carfilzomib. For most of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting EGFRs, papulopustular rash, hand-foot skin reaction, mucositis, and nail abnormalities are the main adverse events. Retinoic acid syndrome occurs in some patients treated with tRA and/or arsenic trioxide. mTOR inhibitors are associated with a considerable number of adverse events including interstitial lung disease. Myelosuppression is a frequent event with HDACIs, and bortezomib, a proteosome inhibitor, may cause gastrointestinal symptoms, thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathy, and adverse cutaneous reactions including Sweets syndrome. Of the 85 currently approved mAbs, 34 recognizing 21 different targets are indicated for the treatment of cancers. Seven mAbs are antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) which effect cell killing by an attached bioactive payload of a potentially lethal toxin, drug, cytokine, or radionuclide. Immune checkpoint inhibitors target inhibitory pathways regulating signaling between T cells and antigen-presenting cells. mAbs may provoke type I immediate hypersensitivities (anaphylaxis, urticaria), types II (rituximab-induced neutropenia) and III hypersensitivities (serum sickness), delayed type IV cutaneous reactions, pulmonary toxicities, and cardiac adverse events. Skin reactions after cetuximab and panitumumab often appear as papulopustular eruptions. Severe infusion reactions provoked by mAbs can resemble anaphylaxis, cytokine-release syndrome (CRS), infusion, and type I allergic reactions, while tumor lysis syndrome, unlike CRS, is easy to distinguish from type I immediate reactions.","output":"Targeted Drugs for Cancer Therapy: Small Molecules and Monoclonal Antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality can be estimated based on reliable mortality data.

Lung tissues from 62 consecutive autopsies, conducted during the first and second COVID-19 pandemic waves in Switzerland, were analyzed for bacterial, viral and fungal respiratory pathogens including SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 28 lungs of 62 deceased patients (45%), although only 18 patients (29%) were reported to have COVID-19 at the time of death.

The majority of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (75%) did not suffer from respiratory co-infections, as long as they were treated with antibiotics. In the lungs of 5 patients (8% of all), SARS-CoV-2 was found, yet without typical clinical and/or autopsy findings. Our findings suggest that underreporting of COVID-19 contributes substantially to excess mortality.

We label these measures the maternal cumulative prevalence of infant mortality (mIM), under-five mortality (mU5M) and offspring mortality (mOM) and generate prevalence estimates for 20C44-year-old and 45C49-year-old mothers. RESULTS: In several Asian and European countries, the mIM and mU5M are below 10 per 1000 mothers yet exceed 200 per 1000 mothers in several Middle Eastern and African countries. Global inequality in mothers experience of child loss is enormous: mothers in high-mortality-burden African countries are more than 100 times more likely to have had a child die than mothers in low-mortality-burden Asian and European countries.

Yet, as with other types of crises and emergencies, there have been doubts about the extent to which the public are able to engage effectively with the required behaviour. These doubts are based on outdated models of group psychology. AIMS AND ARGUMENT: We analyse the role of group processes in the COVID-19 pandemic in three domains: recognition of threat, adherence by the public to the required public health behaviours (and the factors that increase such adherence) and actions of the many community mutual aid groups that arose during lockdown. In each case, we draw upon the accumulated research on behaviour in emergencies and disasters, as well as the latest findings in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, to show that explanations in terms of social identity processes make better sense of the patterns of evidence than alternative explanations. CONCLUSIONS: If behaviour in the pandemic is a function of mutable group processes rather than fixed tendencies, then behavioural change is possible. There was evidence of significant change in behaviour from the public, particularly in the early days of the pandemic. Understanding the role of group processes means we can help design more effective interventions to support collective resilience in the public in the face of the pandemic and other threats.

During pinocytosis, extracellular fluid volume equivalent to its CV is incorporated within an hour and membrane area equivalent to the cells surface within 30 min. Since neither fluid uptake nor membrane consumption leads to swelling or shrinkage, cells must be equipped with potent volume regulatory mechanisms. Normally, cells respond to outwardly or inwardly directed osmotic gradients by a volume decrease and increase, respectively, i.e., they shrink or swell but then try to recover their CV. However, when a cell death (CD) pathway is triggered, CV persistently decreases in isotonic conditions in apoptosis and it increases in necrosis. One type of CD associated with cell swelling is due to a dysfunctional pinocytosis. Methuosis, a non-apoptotic CD phenotype, occurs when cells accumulate too much fluid by macropinocytosis. In contrast to functional pinocytosis, in methuosis, macropinosomes neither recycle nor fuse with lysosomes but with each other to form giant vacuoles, which finally cause rupture of the plasma membrane (PM). Understanding methuosis longs for the understanding of the ionic mechanisms of cell volume regulation (CVR) and vesicular volume regulation (VVR). In nascent macropinosomes, ion channels and transporters are derived from the PM. Along trafficking from the PM to the perinuclear area, the equipment of channels and transporters of the vesicle membrane changes by retrieval, addition, and recycling from and back to the PM, causing profound changes in vesicular ion concentrations, acidification, andmost importantlyshrinkage of the macropinosome, which is indispensable for its proper targeting and cargo processing. In this review, we discuss ion and water transport mechanisms with respect to CVR and VVR and with special emphasis on pinocytosis and methuosis. We describe various aspects of the complex mutual interplay between extracellular and intracellular ions and ion gradients, the PM and vesicular membrane, phosphoinositides, monomeric G proteins and their targets, as well as the submembranous cytoskeleton. Our aim is to highlight important cellular mechanisms, components, and processes that may lead to methuotic CD upon their derangement.","output":"From Pinocytosis to MethuosisFluid Consumption as a Risk Factor for Cell Death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To determine the accuracy, reproducibility, and intra- and interobserver agreement of a computer-based quantitative method to measure liver surface nodularity (LSN) from routine computed tomographic (CT) images as a biomarker for detection and evaluation of cirrhosis. Materials and Methods For this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, adult patients with healthy livers (n = 24) or various stages of hepatitis C virus-induced chronic liver disease (n = 70) with routine nonenhanced and portal venous phase contrast agent-enhanced liver CT imaging with thick-section (5.0 mm) and thin-section (1.25-1.50 mm) axial images obtained between January 1, 2006, and March 31, 2011, were identified from the electronic medical records. A computer algorithm was developed to measure LSN and derive a score. LSN scores, splenic volume, and the ratio of left lateral segment (LLS) to total liver volume (TLV) were measured from the same multiphasic liver CT examinations. Accuracy for differentiating cirrhotic from noncirrhotic livers was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Intra- and interobserver agreement was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient. Results Median LSN scores from nonenhanced thick-section CT images in cirrhotic livers (3.16; 56 livers) were significantly higher than in noncirrhotic livers (2.11; 38 livers; P < .001). LSN scores from the four CT imaging types (94 patients for each type) were very strongly correlated (range of Spearman r, 0.929-0.960). LSN scores from portal venous phase contrast-enhanced thick-section CT images had significantly higher accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.929) than splenic volume (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.835) or LLS-to-TLV ratio measurements (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.753) for differentiating cirrhotic from noncirrhotic livers (P = .038 and .003, respectively; n = 94). Intra- and interobserver agreements that used nonenhanced thick CT images were very good (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.963 and 0.899, respectively). Conclusion Quantitative measurement of LSN on routine CT images accurately differentiated cirrhotic from noncirrhotic livers and was highly reproducible. (?)

We used a large-scale strategy to determine the time-dependent transcriptomic changes in islets of diabetes-prone db/db and diabetes-resistant ob/ob mice at 6 and 16 weeks of age. Differentially expressed genes were subjected to cluster, gene ontology, pathway and gene set enrichment analyses. A distinctive gene expression pattern was observed in 16 week db/db islets in comparison to the other groups with alterations in transcriptional regulators of islet cell identity, upregulation of glucose/lipid metabolism, and various stress response genes, and downregulation of specific amino acid transport and metabolism genes. In contrast, ob/ob islets displayed a coordinated downregulation of metabolic and stress response genes at 6 weeks of age, suggestive of a preemptive reconfiguration in these islets to lower the threshold of metabolic activation in response to increased insulin demand thereby preserving beta-cell function and preventing cellular stress. In addition, amino acid transport and metabolism genes were upregulated in ob/ob islets, suggesting an important role of glutamate metabolism in beta-cell compensation. Gene set enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes identified the enrichment of binding motifs for transcription factors, FOXO4, NFATC1, and MAZ. siRNA-mediated knockdown of these genes in MIN6 cells altered cell death, insulin secretion, and stress gene expression. In conclusion, these data revealed novel gene regulatory networks involved in beta-cell compensation and failure. Preemptive metabolic reconfiguration in diabetes-resistant islets may dampen metabolic activation and cellular stress during obesity.","output":"Transcriptome analysis of islets from diabetes-resistant and diabetes-prone obese mice reveals novel gene regulatory networks involved in beta-cell compensation and failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first wave of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in China showed there was a lag between the reduction in human mobility and the decline in COVID-19 transmission and this lag was different in cities A prolonged lag would cause public panic and reflect the inefficiency of control measures This study aims to quantify this time-lag effect and reveal its influencing socio-demographic and environmental factors, which is helpful to policymaking in controlling COVID-19 and other potential infectious diseases in the future We combined city-level mobility index and new case time series for 80 most affected cities in China from Jan 17 to Feb 29, 2020 Cross correlation analysis and spatial autoregressive model were used to estimate the lag length and determine influencing factors behind it, respectively The results show that mobility is strongly correlated with COVID-19 transmission in most cities with lags of 10 days (interquartile range 8 -

OBJECTIVE: To determine to what extent practical skills can be learned within the framework of a fully digitally implemented ENT mirror examination, the minimum number of teaching units (UE) required for competent execution, and the difficulty of the various examinations were identified. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a period of 5 days of their ENT block internship, a total of 146 students learned six ENT mirror examinations in daily videoconferences. A subgroup (n = 48) was assessed formatively each day and the increase in performance was statistically analysed over the 5 days. On the fifth day, exams were carried out with the entire cohort. RESULTS: Over the course of the 5 days, a significant increase in performance was observed in the various examinations. Based on the evaluation of the increase in performance in the subsections, examinations could also be classified as simple and difficult. Peak performance according to competence level 3a of the Nationaler Kompetenzorientierter Lernzielkatalog Medizin (NKLM) was achieved on day 4 after 5 UE had been completed.

METHODS: During the winters 2015-2018, we enrolled 571 sheltered homeless males and 54 non-homeless controls. Streptococcus pneumoniae was directly searched from nasal/pharyngeal samples using real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The homeless people were mostly migrants from African countries, with a mean age of 43 years. Pneumococcal vaccination coverage was low (3.1%). The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 13.0% and was significantly higher in homeless people (15.3% in 2018) than in controls (3.7%), with p = 0.033.

All patients with positive SARS CoV 2 RTPCR test on oral/nasopharyngeal swabs hospitalized from 21st February to 21st April 2020 were identified. Kaplan Meier survival estimates were calculated at 14 and 30 days for death in any setting, stratifying by age, sex and Charlson Index. Findings Overall 42,926 hospitalized COVID19 patients were identified. Patients' median age was 69 years (IQR: 57; 79), 62.6% were males, 69.4% had a Charlson Index of 0.

However, only 50% (38/76) had access to blend oxygen with medical air and 1% (1/75) had the capacity to blend oxygen/air for every infant. Although 96% (72/75) of units could monitor oxygen saturation, monitoring was mostly intermittent and only 32% (24/75) were able to monitor oxygen saturation in every infant receiving oxygen supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that oxygen supplementation is inadequately managed in neonatal units in sub-Saharan Africa, which may put infants at risk of developing severe ROP.","output":"Oxygen management among infants in neonatal units in sub-Saharan Africa: a cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Data on the national level and worldwide show a higher rate of mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) due to COVID-19, which determines the high relevance of risk factor analysis for outcomes in DM patients to substantiate the strategy for this category of patients. AIM To assess the effect of clinical and demographic parameters (age, gender, body mass index (BMI), glycemic control (HbA1c), and antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs) on clinical outcomes (recovery or death) in patients with type 2 DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of the Russian Register of Diabetes database was performed, including patients with type 2 DM (n=309) who suffered pneumonia/COVID-19 in the period from 01.02.2020 to 27.04.2020 and the indicated outcome of the disease (recovery or death) RESULTS: The percentage of lethality was determined to be 15.2% (47 of 309 people). The degree of lethality was found to be significantly higher in males (OR=2.08; 95% CI 1.1C3.9; p=0.022) and in patients on insulin therapy (OR=2.67; 95% CI; 1.42C5.02; p=0.002), while it was significantly lower in patients with an age <65 years (OR=0.34; 95% CI 0.18C0.67; p=0.001) and in patients receiving metformin (OR=0.26; 95% CI 0.14C0,5; p<0.0001), antihypertensive therapy (OR=0.43; 95% CI 0.22C0.82; p=0.009), -blockers (OR=0.26; 95% CI 0.08C0.86; p=0.018), diuretics (OR=0.4; 95% CI 0.17C0.93; p=0.028) and renin-angiotensin system blockers (ACE inhibitors or ARBs) (OR=0.36; 95% CI 0.18C0.74; p=0.004). A tendency to an increase in lethality at higher rates of HbA1c and BMI was present, but it did not reach a statistical significance. Differences between patients receiving insulin therapy and those who were not receiving the insulin therapy were observed as follows: a significantly longer duration of type 2 DM (13.4 vs. 6.8 years, respectively; p<0.0001), worse overall glyacemic control (HbA1c: 8.1% vs. 7.0%, resp.; p<0.0001), and three times more frequent failure to achieve the HbA1c goal by more than 2.5% (14.7% vs. 5.9%, resp.; p=0.04). CONCLUSION The identified risk factors for lethality in patients with type 2 DM indicate that good glycemic control and previous treatment with metformin and antihypertensive drugs (including RAS blockers) could reduce the frequency of deaths. In patients on insulin therapy, a higher lethality degree was associated with worse glycemic control.","output":"[Diabetes and COVID-19: analysis of the clinical outcomes according to the data of the russian diabetes registry]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundNICE guidelines state that children with their first seizure should be seen by a specialist within two weeks.

This led to a delay in seizure management and emotional anxiety to families and staff.ObjectivesTo decrease the time taken from referral to first clinic review, so as to decrease patient anxiety and improve seizure management, by March 2021MethodsUsing diagnostics (process map and fishbone diagram), I identified the process and areas of possible intervention.Two approaches were used1. Retrospective analysis of data obtained from our IT department on patients referred to first seizure/new epilepsy clinic, January - August 2020 to get a baseline measurement2.

Introduction of a generic email address for all referrals (3 cycles)2. Designing a standardised referral form to streamline referrals (6 cycles)3. Discussion with the IT team possibility of integrating referral form onto hospital electronic system (4 cycles)4. Uploading the referral form onto hospital intranet to make it accessible and creating awareness about new referral process (3 cycles)ResultsThe initial average waiting time was 83 days (median 63 days). Since the initiation of the PDSA series, the average waiting time has decreased to 47 days (median 54 days). It is however important to note that there have been fewer referrals due to the Covid pandemic since December (time of initiation of the 1st PDSA series) and thus the impact of changes made on waiting time has been difficult to accurately assess.The process of referral has however been streamlined.As I continue collecting data in real time, I anticipate that I will be able to show a sustained decrease in waiting time.ConclusionsThe system of triage and referral to the first seizure/new epilepsy clinic is influenced by several factors, each of which makes an impact on the waiting time. In order to make a sustainable difference to the waiting time, we will have to continue making small changes throughout the booking process and continuously monitor their effect.","output":"Sort out my 1st seizure.QUICK!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Given that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mainly spreads through the respiratory system and is associated with severe pulmonary complications, lung cancer patients may have worse outcomes than those with other tumors. There is no confirmed evidence about the mortality comparison between COVID-19 patients with lung cancer and other tumors. We performed a systematic review and pooled analysis to provide precise estimates of the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with lung cancer and other tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study systemically included and reviewed 13 studies on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients with lung cancer published up to November 1, 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. We also compared the all-cause mortality rates in China and other regions as a secondary endpoint. The mortality rate was assessed with a fixed-effects model, which was used to derive the pooled mortality and 95 % condence interval (CI). RESULTS: Thirteen studies from different countries, involving 1,229 patients with both COVID-19 and cancer, were selected for the pooled analysis. A total of 343 deaths were recorded in this population: 86 for lung cancers and 257 for other tumors. The mortality rate varies from 18 % to 60 % for patients with lung cancer and COVID-19 and 10%-41% for other tumor patients with COVID-19. The overall meta-analysis did not show a significant mortality difference for the lung cancer and other tumor subgroups (OR = 1.47, 95 %CI = 0.98-2.20, p = 0.06, I2 = 23 %). Nevertheless, in regions other than China, the pooled mortality of lung cancer patients with COVID-19 was 42 %, which was significantly higher than that of other tumors (24 %) (OR = 2.73, 95 % CI = 1.54-4.86, p = 0.0006, I2 = 16 %).

PATIENTS AND METHODS In an observational trial, COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients were enrolled. MR-proADM, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and lactic acid (LA) were measured in all patients at admission (T0), at 24 hours (T1) and in the third (T3) and fifth day (T5) of hospitalization. The aims of this study were to determine the role of MR-proADM to detect patients with high risk of mortality and compare the prognostic value of MR-proADM with commonly used clinical scores (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score - SOFA score, Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II score - APACHE II score, and Simplified Acute Physiological score II - SAPS II score). RESULTS Twenty-one COVID-19 ARDS patients admitted to the Intermediate Care Unit (IMCU) were enrolled. The median MR-proADM values were 2.28, 2.41, 1.96 and 1.89 nmol/L at T0, T1, T3 and T5, respectively. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 52.4%. Mean MR-proADM T0 value was significantly higher in non-survivors compared with survivors (3.5 vs. 1.1 nmol/L, p < 0.05). No significant differences were found for the other inflammatory biomarkers. In terms of the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), MR-proADM showed a similar discriminatory power compared with APACHE II, SOFA and SAPS II score (0.81, 0.91, 0.70 and 0.78, respectively). The optimal MR-proADM cut-point cut-off point was 1.07 nmol/L, which corresponds to a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 71%.

Researchers have been unveiling the transmission mechanisms and disclosing possible contributing factors. Studies have theorized plausible linkage mechanisms between air pollution exposure and COVID-19 infection and have divided the air pollution exposure into two types: long-term exposure and short-term exposure. However, present studies on impacts of short-term exposure have not reached a conclusive result and are mostly focusing on Asian and European countries. In this study, we conduct a nationwide analysis to examine the association between short-term air pollution exposure and COVID-19 infection in the United States. Daily confirmed cases, air pollution information, and meteorological factors at the county level were collected between March 1st and June 30th, 2020. A total of 806 (out of 3143) counties were included in this study, with 554 counties for PM(2.5), 670 counties for ozone (O(3)), and 418 counties for both, accounting for around 2.1 million cumulative confirmed cases. This accounts for about 80% of all confirmed cases in the U.S. over the study period. A generalized additive model was applied to investigate the relationship between short-term exposure to PM(2.5)/O(3) and COVID-19 confirmed cases. The statistically significant results indicate that, with every 10 [Formula: see text] increase in mean pollutant concentration, the number of daily confirmed cases increases by 9.41% (CI: 8.77%C10.04%) for PM(2.5) and by 2.42% (CI: 1.56%C3.28%) for O(3). The relative risks associated with short-term PM(2.5) exposure remain positive after isolating the impacts of long-term exposure. The findings of this study suggest that short-term exposure to air pollution, especially to PM(2.5), is likely contributing to the spread and course of the pandemic. This finding has important implications for policymakers and the public to take preventive measures such as staying at home on polluted days while improving ventilation indoors to lower the probability of infection.","output":"Short-term air pollution exposure and COVID-19 infection in the United States()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Healthcare costs are increasing in the U.S. Healthcare market is fragmented and opaque.

The 2020 COVID-19 lockdown measures can be seen as an unintended but effective experiment to assess the impact of traffic restriction policies on air pollution. Our objective was to estimate the impact of the lockdown measures on NO(2) concentrations and health in the two largest Italian cities. METHODS: NO(2) concentration datasets were built using data deriving from a 1-month citizen science monitoring campaign that took place in Milan and Rome just before the Italian lockdown period. Annual mean NO(2) concentrations were estimated for a lockdown scenario (Scenario 1) and a scenario without lockdown (Scenario 2), by applying city-specific annual adjustment factors to the 1-month data. The latter were estimated deriving data from Air Quality Network stations and by applying a machine learning approach. NO(2) spatial distribution was estimated at a neighbourhood scale by applying Land Use Random Forest models for the two scenarios. Finally, the impact of lockdown on health was estimated by subtracting attributable deaths for Scenario 1 and those for Scenario 2, both estimated by applying literature-based doseCresponse function on the counterfactual concentrations of 10 g/m(3). RESULTS: The Land Use Random Forest models were able to capture 41C42% of the total NO(2) variability. Passing from Scenario 2 (annual NO(2) without lockdown) to Scenario 1 (annual NO(2) with lockdown), the population-weighted exposure to NO(2) for Milan and Rome decreased by 15.1% and 15.3% on an annual basis. Considering the 10 g/m(3) counterfactual, prevented deaths were respectively 213 and 604. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the lockdown had a beneficial impact on air quality and human health. However, compliance with the current EU legal limit is not enough to avoid a high number of NO(2) attributable deaths. This contribution reaffirms the potentiality of the citizen science approach and calls for more ambitious traffic calming policies and a re-evaluation of the legal annual limit value for NO(2) for the protection of human health.

To our knowledge, it is the first study in Turkey to value human life losses associated with COVID-19. Methods: A human capital approach (HCA) model was applied to estimate the total monetary value of the 4,807 human lives lost in Turkey (TMVHL) from COVID-19 by 15 June 2020. The TMVHL equals the sum of monetary values of human lives lost (MVHL) across nine age groups. The MVHL accruing to each age group is the sum of the product of discount factor, years of life lost, net GDP per capita, and the number of COVID-19 deaths in an age group. The HCA model was re-calculated five times assuming discount rates of 3%, 5%, and 10% with a national life expectancy of 78.45 years; and the world highest life expectancy of 87.1 years and global life expectancy of 72 years with 3% discount rate. Results: The 4807 human life losses from COVID-19 had a TMVHL of Int$1,098,469,122; and a mean of Int$228,514 per human life. Reanalysis with 5% and 10% discount rates, holding national life expectancy constant, reduced the TMVHL by Int$167,248,319 (15.2%) and Int$ 429,887,379 (39%), respectively. Application of the global life expectancy reduced the TMVHL by 36.4%, and use of world highest life expectancy increased TMVHL by 69%. However, the HCA captures only the economic production losses incurred as a result of years of life lost. It ignores non-market contributions to social welfare and the adverse effects of economic activities.

Further research is required to halt progression of multi-organ injury induced by hyper-inflammation. AREAS COVERED: PubMed/MEDLINETM databases were accessed between May 9th-June 9th, 2020, to review the latest perspectives on the treatment and pathogenesis of CRS. EXPERT OPINION: Over-activity of chemotaxis triggers a macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-6 and TNF- &#945; are at the forefront of hyper-inflammation. The inflammatory cascade induces endothelial activation and capillary leak, leading to circulatory collapse and shock. As endothelial dysfunction persists, there is activation of the clotting cascade and microvascular obstruction. Continued endothelial activation results in multi-organ failure, regardless of pulmonary tissue damage. We propose that targeting the endothelium may interrupt this cycle. Immuno-modulating therapies have been suggested, however, further data is necessary to confirm that they do not jeopardize adaptive immunity. Inhibition of IL-6 and the Janus Kinase, signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins pathway (JAK/STAT), are favorable targets.

In addition to accommodating new guidelines and policies, staff had to adjust to rapid reconfiguration of services external to the home that they would normally depend upon for support. This study examined the complex interdependencies of support as staff responded to COVID-19. The aim was to inform more effective responses to the ongoing pandemic, and to improve understanding of how to work with care home staff and organisations after the pandemic has passed. METHODS: Ten managers of registered care homes in the East Midlands of England were interviewed by videoconference or phone about their experiences of the crisis from a structured organisational perspective. Analysis used an adapted organisational framework analysis approach with a focus on social ties and interdependencies between organisations and individuals. RESULTS: Three key groups of interdependencies were identified: care processes and practice; resources; and governance. Care home staff had to deliver care in innovative ways, making high stakes decisions in circumstances defined by: fluid ties to organisations outside the care home; multiple, sometimes conflicting, sources of expertise and information; and a sense of deprioritisation by authorities. Organisational responses to the pandemic by central government resulted in resource constraints and additional work, and sometimes impaired the ability of staff and managers to make decisions. Local communities, including businesses, third-sector organisations and individuals, were key in helping care homes overcome challenges. Care homes, rather than competing, were found to work together to provide mutual support. Resilience in the system was a consequence of dedicated and resourceful staff using existing local networks, or forging new ones, to overcome barriers to care. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified how interdependency between care home organisations, the surrounding community, and key statutory and non-statutory organisations beyond their locality, shaped decision making and care delivery during the pandemic. Recognising these interdependencies, and the expertise shown by care home managers and staff as they navigate them, is key to providing effective healthcare in care homes as the pandemic progresses, and as the sector recovers afterwards.","output":"Care homes, their communities, and resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic: interim findings from a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of a novel beta coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 on pregnancy outcomes and the neonatal prognosis is not fully documented yet.

TMPRSS2 encodes a transmembrane serine protease which plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMPRSS2 might influence SARS-CoV2 entry into the cell. This study aimed to investigate the impact of SNPs on TMPRSS2 function and structure. In silico tools such as Ensembl, Gtex, ExPASY 2, GEPIA, CCLE, KEGG and GO were engaged to characterize TMPRSS2 and its expression profile. The functional effects of SNPs were analyzed by PolyPhen-2, PROVEN, SNAP2, SIFT and HSF. Also, Phyre2, GOR IV and PSIPRED were used to predict the secondary structure of TMPRSS2. Moreover, post-translational modification (PTM) and secretory properties were analyzed through Modpredand Phobius, respectively. Finally, miRNA profiles were investigated by PolymiRTS and miRSNPs. Out of 11,184 retrieved SNPs from dbSNP, 92 showed a different frequency between Asians and other populations. Only 21 SNPs affected the function and structure of TMPRSS2 by influencing the protein folding, PTM, splicing and miRNA function. Particularly, rs12329760 may create a de novo pocket protein. rs875393 can create a donor site, silencer and broken enhancer motifs. rs12627374 affects a wide spectrum of miRNAs profile. This study highlighted the role of TMPRSS2 SNPs and epigenetic mechanisms especially non-coding RNAs in appearance of different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 among different populations.

The latter is less expensive, easily accessible to populations in rural and remote areas. In addition, the device for acquiring these images is easy to disinfect, clean and maintain. The main challenge is the lack of labeled training data needed to train convolutional neural networks. To overcome this issue, we propose to leverage Deep Transfer Learning architecture pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and trained Fine-Tuning on a dataset prepared by collecting normal, COVID-19, and other chest pneumonia X-ray images from different available databases. We take the weights of the layers of each network already pre-trained to our model and we only train the last layers of the network on our collected COVID-19 image dataset. In this way, we will ensure a fast and precise convergence of our model despite the small number of COVID-19 images collected. In addition, for improving the accuracy of our global model will only predict at the output the prediction having obtained a maximum score among the predictions of the seven pre-trained CNNs. The proposed model will address a three-class classification problem: COVID-19 class, pneumonia class, and normal class.

While online posting proves very convenient for individual users, it also fosters fast-spreading of various rumors. The rapid and wide percolation of rumors can cause persistent adverse or detrimental impacts. Therefore, researchers invest great efforts on reducing the negative impacts of rumors. Towards this end, the rumor classification system aims to detect, track, and verify rumors in social media. Such systems typically include four components: (i) a rumor detector, (ii) a rumor tracker, (iii) a stance classifier, and (iv) a veracity classifier. In order to improve the state-of-the-art in rumor detection, tracking, and verification, we propose VRoC, a tweet-level variational autoencoder-based rumor classification system. VRoC consists of a co-train engine that trains variational autoencoders (VAEs) and rumor classification components. The co-train engine helps the VAEs to tune their latent representations to be classifier-friendly. We also show that VRoC is able to classify unseen rumors with high levels of accuracy.

ReDuNing injection (RDN) is a traditional Chinese medicine known to exert antibacterial, antiviral, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, RDN has been recommended in the diagnosis and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated pneumonia by the National Health Council and the National Administration of Chinese Medicine. However, there is no information regarding its efficacy against COVID-19. AIM OF STUDY: This study was designed to determine the clinical efficacy of RDN in patients with COVID-19 and characterize its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 adults with COVID-19 were included in this study, and the primary endpoint was recovery from clinical symptoms following 14 days of treatment. General improvements were defined as the disappearance of the major symptoms of infection including fever, fatigue, and cough. The secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients who achieved clinical symptom amelioration on days 7 and 10, time to clinical recovery, time to a negative nucleic acid test result, duration of hospitalization, and time to defervescence. Plaque reduction and cytopathic effect assays were also performed in vitro, and reverse-transcription quantitative PCR was performed to evaluate the expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IP-10, MCP-1, IL-6, IFN-&#945;, IFN-?3, IL-2 and CCL-5) during SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The RDN group exhibited a shorter median time for the resolution of clinical symptoms (120 vs. 220 h, P < 0.0001), less time to a negative PCR test result (215 vs. 310 h, P = 0.0017), shorter hospitalization (14.8 vs. 18.5 days, P = 0.0002), and lower timeframe for defervescence (24.5 vs. 75 h, P = 0.0001) than the control group. In addition, time to improved imaging was also shorter in the RDN group than in the control group (6 vs.8.9 days, P = 0.0273); symptom resolution rates were higher in the RDN group than in the control group at 7 (96.30% vs. 39.13%, P < 0.0001) and 10 days (96.30% vs. 56.52%, P = 0.0008). No allergic reactions or anaphylactic responses were reported in this trial. RDN markedly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 proliferation and viral plaque formation in vitro. In addition, RDN significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine production in infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: RDN relieves clinical symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection by regulating inflammatory cytokine-related disorders, suggestion that this medication might be a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19.","output":"Efficacy and safety of ReDuNing injection as a treatment for COVID-19 and its inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ticks are important vector hosts of pathogens which cause human and animal diseases worldwide.

We investigated the overall impact of the economic recession between 1991 and 1994 in Finland on the long-term incidence of psychiatric and alcohol-related diseases. METHODS: A population-based sample of 1,774 women and men aged 53C73 years were examined between 1998 and 2001 from the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD). Participants completed comprehensive questionnaires on the possible impact of the 1990s recession in Finland on their lives. They were followed-up until 2018. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of new incident psychiatric and alcohol-related disorders during the 20-years follow-up after linkage to the National Hospital Registry. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) of psychiatric disorders at baseline. RESULTS: At baseline, 93 participants had psychiatric disorders. During 20-years follow-up, 138 new psychiatric disorders and 45 alcohol-related diseases were developed. The covariate-adjusted risk of psychiatric disorders was over twice higher among men who experienced recession-induced hardships compared to those who did not (HR = 2.20, 95%CI = 1.04C4.70, p = 0.04). The risk of alcohol-related diseases was more than four times higher among men with hardships (HR = 4.44, 95%CI = 1.04C18.90, p = 0.04). No such associations were observed among women. No association was observed between recession-induced hardships and having psychiatric disorders at baseline in both genders (multivariate-adjusted p = 0.63 for women, multivariate-adjusted p = 0.36 for men).

We aimed to predict the potential effects of such disruptions on HIV-related deaths and new infections in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: In this modelling study, we used five well described models of HIV epidemics (Goals, Optima HIV, HIV Synthesis, an Imperial College London model, and Epidemiological MODeling software [EMOD]) to estimate the effect of various potential disruptions to HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services on HIV-related deaths and new infections in sub-Saharan Africa lasting 6 months over 1 year from April 1, 2020. We considered scenarios in which disruptions affected 20%, 50%, and 100% of the population. FINDINGS: A 6-month interruption of supply of antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs across 50% of the population of people living with HIV who are on treatment would be expected to lead to a 163 times (median across models; range 139C187) increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period compared with no disruption. In sub-Saharan Africa, this increase amounts to a median excess of HIV deaths, across all model estimates, of 296 000 (range 229 023C420 000) if such a high level of disruption occurred. Interruption of ART would increase mother-to-child transmission of HIV by approximately 16 times. Although an interruption in the supply of ART drugs would have the largest impact of any potential disruptions, effects of poorer clinical care due to overstretched health facilities, interruptions of supply of other drugs such as co-trimoxazole, and suspension of HIV testing would all have a substantial effect on population-level mortality (up to a 106 times increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period due to disruptions affecting 50% of the population compared with no disruption). Interruption to condom supplies and peer education would make populations more susceptible to increases in HIV incidence, although physical distancing measures could lead to reductions in risky sexual behaviour (up to 119 times increase in new HIV infections over a 1-year period if 50% of people are affected). INTERPRETATION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary priority for governments, donors, suppliers, and communities should focus on maintaining uninterrupted supply of ART drugs for people with HIV to avoid additional HIV-related deaths. The provision of other HIV prevention measures is also important to prevent any increase in HIV incidence.

Four trials were head-to-head comparisons of sanitiser and soap and water but too heterogeneous to pool: two found a significantly greater reduction in the sanitiser group compared with the soap group and two found no significant difference between the intervention arms. CONCLUSIONS: Adequately performed hand hygiene, with either soap or sanitiser, reduces the risk of ARI virus transmission; however, direct and indirect evidence suggest sanitiser might be more effective in practice.","output":"Soap versus sanitiser for preventing the transmission of acute respiratory infections in the community: a systematic review with meta-analysis and doseCresponse analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bearing the largest single-stranded RNA genome in nature, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes sophisticated replication/transcription complexes (RTCs), mainly composed of a network of nonstructural proteins and nucleocapsid protein, to establish efficient infection.

We describe the makeup and risk factors gathered from a contact tracing program in a hospital system in Miami, Florida. Methods The contact tracing effort covered a system of four hospitals: two major teaching hospitals and two community hospitals. Associated satellite facilities were also included. Sample consisted of employees tested for COVID-19 regardless of employee category or testing location between July and September 2020. Only employees who tested positive and were successfully interviewed by the Infection Prevention and Control department staff were included in this analysis. Risk factors included employee role, direct extended contact with patients and other employees, PPE usage, meal break behavior and location, and manner of commuting. Results 220 employees tested positive and were interviewed. 84 (38.2%) were nursing staff, 68 (30.9%) were non-nurse clinical staff and 68 (30.9%) non-clinical staff. 159 (72.3%) had extended contact with patients and 205 (93.2%) had contact with other staff. 1 (0.5%) employee reported not wearing PPE in the presence of other employees. 85 (38.6%) and 98 (44.5%) employees reported working in a shared office or floor unit with no set office respectively. 101 (45.9%) employees reported eating lunch in their employee lounge or break room.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional online thirty-six-item Google Survey. The survey queried demographics and information on usage and perceived telemedicine quality. SETTING: The survey was distributed to Israeli Dietetic Association (ATID) mailing list between 31 March and 5 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Clinical dietitians, members of ATID, who consented to participated in the survey. RESULTS: Three hundred dietitians (12 % of ATID members; 95 % women; mean age 441 (sd 102) years) replied to the survey. Most dietitians reported a significant a??30 % decrease in work hours due to the pandemic. The most prevalent form of alternative nutrition counselling (ANC) was over the phone (72 %); 535 % used online platforms. Nearly 45 % had no former ANC experience. Both ANC formats were reported inferior to face-to-face nutritional consultation (consultation quality median scores 8 and 7, on a 1-10 scale, for online and phone, respectively). ANC difficulties on either phone or online platforms were technical (56 and 47 %, respectively), lack of anthropometric measurements (28 and 25 %, respectively) and interpersonal communication (19 and 146 %, respectively). Older age and former phone counselling experience were associated with higher quality scores, respectively (OR = 1046, 95 % CI 101, 108, P = 0005), (95 % CI 138, 452, P = 002). Those who continued to work full time had five-time greater odds for a higher quality score using online platforms (OR = 533, 95 % CI 1091, 1489, P = 0001).

Recently, researchers started paying more attention to the changes in climate and their subsequent impact on the social, environmental and economic determinants of health, and the role they play in causing or exacerbating mental health problems. The effects of climate change-related events on mental well-being could be classified into direct and indirect effects. The direct effects of climate change mostly occur after acute weather events and include post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, substance abuse disorder, depression and even suicidal ideation. The indirect effects include economic losses, displacement and forced migration, competition over scarce resources and collective violence. The risk factors for developing those mental health issues include young age, female gender, low socioeconomic status, loss or injury of a loved one, being a member of immigrant groups or indigenous people, pre-existing mental illness and inadequate social support. However, in some individuals, especially those undisturbed by any directly observable effects of climate change, abstract awareness and acknowledgement of the ongoing climate crisis can induce negative emotions that can be intense enough to cause mental health illness. Coping strategies should be provided to the affected communities to protect their mental health from collapse in the face of climate disasters. Awareness of the mental health impacts of climate change should be raised, especially in the high-risk groups. Social and global attention to the climate crisis and its detrimental effects on mental health are crucial. This paper was written with the aim of trying to understand the currently, scientifically proven impact of climate change-related disasters on mental health and understanding the different methods of solving the problem at the corporate level, by trying to decrease greenhouse gas emissions to zero, and at the individual level by learning how to cope with the impacts of those disasters.","output":"Are climate change and mental health correlated?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN Global cross-sectional survey.

METHODS A live webinar was organized in 2018 for validation of the AO Spine Subaxial Injury Classification System, consisting of 35 unique computed tomography (CT) scans and key images with subaxial spine injuries. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility was calculated for injury morphology, subtype, and facet injury according to the classification system. Based on the experiences from this webinar and incorporating rater feedback, adjustments were made in the organization and techniques used and in 2020 a repeat validation webinar was performed, evaluating images of 41 unique subaxial spine injuries. RESULTS In the 2018 session, the AO Spine Subaxial Injury Classification System demonstrated fair interobserver reliability for fracture subtype ( = 0.35) and moderate reliability for fracture morphology and facet injury (=0.45, 0.43, respectively). However, in 2020, the interobserver reliability for fracture morphology ( = 0.87) and fracture subtype ( = 0.80) was excellent, while facet injury was substantial ( = 0.74). Intraobserver reproducibility for injury morphology ( =0.49) and injury subtype/facet injury were moderate ( = 0.42) in 2018. In 2020, fracture morphology and subtype reproducibility were excellent ( =0.85, 0.88, respectively) while reproducibility for facet injuries was substantial ( = 0.76).

This situation arises the mental abnormalities, sudden rise in body temperature, disturbance of consciousness, and so forth in children, which can be life-threatening. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed at exploring the effect of diffusion weighted MRI on children with severe viral encephalitis and myocarditis. METHODS: This work presents a diffusion weighted MRI scanning method that involves scanning through a serial imaging device, axial scanning, and sagittal and coronal scanning. 60 children with severe viral encephalitis and myocarditis who admitted to Brain Hospital of Hunan Province from April 2017 to May 2020 were deemed as research subjects. All the children underwent CT and MRI examination, blood routine examination, and cerebrospinal fluid examination after admission. This work uses the random number table method to classify the subjects into control group and observation group, each consisting of 30 cases. Children in the control group were provided with the routine nursing intervention, whereas children in the observation group were subjected to incentive nursing intervention. The baseline data, ECG monitoring indicators, body abnormalities, and clinical symptom relief time of the two groups of children were compared and the results of diffusion weighted MRI scans were analyzed and the ADC values were counted. RESULTS: The two groups of children were compared on the basis of baseline data, and the variation was not statistically substantial (P > 0.05). The cases of children in the control group had higher heart rate and respiration, and physical dysfunction, language dysfunction, unconsciousness, and nervous dysfunction were more than those in the observation group. However, the cases of blood oxygen saturation were less than those of the observation group. After nursing intervention done for the control group, remission time of clinical symptoms such as convulsion, physical dysfunction, unconsciousness, and nerve dysfunction was longer relative to the observation group (all P < 0.05 are considered). CONCLUSION: The diffusion weighted MRI had diagnostic significance for severe viral encephalitis and myocarditis. For children with severe viral encephalitis and myocarditis, clinical incentive nursing intervention was particularly imperative. It can not only help children to relieve symptoms and control the deterioration of the disease in a short time but also help improve the quality of life of the children and the confidence of family members to cope with the disease.","output":"Analysis of the Effect of Incentive Nursing Intervention in Children with Severe Viral Encephalitis and Myocarditis during Rehabilitation Based on Diffusion Weighted MRI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and/or a defective antibody response to T-dependent and T-independent antigens.

In CVID patients, humoral and cellular responses to the currently used COVID-19 vaccines remain unexplored. Eighteen CVID subjects receiving 2-dose anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were prospectively studied. S1-antibodies and S1-specific IFN- T cell response were determined by ELISA and FluoroSpot, respectively. The immune response was measured before the administration and after each dose of the vaccine, and it was compared to the response of 50 healthy controls (HC). The development of humoral and cellular responses was slower in CVID patients compared with HC. After completing vaccination, 83% of CVID patients had S1-specific antibodies and 83% had S1-specific T cells compared with 100% and 98% of HC (p = 0.014 and p = 0.062, respectively), but neutralizing antibodies were detected only in 50% of the patients. The strength of both humoral and cellular responses was significantly lower in CVID compared with HC, after the first and second doses of the vaccine. Absent or discordant humoral and cellular responses were associated with previous history of autoimmunity and/or lymphoproliferation. Among the three patients lacking humoral response, two had received recent therapy with anti-B cell antibodies. Further studies are needed to understand if the response to COVID-19 vaccination in CVID patients is protective enough.

There is an urgent need for therapeutics, both through the repurposing of approved drugs and the development of new treatments. In addition to the viral drug targets, a number of human drug targets have been suggested. In theory, targeting human proteins should provide an advantage over targeting viral proteins in terms of drug resistance, which is commonly a problem in treating RNA viruses. This paper focuses on the human protein TMPRSS2, which supports coronavirus life cycles by cleaving viral spike proteins. The three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 is not known and so we have generated models of the TMPRSS2 in the apo state as well as in complex with a peptide substrate and putative inhibitors to aid future work. Importantly, many related human proteases have 80% or higher identity with TMPRSS2 in the S1-S1 subsites, with plasminogen and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) having 95% identity. We highlight 376 approved, investigational or experimental drugs targeting S1A serine proteases that may also inhibit TMPRSS2. Whilst the presence of a relatively uncommon lysine residue in the S2/S3 subsites means that some serine protease inhibitors will not inhibit TMPRSS2, this residue is likely to provide a handle for selective targeting in a focused drug discovery project.

In this study, a total of 51 water samples were collected from two rivers and four lakes in May 2020 in Wuhan to explore the regional variation of nitrogen (N) species, DON's compositional characteristics, and the three classes of DBP occurrence. In lakes, 53.0% to 86.3% of N existed as DON, with its concentration varying between 0.3-4.0 mg N/L. In contrast, NO3--N was the dominant N species in rivers. Spectral analysis revealed that DON in the lakes contained higher humic and fulvic materials with higher A254, A253/A203, SUVA254, and PIII+IV/PI+II+V ratios, while rivers had higher levels of hydrophilic compounds.

In 2018, samples from Ross 308 breeding hens aged 35 weeks were delivered for IBV diagnosis. IBV presence was detected, but all attempts to amplify the S gene fragment were negative. The field material was analysed using the Illumina MiSeq platform and a 1073-nt fragment of the S1 coding region was obtained. The gCoV/ck/Poland/516/2018 strain shared only 52.7-58.1% nucleotide identity to any known genotypes of IBV and shared the highest identity of 81.4% to the unique North American PA/1220/98 variant. Based on the obtained sequence, a specific molecular test was constructed and used for screening of chicken samples from 35 field cases delivered to our laboratory between 2018 and 2019 for IBV diagnosis. Application of this test enabled detection of another three chicken flocks as positive for this new strain. All positives were identified in commercial layers with egg production problems.

METHODS: Sixty-four mothers (M(age) = 39.3 years) who underwent bariatric surgery (M(time since surgery) = 19.6 months) completed surveys online (November 2020CFebruary 2021). Information obtained included their COVID-19 vaccine intention (vaccine ready, undecided, vaccine opposed). Analyses examined group differences in demographics, body mass index (BMI = kg/m(2)), knowledge of obesity-related COVID-19 risk, flu vaccination history, general beliefs about vaccine safety/effectiveness, and factors increasing confidence/motivation to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Thirty-six (56.3%) mothers had severe obesity ( Class II [BMI =  35 kg/m(2)]). The majority were vaccine hesitant (undecided [n = 28; 43.8%]; vaccine opposed [n = 15; 23.4%]). Compared to the vaccine-ready group, vaccine-hesitant groups were younger (p < .05). For the vaccine opposed, recent flu vaccination rates (p = .012) and general belief that vaccines are safe (p = .028) were lower than expected. Among hesitant participants, no reported side effects and the health of self and others were endorsed as top factors increasing vaccine confidence and motivation respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While preliminary, the prominence of early vaccine hesitancy in this sample of mothers who have undergone bariatric surgery, with most persisting with severe obesity, indicates a subgroup at high risk. Factors to address through targeted messaging and intervention were identified.

An ANN is built from a network of linked units or nodes known as artificial neurons, which are roughly modeled after the neurons in the human brain. Each link, like synapses in a human brain, has the ability to send a signal to other neurons. The connections are referred to as edges. Neurons and edges usually have a weight that changes as learning progresses. The weight changes the intensity of the signal at a connection. Artificial neural networks have found applications in a wide range of fields due to their capacity to recreate and simulate nonlinear phenomena. System identification and control, medical diagnostics, data mining, visualization, machine translation, distinguishing highly invasive cancer cell lines from less invasive lines using simply cell shape information, and many more domains are examples of application areas. In this study, ANN analysis was utilized by us to forecast the total cost of therapy or the prognosis of severe COVID-19 the patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: The parameters such as ages, and the other biochemical parameters that affect the staying periods (days) of COVID-19 infected patients in ICU were evaluated by using an ANN analysis. For this a computer program, Pythia?, was used to develop ANN models. Real data was used for that selected patients in this study. Results: The real data obtained from the ICU and gave to the computer as initial parameters. The computer program gave 15 neurons for the first level, one neurons for the second level as the most suitable model for the prediction (SSD = 0.000995). This program predicts a total cost 144.930,94 Turkish Lira (27.300 USD) where the real cost 142.234,06 Turkish Lira (26.792 USD) for the real patient in 2019. This relation was found to be good to predict the possible affected parameters on staying times. Conclusion: The ANN model developed and released in this research does not necessitate any experimental parameters. Besides, ANN has the ability to deliver helpful and exact prediction or information regarding the expense of COVID-19 patients in ICU. ? 2022.

Assessing the antibody status of patients with cancer and HCWs can help understand the spread of COVID-19 in cancer care. Objective: To evaluate serum SARS-CoV-2 antibody status in patients with cancer and HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Design, Setting, and Participants: Participants were enrolled for this prospective cross-sectional study between August 3 and October 30, 2020, from 2 comprehensive cancer centers in the epidemic area around Tokyo, Japan. Patients with cancer aged 16 years or older and employees were enrolled. Participants with suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of enrollment were excluded. Exposures: Cancer of any type and cancer treatment, including chemotherapy, surgery, immune checkpoint inhibitors, radiotherapy, and targeted molecular therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Seroprevalence and antibody levels in patients with cancer and HCWs. Seropositivity was defined as positivity to nucleocapsid IgG (N-IgG) and/or spike IgG (S-IgG). Serum levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. Results: A total of 500 patients with cancer (median age, 62.5 years [range, 21-88 years]; 265 men [55.4%]) and 1190 HCWs (median age, 40 years [range, 20-70 years]; 382 men [25.4%]) were enrolled. In patients with cancer, 489 (97.8%) had solid tumors, and 355 (71.0%) had received anticancer treatment within 1 month. Among HCWs, 385 (32.3%) were nurses or assistant nurses, 266 (22.4%) were administrative officers, 197 (16.6%) were researchers, 179 (15.0%) were physicians, 113 (9.5%) were technicians, and 50 (4.2%) were pharmacists. The seroprevalence was 1.0% (95% CI, 0.33%-2.32%) in patients and 0.67% (95% CI, 0.29%-1.32%) in HCWs (P = .48). However, the N-IgG and S-IgG antibody levels were significantly lower in patients than in HCWs (N-IgG: ?, -0.38; 95% CI, -0.55 to -0.21; P < .001; and S-IgG: ?, -0.39; 95% CI, -0.54 to -0.23; P < .001). Additionally, among patients, N-IgG levels were significantly lower in those who received chemotherapy than in those who did not (median N-IgG levels, 0.1 [interquartile range (IQR), 0-0.3] vs 0.1 [IQR, 0-0.4], P = .04). In contrast, N-IgG and S-IgG levels were significantly higher in patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitors than in those who did not (median N-IgG levels: 0.2 [IQR, 0.1-0.5] vs 0.1 [IQR, 0-0.3], P = .02; S-IgG levels: 0.15 [IQR, 0-0.3] vs 0.1[IQR, 0-0.2], P = .02). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of Japanese patients with cancer and HCWs, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies did not differ between the 2 groups; however, findings suggest that comorbid cancer and treatment with systemic therapy, including chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors, may influence the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Difference in SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Status Between Patients With Cancer and Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The aim of this study is to explore factors influencing the study engagement of health and social professions students during the COVID-19 pandemic. While antecedents of study engagement have been studied previously, the factors influencing engagement under pandemic conditions have not yet been investigated. Furthermore, there is a particular need for research among students in health and social professions programs, as these students are particularly affected by the pandemic. As theoretical basis, the study draws on the demands-resources-theory. It is hypothesized that pandemic-related study and personal resources drive engagement during the pandemic, and that pandemic-related demands negatively influence engagement. Method: The study uses a cross-sectional survey to explore the hypothesized effects. The sample consists of 559 university students of health and social professions in Germany. The study was carried out in July 2020, towards the end of the first digital semester and after the first peak in COVID-19 cases. Data are analyzed using linear multiple regression analysis. Results: The findings show that the demands-resources-theory is suitable to explain study engagement even under pandemic conditions. Suitable digital learning formats and social support are identified as important study resources for study engagement during major life events, while emotional resilience, active self-care and academic self-efficacy are identified as important personal resources. Conclusions: Under pandemic conditions academic institutions should focus on providing beneficial teaching formats and innovative ways to support students lacking social networks. Besides, they should consider developing means to help students structuring daily life as well as establishing initiatives to strengthen students' self-efficacy beliefs.

Clopidogrel is commonly used as a short-term adjunct to aspirin after endovascular revascularization, whether clopidogrel modifies the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban has not been described. Methods: VOYAGER PAD was a phase 3, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in symptomatic PAD patients undergoing LER randomized to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus 100 mg aspirin daily or rivaroxaban placebo plus aspirin. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of acute limb ischemia, major amputation of a vascular cause, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke or cardiovascular death. The principal safety endpoint was TIMI major bleeding with ISTH major bleeding a secondary safety outcome. Clopidogrel use was allowed at the discretion of the investigator for up to six months following the qualifying revascularization. Results: 3313 (50.6%) of the randomized patients received clopidogrel, median duration of 29.0 days. Over 3-years the hazard ratio (HR) for the primary outcome of rivaroxaban versus placebo was 0.85 (95% CI 0.71-1.01) with clopidogrel and 0.86 (95% CI 0.73-1.01) without, without statistical heterogeneity (p-interaction =0.92). Rivaroxaban resulted in an early apparent reduction in acute limb ischemia (ALI) within 30 days, HR 0.45 (95%CI 0.14-1.46) with and HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.22-1.01) without clopidogrel (p-interaction = 0.93). Compared with aspirin, rivaroxaban increased TIMI major bleeding similarly regardless of clopidogrel use (p-interaction 0.71). With clopidogrel use >30 days, rivaroxaban was associated with more ISTH major bleeding within 365 days (HR 3.20, 95% CI 1.44-7.13) compared with shorter durations of clopidogrel (p-trend 0.06). Conclusions: In the VOYAGER PAD trial, rivaroxaban plus aspirin reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular and limb events with an early benefit for ALI regardless of clopidogrel use. The safety of rivaroxaban was consistent regardless of clopidogrel use, but with a trend for more ISTH major bleeding with clopidogrel use > 30 days than a shorter duration. These data support the addition of rivaroxaban to aspirin after LER regardless of concomitant clopidogrel with a short (course  30 days) associated with less bleeding.

Photochromic indicators (PCIs) can accurately measure UV-C dose on nonplanar surfaces, but often saturate below doses required to decontaminate porous, multilayered textiles such as N95s. Here, we investigate the use of optical attenuators to extend PCI dynamic range while maintaining a near-ideal angular response - critical for accurate measurements when UV-C is uncollimated. Through an analytical model, we show that tuning attenuator refractive index, attenuation coefficient, and thickness can extend dynamic range, but compromises ideal angular response unless the attenuator is an ideal diffuser. To demonstrate this tradeoff empirically, we pair PCIs with model specular (floated borosilicate) and diffuse (polytetrafluoroethylene) attenuators, characterize the angular response, and evaluate on-N95 UV-C dose measurement accuracy of each PCI-attenuator stack in a UV-C decontamination system. While both borosilicate and polytetrafluoroethylene increase PCI dynamic range>4$\\\\times$, both attenuators introduce angle-dependent transmittance, which causes location-dependent underestimation of UV-C dose. The PCI-borosilicate and PCI-polytetrafluoroethylene stacks underreport true on-N95 dose by 1) 14.7% and 3.6%, respectively, on a surface near-normal to the array of source lamps, and 2) 40.8% and 19.8%, respectively, on a steeply sloped location.

Dyspnea is a common emergency presentation in patients with cancer with a wide range of differential diagnoses, including pulmonary embolism, pleural disease, lymphangitis, and infection, of which SARS-CoV-2 is now a pathogen to be considered. Screening interviews to determine whether patients may be infected with COVID-19 are imperative to prevent the spread of infection, especially within healthcare facilities. Cancer patients testing positive with no or minimal symptoms may be monitored from home. Telemedicine is an option to aid in following patients without potential exposure. Management of complications of systemic anticancer treatment, such as febrile neutropenia (FN), is of particular importance during the COVID-19 pandemic where clinicians aim to minimize patients risk of infection and need for hospital visits. Outpatient management of patients with low-risk FN is a safe and effective strategy. Although the MASCC score has not been validated in patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2, it has nevertheless performed well in patients with a range of infective illnesses and, accordingly, it is reasonable to expect efficacy in the clinical setting of COVID-19. Risk stratification of patients presenting with FN is a vital tenet of the evolving sepsis and pandemic strategy, necessitating access to locally formulated services based on MASCC and other national and international guidelines.

Recently, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging has become more available. However, to date, the usefulness of these imaging modalities using the customary >50% treatment threshold for diameter (multiplanar venography) and area (IVUS) stenosis of iliofemoral veins has not been validated prospectively within the context of clinical improvement. METHODS The multicenter Venogram Versus Intravascular Ultrasound for Diagnosing and Treating Iliofemoral Vein Obstruction (VIDIO) trial prospectively enrolled 100 symptomatic patients (Clinical Etiologic Anatomic Pathophysiologic [CEAP] classification of 4-6) with suspected iliofemoral venous outflow disease. Venous stenting for presumed significant iliofemoral vein stenosis, based on imaging and clinical findings, was performed on 68 patients. Based on imaging, stenosis was characterized as nonthrombotic in 48 patients and post-thrombotic in 20 patients. Each underwent baseline and poststenting venography and IVUS to compare the diagnostic and clinical usefulness of the tests. The revised Venous Clinical Severity Score was used to assess clinical patient outcome. A >4-point reduction in the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score between baseline and 6 months was used as an indicator of clinically meaningful improvement. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the optimal diameter and area thresholds for prediction of clinical improvement. RESULTS Clinical improvement after stenting was best predicted by IVUS baseline measurement of area stenosis (area under the curve, 0.64; P = .04), with >54% estimated as the optimal threshold of stenosis indicating interventional treatment. With measurement of lumen gain from baseline to after the procedure, the optimal reduction in vein stenosis correlative of later clinical improvement was >41%; IVUS measurement of area stenosis was most predictive (area under the curve, 0.70; P = .004). Venographic measurements of baseline stenosis and stenotic change were not predictive of later improvement. In a 48-patient nonthrombotic subset analysis, IVUS diameter rather than area measurements of baseline stenosis were significantly predictive of clinical success, but indicated a higher optimal threshold of stenosis (>61%) may be necessary. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that IVUS shows significant usefulness at predicting when stenting iliofemoral vein stenosis in patients clinical-etiologic-anatomic-pathophysiologic classification of 4-6 will result in significant symptom improvement. Our findings corroborate the conventional >50% cross-sectional area threshold by IVUS as defining a clinically significant iliofemoral stenosis that, when stented, has significant predictive value for symptom improvement. In nonthrombotic patients, however, a threshold of >61% diameter stenosis by IVUS may better predict clinical improvement.","output":"Analysis of threshold stenosis by multiplanar venogram and intravascular ultrasound examination for predicting clinical improvement after iliofemoral vein stenting in the VIDIO trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: : COVID-19 patient experiences in the intensive care unit (ICU) are marked by family separation.

A complete energy framework analysis using the HF/3-21G energy model was performed which found that dispersion forces and C-H...O interactions are responsible for the crystal structure features. The magnetic properties of the complexes show a weak magnetic exchange between spins, resulting in low exchange constants of -2.72 (1) cm-1 and -1.10 (1) cm-1 for complexes (2) and (3), respectively. This results from the low overlap between magnetic orbitals induced by 3,5-dinitrobenzoate bridges and the arrangement of the magnetic orbitals. Consequently, the dinuclear complexes (2) and (3) behave as spin-isolated multinuclear CuII species in contrast to the trinuclear complex with similar ligands.","output":"Intermolecular interaction energies and magnetic properties of spin-isolated multinuclear CuII complexes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic led to development of mRNA vaccines, which became a leading anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunization platform. Preclinical studies are limited to infection-prone animals such as hamsters and monkeys in which protective efficacy of vaccines cannot be fully appreciated. We recently reported a SARS-CoV-2 human Fc-conjugated receptor-binding domain (RBD-hFc) mRNA vaccine delivered via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). BALB/c mice demonstrated specific immunologic responses following RBD-hFc mRNA vaccination. Now, we evaluated the protective effect of this RBD-hFc mRNA vaccine by employing the K18 human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (K18-hACE2) mouse model. Administration of an RBD-hFc mRNA vaccine to K18-hACE2 mice resulted in robust humoral responses comprising binding and neutralizing antibodies. In correlation with this response, 70% of vaccinated mice withstood a lethal SARS-CoV-2 dose, while all control animals succumbed to infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first nonreplicating mRNA vaccine study reporting protection of K18-hACE2 against a lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Lipid Nanoparticle RBD-hFc mRNA Vaccine Protects hACE2 Transgenic Mice against a Lethal SARS-CoV-2 Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several lines of existing evidence support the possibility of airborne transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, quantitative information on the relative importance of transmission pathways of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains limited. To evaluate the relative importance of multiple transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2, we developed a modeling framework and leveraged detailed information available from the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak that occurred in early 2020. We modeled 21,600 scenarios to generate a matrix of solutions across a full range of assumptions for eight unknown or uncertain epidemic and mechanistic transmission factors. A total of 132 model iterations met acceptability criteria (R(2) > 0.95 for modeled vs. reported cumulative daily cases and R(2) > 0 for daily cases). Analyzing only these successful model iterations quantifies the likely contributions of each defined mode of transmission. Mean estimates of the contributions of short-range, long-range, and fomite transmission modes to infected cases across the entire simulation period were 35%, 35%, and 30%, respectively. Mean estimates of the contributions of larger respiratory droplets and smaller respiratory aerosols were 41% and 59%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that aerosol inhalation was likely the dominant contributor to COVID-19 transmission among the passengers, even considering a conservative assumption of high ventilation rates and no air recirculation conditions for the cruise ship. Moreover, close-range and long-range transmission likely contributed similarly to disease progression aboard the ship, with fomite transmission playing a smaller role. The passenger quarantine also affected the importance of each mode, demonstrating the impacts of the interventions.","output":"Mechanistic transmission modeling of COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship demonstrates the importance of aerosol transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efforts to combat the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have placed a renewed focus on the use of transmission electron microscopy for identifying coronavirus in tissues.

We describe morphologic features of coronavirus that distinguish it from subcellular structures, including particle size range (60-140 nm), intracellular particle location within membrane-bound vacuoles, and a nucleocapsid appearing in cross section as dense dots (6-12 nm) within the particles.

The extent to which these disparities are related to socioeconomic versus biologic factors is largely unknown. We investigate the racial and socioeconomic associations of COVID-19 hospitalization among 418,794 participants of the UK Biobank, of whom 549 (0.13%) had been hospitalized. Both black participants (odds ratio 3.4; 95%CI 2.4-4.9) and Asian participants (odds ratio 2.1; 95%CI 1.5-3.2) were at substantially increased risk as compared to white participants. We further observed a striking gradient in COVID-19 hospitalization rates according to the Townsend Deprivation Index - a composite measure of socioeconomic deprivation - and household income. Adjusting for such factors led to only modest attenuation of the increased risk in black participants, adjusted odds ratio 3.1 (95%CI 2.0-4.8). These observations confirm and extend earlier preliminary and lay press reports of higher morbidity in non-white individuals in the context of a large population of participants in a national biobank.

In fact, many methods have been used to recognize the Covid-19 infection including Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), X-ray scan and CT-scan. In addition to the recognition of the Covid-19 infection, CT-scans can provide more important information about the evolution of this disease and its severity. With the extensive number of Covid-19 infections, estimating the Covid-19 percentage can help the intensive care to free up the resuscitation beds for the critical cases and follow other protocol for less severity cases. In this paper, we propose Covid-19 percentage estimation database. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of three Covolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures which are ResneXt-50, Densenet-161 and Inception-v3. For the three CNN architectures, we use two loss functions which are MSE and Dynamic Huber. In addition, two pretrained scenarios are investigated (ImageNet pretrained models and X-ray pretrained models).

Long COVID can also manifest as prolonged fatigue, which may be linked to neuromuscular function impairment (NMFI). The current clinical assessment for NCVI monitors neurocardiovascular performance upon the application of orthostatic stressors such as an active (i.e. self-induced) stand or a passive (tilt table) standing test. Lower limb muscle contractions may be important in orthostatic recovery via the skeletal muscle pump. In this study, adults with long COVID were assessed with a protocol that, in addition to the standard NCVI tests, incorporated simultaneous lower limb muscle monitoring for NMFI assessment. To accomplish such an investigation, a wide range of continuous non-invasive biomedical technologies were employed, including digital artery photoplethysmography for the extraction of cardiovascular signals, near-infrared spectroscopy for the extraction of regional tissue oxygenation in brain and muscle, and electromyography for assessment of timed muscle contractions in the lower limbs. With the novel technique described and exemplified in this paper, we were able to integrate signals from all instruments used in the assessment in a precisely synchronized fashion. We demonstrate that it is possible to visualize the interactions between all different physiological signals during the combined NCVI/NMFI assessment. Multiple counts of evidence were collected, which can capture the dynamics between skeletal muscle contractions and neurocardiovascular responses. The proposed multimodal data visualization can offer an overview of the functioning of the muscle pump during both supine rest and orthostatic recovery and can conduct comparison studies with signals from multiple participants at any given time in the assessment. This could help researchers and clinicians generate and test hypotheses based on the multimodal inspection of raw data, in long COVID and other clinical cohorts.","output":"A novel methodology for the synchronous collection and multimodal visualisation of continuous neurocardiovascular and neuromuscular physiological data in adults with long COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China is one of the worlds leading consumer markets for wildlife products, yet there is little understanding of how demand will change in the future. In this study, we investigate the consumptive habits and attitudes of the millennial Juilinghou demographic C a subset of society in China with the potential to substantially influence future demand for wildlife products. We surveyed 350 Chinese university students across Harbin and Beijing, China, and found that the intended future consumption of wildlife products was relatively low in this population but with a strong orientation towards wildlife products with medicinal properties. Seventy percent of those respondents who had used and/or intended to use wildlife products were willing to try substitutes, but this was heavily dependent on their price (cheaper) and quality.

METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting with ACS at 18 Centers in Northern-Italy during the Covid-19 outbreak were included. In-hospital all-cause death was the primary outcome. In-hospital cardiovascular death along with mechanical and electrical complications were the secondary ones. A case period (February 20, 2020-May 3, 2020) was compared vs. same-year (January 1-February 19, 2020) and previous-year control periods (February 20-May 3, 2019). ACS patients with Covid-19 were further compared with those without. RESULTS: Among 779 ACS patients admitted during the case period, 67 (8.6%) tested positive for Covid-19. In-hospital all-cause mortality was significantly higher during the case period compared to the control periods (6.4% vs. 3.5% vs. 4.4% respectively; p 0.026), but similar after excluding patients with COVID-19 (4.5% vs. 3.5% vs. 4.4%; p 0.73). Cardiovascular mortality was similar between the study groups. After multivariable adjustment, admission for ACS during the COVID-19 outbreak had no impact on in-hospital mortality. In the case period, patients with concomitant ACS and Covid-19 experienced significantly higher in-hospital mortality (25% vs. 5%, p < 0.001) compared to patients without. Moreover, higher rates of cardiovascular death, cardiogenic shock and sustained ventricular tachycardia were found in Covid-19 patients. CONCLUSION: ACS patients presenting during the Covid-19 pandemic experienced increased all-cause mortality, driven by Covid-19 positive status due to higher rates of cardiogenic shock and sustained ventricular tachycardia. No differences in cardiovascular mortality compared to non-pandemic scenarios were reported.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and infection on in hospital survival for patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes: A multicenter registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Twitter engagement between surgeons provides opportunities for international discussion of research and clinical practice. Understanding how surgical tweet chats work is important at a time when increasing reliance is being placed on virtual engagement because of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Individual tweets from the May 2019 #BJSConnect tweet chat were extracted using NodeXL, complemented by Twitter searches in an internet browser to identify responses that had not used the hashtag. Aggregate estimates of tweet views were obtained from a third-party social media tool (Twitonomy) and compared with official Twitter Analytics measurements. RESULTS: In total 37 Twitter accounts posted 248 tweets or replies relating to the tweet chat. A further 110 accounts disseminated the tweets via retweeting. Only 58.5 per cent of these tweets and 35 per cent of the tweeters were identified through a search for the #BJSConnect hashtag. The rest were identified by searching for replies (61), quoting tweets (20), and posts by @BJSurgery that used the hashtag but did not appear in the Twitter search (22). Studying all tweets revealed complex branching discussions that went beyond the discussed paper's findings. Third-party estimates of potential reach of the tweet chat were greatly exaggerated. CONCLUSION: Understanding the extent of the discussion generated by the #BJSConnect tweet chat required looking beyond the hashtag to identify replies and other responses, which was time-consuming.

This study is based on acceleration and heart rate to build linear regression and back propagate neural network prediction model of Tabata energy expenditure, and compare the accuracy of the two models. Participants (n = 45; Mean age: 21.04  2.39 years) were randomly assigned to the modeling and validation data set in a 3:1 ratio. Each participant simultaneously wore four accelerometers (dominant hand, non-dominant hand, right hip, right ankle), a heart rate band and a metabolic measurement system to complete Tabata exercise test.

This model provides an excellent fit to the existing data for 46 countries with 10,000+ cases by 16 May 2020, five continents and the entire world. Hence, the model has largely captured the transmission patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak under a variety of intervention and control measures.

Our model suggests that it is possible to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic by the end of 2020 through achieving a high damping rate (0.0615 d(?1)). However, the global damping rate is rather low (0.0504 d(?1) before 26 April) and has dropped even further since late April (0.0168 d(?1)).

Thus, we investigated the genotypic diversity and epidemiology of HRV in children with SARI in China over a 2-year period. In total 1,003, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children hospitalized with SARI in Shanghai from 2013 to 2015. HRV was screened for by a PCR method targeting the viral 5 UTR and was genotyped by sequencing of the VP4CVP2 region of the HRV genome. We also screened for 15 other common respiratory viruses to assess the prevalence of co-infection with HRV. The patient demographic and clinical data were reviewed. HRV was detected in 280 (27.9%) of the 1,003 specimens: HRV-A in 140 (14.0%), HRV-B in 21 (2.1%), HRV-C in 56 (5.6%), and HRV-untyped in 63 (6.3%). A phylogenetic analysis identified 77 genotypes (43 HRV-A, 10 HRV-B, and 24 HRV-C), among which A78, A12, A89, B70, C2, C6, and C24 predominated.

This may account for some of the diversity in clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe COVID-19. Although age is a risk factor for COVID-19, how age affects SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses remains unknown. We found that some pre-existing T cell responses to specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins, Spike (S) and Nucleoprotein (N), were significantly lower in elderly donors (>70 years old) who were seronegative for S than in young donors. However, substantial pre-existing T cell responses to the viral membrane (M) protein were detected in some elderly donors. These responses likely compensate for loss of T cell responses specific to S and N. In contrast, young and elderly donors exhibited comparable T cell responses to S, N, and M proteins after infection with SARS-CoV-2. M-specific responses were mediated by CD4 T cells producing interferon-gamma in both seronegative and seropositive individuals. T cells in seronegative elderly donors responded to various M-derived peptides, while the response after SARS-CoV-2 infection was apparently focused on a single peptide. These data suggest that diversity of target antigen repertoire for pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells declines with age, but the magnitude of pre-existing T cell responses is maintained by T cells reactive to specific viral proteins such as M.

METHODS: A convenience sample of patients aged 75 years or older admitted to a non-geriatric ward were recruited between May 2017 and April 2019. The Interpersonal Geriatric care relationship (InteGer) tool was used to identify elements of the IPCR and was completed by the researchers through structured patient interviews. RESULTS: The mean total scale score for frequency was 3.74 (SD 1.51) [range 0-12]. On subscale level, the highest mean score was in the accessibility and the lowest mean score in the humanization subscale. Statistically significant differences between the hypothesized and experienced disturbance were observed in 18 of the 30 items. Ten items score in the category 'no action needed' (not occurring, not disturbing), nine items in the category 'remain attentive for patient experiences' (occurring, not disturbing), 10 items in the category 'further analyses or monitoring needed' (not occurring, disturbing) and one item in the category 'urgent action needed' (occurring and disturbing). CONCLUSION: Participants report mostly positive experiences related to the four subscales of the InteGer, that is, humanization, attentiveness, interest and accessibility.

SETTING: The original sampling frame was based on 13 out of 27 provinces in 1993, representing 83% of the Indonesian population. PARTICIPANTS: We included respondents aged 50 years and above in 2007, excluding those who did not participate in both Waves 4 and 5. The total number of participants in this study are 3678 respondents. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We examined three main outcomes; health service use (outpatient and inpatient care), financial burden (catastrophic health expenditure) and productivity loss (labour participation, days primary activity missed, days confined in bed). We applied multilevel mixed-effects regression models to assess the associations between NCD multimorbidity and outcome variables, RESULTS: Women were more likely to have NCD multimorbidity than men and the prevalence of NCD multimorbidity increased with higher socioeconomic status. NCD multimorbidity was associated with a higher number of outpatient visits (compared with those without NCD, incidence rate ratio (IRR) 4.25, 95% CI 3.33 to 5.42 for individuals with >3 NCDs) and inpatient visits (IRR 3.68, 95% CI 2.21 to 6.12 for individuals with >3 NCDs). NCD multimorbidity was also associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing catastrophic health expenditure (for >3 NCDs, adjusted OR (aOR) 1.69, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.81) and lower participation in the labour force (aOR 0.23, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.33) compared with no NCD. CONCLUSIONS: NCD multimorbidity is associated with substantial direct and indirect costs to individuals, households and the wider society. Our study highlights the importance of preparing health systems for addressing the burden of multimorbidity in low-income and middle-income countries.","output":"Impact of non-communicable disease multimorbidity on health service use, catastrophic health expenditure and productivity loss in Indonesia: a population-based panel data analysis study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac PET/MR imaging is an integrated imaging approach that requires less radiation than PET/computed tomography and combines the high spatial resolution and morphologic data from MR imaging with the physiologic information from PET.

Once the elective medical services are restored, a technical and ethical strategy becomes critical to select candidate patients for elective surgery. Objective: To describe the results from the implementation of MeNTS (Medically Necessary Timesensitive Procedures), FI-CGA, and survey on COVID-19 symptoms Scales, as methods for the selection of patients who were candidates for elective surgery during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in a third level institution in Cali, Colombia. Methods: The databases of the results on the administration of MeNTS, frailty index (FI-CGA) and COVID 19 symptoms scales in patients who were candidates for elective surgery in a third level clinic in Cali city, between March 1st and August 31st, 2020 were reviewed. Results: A total of 1,044 patients were included, of which 647 (62.0 %) were females, with a median age of 52 years (interquartile range [IQR] 38-62). 98 % of the patients were asymptomatic, the overall median score for MeNTS was 48 (IQR 44-52) and the average for FI-CGA was 0.0 (standard deviation 0.1). Conclusions: MeNTS, FI-CGA and the Symptoms Survey are easily accessible scales amidst the pandemic and are helpful to select patients with intermediate and low risk of perioperative morbidity in elective surgery during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Further studies are required to confirm these findings and to clarify the potential of these tools in the selection of patients that meet the high-risk criteria.

RECENT FINDINGS: The first level is a green zone representing a safe space (to proceed), where any hazards are controlled, latent or undetectable. The second is an amber zone, where hazards are known to be present, but one can proceed with caution and increased vigilance, and where defences are used to prevent escalation to a crisis. In the red phase -- a state of crisis -- a hazard is realized, clear and present. This is a time to decide what actions are required to mitigate the threat. Next, a blue phase refers to a life-threatening emergency, where the system is unstable, harm is evident and compounding upon itself, and immediate rescue action is needed to avert an irreversible outcome. Finally, dark grey represents the aftermath, where the situation has either stabilized or progressed to its final outcome, a time to reflect and learn.

Analyses of pathological lesions at different times offer a good opportunity to better understand the disease and how its evolution has been influenced mostly by new SARS-CoV-2 variants or the different therapeutic approaches. In this short report we summarize responses collected from a questionnaire survey that investigated important pathological data during the first two pandemic waves (spring-summer 2020; autumn-winter 2020C2021). The survey was submitted to expert lung pathologists from nine European countries involved in autoptic procedures in both pandemic waves. The frequency of each lung lesion was quite heterogeneous among the participants. However, a higher frequency of pulmonary superinfections, both bacterial and especially fungal, was observed in the second wave compared to the first. Obtaining a deeper knowledge of the pathological lesions at the basis of this complex and severe disease, which change over time, is crucial for correct patient management and treatment.

COVID-19 has further raised their public profile and emphasised the need to deliver better, faster, more efficient trials for patient benefit. Considerable overlap exists between data required for trials and data already collected routinely in electronic healthcare records (EHRs). Opportunities exist to use these in innovative ways to decrease duplication of effort and speed trial recruitment, conduct and follow-up. APPROACH: The National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), Health Data Research UK and Clinical Practice Research Datalink co-organised a national workshop to accelerate the agenda for data-enabled clinical trials. Showcasing successful examples and imagining future possibilities, the plenary talks, panel discussions, group discussions and case studies covered: design/feasibility; recruitment; conduct/follow-up; collecting benefits/harms; and analysis/interpretation. REFLECTION: Some notable studies have successfully accessed and used EHR to identify potential recruits, support randomised trials, deliver interventions and supplement/replace trial-specific follow-up. Some outcome measures are already reliably collected; others, like safety, need detailed work to meet regulatory reporting requirements. There is a clear need for system interoperability and a route map to identify and access the necessary datasets. Researchers running regulatory-facing trials must carefully consider how data quality and integrity would be assessed. An experience-sharing forum could stimulate wider adoption of EHR-based methods in trial design and execution. DISCUSSION: EHR offer opportunities to better plan clinical trials, assess patients and capture data more efficiently, reducing research waste and increasing focus on each trials specific challenges. The short-term emphasis should be on facilitating patient recruitment and for postmarketing authorisation trials where research-relevant outcome measures are readily collectable. Sharing of case studies is encouraged. The workshop directly informed NIHRs funding call for ambitious data-enabled trials at scale. There is the opportunity for the UK to build upon existing data science capabilities to identify, recruit and monitor patients in trials at scale.","output":"Realising the full potential of data-enabled trials in the UK: a call for action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe infection with human adenovirus (HAdV) is uncommon in adults, and the lack of reliable point-of-care testing makes the diagnosis challenging.

Methods Surveys were distributed electronically to U.S. PEM fellows and PDs from March to April 2020. Fellows and PDs were queried on program research infrastructure and current gaps in fellow research experience. For programs that had at least one fellow and PD response, each fellow response was compared to their PD's corresponding response (reference standard). For each binary survey item, we determined the percent of responses with agreement between the fellow and PD. Results Of 79 fellowship programs, 70 (89%) were represented with at least one response, including responses from 59 PDs (75%) and 218 fellows (39% of all fellows, representing 80% of programs). Fellows and PDs identified mentorship and faculty engagement as the most important needs for successful fellowship research; for every one fellow there was a median of 0.8 potential faculty mentors in the division.

Greater understanding of patient perceptions is important in order to inform future integrated care models involving telehealth. Design/methodology/approach: An interpretative qualitative study. Fifteen, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with diverse range of community dwelling patients who attended outpatient clinics at The John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Findings: Key themes were identified: (1) telehealth is valuable in a pandemic;(2) telehealth accessibility can be challenging;(3) there are variations in care experiences, especially when visual feedback is lacking;(4) telehealth for acute and complex care needs may lead to gaps and (5) considerations towards the future of telehealth, beyond a pandemic. Research limitations/implications: There is a shortfall in evidence of the patient experience of integrated care within a telehealth framework. The results provided practical insights into how telehealth services can play a greater role in integrated care. Practical implications: Apart from the need for affordable access to high-speed data for basic Internet access, the author posit the need for patient and clinician training towards promoting communication that is underpinned by choice, trust and shared decision-making. Originality/value: Telehealth is important towards keeping patients safe during COVID-19. Key findings extend knowledge of the practical implications need to promote integrated telehealth systems. While there is a benefit in extending telehealth to more preventative activities, there is also a need for greater service coordination and sharing of information between treating clinicians.

In the acute setting, patients can present with severe ischemia of either the upper or lower limb, and urgent surgical intervention is often required to avoid severe debilitation and limb loss. PATIENTS: Our case series comprised three patients who presented with upper and lower limb ischemia and were found to have concomitant malignancy. All three patients were female, with a median age of 54.3 years, and none of the patients was on active chemotherapy. One presented with stage IIb uterine carcinoma, one with stage IIIb ovarian carcinoma, and the other with stage IIIb cervical carcinoma. These patients were referred for vascular management, with two being acute and the other acute on chronic. RESULTS: Of the three patients, two presented with acute limb ischemia and underwent arterial thrombectomy, one of the upper and the other the lower limb. The third patient, with acute-on-chronic upper limb ischemia, was treated conservatively with intravenous heparin followed by oral anticoagulation. All three had limb salvage and survival outcome at 1 year post-treatment. CONCLUSION: In this small series, surgical intervention in two patients and conservative management in the other patient led to limb salvage with a reasonably good quality of life. Even though the long-term survival for patients with malignant disease is generally poor, surgical intervention can achieve limb salvage with a reasonably good quality of life.","output":"Arterial Embolism in Malignancy: The Role of Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate bidirectional associations between (prolonged) sitting time and sleep duration in 12- to 14-year-old adolescents using a between-subjects and within-subjects analyses approach. METHODS: Observational data were used from 108 adolescents (53% girls; mean age 12.9 (SD 0.7) years) from six schools in Flanders, Belgium. The Axivity AX3 triaxial accelerometer, worn on the thigh, was used to assess daily total sitting time and daily time spent in sedentary bouts of 30 min (as a proxy for prolonged sitting time). The Fitbit Charge 3 was used to assess nightly sleep duration. Both monitors were worn on schooldays only (ranging from 4 to 5 days). Linear mixed models were conducted to analyse the associations, resulting in four models. In each model, the independent variable (sleep duration, sitting time or prolonged sitting time) was included as within- as well as between-subjects factor. RESULTS: Within-subjects analyses showed that when the adolescents sat more and when the adolescents spent more time sitting in bouts of 30 min than they usually did on a given day, they slept less during the following night (p = 0.01 and p = 0.05 (borderline significant), respectively). These associations were not significant in the other direction. Between-subjects analyses showed that adolescents who slept more on average, spent less time sitting (p = 0.006) and less time sitting in bouts of 30 min (p = 0.004) compared with adolescents who slept less on average. Conversely, adolescents who spent more time sitting on average and adolescents who spent more time sitting in bouts of 30 min on average, slept less (p = 0.02 and p = 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the between-subjects analyses, interventions focusing on reducing or regularly breaking up sitting time could improve adolescents sleep duration on a population level, and vice versa. However, the within-subjects association was only found in one direction and suggests that to sleep sufficiently during the night, adolescents might limit and regularly break up their sitting time the preceding day.

Image recognition algorithms based on deep learning are an effective method to assist epidemic detection. However, COVID-19 medical image data has the problems of difficulty in obtaining case samples and high data labeling costs. Contrastive learning algorithm is the best performing method among self-supervised learning algorithms without label training. To solve the problem of insufficient annotation data for COVID-19 medical images, this paper proposes a contrastive learning algorithm that incorporates feature synthesis components of hard negative samples. The feature of hard negative samples is a key factor to promote network training among a large number of negative samples features. Generating more hard negative samples features and adding them to the contrastive loss function for calculation allows the comparison learning algorithm to learn better semantic features. At the same time, the contrastive learning algorithm proposed in this paper is used in the transfer learning of COVID-19 CT images, which can deal with the problem of large differences between the original domain and the target domain. The algorithm proposed in this paper uses common methods of self-supervised learning to evaluate the classification accuracy of 0.798 on the COVID-CT data set, which has a significant improvement.

Birth stories have frequently been used as a way for women to describe their experiences with the birthing process. In this uncertain time, birth stories can provide valuable insight into how pregnancy and birth stressors during a pandemic can impact the patient's overall experience. This study sought to describe and understand pregnant and new mothers' lived experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Researchers extracted relevant YouTube birth stories using predetermined search terms and inclusion criteria. The mothers' birth stories were narrated in their second or third trimester or those who had recently given birth during the study period. Birth stories were analyzed using an inductive and deductive approach to capture different aspects of the birthing experience. Results Overall, eighty-three birth stories were analyzed. Within these birth stories, four broad themes and twelve subthemes emerged. Key themes included a sense of loss, hospital experiences, experiences with healthcare providers, and unique experiences during birth and postpartum. The birth stories revealed negative and positive birth experiences. Particularly, mothers were frustrated with constantly changing policies within the healthcare setting that negatively affected their birthing experience. On the other hand, support from healthcare professionals, having their partners in the delivery room, and having a positive mindset was instrumental in having a positive birth experience.

This pandemic has brought the world to a standstill and threatened human lives. Many methods are known to date to detect this virus. Due to their relative sensitivity, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays are the most frequently applied and considered the gold standard. However, due to the rapid mutation rate of the viral genome and the emergence of new variants, existing protocols need to be updated and improved. Designing a fast and accurate PCR-based assay is of great importance for the early detection of this virus and more efficient control of the spread of this disease. This study describes a fast, reliable, easy-to-use, and high-throughput multiplex SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR detection method. The assay was designed to detect two viral genes (N and RdRP) and a human gene (RP) simultaneously. The performance and the sensitivity of the assay were tested in 28 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples and compared with commercial kits, which showed 100% positive percent agreement with a limit of detection (LOD) value of 1.40 and 0.81 copies/L or 35.13 and 20.31 copies/reaction for RdRP and N genes, respectively.

Precepting NP students using telehealth follows similar principles as in-person teaching, but some modifications and additional considerations are needed to transition to the virtual environment. At a time when many NPs have swiftly adapted to telehealth in practice, this article will offer a brief \\"how-to\\" for teleprecepting. Prior to COVID-19, teleprecepting was piloted with less than 2% of NP students in the school's pilot teleprecepting project. Seven months after the initial surge of cases and restrictions, 72% of students (n = 151) in the family nurse practitioner, psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, and pediatric nurse practitioner specialties had transitioned to teleprecepting. This project was implemented rapidly during the pandemic, and thus, evaluations comparing competency outcomes and experiences of students and preceptors are still in process. Additionally, feasibility of this educational model may change as telehealth regulations continue to evolve. COVID-19 poses challenges for both patient care and clinical training of NP students across specialties. With some adaptation, clinical placements can be transitioned to the virtual environment of telehealth.

A deep mutational scan of ACE2 expressed on human cells identified mutations that increase S affinity and guided the engineering of a potent and broad soluble receptor decoy. A deep mutational scan of the RBD displayed on the surface of yeast has revealed residues tolerant of mutational changes that may act as a source for drug resistance and antigenic drift.

The results showed that GCs in soil can be removed by modified Fenton-like processes (removal efficiency gt; 70% for 24 h).

They are typically analyzed as protein concentrates or isolates, the latter usually obtained by isoelectric precipitation or diafiltration. Despite generally lower solubility, as compared to their animal counterparts (lactoglobulins, caseins, albumins, etc.), the plant seed proteins are also capable of lowering surface tension and forming viscoelastic adsorbed layers. Many seed proteins serve mostly as amino acids reservoirs for the future seedling (storage proteins), hence their instantaneous amphiphilicity is not always sufficient to induce strong adsorption at the aqueous-air interface. They can be, however, conveniently unfolded, hydrolyzed and/or chemically/enzymatically modified to expose more hydrophilic or hydrophobic patches. As shown in numerous contributions reviewed below, the resulting shift of the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance can boost their surface activity to the level comparable to that of many animal proteins or low molecular weight surfactants. An important advantage of the plant seed proteins over the animal ones is their much lower environmental cost and abundance in many plants (e.g. ~40% in sunflower or soybean seeds).","output":"Surface tension of native and modified plant seed proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans have been plagued by the scourge of invasion by pathogens leading to infectious diseases from the time in memoriam and are still the cause of morbidity and mortality among millions of individuals. Trying to understand the disease mechanisms and finding the remedial measures have been the quest of humankind. The susceptibility to disease of an individual in a given population is determined by ones genetic buildup. Response to treatment and the disease prognosis also depends upon individuals genetic predisposition. The environmental stress induces mutations and is leading to the emergence of ever-increasing more dreaded infectious pathogens, and now we are in the era of increasing antibiotic resistance that has thrown up a challenge to find new treatment regimes. Discoveries in the science of high-throughput sequencing and array technologies have shown new hope and are bringing a revolution in human health. The information gained from sequencing of both human and pathogen genomes is a way forward in deciphering host-pathogen interactions. Deciphering the pathogen virulence factors, host susceptibility genes, and the molecular programs involved in the pathogenesis of disease has paved the way for discovery of new molecular targets for drugs, diagnostic markers, and vaccines. The genomic diversity in the human population leads to differences in host responses to drugs and vaccines and is the cause of poor response to treatment as well as adverse reactions. The study of pharmacogenomics of infectious diseases is still at an early stage of development, and many intricacies of the host-pathogen interaction are yet to be understood in full measure. However, progress has been made over the decades of research in some of the important infectious diseases revealing how the host genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters affect the bioavailability of the drugs which further determine the efficacy and toxicology of the drugs used for treatment. Further, the field of structural biology and chemistry has intertwined to give rise to medical structural genomics leading the way to the discovery of new drug targets against infectious diseases.

Proteasome subunit alpha type 2 (PSMA2) is a cellular protein highly expressed in IAV-infected human lung epithelial A549 cells. PSMA2 is part of the 20S proteasome complex that degrades or recycles defective proteins and involves proteolytic modification of many cellular regulatory proteins. However, the role of PSMA2 in IAV replication is not well understood. In this study, PSMA2 knockdown (KD) in A549 cells caused a significant reduction in extracellular progeny IAV, but intracellular viral protein translation and viral RNA transcription were not affected. This indicates that PSMA2 is a critical host factor for IAV maturation. To better understand the interplay between PSMA2 KD and IAV infection at the proteomic level, we used the SomaScan 1.3K version, which measures 1,307 proteins to analyze alterations induced by these treatments. We found seven cellular signaling pathways, including phospholipase C signaling, Pak signaling, and nuclear factor erythroid 2p45-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress response signaling, that were inhibited by IAV infection but significantly activated by PSMA2 KD. Further analysis of NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response signaling indicated IAV inhibits accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but ROS levels significantly increased during IAV infection in PSMA2 KD cells. However, IAV infection caused significantly higher NFR2 nuclear translocation that was inhibited in PSMA2 KD cells. This indicates that PSMA2 is required for NRF2-mediated ROS neutralization and that IAV uses PSMA2 to escape viral clearance via the NRF2-mediated cellular oxidative response.

The cellular processes that promote and inhibit IAV infection and pathogenesis remain only partially understood. PSMA2 is a critical component of the 20S proteasome and ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is important in the replication of numerous viruses. This study examined host protein responses to IAV infection alone, PSMA2 knockdown alone, and IAV infection in the presence of PSMA2 knockdown and determined that interfering with PSMA2 function affected IAV maturation.

Previous studies have also established the presence of NA in filamentous fungi and some mosses, whereas an analogue of NA was inferred in an archaeon. More recently, opine-type metallophores with homology to NA were uncovered in bacteria, especially in human pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Yersinia pestis, synthesizing respectively staphylopine, pseudopaline and yersinopine. Here, we review the current state of knowledge regarding the discovery, biosynthesis, function and regulation of these metallophores. We also discuss the genomic environment of the cntL gene, which is homologous to the plant NA synthase (NAS) gene, and plays a central role in the synthesis of NA-like metallophores. This reveals a large diversity of biosynthetic, export and import pathways. Using sequence similarity networks, we uncovered that these metallophores are widespread in numerous bacteria thriving in very different environments, such as those living at the host-pathogen interface, but also in the soil. We additionally established a phylogeny of the NAS/cntL gene and, as a result, we propose that this gene is an ancient gene and NA, or its derivatives, is an ancient metallophore that played a prominent role in metal acquisition or metal resistance. Indeed, our phylogenetic analysis suggests an evolutionary model where the possibility to synthesize this metallophore was present early in the appearance of life, although it was later lost by most living microorganisms, unless facing metal starvation such as at the host-pathogen interface or in some soils.

Informal providers (IPs) who practise allopathic medicine are part of India's pluralistic health system legacy. They outnumber formal providers but operate in a policy environment of unclear legitimacy, creating unique challenges for antibiotic stewardship. Using a systems approach we analysed the multiple intrinsic (provider specific) and extrinsic (community, health and regulatory system and pharmaceutical industry) drivers of antibiotic provision by IPs in rural West Bengal, to inform the design of community stewardship interventions. We surveyed 291 IPs in randomly selected village clusters in two contrasting districts and conducted in-depth interviews with 30 IPs and 17 key informants including pharmaceutical sales representatives, managers and wholesalers/retailers; medically qualified private and public doctors and health and regulatory officials. Eight focus group discussions were conducted with community members. We found a mosaic or bricolage of informal practices conducted by IPs, qualified doctors and industry stakeholders that sustained private enterprise and supplemented the weak public health sector. IPs' intrinsic drivers included misconceptions about the therapeutic necessity of antibiotics, and direct and indirect economic benefits, though antibiotics were not the most profitable category of drug sales. Private doctors were a key source of IPs' learning, often in exchange for referrals. IPs constituted a substantial market for local and global pharmaceutical companies that adopted aggressive business strategies to exploit less-saturated rural markets. Paradoxically, the top-down nature of regulations produced a regulatory impasse wherein regulators were reluctant to enforce heavy sanctions for illegal sales, fearing an adverse impact on rural healthcare, but could not implement enabling strategies to improve antibiotic provision due to legal barriers. We discuss the implications for a multi-stakeholder antibiotic stewardship strategy in this setting.","output":"What are the challenges for antibiotic stewardship at the community level?

Attempts in this area tend to develop new forms to make their applications more convenient and wider. Here, we propose a novel Chinese herb microneedle (CHMN) patch by integrating the herbal extracts, Premna microphylla and Centella asiatica, with microstructure of microneedle for wound healing. Such path is composed of sap extracted from the herbal leaves via traditional kneading method and solidified by plant ash derived from the brine induced process of tofu in a well-designed mold. Because the leaves of the Premna microphylla are rich in pectin and various amino acids, the CHMN could be imparted with medicinal efficacy of heat clearing, detoxicating, detumescence and hemostatic. Besides, with the excellent pharmaceutical activity of Asiatic acid extracted from Centella asiatica, the CHMN is potential in promoting relevant growth factor genes expression in fibroblasts and showing excellent performance in anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial activity. Taking advantages of these pure herbal compositions, we have demonstrated that the derived CHMN was with dramatical achievement in anti-bacteria, inhibiting inflammatory, collagen deposition, angiogenesis and tissue reconstruction during the wound closure.

A recent strategy to achieve this goal is formation of stable co-amorphous solid dispersions with co-formers of low molecular weight. Here, the amorphization strategy was applied for low-soluble anti-hypertensive valsartan (VAL), an angiotensin II receptor blocker, and nicotinamide, which exhibits lung- and cardio-protective effects. Through interactions with the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system, VAL may be used to treat both hypertension and the current pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using mechanochemical and liquid- and solid-state approaches, solvated co-amorphous solid dispersions of VAL with nicotinamide were obtained. They were characterized by spectroscopic, thermal, and X-ray analyses. The density functional theory, quantum theory of atoms in molecules, and non-covalent interaction index calculations revealed the presence of two types of hydrogen bonds between VAL and NIC (i.e., N-HO and O-HO). One of them had a partially covalent character, which caused conformational changes in the flexible VAL molecule, restricting contribution of the tetrazolyl N-H donor and thus limiting the possibility of co-crystal formation. The recognized VAL/NIC1- and VAL/NIC2-type heterodimeric interactions were responsible for the excellent durability of the solid compositions and up to 24-fold better solubility than VAL alone. The synthesized dispersions constitute a new class of dually acting drugs, containing an active pharmaceutical ingredient (VAL) and supporting nutraceutical (nicotinamide).","output":"Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Formation of Co-amorphous Valsartan/Nicotinamide Compositions of High Solubility and Durability with Anti-hypertension and Anti-COVID-19 Potential"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Rehabilitation experts play an important role in preventing hospital-acquired debility, increasing patients' abilities to safely perform activities of daily living, and facilitating discharge to the home setting for patients with COVID-19.

METHODS: We use data from participants of the INCAP Longitudinal Study 1969C2018 (n = 1258) from Guatemala. We use the MacArthur ladder for two measures of SSS - perceived community respect and perceived economic status. We estimate the association of SSS with health outcomes after adjusting for early life characteristics and life course objective SEP (wealth, schooling, employment) using linear regression. We use path analysis to study the extent of mediation by SSS on the health outcomes of body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)), psychological distress (using the WHO Self-Reported Questionnaire; SRQ-20) and happiness, using the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS). RESULTS: Median participant rating was 5 [IQR: 3C8] for the perceived community respect and 3 [IQR: 1C5] for the perceived economic status, with no differences by sex. Objective SEP in early life and adulthood were predictive of both measures of SSS in middle adulthood as well as health outcomes (BMI, SRQ-20 and SHS). Perceived community respect (z-scores; 1 z = 3.1 units) was positively associated with happiness (0.13, 95 % CI: 0.07, 0.19). Perceived economic status (z-scores; 1 z = 2.3 units) was inversely associated with psychological distress (?0.28, 95 % CI: ?0.47, ?0.09). Neither measure of SSS was associated with BMI. Neither perceived community respect nor perceived economic status attenuated associations of objective SEP with health outcomes on inclusion as a mediator.

METHODS: Here, we describe five individuals from four unrelated families with an undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder in which we performed exome sequencing, on a combination of trio-based (4 subjects) or single probands (1 subject). RESULTS: We identified five patients from four unrelated families with homozygous ZNF526 variants by whole exome sequencing.

INTRODUCTION: Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is largely offered for symptomatic relief. The ORBIT registry has shown that patients with a higher EHRA class and lower quality of life (QoL) scores (AFEQT score <65.7) are more likely to suffer emergency hospital admissions. To help prevent unplanned AF admissions and to best utilise the reduced capacity for elective work during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become even more important to prioritise the most symptomatic AF patients for ablation. Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of a subjective symptom-based clinician prioritisation schema compared to objective patient-completed quality of life (QoL) scores. Methods: In July 2020, all elective cases awaiting AF ablation at our institution were categorised by their cardiologist as either category 1 (C1-urgent), category 2 (C2Cpriority, procedure to be done during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) or category 3 (C3Croutine, procedure may be delayed until post pandemic). This categorisation was based on review of clinic letters where EHRA AF symptom class or PROMS are not routinely recorded. All patients in C2 and C3 were then posted an AF specific (AFEQT) and a generic (EQ5D) QoL questionnaire to complete. Physicians were blinded to patient responses on the QoL questionnaires. Results: Details of physician prioritisation and completed questionnaires were available for 85 patients (62  10 years, PAF in 61%, males 66%). The 18 patients that had been categorised in C2 (priority) group were found to have a significantly lower AFEQT score (30.4, IQR 17.2-51.9) compared to the 67 patients classed in C3 (routine) group (56.5, IQR 32.1-74.1; p < 0.01)(Figure 1a). EQ5D scores also tended to be lower in the C2 patients (0.7, IQR 0.4-0.8) compared to C3 (0.8, IQR 0.6-0.9; p = 0.056) (Figure 1c). 16 (89%) patients in C2 had significant AF-related impact on QoL (as defined as AFEQT score <65.7) compared to 42 (63%) of patients in C3. However, there was significant overlap between groups (Figure 1b). 4 patients in C3 had unplanned AF related hospital admissions while awaiting ablation, as compared to none in C2. The median AFEQT score of these 4 patients was 23.3, indicating that they were highly symptomatic despite being classified in C3 by their cardiologist. Conclusion : Physician assessments are moderately accurate in prioritising patients awaiting AF ablation. The addition of formal patient-completed QoL assessment such as with AFEQT, helps to identify the most symptomatic patients at risk of emergency hospital admission, and physicians should consider using these as part of routine assessment, especially during the COVID pandemic.","output":"Assessing atrial fibrillation ablation priority during COVID-19 -does use of patient questionnaires help in stratification above physician assessment?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has strained health care system resources and reduced the availability of life-sustaining and medical-grade personal protective equipment (PPE) though the combination of increased demand and disrupted manufacturing supply chains.

Lack of quality control for makeshift PPE and frequent repurposing of used items to conserve supplies increase both the risk of provider infection and nosocomial spread to uninfected patients. One strategy to reduce risk of infection and preserve existing equipment is the implementation of secondary barrier devices placed directly over patients or providers.

The unit was successfully deployed in Taiwan during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and again during the COVID-19 pandemic. The iPPE worn directly by the health care workers (HCWs) can be donned prior to patient contact in the presence of an air source. This strategy may be more protective than a covering placed over the patient in an aerosol-generating environment, which requires the HCW to be in close contact with the patient prior to securing the protective device.","output":"A Positive-Pressure Environment Disposable Shield (PEDS) for COVID-19 Health Care Worker Protection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most of the patients who overcome the SARS-COV-2 infection do not present complications and do not require a specific follow-up, but a significant proportion (especially those with moderate/severe clinical forms of the disease) require clinicalradiological follow-up Although there are hardly any references or clinical guidelines regarding the long-term follow-up of post-COVID-19 patients, radiological exams are being performed and monographic surveillance consultations are being set up in most of the hospitals to meet their needs The purpose of this work is to share our experience in the management of the post-COVID-19 patient in two institutions thathave had a high incidence of COVID-19 and to propose general follow-uprecommendations from a clinical and radiological perspective Resumen La mayor parte de los pacientes que superan la infeccin por SARS-COV-2 no presentan complicaciones ni requieren un seguimiento especfico, pero una proporcin significativa (especialmente aquellos con formas clnicas moderadas/graves de la enfermedad) necesitan un seguimiento clnico-radiolgico Aunque apenas existen referencias o guas clnicas sobre el seguimiento a largo plazo de estos pacientes post-COVID-19, se estn realizando pruebas radiolgicas y constituyendo consultas monogrficas de vigilancia en la mayor parte de los centros hospitalarios para atender sus necesidades El propsito de este trabajo es compartir nuestra experiencia en el manejo del paciente post-COVID-19 en dos instituciones que han tenido una elevada incidencia de la COVID-19 y proponer unas recomendaciones generales de seguimiento desde una perspectiva clnica y radiolgica","output":"Radiological management and follow-up of post-COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting patients and healthcare providers worldwide.

AIMS: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in care to IBD patients METHODS: A survey study was conducted to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on IBD care. All patients had a virtual clinic appointment between March to July 2020 at either: University of Alberta Hospital or the University of Calgary Clinic. A section of the survey assessed patient experience of virtual clinics and delays in access to IBD care during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 1581 patients were contacted to complete the survey. 628 patients agreed to participate in the survey, however not all patients completed each component. The mean age of patients who participated in the survey was 48 years (SD = 15.19). 408 patients responded to satisfaction/future use questions: 84.3% (344) patients agree/strongly agree they were comfortable communicating to the physician using the remote system, 77.5% (316) of patients agree/strongly agree that virtual clinic is an acceptable way to receive healthcare services, 84.8% (346) of patients agree/strongly agree they would use virtual care services again, and 82.6% (337) agree/strongly agree they were satisfied with the telehealth system. Additional challenges were reported by 228 patients. Fear and stress (infection risk/mental health concerns/unemployment) was reported by 57.4% (131) patients. Access to healthcare services, PPE, and community resources was a challenge experienced by 26.3% (60) patients. Additionally, 16.2% (37) patients experienced uncertainty around IBD-specific care, including procedures, treatments, labs, and medications. Overall, 17.3% of patients reported some type of delay in care by July 2020.

Within the framework of pandemic-related protective measures, people over 65 years of age in particular were asked to stay away from public places and avoid direct physical contact. AIM: This paper examines how the pandemic affected the feelings of people over 50 years of age with regard to the limited daily supply of everyday things, outdoor physical activity and social contact. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In May and June 2020, telephone interviews were conducted with 1011 people aged 50 years and over living in Switzerland. The average respondent age was 65 years and 53% of the respondents were women. RESULTS: The results show that the respondents hardly felt any negative changes in their supply of everyday things or outdoor activity; however, 43% of those surveyed stated that during the pandemic, with its associated protective measures, they more often felt that they were unable to spend enough time with people they cared about. The multivariate results show that education played a role in the respondents evaluation of everyday life considered in the interviews. CONCLUSION: This study identifies older peoples feelings about possible everyday restrictions and should stimulate discussion in practical gerontological work to better consider older peoples subjective perceptions.","output":"Wahrgenommene Einschr?nkungen w?hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie bei ?lteren Personen in der Schweiz"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Septic shock is a clinical condition with high mortality (40%-70%) and morbidity. During septic shock, there is a significant release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators that can cause damage to different organs, known as a \\"cytokine storm.\\" The cytokine storm can cause hypotension, tissue damage, metabolic acidosis, and renal failure. This clinical picture also seems to be confirmed in the context of Covid-19 patients. Hemoadsorption with CytoSorb represents an adjunctive therapy to attenuate the systemic inflammatory process and helps restore a balanced immune response. We present the clinical case of a 75-year-old man, admitted to our hospital with respiratory failure due to Sars-CoV-2 infection and secondary septic shock due to a sacral decubitus. On admission the patient presented with a clinical picture of mixed acidosis with high levels of lactate and inflammatory indexes. Simultaneously along with antibiotic therapy, we started hemoadsorption treatment with CytoSorb in combination with continuous venous-venous hemodiafiltration. At the end of the treatment the patient had recovered his vital functions and the infection was successfully treated. Use of the CytoSorb device in a Covid-19 positive patient was safe and well-tolerated. Early treatment with CytoSorb decreased interleukin 6 plasma levels and inflammatory indexes, resulting in earlier stabilization of homeostasis.

Although improvements in stroke care and outcomes have been reported in high-income countries, little is known about practice and outcomes in low and middle-income countries. We aimed to compare patterns of care available and their association with patient outcomes across countries at different economic levels. METHODS We studied the patterns and effect of practice variations (ie, treatments used and access to services) among participants in the INTERSTROKE study, an international observational study that enrolled 13 447 stroke patients from 142 clinical sites in 32 countries between Jan 11, 2007, and Aug 8, 2015. We supplemented patient data with a questionnaire about health-care and stroke service facilities at all participating hospitals. Using univariate and multivariate regression analyses to account for patient casemix and service clustering, we estimated the association between services available, treatments given, and patient outcomes (death or dependency) at 1 month. FINDINGS We obtained full information for 12 342 (92%) of 13 447 INTERSTROKE patients, from 108 hospitals in 28 countries; 2576 from 38 hospitals in ten high-income countries and 9766 from 70 hospitals in 18 low and middle-income countries. Patients in low-income and middle-income countries more often had severe strokes, intracerebral haemorrhage, poorer access to services, and used fewer investigations and treatments (p<00001) than those in high-income countries, although only differences in patient characteristics explained the poorer clinical outcomes in low and middle-income countries. However across all countries, irrespective of economic level, access to a stroke unit was associated with improved use of investigations and treatments, access to other rehabilitation services, and improved survival without severe dependency (odds ratio [OR] 129; 95% CI 114-144; all p<00001), which was independent of patient casemix characteristics and other measures of care. Use of acute antiplatelet treatment was associated with improved survival (139; 112-172) irrespective of other patient and service characteristics. INTERPRETATION Evidence-based treatments, diagnostics, and stroke units were less commonly available or used in low and middle-income countries. Access to stroke units and appropriate use of antiplatelet treatment were associated with improved recovery. Improved care and facilities in low-income and middle-income countries are essential to improve outcomes.

However, DAD is not the unique pathological figure in ARDS and it can also be observed in settings other than ARDS. In the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related ARDS, the impairment of lung microvasculature has been pointed out. The airways, and of notice the small peripheral airways, may contribute to the loss of aeration observed in ARDS. High-resolution lung imaging techniques found that in specific experimental conditions small airway closure was a reality. Furthermore, low-volume ventilator-induced lung injury, also called as atelectrauma, should involve the airways. Atelectrauma is one of the basic tenet subtending the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at the ventilator in ARDS. Recent data revisited the role of airways in humans with ARDS and provided findings consistent with the expiratory flow limitation and airway closure in a substantial number of patients with ARDS. We discussed the pattern of airway opening pressure disclosed in the inspiratory volume-pressure curves in COVID-19 and in non-COVID-19 related ARDS.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, mixed-mode (online and telephone) survey using non-probability sampling. SETTING: All 15 counties in Liberia with a focus on Maryland County. PARTICIPANTS: From 28 May to 28 June 2020, data were collected from a total of 431 adults aged 18 years and older (telephone 288 (66.8%); online 143 (33.2%)) out of a total of 741 contacts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: KAP scores. Frequencies and proportions were calculated, followed by univariate and multivariable analyses to examine the association between KAP scores and the sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: Around 69% of the online survey respondents were younger than 35 years of age, compared with 56% in the telephone interviews. The majority (87%) of online respondents had completed tertiary education, compared with 77% of the telephone respondents. Male participants, on average, achieved higher knowledge (52%) and attitude scores (72%), in contrast to females (49% and 67%, respectively). Radio (71%) was the most cited source for COVID-19 information, followed by social media (63%). After controlling for sociodemographic variables, adaptive regression modelling revealed that survey mode achieved 100% importance for predicting knowledge and practice levels with regard to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The survey population demonstrated moderate COVID-19 knowledge, with significant differences between survey mode and educational level. Correct knowledge of COVID-19 was associated with appropriate practices in Maryland County. Generalisation of survey findings must be drawn carefully owing to the limitations of the sampling methods.

Because of the disenfranchised nature of perinatal grief reactions, many clinicians may be apt to miss or dismiss a grief reaction that was not identified in the perinatal period. A significant number of those experiencing a reproductive loss exhibit signs of anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Reproductive losses are typically screened for and recorded numerically as part of a womans well-visit intake, yet this process often fails to identify patients emotionally troubled by a prior pregnancy loss. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A summative content analysis of 164 recent website blogs from female participants who self-reported having experienced a miscarriage or abortion in their lifetime was conducted. The narratives were reviewed for details regarding the time span between the pregnancy loss and the composition of the blog post. The stories were analyzed for subsequent relationship problems and detrimental mental health conditions. Maladaptive reactions were contrasted for those that indicated a greater than 12 months time-lapse and those who had not. RESULTS: More than a third (39.6%) of the women reported in the narrative that at least one year or more had passed since experiencing the miscarriage or abortion. For those women, the median time span between the loss and composing the blog was 4 years with a range of 47 years. Mental health conditions attributed to the reproductive loss by those who reported longer bereavement times included subsequent relationship problems, substance misuse, depression, suicidal ideation, and PTSD. The percent of reported maladaptive issues was more than double (136.9% vs. 63.6%) for those who reported that a year or more had passed since the loss of the pregnancy. DISCUSSION: Grief reactions following the loss of a pregnancy may be prolonged or delayed for several months which can contribute to adverse biopsychosocial outcomes. Recognition and treatment of maladaptive grief reactions following a pregnancy loss are critical. Screening methods should be enhanced for clinicians in medical office settings to help identify and expedite the appropriate mental health assistance.","output":"Uncovering Prolonged Grief Reactions Subsequent to a Reproductive Loss: Implications for the Primary Care Provider"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the health authorities recommended the implementation of strict social distancing and complete lockdown regulations to reduce disease spread. The pharmacists quickly adopted telemedicine (telepharmacy) as a solution against this crisis, but awareness about this technology is lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to explore the patients' perspectives and preferences regarding telepharmacy instead of traditional in-person visits. METHODS: An electronic questionnaire was designed and sent to 313 patients who were eligible for the study (from March to April 2021). The questionnaire used five-point Likert scales to inquire about motivations for adopting telepharmacy and in-person visits, their perceived advantages and disadvantages, and the declining factors of telepharmacy. Finally, the results were descriptively analyzed using SPSS 22. RESULTS: Of all 313 respondents, a total of 241 (77%) preferred appointments via telepharmacy while 72 (23%) preferred in-person services. There was a significant difference between the selection percentage of telepharmacy and in-person services (chi-square 91.42; p < 0.0001). Preference bout the telepharmacy system versus in-person visits to the pharmacy was associated with factors such as \\"reducing the incidence of contagious disease\\" (4.41;  0.78), \\"spending less time receiving pharmaceutical services (4.24;  0.86)), and traveling a shorter distance for receiving pharmaceutical services\\" (4.25;  0.86). \\"Reducing costs\\" (90.87%), \\"saving time\\" (89.21%), and \\"reducing the incidence of contagious disease\\" (87.13%) were the most important reasons for choosing telepharmacy services. Also, face-to-face communication with the pharmacist (25%), low internet bandwidth (25%), and reduction of patients' anxiety and the increase of their peace of mind (23.61%) were the most important reasons for choosing in-person visits. CONCLUSION: Survey data indicate that most participants are likely to prefer the use of telepharmacy, especially during crises such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Telepharmacy can be applied as an important means and a crucial service to lessen the load on healthcare organizations and expand drug supply shelters in pharmacies. However, there are still substantial hurdles to overcome in order to successfully implement the telemedicine platform as part of mainstream practice.

It may require renal replacement therapy (RRT), which is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. This review explores the efficacy of proposed pharmacological and non-surgical renal protective strategies. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was done using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus databases. Keywords included were cardiopulmonary bypass, cardiac surgery, coronary artery bypass, renal protection and renal preservation. Eligible articles consisted of all studies on patients who had undergone cardiac surgery via CPB with an outcome of AKI and/or RRT reported. All studies underwent a quality check via the risk of bias tool. The three most researched interventions (based on number of randomized controlled trials and total patients analysed) and their renal outcomes were then analysed with Review Manager Software. RESULTS Eighty-eight articles were extracted. A total of 26 management strategies for renal protection following CPB were identified. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) and the use of volatile anaesthetic agents (VAAs) were further analysed. NAC, RIPC and VAA had no statistically significant benefit in reducing either AKI-CPB or the need for RRT following CPB. CONCLUSION NAC, RIPC and VAA were found to have no statistical significant benefit in reducing either AKI-CPB or the need for RRT following CPB.

Method: We performed a comprehensive literature search of several databases and qualitatively synthesized findings from studies. Results: Twenty-six studies were included with 1228 pooled subjects, with a mean age of 8.6 years, which were dominated by male gender (53%), and African ethnicity (31%). 732 (38%) patients were reactive on a serological test, and 457 patients (45%) were positive on SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. ST-segment abnormalities were the most common ECG findings (16%, n/N: 34/212). Various markers of troponin and the pooled mean of BNP and NT-pro-BNP levels were elevated. Cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion (21.8%, n/N: 164/751) was the most common chest X-ray findings. In echocardiography, the majority of patients' left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced (59.0%, n/N: 180/305), with pericardial effusion/ pericarditis seen the most (17.44%, n/N: 221/1267), and Z score &#8805; 2 in 28% (n/N: 42/139). Cardiac MRI findings were consistent with acute myocarditis. Intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, and vasoactive drugs were frequently utilized. The mean length of stay was 6 days, with most patients (71%, n/N: 834/1163) were admitted to the ICU. However, the overall prognosis was favourable, with 98% alive (n/N: 1235/1260), and more than 50% of patients experienced recovery of left ventricular systolic functions at discharge (116 out of 206 patients).

Type A includes areas of periurban agriculture surrounding the metropolitan cities, type B areas of intensive agriculture with high concentration of agroindustry, type C hilly areas with highly diversified agriculture and valuable landscape, and type D high hills and mountains with forests and protected areas. Areas A and B are located in the plains, covering 21% of the territory and accounting for 57% of the population. They produce most of the added value, consume high levels of energy and represent the main source of pollution. Areas C and D cover 79% of the territory and 43% of the population. We find that provinces with 10% more type C and D areas exhibit on average 10% fewer cases of contagion. The result is statistically significant, after controlling for demographic, economic and environmental characteristics of the provinces. The pollution produced in more energy-intensive landscape has triggered an intense debate of how to ensure the economic competitiveness of Italian agriculture, without compromising environmental integrity or public health. Our findings speak to this debate, by suggesting that planning for more rural territory with lower energy inputs may come with the added benefit of new development opportunities and decreasing the exposure of the population to covid-19. Cost benefit-analyses should take into account that policies aimed at revitalizing more rural areas may reduce the economic impact of covid-19 and of potential future pandemics.","output":"Covid-19 and rural landscape: The case of Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented as a grim and complex situation recently.

Due to the discontinuation of traditional classroom teaching, the need to expand digital learning opportunities is undeniable. The aim of our study is to develop a tele-guided US course for undergraduate medical students and test the feasibility and efficacy of this digital US teaching method. MATERIALS AND METHODS A tele-guided US course was established for medical students. Students underwent seven US organ modules. Each module took place in a flipped classroom concept via the Amboss platform, providing supplementary e-learning material that was optional and included information on each of the US modules. An objective structured assessment of US skills (OSAUS) was implemented as the final exam. US images of the course and exam were rated by the Brightness Mode Quality Ultrasound Imaging Examination Technique (B-QUIET). Achieved points in image rating were compared to the OSAUS exam. RESULTS A total of 15 medical students were enrolled. Students achieved an average score of 154.5 (SD  11.72) out of 175 points (88.29 %) in OSAUS, which corresponded to the image rating using B-QUIET. Interrater analysis of US images showed a favorable agreement with an ICC (2.1) of 0.895 (95 % confidence interval 0.858 < ICC < 0.924).

Using innovative approaches such as video conferencing can connect mentors with practitioners regardless of location. This study describes and evaluates the methods, outputs, and outcomes of a quality improvement program implemented in 12 public hospital laboratories in Cambodia between January 2018 and April 2019. The program used mixed intervention methods including both in-person and remote-access training and mentorship. METHODS: Training outputs were quantified from the activity reports of program trainers and mentors. Program outcomes were measured by pre- and postimplementation audits of laboratory quality management system conformity to international standards. Variations in improved outcomes were assessed in relation to the time spent by laboratory personnel in video conference training and mentoring activity. An additional cross-sectional comparison described the difference in final audit scores between participating and nonparticipating laboratories. RESULTS: Laboratories significantly improved their audit scores over the project period, showing significant improvement in all sections of the ISO 15189 standard. Pre- and postaudit score differences and laboratory personnel participation time in remote mentoring activities showed a strong monotonic relationship. Average input per laboratory was 6,0272,454 minutes of participation in video conference activities with mentors. Audit scores of participating laboratories were significantly higher than those of laboratories with no quality improvement program. CONCLUSION: Laboratories improved significantly in ISO 15189 conformity following structured laboratory quality management systems training supported by remote and on-site mentoring. The correlation of laboratory participation in video conference activities highlights the utility of remote video conferencing technology to strengthen laboratories in resource-limited settings and to build communities of practice to address quality improvement issues in health care.

It is mediated by various types of cells. Recently, immature red blood cells called erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) were identified as regulators of the immune response in cancer. EPCs expand in cancer as a result of dysregulated erythropoiesis and potently suppress the immune response. Thus, targeting dysregulated EPC differentiation appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy. ABSTRACT: Cancer cells harness normal cells to facilitate tumor growth and metastasis. Within this complex network of interactions, the establishment and maintenance of immune evasion mechanisms are crucial for cancer progression. The escape from the immune surveillance results from multiple independent mechanisms. Recent studies revealed that besides well-described myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) or regulatory T-cells (Tregs), erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) play an important role in the regulation of immune response and tumor progression. EPCs are immature erythroid cells that differentiate into oxygen-transporting red blood cells. They expand in the extramedullary sites, including the spleen, as well as infiltrate tumors. EPCs in cancer produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), transforming growth factor  (TGF-), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and express programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and potently suppress T-cells. Thus, EPCs regulate antitumor, antiviral, and antimicrobial immunity, leading to immune suppression. Moreover, EPCs promote tumor growth by the secretion of growth factors, including artemin. The expansion of EPCs in cancer is an effect of the dysregulation of erythropoiesis, leading to the differentiation arrest and enrichment of early-stage EPCs. Therefore, anemia treatment, targeting ineffective erythropoiesis, and the promotion of EPC differentiation are promising strategies to reduce cancer-induced immunosuppression and the tumor-promoting effects of EPCs.","output":"Tumor Immune Evasion Induced by Dysregulation of Erythroid Progenitor Cells Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug repositioning represents an effective way to control the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Finding vaccines and therapeutics is therefore urgent, but elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that allow some viruses to cross host species boundaries, becoming a threat to human health, must also be given close attention. Here, analysis of all proteins of SARS-CoV-2 revealed a unique PPxY Late (L) domain motif, 25PPAY28, in a spike (S) protein inside a predicted hot disordered loop subject to phosphorylation and binding. PPxY motifs in enveloped RNA viruses are known to recruit Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases and ultimately the ESCRT complex to enhance virus budding and release, resulting in higher viral loads, hence facilitating new infections. Interestingly, proteins of SARS-CoV-1 do not feature PPxY motifs, which could explain why SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than SARS-CoV-1. Should an experimental assessment of this hypothesis show that the PPxY motif plays the same role in SARS-CoV-2 as it does in other enveloped RNA viruses, this motif will become a promising target for the development of novel host-oriented antiviral therapeutics for preventing S proteins from recruiting Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase partners.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Encodes a PPxY Late Domain Motif Known to Enhance Budding and Spread in Enveloped RNA Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging infectious diseases have caused a global effort for development of fast and accurate detection techniques.

Mature viral particles are composed of an envelope 50C72 nm in diameter, with an isometric core about 20C30 nm enclosing a linear positive-stranded RNA genome of approximately 15 kb. The virions are assembled by the budding of preformed nucleocapsids into the lumen of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi apparatus. The mature virions are then released by exocytosis. The viral genome contains eight open reading frames (ORFs) which are transcribed in cells as a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. The ORF1a and ORF1b situated at the 5end of the genome represent nearly 75% of the viral genome and code for proteins with apparent replicase and polymerase activities. The major structural proteins consist of a 25 kDa envelope glycoprotein (GP(5)), an 18C19 kDa unglycosylated membrane protein (M), and a 15 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein, encoded by ORFs 5, 6 and 7, respectively. The N protein is the more abundant protein of the virion and is highly antigenic, which therefore makes it a suitable candidate for the detection of virus-specific antibodies and diagnosis of the disease. Four to five domains of antigenic importance have been identified for the N protein, a common conformational antigenic site for European and North American strains being localized in the central region of the protein. In cells and virions, both M and GP(5) occur in heterodimeric complexes linked by disulfide bonds. The expression products of ORFs 2 and 4 are also incorporated into virus particles as additional minor membrane-associated glycoproteins designated as GP(2) and GP(4), with M(r) of 29 and 31 kDa, respectively. The structural nature of the ORF3 product, a highly glycosylated protein with an apparent M(r) of 42 kDa, is still being debated, in view of the apparently conflicting data on its presence in virus particles. Nonetheless, the GP(3) of North American and European strains has been shown to be antigenic, providing protection for piglets against PRRSV infection in the absence of a noticeable neutralizing humoral response. Pigs exposed to the native form of GP(5) by means of DNA immunization develop specific neutralizing and protecting antibodies. The GP(5) is involved in antigenic variability, apoptosis, and possibly antibody-dependent enhancement phenomena. The GP(4) also possesses antigenic determinants that trigger the immune system to produce neutralizing antibodies. Each of the PRRSV structural proteins carries common and type-specific antigenic determinants that permit the ability to differentiate between European and North American strains. The potential use of the PRRSV structural proteins in subunit recombinant-type vaccines is also discussed.","output":"Current knowledge on the structural proteins of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus: comparison of the North American and European isolates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to significant disruptions in the healthcare system including surges of infected patients exceeding local capacity, closures of primary care offices, and delays of non-emergent medical care.

We evaluate the immediate impact of the Public Health Messaging and shelter-in-place mandates on Emergency Department (ED) demand for radiology services. METHODS: We analyzed ED radiology volumes from the five University of California health systems during a 2-week time period following the shelter-in-place mandate and compared those volumes with March 2019 and early April 2019 volumes. RESULTS: ED radiology volumes declined from the 2019 baseline by 32 to 40% (p < 0.001) across the five health systems with a total decrease in volumes across all 5 systems by 35% (p < 0.001).

METHODS: A total of 1401 patients were enrolled, with 852 (60.8%) patients receiving 5 000 000 U of IFN-&#945;-2b via aerosol inhalation twice daily. The primary outcome was a composite measure consisting of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death.

Although this phenomenon is sometimes recognized among patients and their clinicians, the association between dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) in PD patients and creativity remains underexplored. It is unclear, for instance, whether DRT affects creativity through convergent or divergent thinking, idea generation, or a general lack of inhibition. It is also unclear whether DRT only augments pre-existing creative attributes or generates creativity de novo. Here, we tested a group of PD patients when on and off dopaminergic treatment on a series of tests of creative problem-solving (Alternative Uses Task, Compound Remote Associates, Rebus Puzzles), and related their performance to a group of matched healthy controls as well as to their pre-PD creative skills and measures of inhibition/impulsivity. Results did not provide strong evidence that DRT improved creative thinking in PD patients. Rather, PD patients on medication showed less flexibility in divergent thinking, generated fewer ideas via insight, and showed worse performance in convergent thinking overall (by making more errors) than healthy controls. Pre-PD creative skills predicted enhanced flexibility and fluency in divergent thinking when PD patients were on medication. However, results on convergent thinking were mixed. Finally, PD patients who exhibited deficits in a measure of inhibitory control showed weaker convergent thinking while on medication, supporting previous evidence on the importance of inhibitory control in creative problem-solving. Altogether, results do not support the hypothesis that DRT promotes creative thinking in PD. We speculate that bursts of artistic production in PD are perhaps conflated with creativity due to lay conceptions of creativity (i.e., an art-bias).","output":"The Effect of Dopaminergic Replacement Therapy on Creative Thinking and Insight Problem-Solving in Parkinson's Disease Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and associated coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has brought farmers and farmworkers the designation of \\"essential\\", while placing them into heightened vulnerability for the disease.

Adopting SBL provides a controlled environment for meeting educational objectives without the risk of harm to real patients. Given that social distancing is required during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, SBL is a suitable alternative to clinical training for nursing students to learn and acquire the required clinical competencies. The study aimed to describe the effectiveness of SBL as a complete substitute for clinical experience from the perspective of students. This cross-sectional descriptive survey investigated students perceptions regarding the description of the effectiveness of SBL in four nursing colleges at four different universities across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Settings: Four nursing colleges at four different universities across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Participants included nursing students who attended simulation sessions. Data were collected by distributing a self-administrated online questionnaire, the Modified Simulation Effectiveness Tool (SET-M), which is a 19-item. Results: Approximately two-thirds of the participants were in their third (30.4%) and fourth (44.5%) academic year. The highest student presentation was for Site 1 (39.5%) and Site 2 (32.5%). Significant differences existed in all domains according to sex and university (p  0.001). There was a significant difference in relation to the level of agreement for pre-briefing, scenario, and debriefing domains (<0.001). Conclusions: SBL is a valuable teaching strategy that enhances nursing students self-awareness, self-confidence, clinical performance, and efficiency in performing procedures with considerable gender variation. Female students had more positive perceptions toward simulation effectiveness.","output":"Maintaining Clinical Training Continuity during COVID-19 Pandemic: Nursing Students Perceptions about Simulation-Based Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Aim of the study is to compare macroporous (> 1 mm2) polytetrafluoroethylene mesh (LP-PTFE) versus microporous (< 1 mm2) polypropylene mesh (SP-PPL) in terms of postoperative acute and chronic discomfort and pain, difficulty in mesh handling and long-term recurrence rate. METHODS Fifty-two patients with bilateral hernia were enrolled in this double-blind randomized controlled trial (NCT02023203). Each hernia, in the same patient, was randomized to implant LP-PTFE or SP-PPL mesh during totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic hernia repair. Patients were followed at 7 days, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 60 months after surgery. Visual analog scale (VAS) score was employed to evaluate the outcomes. Student's t test was used in case of normally distributed continuous variables, while the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used in case of not normally distributed variables. Chi square test was used for analysis of categorical variables. RESULTS Median VAS discomfort score with SP-PPL was significantly higher than LP-PTFE at 1 and 3 months after surgery (p = 0.003 in both cases). LP-PTFE showed significantly lower median score than SP-PPL at 7 days after surgery (p = 0.025) regarding pain at movement. Testicular pain was lower in case of LP-PTFE than SP-PPL at 7 days, 1 and 3 months after surgery (p = 0.005, p = 0.004 and p = 0.004, respectively). LP-PTFE was significantly more difficult to handle (p = 0.001). At 60 months, one recurrence was observed in the LP-PTFE group (p = 1.0000). CONCLUSIONS LP-PTFE has less postoperative discomfort and pain up to 3 months after surgery, without differences after that period, although it shows more difficulty in handling and recurrences occur even if not statistically significant.","output":"Polytetrafluoroethylene versus polypropylene mesh during laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair of inguinal hernia: short- and long-term results of a double-blind clinical randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pancreas disease (PD) and sleeping disease (SD), caused by an alphavirus, are endemic in European salmonid aquaculture, causing significant mortality, reduced growth and poor flesh quality.

The mortality rate of COVID-19 is similar in both populations too. The authors discuss the role of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in preventing infection or reducing COVID-19 severity. They also discuss the pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 in PLWH. EXPERT OPINION: Management of COVID-19 in PLWH is no different from the general population. It should be based on careful supportive care, emphasizing lung-protective ventilation, and wise pharmacological interventions. The antiviral drug remdesivir and dexamethasone are the only pharmacological interventions with clinical benefit for COVID-19, whereas anticoagulation may prevent thrombotic complications. The experience with using these drugs in PLWH is limited, which prevents from rendering well-founded conclusions. Until more data on COVID-19 in PLWH become available, the best weapons within our reach are sound supportive care and sensible use of RDV and dexamethasone, bearing in mind the potential for drug-drug interactions of most corticosteroids and antiretroviral drugs.","output":"Pharmacological considerations for the treatment of COVID-19 in people living with HIV (PLWH)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a context where learning mediated by technology has gained prominence in higher education, learning analytics has become a powerful tool to collect and analyse data with the aim of improving students learning.

However, the small number of proteins encoded by viral genomes is insufficient to enable virus infection. Hence, viruses hijack cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to aid replication and spread. In this review we discuss the knowns and unknowns regarding the contribution of host RBPs to the formation of viral particles and the initial steps of infection in the newly infected cell. Through comparison of the virion proteomes of ten different human RNA viruses, we confirm that a pool of cellular RBPs are typically incorporated into viral particles. We describe here illustrative examples supporting the important functions of these RBPs in viral particle formation and infectivity and we propose that the role of host RBPs in these steps can be broader than previously anticipated. Understanding how cellular RBPs regulate virus infection can lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets against viruses.","output":"The importance of virion-incorporated cellular RNA-Binding Proteins in viral particle assembly and infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death, major depressive disorder (MDD) is the primary cause of disability, affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. Interestingly, there is evidence that CVD is more prevalent in people with MDD. It is well established that neurotransmitters, namely serotonin and norepinephrine, are involved in the biochemical mechanisms of MDD, and consequently, drugs targeting serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake, such as duloxetine, are commonly prescribed for MDD. In this connection, serotonin and norepinephrine are also known to play critical roles in primary hemostasis. Based on these considerations, we investigated if duloxetine can be repurposed as an antiplatelet medication. Our results-using human and/or mouse platelets show that duloxetine dose-dependently inhibited agonist-induced platelet aggregation, compared to the vehicle control. Furthermore, it also blocked agonist-induced dense and -granule secretion, integrin IIb3 activation, phosphatidylserine expression, and clot retraction. Moreover duloxetine-treated mice had a significantly prolonged occlusion time. Finally, duloxetine was also found to impair hemostasis. Collectively, our data indicate that the antidepressant duloxetine, which is a serotonin-norepinephrine antagonist, exerts antiplatelet and thromboprotective effects and inhibits hemostasis. Consequently, duloxetine, or a rationally designed derivative, presents potential benefits in the context of CVD, including that associated with MDD.","output":"The Antidepressant Duloxetine Inhibits Platelet Function and Protects against Thrombosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although -amyloid (A) may be the primary driver of Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology, accumulation of pathological tau correlates with dementia in AD patients. Thus, the prevention/inhibition of AD may require vaccine/s targeting A and tau simultaneously or sequentially.

Formulation of AV-1959R in Advax(CpG) induced the highest cellular and humoral immune responses in mice. The dual-epitope vaccine, AV-1953R, or the combination of AV-1959R and AV-1980R vaccines formulated with Advax(CpG) induced robust antibody responses against various forms of both, A and tau pathological molecules. While anti-A antibody titers after AV-1953R immunization were similar to that in mice vaccinated with AV-1959R or AV-1959R/AV-1980R combination, anti-tau titers were significantly lower after AV-1953R injection when compared to the AV-1980R or AV-1959R/AV-1980R.

Both patients had respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and abdominal symptoms consistent with acute pancreatitis later-on confirmed through laboratory and CT findings. Our conservative management led to an improvement of the pancreatitis, though the first patient suffered from a severe form of COVID-19 justifying the using of mechanical ventilation and ECMO, while the second patient exhibited a milder form of COVID-19. Although both patients improved in terms of pancreatitis, the overall evolution was very different due to the extent of the respiratory involvement of COVID-19, as one patient exhibited a spectacular improvement of her respiratory state leading to a full recovery, the other patient suffered a rapid worsening of her acute respiratory distress leading to death following ECMO complications.

Animals were immunized with recombinant RBD antigen intraperitoneally using three different adjuvants (Zn-chitosan, Alhydrogel, and Adju-Phos), and antibody responses were followed for over 5 months. Results showed that potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) can be induced with 70% neutralization titer (NT70) of ~14,580 against live, infectious viruses. Although antigen-binding antibody titers decreased gradually over time, sufficiently protective levels of nAbs persisted (NT80 >2,430) over the 5-month observation period. Results also showed that adjuvants have profound effects on kinetics of nAb induction, total antibody titers, antibody avidity, antibody longevity, and B-cell epitopes targeted by the immune system.

This shortage potentially hinders efforts towards attaining universal access to basic healthcare. More importantly, poor quality of pre-service training for health trainees has the potential to worsen this predicament. There is therefore the need to leverage emerging digital innovations like e-learning to complement existing efforts. This study was conducted several months before the outbreak of COVID-19 to investigate the preparedness, acceptability and feasibility e-learning innovation for nursing and midwifery trainees. METHODS: The study is a cross-sectional descriptive survey involving nursing and midwifery students (n = 233) in one of Ghanas public universities, located in the Volta region of Ghana. Simple random sampling technique was used to collect responses from eligible respondents using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistical analysis was done using STATA software (version 12.0). RESULTS: It was found that nearly 100% of respondents owned smartphones that were used mostly for learning purposes including sharing of academic information. Over 70% of respondents particularly used social media, social networking applications and internet searches for learning purposes. Health trainees were however constrained by low bandwidth and lack of seamless internet connectivity within their learning environments to maximize the full benefits of these e-learning opportunities. CONCLUSION: Respondents were predominantly prepared for an e-learning pilot project. These feability findings suggest e-learning is a huge potential that can be used to augment existing approaches for pre-service training of health trainees in Ghana, when implementation threats are sufficiently addressed.

An expert subgroup reviewed existing SA guidelines and new publications focusing on prevention. Published evidence on pneumonia prevention informed the revisions; in the absence of evidence, expert opinion was used. Evidence was graded using the British Thoracic Society (BTS) grading system. Recommendations. General measures for prevention include minimising exposure to tobacco smoke or air pollution, breastfeeding, optimising nutrition, optimising maternal health from pregnancy onwards, adequate antenatal care and improvement in socioeconomic and living conditions. Prevention of viral transmission, including SARS-CoV-2, can be achieved by hand hygiene, environmental decontamination, use of masks and isolation of infected people. Specific preventive measures include vaccines as contained in the Expanded Programme on Immunisation schedule, isoniazid prophylaxis for tuberculosis, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis for HIV-infected infants and children who are immunosuppressed, and timely diagnosis of HIV, as well as antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. HIV-infected children treated with ART from early infancy, and HIV-exposed children, have similar immunogenicity and immune responses to most childhood vaccines as HIV-unexposed infants. Validation.

In contrast, hydrocarbons are predominantly state-owned. In 2017, on average 13% was paid in royalties for gas and 11% for petroleum. These royalties have minor impact on state budgets. For instance, in the concerned state of Lower Saxony, the levies amount to 189 million  or 0.6% of the state budget. Thus, the state income from royalties is low.

METHODOLOGY: A total of 1,160 adult respondents of the 2013 NNS living in the National Capital Region, Philippines were enrolled. Of the 1,160 sequenced samples, 833 passed the stringent quality control based on multiple parameters and were used for further analysis. Total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was determined using electro-chemiluminescence binding assay method. Genomic DNA was used for targeted next generation sequencing of 502 lifestyle and nutrition related polymorphisms. Analysis of variance, followed by Tukey post hoc analysis, was employed to compare 25(OH)D serum levels across genotypes. RESULTS: Of the study participants, 56% was classified as having low serum 25(OH)D. The lower serum 25(OH)D was observed in the following gene/genotypes: KNG1 rs11924390 T/T; ANKH rs2454873 G/G; NPFFR2 rs4129733 T/G; SH2B1 rs4788102 G/A; RAP1A rs494453 T/T and CRHBP rs7728378 T/C.

The aim of this study was to objectively investigate olfactory dysfunction in two cohorts of patients at two different stages: during acute illness and after a median recovery of 4 months. METHODS: Twenty-five acutely ill patients and 26 recovered subjects were investigated. Acute patients had a molecular diagnosis of COVID-19; recovered subjects had a positive antibody assay and a negative molecular test. A 33-item psychophysical olfactory identification test tailored for the Italian population was performed. RESULTS: Median time from symptoms onset to olfactory test was 33 days in acute patients and 122 days in recovered subjects. The former scored a significantly higher number of errors at psychophysical testing (median [IQR]: 8 [13] vs 3 [2], p < 0.001) and were more frequently hyposmic (64% vs 19%, p = 0.002). Recovered subjects reported a variable time to subjective olfactory recovery, from days up to 4 months. Participants included in the study reported no significant nasal symptoms at olfactory testing. Among recovered subject who reported olfactory loss during acute COVID-19, four (27%) were still hyposmic. Demographic and clinical characteristics did not show significant associations with olfactory dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Moderate-to-severe hospitalized patients showed a high level and frequency of olfactory dysfunction compared to recovered subjects. In the latter group, subjects who reported persisting olfactory dysfunction showed abnormal scores on psychophysical testing, indicating that, at least in some subjects, persistent hyposmia may represent a long-term sequela of COVID-19.","output":"Testing olfactory dysfunction in acute and recovered COVID-19 patients: a single center study in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the national transplant activity has been reduced due to the overload of the health system and concern for patient safety in this situation. The aim of our work is to expose the activity of kidney transplantation in Cantabria during the state of alarm, as well as to assess the safety of the transplantation program. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of kidney transplants performed in our Center from the beginning of the state of alarm until the beginning of the lockdown easing in Cantabria. Descriptive analysis of the demographic data of recipients and their donors, intraoperative data and postoperative outcomes. Comparative analysis with the data of the same period in 2017-2019, by means of the &#967;2 for categorical variables, Student's T and Mann-Whitney U tests in case of quantitative variables of normal and non-normal distribution, respectively. RESULTS: Fifteen kidney transplants were performed in the period described. Delayed renal function (DRF) was seen in 7.5% of patients, and 26.6% showed data of acute rejection; no patient presented COVID-19 disease. Comparative analysis showed a remarkable increase in the number of transplants in comparison with previous periods (15 vs 5.6), at the expense of donors from outside Cantabria (93.3%). We found no statistically significant differences in terms of cold ischemia time (p=0.77), DRF (p=0.73), need for dialysis (p=0.54), or appearance of post-surgical complications (p=0.61).

National data demonstrate that increased sugar consumption, a high daily caloric intake, and low levels of daily physical activity are independently associated with COVID-19 mortality. Further, genetic factors such as variations in the androgen receptor may compound the effects of an unhealthy lifestyle and increase the risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms in some patients. A diet high in sugar in combination with a low level of physical activity may increase blood glucose levels and impair glucose metabolism. Recent data show that patients admitted to the hospital with high levels of fasting blood glucose are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms. Moreover, elevated glucose levels resulted in increased SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in vitro.

A particular vulnerable group of patients is those with opioid dependence maintained on opioid substitution therapy (OST). These patients are pharmacologically dependent on the OST medication (buprenorphine, buprenorphine-naloxone combination [BNX], and methadone) for their healthy functioning and recovery. COVID-19 outbreak, lock-down, and difficult access to medical care, all are likely to induce stress and withdrawal, which is a potential risk for relapse among individuals with opioid dependence, who are anyway more vulnerable due to social, housing, living, and medical conditions.

Especially in helicopter emergency medical systems (HEMS), which have limitations regarding loading weight and space and typically operate in rural and remote areas, whether MCDs have benefits for patients is still unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of MCDs in a large Swiss HEMS system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of all HEMS missions of Swiss Air rescue Rega between January 2014 and June 2016 with the use of an MCD (Autopulse?). Details of MCD use and patient outcome are reported from the medical operation journals and the hospitals' discharge letters. RESULTS: MCDs were used in 626 HEMS missions, and 590 patients (94%) could be included. 478 (81%) were primary missions and 112 (19%) were interhospital transfers. Forty-nine of the patients in primary missions were loaded under ongoing CPR with MCDs. Of the patients loaded after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 20 (7%) experienced a second CA during the flight. In interhospital transfers, 102 (91%) only needed standby use of the MCD. Five (5%) patients were loaded into the helicopter with ongoing CPR. Five (5%) patients went into CA during flight and the MCD had to be activated. A shockable cardiac arrhythmia was the only factor significantly associated with better survival in resuscitation missions using MCD (OR 0.176, 95% confidence interval 0.084 to 0.372, p < 0.001).

Carbohydrates with a low glycemic index are recommended, but the ideal amount of carbohydrate in the diet is unclear. We performed a meta-analysis comparing diets containing low to moderate amounts of carbohydrate (LCD) (energy percentage below 45%) to diets containing high amounts of carbohydrate (HCD) in subjects with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We systematically reviewed Cochrane library databases, EMBASE, and MEDLINE in the period 2004-2014 for guidelines, meta-analyses, and randomized trials assessing the outcomes HbA1c, BMI, weight, LDL cholesterol, quality of life (QoL), and attrition. RESULTS We identified 10 randomized trials comprising 1376 participants in total. In the first year of intervention, LCD was followed by a 0.34% lower HbA1c (3.7 mmol/mol) compared with HCD (95% CI 0.06 (0.7 mmol/mol), 0.63 (6.9 mmol/mol)). The greater the carbohydrate restriction, the greater the glucose-lowering effect (R=-0.85, p<0.01). At 1 year or later, however, HbA1c was similar in the 2 diet groups. The effect of the 2 types of diet on BMI/body weight, LDL cholesterol, QoL, and attrition rate was similar throughout interventions. LIMITATIONS Glucose-lowering medication, the nutrition therapy, the amount of carbohydrate in the diet, glycemic index, fat and protein intake, baseline HbA1c, and adherence to the prescribed diets could all have affected the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Low to moderate carbohydrate diets have greater effect on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes compared with high-carbohydrate diets in the first year of intervention. The greater the carbohydrate restriction, the greater glucose lowering, a relationship that has not been demonstrated earlier. Apart from this lowering of HbA1c over the short term, there is no superiority of low-carbohydrate diets in terms of glycemic control, weight, or LDL cholesterol.","output":"Systematic review and meta-analysis of dietary carbohydrate restriction in patients with type 2 diabetes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Frozen cassava is one of the food innovations of cassava based The long shelf life of frozen cassava can increase its selling value so that it can be used as a typical souvenir at Sosok Peak The priority problem to be resolved is the lack of knowledge about the processing of cassava products so that the product is marketable and as an alternative for souvenirs Following up on the results of the problem identification, the activity carried out was training on the process of making frozen cassava The covid-19 pandemic activities were carried out online, through webinars, tutorials accessed through https://youtu be/EQeePrurIEY and training modules distributed to partners The output of this service was in the form of knowledge and skills of the women of the P2WKSS group of Sanan hamlet, Bawuran village regarding frozen cassava;new business of the P2WKSS hamlet of Sanan;frozen cassava production process video;learning module","output":"Training of Frozen Cassava (Manihot esculenta) Processing to Increase Selling Value"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergency management systems (EMS) assist emergency managers to resolve emergencies on hand, through analyzing the emergency characteristics and consolidating data from different departments that are involved in resolving the emergency.

Persons with sickle cell disease (SCD) constitute a vulnerable population, subject to health disparities, who may have worse outcomes from COVID-19. Within the United States, New York has a large population of patients with SCD. Here, we analyze the clinical course and outcomes of SCD patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to a community teaching hospital in Brooklyn, NY. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of adult patients with SCD hospitalized with laboratory- confirmed COVID-19. Electronic health records were reviewed to identify patients and analyze their clinical course. Clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiology data were assessed. Rates of acute chest syndrome (ACS), acute kidney injury (AKI) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) were determined. ACS was defined by the presence of fever and/or respiratory symptoms accompanied by a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest Xray. Data on use of blood transfusion, treatments, length of stay and mortality were collected. Results: Between March 1 to June 30, 2020, 53 adults with SCD were hospitalized at our institution. Of these, 13 patients had COVID-19 infection. The mean (SD) age of the COVID-19 patients was 3410 years (range, 22 to 50) with 54% being female. Seven patients (54%) were Hb SS, and 6 patients (46%) were Hb SC. Comorbid conditions included Diabetes Mellitus (1 patient), SLE (1), End-stage renal disease (1), prior VTE (4) and Avascular necrosis of hip (3). Four patients were on hydroxyurea. Clinical, laboratory and radiological findings are summarized in Table 1. While all the Hb SS patients presented with vaso-occlusive crisis, 4 of the 6 patients with Hb SC did not have symptoms of pain crisis. Chest pain and cough were the most common symptoms at presentation. During the hospital stay, 12 patients (92%) had at least one febrile episode >38C, with 77% having recurrent fevers above 38.5C. Eleven patients (85%) met criteria for ACS. Seventy-seven percent of all patients required supplemental oxygen. Nine patients (69%) were transfused, with 4 patients undergoing exchange transfusion. Sixty-seven percent of the transfused patients were transfused within 48 hours of admission. No patients required intubation or mechanical ventilation and none were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Five patients (38.5%) received hydroxychloroquine while 84.6% were treated with antibiotics. No patient received remdesivir. Three patients (23%) developed AKI: of these, one patient required acute hemodialysis, the other two cases were mild with peak creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dl. Ninety-two percent of patients received prophylactic anticoagulation with either unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin or fondaparinux. One patient who did not receive an anticoagulant due to thrombocytopenia developed an acute deep vein thrombosis which was also catheter-related. Of note, during the initial phase of the pandemic standard dosing of prophylactic anticoagulants were used but in the later months, some patients received higher prophylactic doses in keeping with hospital protocol. The median length of hospital stay was 9.4 days (interquartile range, 8.1 to 13.3). There were no deaths - all patients were discharged home. Summary: Panepinto et al (Emerg Infect Dis.) reported a mortality of 7% in 178 SCD patients with COVID-19 in the United States. Other published reports have detailed more favorable outcomes (Arlet et al, Lancet and Appiah-Kubi et al, Br J Haematol.). In this small retrospective analysis of hospitalized SCD patients, there was no mortality. Acute chest syndrome was the most common complication observed. VTE and severe AKI were infrequent. Blood transfusion was performed in the majority of patients (69%); two thirds of the patients transfused received blood within 48 hours of hospitalization. There were no ICU admissions and no use of mechanical ventilation indicative perhaps of less severe COVID-19 disease. This may have been due to the young age of the cohort. Early use of blood transfusion may have been a factor in reducing disease severity and improving outcomes. The best approach to managing these patients is unclear. We advocate for the development and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines to manage SCD patients with COVID-19 to reduce morbidity and mortality in this at-risk population.

Natural preservatives are needed to preserve catch so it wont get spoiled and can be accepted by consumers in suitable conditions for consumption. This study aims to evaluate the particle size of nano-chitosan and determine the effectiveness of nano-chitosan spray with different concentrations as a natural preservative in caught fish. This research method begins with making chitosan through 3 stages: demineralization, deproteination, and deacetylation. Chitosan was made into nano-chitosan with various concentrations of 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1 using ionic gelation. Nano-chitosan underwent several tests, including PSA, antibacterial activity by disc diffusion, organoleptic, and the effectiveness of preservatives. Antibacterial activity of nanochitosan was able to inhibit Bacillus subtilis at three different concentrations, the potential to inhibit Escherichia coli was optimal at 5:1 treatment. The effectiveness of nano-chitosan preservative bacteria inhibition at three different concentrations proved to be sufficient to be used to extend shelf life and ensure the safety and quality of fishery products.

We calculated the dynamic compliance of the respiratory system (C RS) and the intratidal volume-dependent C RS curve using the gliding-SLICE method. The C RS curve was then classified in terms of indicating intratidal recruitment/derecruitment (increasing profile) and overdistension (decreasing profile). During the surgical interventions, the PEEP level was maintained nearly constant at 7 cm H2O. Data are expressed as mean [confidence interval]. RESULTS Baseline C RS was 60 [54-67] mL cm H2O-1. Application of pneumoperitoneum decreased C RS to 40 [37-43] mL cm H2O-1 which partially recovered to 54 [50-59] mL cm H2O-1 (P < 0.001) after removal but remained below the value measured before pneumoperitoneum (P < 0.001). Baseline compliance profiles indicated intratidal recruitment/derecruitment in 48 % patients. After induction of pneumoperitoneum, intratidal recruitment/derecruitment was indicated in 93 % patients (P < 0.01), and after removal intratidal recruitment/derecruitment was indicated in 59 % patients. Compliance profiles showing overdistension were not observed. CONCLUSIONS Analyses of the intratidal compliance profiles reveal that pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery causes intratidal recruitment/derecruitment which partly persists after its removal. The analysis of the intratidal volume-dependent C RS profiles could be used to guide intraoperative PEEP adjustments during elevated intraabdominal pressure.","output":"Pneumoperitoneum deteriorates intratidal respiratory system mechanics: an observational study in lung-healthy patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Saudi universities have suspended the traditional face-to-face classes and moved to online learning to ensure the continuation of the educational process during the COVID-19 pandemic. The speed at which the move to online learning has happened was unprecedented and staggering. Academics, had to improvise and try different e-learning solutions in less-than-ideal circumstances. No matter how powerful and easy-to-use e-learning solutions might be, many academics understandably found the transition to e-learning stressful. This research project looks at the transition experience to online learning from the viewpoint of academics in Saudi universities. It investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the adoption of e-learning solutions and how this forced experience would affect the long-term adoption of e-learning solutions. The study employed an online survey administered to academics from all the 24 public universities. The results were quantitatively analysed by using structural equation modelling (SEM). It was found that attitudes toward e-learning, self-efficacy and perceived reliability have significant positive effects on behavioural intention to adopt e-learning. It was also found that COVID-19 has positively affected the long-term adoption of e-learning. Therefore, it is recommended that universities take immediate actions and capitalise on the e-learning experience that academics have gained during COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the adoption of e-learning among academics in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic affected health services by overloading hospitals capacity, impacting cancer screening and treatment. Unfortunately, a late cancer diagnosis has a detrimental effect in prognosis. We aimed to assess the staging of breast cancer (BC) and cervical cancer (CC) patients (pts) during their first consultation, comparing the periods during and prior to the pandemic. Methods: Data were collected from pts who started follow-up and treatment in a cancer center in Brazil from Sep/20-Jan/21 and from Sep/19-Jan/20. These periods were selected considering the beginning and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, which started on Feb/20 and is still ongoing. We considered the period (Sep/20-Jan/21) to be representative of the pandemic impact on cancer diagnosis. The primary endpoint was BC and CC stages at diagnosis. CC staging was defined according to 2018 FIGO staging. Clinical or pathological (for those with upfront surgery) BC stage was defined according to the TNM anatomic stage from AJCC 8th edition. The comparison of cancer stages between the two periods was performed using Chi-Square test. Results: 268 BC pts and 44 CC pts had their first consult from Sep/20-Jan/21;457 and 60, respectively, occurred from Sep/19-Jan/20. Pts who attended their first consult during the pandemic period presented with higher BC (P<0.001) and CC (P=0.328) stages than those prior to the pandemic, although the difference was not statistically significant for cervical cancer. The proportion of CC pts diagnosed with locally advanced disease (stages III-IVA) was 56.8% (N=25) in Sep/20-Jan/21 compared to 43.3% (N=26) in Sep/19-Jan/20. Similarly, 37.3% (N=100) of BC pts had stage III disease in Sep/20-Jan/21 compared to 23.2% (N=106) in Sep/19-Jan/20. Fewer pts were diagnosed with stage I BC during the pandemic (9.3% vs 20.6%). Additionally, fewer BC pts were diagnosed due to screening tests during the pandemic (13.7%;N=36) than before it (25.5%;N=113) (P<0.001). Conclusions: BC and CC pts presented with a higher stage in their first consultation at a cancer center during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to a similar period prior to the pandemic, confirming the long-term negative impact of the pandemic for oncologic pts.

Due to harvest facility slowdowns and shutdowns, many market animals, including beef cattle, were on feed greater than 60 d past their optimal endpoint. These dramatic changes caused many changes in feeding and growth technologies management. The two major growth enhancing compounds used in feedlot cattle production are steroidal implants (IMP) and -adrenergic agonists (-AA). Implementation of -AA during the pandemic was extremely difficult due to the lack of knowledge on exact shipping dates. The -AA are fed the last 28 to 42 d on feed. Ractopamine was approved for cattle with essential a 12-h withdrawal. Many questions arose about the maximum length of withdrawal on ractopamine before losing any of the added growth response in both the live animal and carcass. Many feedlot operators relied on IMP administration to achieve added growth response in cattle held for longer days on feed. With zero-day withdrawal on implants, it was a cost-effective means to hold cattle in an efficient manner. Many producers simply could not manage -AA feeding during the pandemic period and used other management technologies to enhance growth and efficiency during the end of the feeding period.","output":"219 Managing Beef Cattle Growth Amidst a Global Pandemic: Lessons Learned from 2020 and Strategies for the Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the relationship between US stock market returns (S&P500) and three indicators of the market, namely implied volatility, implied correlation and liquidity.

All scores are proposed for the estimation of survival probability after ECMO treatment for severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. METHODS: Data from 51 patients (2008 to 2013) were analyzed in this retrospective single-center study. A calculation of an adapted PRESERVE score, the RESP score as well as the score developed for externally retrieved ECMO patients was performed. RESULTS: Seventy one percent of patients received veno-venous (v-v) and 29% venous-arterial (v-a) ECMO support during the study period. Overall survival at 6 months was 55%, with a 61% survival rate for v-v cannulated patients and a 40% survival rate for v-a cannulated patients. The PRESERVE score discriminated survivors and non-survivors with an area under the curve of 0.67 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.82, P = 0.03). Analyzing survival prediction according to cannulation modus, the PRESERVE score and the RESP score significantly predicted survival for patients on v-v ECMO with an area under the curve of 0.75 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.92, P = 0.01) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.95, P = 0.035), respectively, while the scoring system developed for externally retrieved ECMO patients failed to predict survival in our study population. All scores failed to predict mortality for patients on v-a ECMO.

The SOCS family regulates the differentiation and function of CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and regulatory T cells, and is involved in immune tolerance, anergy, and exhaustion. SPRED family proteins have been shown to inactivate Ras by recruiting the Ras-GTPase neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) protein. Human genetic analysis has shown that SOCS family members are strongly associated with autoimmune diseases, allergies, and tumorigenesis, and SPRED1 is involved in NF1-like syndromes and tumors.

Confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The primary outcome was a composite measure of maternal mortality and morbidity including admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS 388 singleton pregnancies tested positive to SARS-COV-2 at RT-PCR nasal and pharyngeal swab were included in the study. The primary outcome was observed in 47/388 women (12.1%). 43/388 women (11.1%) were admitted to ICU, 36/388 (9.3%) required mechanical ventilation, and 3/388 women deceased (0.8%). Of the 388 women included in the study, 122 (31.4%) were still pregnant at the time of the study. Among the other 266 women, 6 had spontaneous first-trimester abortion, 3 had elective termination of pregnancy, 6 had stillbirth, and 251 delivered a live-born infant.

Methods: The PubMed database up to September 10, 2020 was searched for questionnaire-based studies conducted in PwE during the COVID-19 emergency, and the literature retrieved was reviewed. In addition, all patients who had a telephone consultation with our center between May 7 and July 31, 2020 were invited to fill in a 57-item online questionnaire focusing on epilepsy and comorbidities, any changes in lifestyle or clinical conditions and any emergency-related problems arising during the COVID-19 emergency, and their views on telemedicine.

It is imperative that internal medicine (IM) and emergency medicine (EM) specialists are competent in ECG interpretation. Our study was designed to improve proficiency in ECG interpretation through a competition among IM and EM residents at a teaching hospital in rural central Haiti in which over 40% of all admissions are due to CVD. METHODOLOGY: The 33 participants included 17 EM residents and 16 IM residents from each residency year at the H?pital Universitaire de Mirebalais (HUM). Residents were divided into 11 groups of 3 participants with a representative from each residency year and were given team-based online ECG quizzes to complete weekly. The format included 56 ECG cases distributed over 11 weeks, and each case had a pre-specified number of points based on abnormal findings and complexity. All ECG cases represented cardiovascular pathology in Haiti adapted from the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine evaluation list. The main intervention was sharing group performance and ECG solutions to all participants each week to promote competition and self-study without specific feedback or discussion by experts. To assess impact, pre- and post-intervention assessments measuring content knowledge and comfort for each participant were performed. RESULTS: Overall group participation was heterogeneous with groups participating a median of 54.5% of the weeks (range 0C100%). 22 residents completed the pre- and post-test assessments. The mean pre- and post-intervention assessment knowledge scores improved from 27.3% to 41.7% (p = 0.004). 70% of participants improved their test scores. The proportion of participants who reported comfort with ECG interpretation increased from 57.6% to 66.7% (p = 0.015).

Collected information including 1) demographic data; 2) amount, type, and source of startup funding; first extramural grant; and first R01-equivalent independent grant; 3) starting and current salaries; and 4) Likert-scale measurements of career satisfaction were analyzed using multivariate regression. RESULTS: Ninety-eight clinician-scientists in ophthalmology were surveyed across different ages (mean: 48  11 years), research categories, institutional types, geographic regions, and academic ranks. Median startup funding ranged from $50-99k, and median starting salaries ranged from $150-199k. A majority of investigators (67%) received their first extramural award from the National Eye Institute, mainly through K-award mechanisms (82%). The median time to receiving their first independent grant was 8 years, mainly through an R01 award (70%). Greater institutional startup support (P = .027) and earlier extramural grant success (P = .022) were associated with earlier independent funding.

Covid-19 has led to disruption to the care of MS in Saudi Arabia as elsewhere. The Expert panel considered a DMT's overall tolerability/safety profile to be the most important consideration on whether or not to prescribe at this time. Treatment can be started or continued with interferon, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, or natalizumab, as these DMTs are not associated with increased risk of infection (there was no consensus on the initiation of other DMTs).

No DMT should be imitated in a patient with active Covid-19, and (only) interferon beta could be continued in the case of Covid-19 infection. Vaccination against Covid-19 is a therapeutic priority for people with MS. New treatment should be delayed for 2C4 weeks for vaccination. Where treatment is already ongoing, vaccination against Covid-19 should be administered immediately without disruption of treatment (first-line DMTs, natalizumab, fingolimod), when lymphocytes have recovered sufficiently (cladribine tablets, alemtuzumab) or 4 months after the last dose (ocrelizumab).

The residues of the -hairpin motif (residues 138C158), an extension of two -strands of the C-terminal -barrel of HAV 3C are critical for the interactions between the enzyme and the tetrapeptide portion of these inhibitors that are analogous to the residues at the P4 to P1 positions in the natural substrates of picornaviral 3C proteinases. Unexpectedly, the S of Cys172 forms two covalent bonds with each inhibitor, yielding an unusual episulfide cation (thiiranium ring) stabilized by a nearby oxyanion. This result suggests a mechanism of inactivation of 3C peptidases by methyl ketone inhibitors that is distinct from that occurring in the structurally related serine proteinases or in the papain-like cysteine peptidases.

However, such observations lack empirical support. Here we examined whether COVID-19 lockdown conditions encouraged greater perceptions of continuing structural racism together with motivational and behavioral support for social justice, and whether guilt or empathic concern undergirded such responses. A national sample of White South Africans data suggests that the pandemic served as a natural intervention, fostering greater acknowledgement of structural racism and support for redress through increased awareness of historical privilege and guilt in response to Black hardship. Guilt furthermore predicted a social justice motivation in relief efforts, whereas empathic concern predicted only charity motivation. These results suggest that White guilt is more consequential than empathic concern in contributing to structural reform but would require longer-term processes to support the translation of its motivational push into sustainable contributions to social justice.

People living with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) are considered potentially vulnerable to the mental health effects of the pandemic, as they may be subject to increased social isolation. AIM: : To systematically review the current evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes among PwMS. METHOD: : We searched four major databases (Medline, EMBASE, PsychInfo and Scopus) and the WHO Global Health COVID-19 research database. We included peer-reviewed primary research studies using validated health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and psychometric screening tools to evaluate mental health outcomes among PwMS during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies reporting data on the prevalence of mental health disorders, severity of psychological symptoms and contributing demographic and clinical factors for PwMS during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. RESULTS: : Our initial search yielded 268 records; 19 studies (13 cross-sectional, 6 longitudinal) were included. Most were conducted during a peak in the pandemic in the host country via an online platform. The main mental health outcomes were depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality and HRQOL. The included studies used a variety of outcome assessment tools and study designs. The prevalence of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and stress were high among PwMS during the pandemic. In addition, compared to control populations, PwMS experienced more severe symptoms of depression and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, results from longitudinal studies demonstrate that the severity of mental health symptoms among PwMS during the pandemic were not significantly different compared with the pre-pandemic period. CONCLUSION: : Although mental health issues such as anxiety and depression were common among PwMS during the pandemic, current evidence suggests that mental health among PwMS has not been significantly affected by pandemic-related restrictive measures. Instead, the observed differences may be the result of pre-pandemic differences in prevalence and severity. Where possible, future studies should seek to address the methodological issues identified in the included studies to ensure that data collected during the pandemic can be synthesized into recommendations for policy and practice.","output":"Psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on individuals living with multiple sclerosis: a rapid systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has changed the life of the planet.

We created a tubes service in an effort to provide more timely nutrition in a safe manner to improve quality of care. We aimed to reduce risk of adverse events as well as to provide more timely nutrition safely by also minimizing radiation from x-ray. Methods: We piloted the enteral nutrition platform with GI fellow placement of NG/post pyloric feeding tubes under direct visualization without use of endoscopy for failed blind bedside NG placements. A data collection form was created to measure results (Figure1a). We incorporated the Resource Intensive Care (RIC) Nurses onto our team. GI provided an in-service for critical care staff on the enteral nutrition platform. The RIC Nurse service went live after each nurse was deemed competent based on a competency evaluation developed by the GI lead physician (Figure1b). Collaboration with IT Services for use of this platform to capture images of proper placement was confirmed for medical record documentation and for reduction of x-ray usage. GI will support failed attempts endoscopically. Results: GI fellows placed 50 tubes with no adverse events from February 2020 - December 2020. This number excludes 3 months of the initial pandemic period and excluded COVID 1 patients. Average time from consult to placement was 9 hours compared to reported time from consult to blind placement averaging 21 hours. From March -April 2021, 16 (100%) tubes were placed successfully in the ICUs by our dedicated RIC nurse team. One attempt was hindered due to hiatal hernia. Average times from consult to placement averaged 4 hours. Conclusion: Bedside placement of feeding tubes with built-in camera technology allows for a safer, more effective, and more efficient method for delivery of enteral nutrition for inpatients. A cost/ benefit analysis shows a potential $840.20 in savings per patient with decreased need for x-rays, decreased risk of adverse events, earlier time to feeding and decreased length of stay. Out of 66 successful placements, it is an estimated total potential savings of $55,453.

However, due to the complexity of its instrumental assessment in critically ill patients, the data available in the literature on specific manifestations of endothelial dysfunction are very contradictory. The objective: to determine the most characteristic capillaroscopic signs of microvascular disorders and to assess the state of microcirculation regulation in patients with severe COVID-19. Subjects and Methods. When admitted to the intensive care unit, 60 patients with COVID-19 and 12 patients with chronic cardiovascular pathology without COVID-19 (Comparison Group) were examined. All patients underwent microscopy of the microcirculatory bed of finger nail bed;the following parameters were assessed: diameters of the venous, arterial and transitional parts of capillaries, height of capillary loops, density of capillaries per 1 mm of the length of the perivascular zone, the average linear velocity of capillary blood flow (LVCBF), and thickness of the perivascular zone. The presence of avascular zones, the number of capillaries in the visualized field with circulating aggregates in the lumen, and the shape of capillaries were taken into account. In addition, an occlusion test using laser Doppler flowmetry was performed in 32 patients with COVID-19. The maximum post-occlusive increase in blood flow at the moment of cuff deflation was assessed, as well as changes in the mean value of post-occlusive blood flow relative to the baseline within 3 minutes after cuff deflation. Results. In 53 (88.3%) patients with COVID-19, abnormalities corresponding to chronic microcirculatory changes in the form of predominance of pathological capillary forms were detected. Microaggregates in the lumen of capillaries and decreased linear velocity of blood flow were revealed in 100% of cases. When comparing groups of patients with different outcomes, statistically significant differences were revealed between the LVCBF parameters (in the survivors - 354.35  44.78 pm/sec, in the deceased - 278.4  26.59 pm/sec), as well as between the values of the perivascular zones thickness (95.35  15.96 microns versus 159.93  19.90 microns). The results of the post-occlusion test revealed a significant difference between the groups in terms of the maximum post-occlusion gain (39.42  3.85 BPU in the group with a favorable outcome, 27.69  3.19 BPU in the group with an unfavorable outcome, 47.23  1.78 BPU in the control group). In both groups, there was no increase in this parameter relative to the initial blood flow. At the same time, in the control group, the average index of post-occlusive blood flow was higher than the initial level. Conclusions. Acute microcirculation disorders with decreased linear velocity of capillary blood flow, circulation of aggregates, increased thickness of the perivascular zone were detected in all patients with severe COVID-19 but especially in those with unfavorable outcomes. Vascular tone regulation disorders were manifested by the absence of reactive hyperemia in response to acute ischemia, as well as a decrease in maximal flow-induced increase. These changes fit into the concept of endothelial dysfunction.

We evaluated the impact of the pandemic on ED visits at an academic tertiary care center. METHODS: We conducted an observational health records review between January 1CApril 22, 2020, comparing characteristics of all ED visits between pre- and post-pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization. Measures included triage acuity, presenting complaints, final diagnoses, disposition, and mortality. We further examined three time-sensitive final diagnoses: stroke; sepsis; and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). RESULTS: In this analysis, we included 44,497 ED visits. Average daily ED visits declined from 458.1 to 289.0 patients/day (?36.9%). For the highest acuity triaged patients there was a drop of 1.1 patients/day (?24.9%). Daily ED visits related to respiratory complaints increased post-pandemic (+14.1%) while ED visits for many other complaints decreased, with the greatest decline in musculoskeletal (?52.5%) and trauma (?53.6%).

Only one region, Daegu-Gyeongbuk (DG), had a significant number of infections, traced to a religious sect.

We find that a one per thousand increase in infections causes a 2 to 3 percent drop in local employment. Non-causal estimates of this coefficient from the US and UK, which implemented large-scale lockdowns, range from 5 to 6 percent, suggesting that at most half of the job losses in the US and UK can be attributed to lockdowns. We also find that employment losses caused by local outbreaks in the absence of lockdowns are (i) mainly due to reduced hiring by small establishments, (ii) concentrated in the accommodation/food, education, real estate, and transportation industries, and (iii) worst for the economically vulnerable workers who are less educated, young, in low-wage occupations, and on temporary contracts, even controlling for industry effects. All these patterns are similar to what we observe in the US and UK: The unequal effects of COVID-19 are the same with or without lockdowns.

Several reports have shown that cross-reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 also exist in people unexposed to this virus. However, the neutralizing activity of cross-reactive antibodies is controversial. Here, we subjected plasma samples from SARS-CoV-2-unexposed elderly Korean people (n = 119) to bead-based IgG antibody analysis. SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit-reactive IgG antibody analysis detected positive signals in some samples (59 of 119, 49.6%). SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-reactive antibody levels were most significantly correlated with human coronavirus-HKU1 S1 subunit-reactive antibody levels. To check the neutralizing activity of plasma samples, the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotype neutralizing assay was used. However, the levels of cross-reactive antibodies did not correlate with neutralizing activity. Instead, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection was neutralized by some RBD-reactive plasma samples (n = 9, neutralization  25%, P  0.05), but enhanced by other RBD-reactive plasma samples (n = 4, neutralization  -25%, P  0.05). Interestingly, the blood plasma groups with enhancing and neutralizing effects had high levels of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive antibodies than the plasma group that had no effect. These results suggest that some SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive antibodies from pre-pandemic elderly people exert two opposing functions during SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection.

Efficacy of telephone appointments was assessed through prospective review of clinic coding to evaluate outcomes including rate of conversion to face-to-face appointment. Markers of treatment pathway efficacy included time from referral to surgical listing and the incidence of benign lesions placed on skin cancer pathways. Productivity was evaluated through review of the cumulative number of completed and missed appointments over a one-month period before and during the pandemic.

The patients who died generally had a sustained increase in their leukocyte and neutrophil levels and biochemical variables, and an ongoing decrease in lymphopenia and eosinopenia levels. Although significant changes were observed in liver function tests, cardiac troponin, hemogram values, kidney function tests and parameters related to inflammation in deceased patients, high ESR, international-normalized-ratio (INR), prothrombin-time (PT), CRP, D-dimer, ferritin and red-cell-distribution width (RDW) values, respectively, were the most effective predictive mortality risk biomarkers of COVID-19. In addition, neutrophilia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, erythrocytopenia were other risk predictors of mortality.

The introduction of a specific prion-binding ligand gel in combination with SD treatment, time-reduced from 4 to 1-1.5 h, still ensures efficient virus kill, reduces abnormal prion protein by >5 log steps, and preserves levels of plasmin inhibitor at close to the reference range. Infections with known non-enveloped viruses such as HAV or parvovirus B19 are prevented by ensuring low virus loads in the starting plasma units, dilution through pooling of single plasma units, and neutralization of immune antibodies already present in the initial plasma pools. The major advantages of SD plasma over fresh frozen plasma and the other pathogen-inactivated plasmas are its extreme safety with respect to transfusion-related acute lung injury and the significantly lower likelihood of provoking allergic reactions. Both advantages are best interpreted as results of the dilution effect of pooling. No fewer than 18 clinical studies covering all indications for plasma, and extensive clinical experience have shown that reduced levels of coagulation factors and inhibitors as a result of SD treatment do not impair significantly the clinical efficacy or tolerance of plasma. Properly standardized clotting factor and inhibitor potencies and low batch-to-batch variations when compared with single-donor plasma units makes SD plasma more suitable for standardized treatment.","output":"The Use of Solvent/Detergent Treatment in Pathogen Reduction of Plasma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacillus subtilis is recognized as a safe and reliable human and animal probiotic and is associated with bioactivities such as production of vitamin and immune stimulation. Additionally, it has great potential to be used as an alternative to antimicrobial drugs, which is significant in the context of antibiotic abuse in food animal production. In this study, we isolated one strain of B. subtilis, named WS-1, from apparently healthy pigs growing with sick cohorts on one Escherichia coli endemic commercial pig farm in Guangdong, China. WS-1 can strongly inhibit the growth of pathogenic E. coli in vitro. The B. subtilis strain WS-1 showed typical Bacillus characteristics by endospore staining, biochemical test, enzyme activity analysis, and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Genomic analysis showed that the B. subtilis strain WS-1 shares 100% genomic synteny with B. subtilis with a size of 4,088,167 bp. Importantly, inoculation of newborn piglets with 1.5  1010 CFU of B. subtilis strain WS-1 by oral feeding was able to clearly inhibit diarrhea (p < 0.05) and death (p < 0.05) caused by pathogenic E. coli in piglets. Furthermore, histopathological results showed that the WS-1 strain could protect small intestine from lesions caused by E. coli infection. Collectively, these findings suggest that the probiotic B. subtilis strain WS-1 acts as a potential biocontrol agent protecting pigs from pathogenic E. coli infection. Importance: In this work, one B. subtilis strain (WS-1) was successfully isolated from apparently healthy pigs growing with sick cohorts on one E. coli endemic commercial pig farm in Guangdong, China. The B. subtilis strain WS-1 was identified to inhibit the growth of pathogenic E. coli both in vitro and in vivo, indicating its potential application in protecting newborn piglets from diarrhea caused by E. coli infections. The isolation and characterization will help better understand this bacterium, and the strain WS-1 can be further explored as an alternative to antimicrobial drugs to protect human and animal health.","output":"A Newly Isolated Bacillus subtilis Strain Named WS-1 Inhibited Diarrhea and Death Caused by Pathogenic Escherichia coli in Newborn Piglets."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused temporary drops in the supply of organs for transplantation, leading to renewed debate about whether T2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients should receive priority during these times. The aim of this study was to provide a quantitative model to aid decision-making in liver transplantation for T2 HCC. We proposed a novel ethical framework where the individual transplant benefit for a T2 HCC patient should outweigh the harm to others on the waiting list, determining a \\"net benefit\\", to define appropriate organ allocation. This ethical framework was then translated into a quantitative Markov model including Italian averages for waiting list characteristics, donor resources, mortality, and transplant rates obtained from a national prospective database (n = 8567 patients). The net benefit of transplantation in a T2 HCC patient in a usual situation varied from 0 life months with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 15, to 34 life months with a MELD score of 40, while it progressively decreased with acute organ shortage during a pandemic (i.e., with a 50% decrease in organs, the net benefit varied from 0 life months with MELD 30, to 12 life months with MELD 40). Our study supports the continuation of transplantation for T2 HCC patients during crises such as COVID-19; however, the focus needs to be on those T2 HCC patients with the highest net survival benefit.","output":"Liver Transplantation for T2 Hepatocellular Carcinoma during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Novel Model Balancing Individual Benefit against Healthcare Resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1244 Table 1Comparison of average HbA1c(mmol/mol) pre- and post-lockdown grouped by baseline HbA1cGroup Number of Subjects Pre-LD (1) Post-LD (2) Av-Post-LD (3) Improved 1C2 Improved 1C3 Improved 2C3 >69 38 86.67 76.94 76.49 Yes Yes Yes 64C69 25 65.69 61.82 61.07 Yes Yes Yes 58C63 44 60.14 58.31 59.78 Yes Yes No 53C57 23 55.35 54.23 54.63 Yes Yes No 48C52 18 50.51 52.25 52.59 No No No <48 13 42.07 44.24 46.50 No No No In the four groups with the highest initial HbA1c, improvements were seen when comparing Pre-LD to both Post-LD and Av-Post-LD, with the >69 group improving by 9.73mmol/mol and 10.18mmol/mol respectively.

Treatment of CPTP has been a clinical challenge and the underlying mechanisms of CPTP remain elusive. Recently, sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling has been shown to be associated with various pain states but its role in the pathogenesis of CPTP is still unclear. Methods: CPTP was induced in rats by thoracotomy. Rats were divided into CPTP group and non-CPTP group based on the mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT). Rats were administered with Shh signaling inhibitor cyclopamine and activator smoothened agonist (SAG), and then evaluated by MWT and cold allodynia testing. The expressions of Shh signaling (Shh ligand, patched and smoothened receptor, Gli transcription factors), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (Trk-B), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt) in rat T4-5 spinal cord dorsal horn (SDH) were detected by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results: The expression of Shh signaling significantly increased and the BDNF/TrkB pathway was activated in T4-5 SDH of CPTP rats. Cyclopamine attenuated hyperalgesia and down-regulated the expressions of Gil1, BDNF, p-TrkB, p-PI3K and p-Akt in CPTP rats. SAG induced hyperalgesia in non-CPTP rats and elevated the expressions of Gil1, BDNF, p-TrkB, p-PI3K and p-Akt. Conclusion: Shh signaling may contribute to CPTP via activating BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway, and inhibition of Shh signaling may effectively alleviate CPTP.","output":"Sonic Hedgehog Signaling Contributes to Chronic Post-Thoracotomy Pain via Activating BDNF/TrkB Pathway in Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radioiodine therapy can be used in differentiated thyroid carcinoma and requires extensive evaluation to ensure effectiveness and safety.

Case report: In a 65-year old patient with arterial hypertension and hyperlipidemia electrical conversion of persistent atrial flutter to sinus rhythm was achieved. The patient has had atrial flutter for about a year. He also suffered from COVID-19 pneumonia infection 2 months before being admitted to the hospital. In spite of sinus rhythm after the electrical conversion that was seen on twelve-lead electrocardiography, 48 hours after conversion no mechanical left atrial activity was restored. MV inflow demonstrated normal E wave (passive filling in early diastole) but absent A wave (atrial contraction during late diastole). TDI at the MV annulus also confirmed isolated mechanical LA standstill. There was absence of a at the MV annulus. Conclusion: Atrial standstill is condition that may involve impairment of electrical function (electrical silence or an inability to pace or capture), or mechanical function (based on imaging).1,2 The pathophysiologic mechanism can be the underlying presence of atrial fibrosis, myopathy or it may include interatrial block.3 The absence of mechanical LA contraction has potential hemodynamic consequences, also there could be the possibility for the thrombus formation within the atria leading to thromboembolism.

Many of these mutations are expected to increase immune evasion, thus making breakthrough cases and re-infection more common. Methods From June 2020 to December 2021 serial blood samples (initial post recovery, 6 months, 12 months) were collected from a COVID-19 convalescent cohort in Boston, MA. Plasma was isolated for use in Mesoscale Discovery based antibody binding assays. Unvaccinated donors or those vaccinated prior to the primary blood draw were excluded from this analysis, as were those who did not have at least two blood draws. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare pre- and post-vaccination titers and antibody response against different variants, while McNemar tests were used to compare the proportions of achieving  4 fold increases against different variants. Findings Forty-eight COVID convalescent donors with post-infection vaccination (hybrid immunity) were studied to evaluate the levels of cross-reactive antibodies pre- and post- vaccination against various SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD proteins. Vaccination with BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 or Ad26.COV2.S led to a 6.3 to 7.8 fold increase in anti-Spike antibody titers and a 70 to 74 fold increase in anti-WT, Alpha and Delta RBD antibody. However, a lower response was observed for Beta and Omicron RBDs with only 7/48 (15%) and 15/48 (31%) donors having a 4 fold increase in post-vaccination titers against Beta and Omicron RBDs. Structural analysis of the Beta and Omicron RBDs reveal a shared immune escape strategy involving residues K417-E484-N501 that is exploited by these variants of concern. Interpretation Through mutations of the K417-E484-N501 triad, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to evade neutralization by the class I/II anti-RBD antibody fraction of hybrid immunity plasma as the polyclonal antibody response post-vaccination shows limitations in the ability to solve the structural requirements to bind the mutant RBDs.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of the national program following implementation in Grand Bassa County in 2018 using data from population-based surveys. We measured before-to-after changes in childhood treatment from qualified providers in a portion of the county that implemented in a first phase compared to those which had not yet implemented. We also assessed changes in whether children received oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea and malaria rapid diagnostic tests if they had a fever by a qualified provider (facility based or CHW). For these analyses, we used a difference-in-differences approach and adjusted for potential confounding using inverse probability of treatment weighting. We also assessed changes in the source from which care was received and examined changes by key dimensions of equity (distance from health facilities, maternal education, and household wealth). We found that treatment of childhood illness by a qualified provider increased by 60.3 percentage points (95%CI 44.7-76.0) more in intervention than comparison areas. Difference-in-differences for oral rehydration therapy and malaria rapid diagnostic tests were 37.6 (95%CI 19.5-55.8) and 38.5 (95%CI 19.9-57.0) percentage points, respectively. In intervention areas, treatment by a CHW increased from 0 to 81.6% and care from unqualified providers dropped. Increases in treatment by a qualified provider did not vary significantly by household wealth, remoteness, or maternal education.

METHODS: Retrospective review of attendances (0C18 years) over the initial pandemic (2 March 2020C3 May 2020) compared with 2019. Outcome measures included number of attendances, referral source, presenting complaint, discharge diagnosis and disposal. Descriptive statistics with subgroup analysis by age/sex/ethnicity and pandemic time periods (pre-lockdown, lockdown weeks 1C3 and lockdown weeks 4C6) was performed. RESULTS: 4417 attendances (57% illness and 43% injuries) occurred, compared with 8813 (57% illness and 43% injuries), a reduction of 50%, maximal in lockdown week 2 (?73%). Ranking of top three illness presentations changed across the pandemic weeks. Breathing difficulty dropped from first (300, 25%) to second (117, 21%) to third (59, 11%) (p<0.001).

Adolescence and early adulthood are peak times for the onset of mental health difficulties. Exposure to a pandemic during this vulnerable developmental period places young people at significant risk of negative psychological experiences. The objective of this research was to summarise existing evidence on the potential impact of a pandemic on the mental health of 12C25 year olds. METHODS: A rapid review of the published peer-reviewed literature, published between 1985 and 2020, using PsycINFO (Proquest) and Medline (Proquest) was conducted. Narrative synthesis was used across studies to identify key themes and concepts. RESULTS: This review found 3,359 papers, which was reduced to 12 papers for data extraction. Results regarding the prevalence of psychological difficulties in youth were mixed, with some studies finding this group experience heightened distress during an infectious disease outbreak, and others finding no age differences or higher distress among adults.

To data, although some vaccines have been developed, there are no ideal drugs to treat novel coronavirus pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)). By examining the structure of the coronavirus and briefly describing its possible pathogenesis based on recent autopsy reports conducted by various teams worldwide, this review analyzes the possible structural and functional changes of the human body upon infection with SARS-CoV-2. We observed that the most prominent pathological changes in COVID-19 patients are diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) of the lungs and microthrombus formation, resulting in an imbalance of the ventilation/perfusion ratio and respiratory failure. Although direct evidence of viral infection can also be found in other organs and tissues, the viral load is relatively small. The conclusion that the injuries of the extra-pulmonary organs are directly caused by the virus needs further investigation.","output":"Structural and physiological changes of the human body upon SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Problem-based learning (PBL) emphasizes learning behavior that leads to critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and collaborative skills in preparing students for a professional medical career.

Internationally, cases in newborns are few and the outcomes, in general, are good. There is no certainty of possible vertical transmission, and the presence of the virus in human milk is improbable. The gold standard for diagnosis is the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. We performed a literature review and presented a case of perinatal COVID-19. Clinical case: We describe the case of a full-term male infant with a birth weight of 3450 g and history of rooming-in with another mother-baby pair, both positive for SARS-CoV-2. On the second day of life, the neonate developed pneumonia, with clinical, X-ray and ultrasound diagnostic confirmation. On the third day of life, RT-PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2; the mother was also positive but remained asymptomatic. The patient required mechanical ventilation and was transferred to a tertiary level neonatal unit on day 5 of life, where congenital heart disease was ruled out. He evolved satisfactorily with a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on day 8 and was extubated and discharged on day 21 of life. Telephone follow-up was performed without complications.

To date, however, there are few reports of prescribing in relation to COVID-19 in Pakistan. Herein, we describe a point prevalence survey of antibiotic prescribing amongst patients hospitalized with suspected or proven COVID-19 in Pakistan. A Point Prevalence Survey (PPS) was undertaken in seven tertiary care health facilities in Punjab Provence, Pakistan. Baseline information about antimicrobial use according to the World Health Organization (WHO) standardized methodology was collected on a single day between 5th and 30 April 2021. A total of 617 patients' records were reviewed and 578 (97.3%) were documented to be receiving an antibiotic on the day of the survey. The majority (84.9%) were COVID-19 PCR positive, 61.1% were male and 34.9% were age 36 to 44 years. One quarter presented with severe disease, and cardiovascular disease was the major comorbidity in 13%. Secondary bacterial infection or co-infection (bacterial infection concurrent with COVID-19) was identified in only 1.4%. On the day of the survey, a mean of 1.7 antibiotics was prescribed per patient and 85.4% antibiotics were recorded as being prescribed for 'prophylaxis'. The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were azithromycin (35.6%), ceftriaxone (32.9%) and meropenem (7.6%). The majority (96.3%) of the antibiotics were empirical and all were from WHO Watch or Reserve categories. Overall, a very high consumption of antibiotics in patients hospitalized with suspected or proven COVID-19 was observed in Pakistan and this is concerning in view of already high rates of antimicrobial resistance in the region.

MethodsWe enrolled 365 healthcare workers (250 women, 115 men) whose 3-month antibody titres were analyzed in our previous study and whose blood samples were collected 183 {+/-} 15 days after the second dose. Participant characteristics collected previously were used. The relationships of these factors with antibody titres at 6 months and rates of change in antibody titres during 3-6 months were analyzed. ResultsMedian age was 44 years. Median antibody titre at 6 months was 539 U/mL. Older participants had significantly lower antibody titres (20s, 752 U/mL; 60s-70s, 365 U/mL). In age-adjusted analysis, smoking was the only factor associated with lower antibody titres. Median rate of change in antibody titres during 3-6 months was -29.4%. The only factor significantly associated with the rate of change in Ab titres was not age or smoking, but sex (women, -31.6%; men, -25.1%). ConclusionThe most important factors associated with lower antibody titres at 6 months were age and smoking, as at 3 months, probably reflecting their effect on peak antibody titres. However, antibody titres significantly attenuated during 3-6 months in women alone, which reduced the sex difference in antibody titres seen during the first 3 months.

HCV vaccine development has faltered largely because the extreme diversity of the virus limits the protective breadth of vaccine elicited antibodies. It is believed that the principle neutralizing epitope in natural infection, HVR1, which is the most variable epitope in HCV, mediates humoral immune escape. So far, efforts to circumvent HVR1 interference in the induction and function of conserved targeting Ab have failed. Efforts to understand factors contributing to cross-neutralization of HVR1 variants have also been limited. Here, following mouse immunizations with two patient-derived HVR1 peptides, we observe cross-genotype neutralization of variants differing at 15/21 positions. Surprisingly, sequence similarity was not associated with cross-neutralization. It appeared neutralization sensitivity was an intrinsic feature of each variant, rather than emergent from the immunogen specific Ab response. These findings provide novel insight into HVR1-mediated immune evasion, with important implications for HCV vaccine design.","output":"Role of HVR1 sequence similarity in the cross-genotypic neutralization of HCV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, many governments suspended outdoor activities and imposed social distancing policies to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These measures have had severe impact on the economy and peoples' daily lives. An alternative to widespread lockdowns is effective contact tracing during an outbreak's early stage. However, mathematical models suggest that epidemic control for SARS-CoV-2 transmission with manual contact tracing is implausible. To reduce the effort of contact tracing, many digital contact tracing projects (e.g., PEPP-PT, DP-3T, TCN, BlueTrace, Google/Apple Exposure Notification, and East/West Coast PACT) are being developed to supplement manual contact tracing. However, digital contact tracing has drawn scrutiny from privacy advocates, since governments or other parties may attempt to use contact tracing protocols for mass surveillance. As a result, many digital contact tracing projects build privacy-preserving mechanisms to limit the amount of privacy-sensitive information leaked by the protocol. In this paper, we examine how these architectures resist certain classes of attacks, specifically DoS attacks, and present BlindSignedIDs, a privacy-preserving digital contact tracing mechanism, which are verifiable ephemeral identifiers to limit the effectiveness of MAC-compliant DoS attacks. In our evaluations, we showed BlindSignedID can effectively deny bogus EphIDs, mitigating DoS attacks on the local storage beyond 90% of stored EphIDs.

There was significant evidence that CAT and the SARS-CoV-2-related S protein binding protein ACE2 interact with each other. Intracellular localization results showed that CAT and ACE2 proteins both exists in the cell membrane and extracellular area and their interaction could have an impact on the cell invasion ability of S protein. In addition, the expression of these three genes showed a significant positive correlation in the lungs.

HIV proteins such as Vif and Vpx mediate the degradation of the host proteins APOBEC3 and SAMHD1, respectively, through the proteasome pathway. However, whether deubiquitylating enzymes play an essential role in HIV-1 infection is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the deubiquitinase, USP21, potently inhibits HIV-1 production by indirectly downregulating the expression of HIV-1 trans-activator of transcription (Tat), which is essential for transcriptional elongation in HIV-1. USP21 deubiquitylates Tat via its deubiquitinase activity, but a stronger ability to reduce Tat expression compared to Ub-KO showed that other mechanisms may contribute to USP21-mediated inhibition of Tat. Further investigation showed that USP21 downregulates cyclin T1 mRNA levels by increasing methylation of histone K9 in the promoter of cyclin T1, a subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) that interacts with Tat and transactivation response element (TAR) and is required for transcription stimulation and Tat stability. Moreover, USP21 had no effect on the function of other HIV-1 accessory proteins, including Vif, Vpr, Vpx, and Vpu, indicating that USP21 was specific to Tat. These findings improve our understanding of USP21-mediated functional suppression of HIV-1 production.ImportanceUbiquitination plays an essential role in viral infection. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) reverse ubiquitination by cleaving ubiquitins from target proteins, thereby affecting viral infection. The role of the members of the USP family, that comprises the largest subfamily of DUBs, is largely unknown in HIV-1 infection. Here, we screened a series of USP members and found that USP21 inhibits HIV-1 production by specifically targeting Tat, but not the other HIV-1 accessory proteins. Further investigations revealed that USP21 reduces Tat expression in two ways. First, USP21 deubiquitinates polyubiquitinated Tat causing Tat instability, and second USP21 reduces the mRNA levels of cyclin T1 (CycT1), an important component of P-TEFb, that leads 56 to Tat downregulation. Thus, in this study, we report a novel role of the deubiquitinase, USP21, in HIV-1 viral infection. USP21 represents a potentially useful target for the development of novel anti-HIV drugs.","output":"Deubiquitinating enzyme USP21 inhibits HIV-1 replication by downregulating Tat expression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seven and 10-month-old infants were presented with a remote-controlled toy dog that intermittently barked at 30-sec intervals as they faced an experimenter who either attended to them (look toward condition) or looked away (look away condition).

electroconvulsive therapy units have had to confront challenges such as the infectious hazard due to aerosol-generating ventilation, or the lack of staff and material resources. Our objective was to elaborate a protocol to make ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic a safer procedure for patients and professionals. METHODS: A multidisciplinary workgroup (including mental health, anesthesia, preventive medicine, and occupational risk professionals) was formed in the Hospital Clnic de Barcelona, in March 2020. A core group conducted a review of the scientific literature and healthcare organizations guidelines and wrote a protocol draft. Then, a discussion with the workgroup was made until consensus was reached. The protocol has been continuously updated. Discussions were made by group e-mailing and video conferencing. RESULTS: The protocol includes the following main areas: 1) ECT unit's structural and functional; 2) SARS-CoV-2 screening protocol; 3) ECT clinical practice adaptation (personal protective equipment, airway management, recovery room, and maintenance of the facilities); 4) management of COVID-19 cases; and 5) protocol assessment. LIMITATIONS: The literature review was not systematic; the consensus was not based on a structured methodology. For other ECT units, local advisories may not be valid, and resource shortages (such as anesthetist availability, or the lack of respirators and PCR tests) may impede or prevent their implementation. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT should continue to be advocated as an essential medical procedure. It is recommended that each ECT unit develop its own protocol.

Cytoplasmic fluorescence was first observed at 12 hr postinfection (h.p.i) in infected HRT-18 cultures. This fluorescence coincided with the appearance of cell surface antigen reacting with colloidal gold-labeled antibodies to BCV antigens. At 24 h.p.i the amount of viral antigens at the surface of HRT-18 had increased, although cytoplasmic fluorescence remained constant. Infected BFS cells but not HRT-18 cells formed polykaryons when incubated in the presence of trypsin. One viral antigen in the plasma membrane of BFS cells was thus identified as the S glycoprotein with a fusion domain. In contrast to HRT-18 cells, the overall amount of BCV antigens at the surface of BFS cells remained constant after the onset of fusion. Analysis of the labeling characteristics established that the goldmarked-sites represented de novo expression of BCV antigen in the plasma membrane of infected cells.","output":"Bovine coronavirus antigen in the host cell plasmalemma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is part of a new series in this regular feature regarding trends in the provision of information by health science libraries.

We further sought to identify variables predictive of these autoregulation end points. METHODS Cerebral autoregulation was monitored continuously with transcranial Doppler in 614 patients during cardiopulmonary bypass enrolled in 3 investigations. A moving Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated between cerebral blood flow velocity and mean arterial pressure to generate the variable mean velocity index. Optimal mean arterial pressure was defined as the mean arterial pressure with the lowest mean velocity index indicating the best autoregulation. The lower and upper limits of cerebral blood flow autoregulation were defined as the mean arterial pressure at which mean velocity index was increasingly pressure passive (ie, mean velocity index 0.4) with declining or increasing blood pressure, respectively. RESULTS The mean ( standard deviation) lower and upper limits of cerebral blood flow autoregulation, and optimal mean arterial pressure were 65  12 mm Hg, 84  11 mm Hg, and 78  11 mm Hg, respectively, after adjusting for study enrollment. In 17% of patients, though, the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation was above this optimal mean arterial pressure, whereas in 29% of patients the upper limit of autoregulation was below the population optimal mean arterial pressure. Variables associated with optimal mean arterial pressure based on multivariate regression analysis were nonwhite race (increased 2.7 mm Hg; P = .034), diuretics use (decreased 1.9 mm Hg; P = .049), prior carotid endarterectomy (decreased 5.5 mm Hg; P = .019), and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (decreased 1.28 per 60 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass). The product of the duration and magnitude that mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass was below the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation was associated with the risk for stroke (P = .02).

This has brought about tremendous burden on the health care system of not only the developing or the third world countries but also that of prosperous counties of the world. The recent Covid-19 pandemic has pushed the worldwide scientific and medical community to find a solution with the help of vaccines to control SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. An effective vaccine is one which leads to synthesis of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, thus aiding the control and decline of the pandemic. Aim: This study aims to evaluate the antibody titres post 1st dose and post 2nd dose Covishield vaccination and reveals the safety and efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19(Recombinant) Covishield vaccine. Methodology: The levels of IgG antibodies were estimated in 215 subjects (both normal subjects and Covid-19 positive subjects) using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Technique. Results: Two hundred & fifteen subjects from Teerthanker Mahaveer Hospital of Moradabad (western Uttar Pradesh) were enrolled for the study. The participants were divided into two different groups. Group I comprised of 215 subjects who received 1st dose of the Covishield vaccine. Group II comprised of 101 subjects who received both the doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19(Recombinant) Covishield vaccine. Levels of IgG were analysed 28 days post 1st dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19(Recombinant) Covishield vaccine and post 2 nd dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19(Recombinant) Covishield vaccination. After testing serologically for neutralising IgG antibodies, the titre was found to be below the threshold level of 1.1 in 67.40% of the subjects in the study group 1, whereas 32.60% (n=70) were found to be in the seroprotective range (i.e IgG titre > 1.1). Out of the total 101 participants who took both the doses, 39 participants (38.6%) were found to be in the seroprotective range (i.e IgG titre > 1.1). Conclusion: The two doses of Covishield vaccination (4 weeks interval) given to subjects resulted in increase in IgG antibody titre (Neutralising Antibodies) against both spike protein and nucleocapsid protein after 1st dose and 2nd dose and that single dose may suffice for seroprotection in subjects with previous history of COVID-19 who had recovered from the disease.","output":"IgG Antibody Seroprevalence Post Covishield Vaccination in Western Uttar Pradesh: A Hospital Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is the most common clinical nontraumatic ONFH. Once ONFH occurs, it seriously reduces patients quality of life. The matrix metalloproteinase/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (MMP/TIMP) system was found to play a significant role in the development of ONFH. The aim of this study was to identify the associations between 7 genes selected from the MMP/TIMP system and steroid-induced ONFH. METHODS: We genotyped 34 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 7 genes selected from the MMP/TIMP system in a caseCcontrol study with 285 cases of steroid-induced ONFH and 308 healthy controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the chi-squared test, genetic model analysis, haplotype analysis, and stratification analysis. RESULTS: We found that the minor alleles of rs1940475 and rs11225395 in MMP8 were associated with a 1.32-fold increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH in the allelic model analysis (P = 0.021 and 0.022, respectively). In the genetic model analysis, we found that rs3740938, rs2012390, rs1940475, and rs11225395 were associated with an increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH. In further stratification analysis, rs3740938 and rs2012390 displayed a significantly increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH in females under the dominant (rs3740938, OR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.50C4.83, P = 0.001; rs2012390, OR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.31C4.03, P = 0.012) and additive (rs3740938, OR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.24C3.29, P = 0.010; rs2012390, OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.12C2.80, P = 0.047) models.

Since then, BC has consistently reported the highest overdose death rates of any province in Canada. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, overdose deaths in BC reached a record high in 2020. This analysis reports on changes in the profile of people who have died of overdose since BC's declaration of COVID-19 as a public health emergency on 17 March 2020. METHODS Using BC Coroners Service data, Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression were conducted to compare demographic, geographic and post-mortem toxicology data between people who died of overdose before (17 March-31 December 2019) and after (17 March-31 December 2020) BC's declaration of COVID-19 as a public health emergency. RESULTS Overdose deaths observed since 17 March 2020 (n = 1516) more than doubled those observed in the same period in 2019 (n = 744). In the adjusted logistic regression model, odds of death in the post compared to pre-COVID-19 period was significantly higher among males compared to females, among all older age groups compared to people aged 30-39, and was lower in public buildings compared to private residences. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Alongside a significant increase in overdose deaths since BC's declaration of COVID-19 as a public health emergency, the demographic profile of people who have died of overdose has changed.

Access to therapy services for adults with Osteogenesis Imperfecta is variable. We designed this analysis to better understand the musculoskeletal disorders and consequent therapy needs for adults with Osteogenesis Imperfecta. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional analysis of outpatients with Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Adults attending a newly established multidisciplinary clinic at a tertiary centre in 2019 were included. A highly specialist physiotherapist worked within the clinic to offer therapy input if required and to refer patients to appropriate therapy as needed. People over the age of 18 were included if they had a diagnosis of Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Data were collected over a five month period using routinely collected clinical information and patient reported outcomes. RESULTS: Over five months 50 patients attended the clinic. Musculoskeletal pain was a significant feature reported by 84% of patients. Over 50% of patients reported persistent pain for longer than one year duration and the most common site of pain was in the spine (46%). No difference in pain between types of OI and age. Forty five per cent (n = 19) of patients reported moderate to severe problems with mobility on the EQ-5D with over half reporting problems with self-care and ability to carry out usual activities.

Mindful emotion regulation refers to individuals? inherent capacities to regulate emotions mindfully, i.e., through paying attention to one?s experiences in the present moment nonjudgmentally. Based on the theoretical and empirical literature associating mindful emotion regulation with loneliness and perceived social support, the current study tested the effects of mindful emotion regulation on later changes in perceived social support and loneliness in U.S. parents during the pandemic. Participants were 147 parents/caregivers who were living with at least one child or adolescent in their household during the pandemic in the USA. Data were collected from a national online sample at four time points: baseline (April 7?21, 2020), 30-, 60-, and 90-days later. Results of longitudinal mediational structural equation modeling showed that mindful emotion regulation was directly associated with increased perceived social support and decreased loneliness. Moreover, mindful emotion regulation was also associated with perceived social support indirectly through its effects on loneliness. Focusing on the needs of parents is important for promoting family and child wellbeing to ameliorate negative health consequences. More research is needed to elucidate whether and how mindful emotion regulation may be beneficial for parents in the social relationship domain.","output":"Effects of mindful emotion regulation on parents loneliness and social support: A longitudinal study during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, small compound-based therapies have provided new insights into the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) by inducing oxidative impairment. Kinetin riboside (KR) and newly designed derivatives (8-azaKR, 7-deazaKR) selectively affect the molecular pathways crucial for cell growth by interfering with the redox status of cancer cells. Thus, these compounds might serve as potential alternatives in the oxidative therapy of GBM. The increased basal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in GBM support the survival of cancer cells and cause drug resistance. The simplest approach to induce cell death is to achieve the redox threshold and circumvent the antioxidant defense mechanisms. Consequently, cells become more sensitive to oxidative stress (OS) caused by exogenous agents. Here, we investigated the effect of KR and its derivatives on the redox status of T98G cells in 2D and 3D cell culture. The use of spheroids of T98G cells enabled the selection of one derivative7-deazaKRwith comparable antitumor activity to KR. Both compounds induced ROS generation and genotoxic OS, resulting in lipid peroxidation and leading to apoptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that KR and 7-deazaKR modulate the cellular redox environment of T98G cells, and vulnerability of these cells is dependent on their antioxidant capacity.","output":"Implications of Oxidative Stress in Glioblastoma Multiforme Following Treatment with Purine Derivatives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) is an isothiocyanate that largely exists in cruciferous vegetables and exhibits chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic potential against various cancers. However, it is little known about the molecular mechanisms of its antitumor action against osteosarcoma, which is the second highest cause of cancer-related death in children and adolescents. In this study, we investigated the effects of PEITC on K7M2 murine osteosarcoma both in vitro and in vivo. We found that treatment with PEITC dose-dependently inhibited the viability of K7M2 murine osteosarcoma cells with an IC(50) value of 33.49 M at 24 h. PEITC (1, 15, 30 M) dose-dependently inhibited the cell proliferation, caused G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, depleted glutathione (GSH), generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), altered iron metabolism, and triggered multiple forms of cell death, namely ferroptosis, apoptosis, and autophagy in K7M2 cells. We further revealed that PEITC treatment activated MAPK signaling pathway, and ROS generation was a major cause of PEITC-induced cell death. In a syngeneic orthotopic osteosarcoma mouse model, administration of PEITC (30, 60 mg/kg every day, ig, for 24 days) significantly inhibited the tumor growth, but higher dose of PEITC (90 mg/kg every day) compromised its anti-osteosarcoma effect. Histological examination showed that multiple cell death processes were initiated, iron metabolism was altered and MAPK signaling pathway was activated in the tumor tissues. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PEITC induces ferroptosis, autophagy, and apoptosis in K7M2 osteosarcoma cells by activating the ROS-related MAPK signaling pathway. PEITC has promising anti-osteosarcoma activity.

The emerging data from different countries indicate that intimate partner violence (IPV) has intensified since the COVID-19 outbreak. The main purpose of the current study is to find out whether there is any difference in the incidence of IPV during and before the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine and whether any sociodemographical factors are related to the incidence of IPV against pregnant women during quarantine. A cross-sectional, correlational design was in this study. The snowball sampling technique was adopted to select the participants, which produced a nonrepresentative sample of 215 pregnant women. The participants completed the Arabic version of the World Health Organization's Domestic Violence Questionnaire Screening Tool (DVQST). We found that women were exposed to different types of IPV before and during the quarantine. The most prevalent form of IPV was control and humiliation (n 172, 80%) and the least prevalent was sexual violence ((n 33, 15.3%), (n 24, 11.2%), respectively). However, there were statistically significant lower DVQST scores during the COVID-19 quarantine than before the quarantine. All types of IPV are significantly correlated with each other and with relationship problems (marital conflict, verbal fighting, understanding each other). While the findings are not generalizable to the general population of pregnant women in Jordan because the sample consisted only of women of high socioeconomic status due to the use of a nonprobability sampling technique, national campaigns should be developed and implemented in order to reduce IPV and change community behaviors and attitudes toward violence against women.

Leadership is the ability to guide a team or organization toward a stated goal or objective. In addition to hospital-wide leadership, there is need for leadership at the level of medical teams. Resident leadership is essential to ensure team function and patient care, yet residents are often overlooked as valuable leaders. This Perspective argues that residents can demonstrate leadership during a public health crisis by creating a culture of emotional intelligence in their medical teams. Emotional intelligence has been identified as a critical aspect of leadership and consists of self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. In psychiatry, patient interactions depend upon psychiatrists demonstrating a high level of attention to their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as well as those of the patient to communicate in a way that demonstrates both understanding and empathy. In this Perspective, a psychiatry resident uses expertise in emotional intelligence to recommend residents (1) be mindful, (2) ask and listen, (3) establish safety, and (4) unite around a common goal. These practical recommendations can be immediately implemented to increase emotional intelligence on medical teams to improve team function and patient care. Emotional intelligence is valuable at all levels of leadership, so hospital leadership and program directors should also heed these suggestions.

This study aimed at the nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) helicase as a promising target for drug development against COVID-19. A unique collection of nucleoside analogs was screened against the SARS-CoV-2 helicase protein, for which a molecular docking experiment was executed to depict the selected ligand's binding affinity with the SARS-CoV-2 helicase proteins. Simultaneously, molecular dynamic simulations were performed to examine the protein's binding site's conformational stability, flexibility, and interaction with the ligands. Key nucleoside ligands were selected for pharmacokinetic analysis based on their docking scores. Selected ligands (cordycepin and pritelivir) showed excellent pharmacokinetics and were well stabilized at the proteins' binding site throughout the MD simulation. We have also performed binding free energy analysis or the binding characteristics of ligands with Nsp13 by using MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA.

Results: The LSTM vs. U-Net model provided breathing metrics which were strongly correlated with those from the reference signal (all p < 0.001, except for inspiratory: expiratory ratio). The following absolute mean bias (95% confidence interval) values were observed (in seconds): inspiration time 0.01(?2.31, 2.34) vs. ?0.02(?2.19, 2.16), expiration time ?0.19(?2.35, 1.98) vs. ?0.24(?2.36, 1.89), and inter-breath intervals ?0.19(?2.73, 2.35) vs. ?0.25(2.76, 2.26).

Objective and method From January to May 2020, 113 patients were admitted in ICU for severe COVID-19. All these patients underwent continuous monitoring of their cardiac rhythm. Ten patients (9%) presented a bradycardia. A 24-hour Holter-ECG was subsequently performed for 7 patients. Results Patients had a median age of 63years. Most of them were men and had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. All episodes were due to sinus bradycardia with a median heart rate of 36 bpm. Bradycardia was sudden for four patients and required brief resuscitation maneuvers for one. Bradycardia was persistent for the six other patients and required transient continuous isoprenaline infusion for three. Patients had normal baseline ECG and echocardiography. A comprehensive review of patient's files ruled out bradycardia due to drug-drug interactions, myocarditis, hyperkalemia, hypoxia or vagal physical stimulation. Two patients had beta-blockers interrupted several days before bradycardia and one patient received Hydroxychloroquine discontinued 21days before bradycardia. On the Holter-ECG, 3 recordings evoked vagal hyperactivity (low mean heart rate and elevated pNN50/RMSSD, Fig. 1, patient A), 3 others cardiac dysautonomia (SDNN<100ms, Fig. 1, patient B). Amongst these 10 patients, five returned home and five died from COVID-19 associated multiple-organ failure. None of them required temporary or permanent cardiac pacing (Fig. 1).

METHODS We performed a secondary analysis of a cohort with spontaneous ICH requiring mechanical ventilation. We collected baseline data, measures of systemic inflammation, microbiological culture results for the first 48 h, and daily antibiotic usage. Two physicians adjudicated true-positive and false-positive culture results using standard criteria. We calculated the cost per true-positive result and used logistic regression to test the association between false-positive results with subsequent antibiotic exposure. RESULTS Overall, 697 subjects were included. A total of 233 subjects had 432 blood cultures obtained, with one true-positive (diagnostic yield 0.1 %, $22,200 per true-positive) and 11 false-positives. True-positive urine cultures (5 %) and sputum cultures (13 %) were more common but so were false-positives (6 and 17 %, respectively). In adjusted analysis, false-positive blood and sputum results were associated with increased antibiotic exposure. CONCLUSIONS The yield of blood cultures early after spontaneous ICH was very low.

RESULTS: Nembro had 11 505 residents as of 1 January 2020. Monthly all cause mortality between January 2012 and February 2020 fluctuated around 10 per 1000 person years, with a maximum of 21.5 per 1000 person years. In March 2020, monthly all cause mortality reached a peak of 154.4 per 1000 person years. For the first 11 days in April, this rate decreased to 23.0 per 1000 person years.

Proper management of an increasing number of home-quarantined individuals created a significant challenge for health care authorities and professionals. This was especially true when considering the importance of remote surveillance to detect signs of disease progression and consequently regulate access to hospitals and intensive care units on a priority basis. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we report on an initiative promoted to cope with the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Spring/Summer of 2020, in the Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy. A purposefully built app named TreCovid19 was designed to provide dedicated health care staff with a ready-to-use tool for remotely monitoring patients with progressive symptoms of COVID-19, who were home-quarantined during the first wave of the epidemic, and to focus on those patients who, based on their self-reported clinical data, required a quick response from health care professionals. METHODS: TreCovid19 was rapidly developed to facilitate the monitoring of a selected number of home-quarantined patients with COVID-19 during the very first epidemic wave. The app was built on top of an existing eHealth platform, already in use by the local health authority to provide home care, with the following functionalities: (1) to securely collect and link demographic and clinical information related to the patients and (2) to provide a two-way communication between a multidisciplinary health care team and home-quarantined patients. The system supported patients to self-assess their condition and update the multidisciplinary team on their health status. The system was used between March and June 2020 in the province of Trento. RESULTS: A dedicated multidisciplinary group of health care professionals adopted the platform over a period of approximately 3 months (from March-end to June 2020) to monitor a total of 170 patients with confirmed COVID-19 during home quarantine. All patients used the system until the end of the initiative. The TreCovid19 system has provided useful insights of possible viability and impact of a technological-organizational asset to manage a potentially critical workload for the health care staff involved in the periodic monitoring of a relevant number of quarantined patients, notwithstanding its limitations given the rapid implementation of the whole initiative. CONCLUSIONS: The technological and organizational model adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was developed and finalized in a relatively short period during the initial few weeks of the epidemic. The system successfully supported the health care staff involved in the periodic monitoring of an increasing number of home-quarantined patients and provided valuable data in terms of disease surveillance.","output":"Use of eHealth Platforms and Apps to Support Monitoring and Management of Home-Quarantined Patients With COVID-19 in the Province of Trento, Italy: App Development and Implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Sino-US conflicts and the COVID-19 have significantly impacted the Chinese economy and the Chinese government has proposed the \\"Dual Circulation Economy\\"strategy as countermeasure As one of the most developed regions in China, the Guangdong -Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is expected to shoulder responsibilities in this ambition In this paper, we analyze the challenges for the Greater Bay Area to participate from the perspective of industrial development We then employ a quantitative method to identify the industrial potential of the Greater Bay Area cities in facilitating the dual circulation economy At last, we provide several policy recommendations including promoting cross-regional industrial cooperation and enhancing the spatial spillover effects of core cities ?

Using rhizospheric microbes as biostimulants/biofertilizers is one of the best ways to improve agro-agriculture in the face of these things. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether a native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculum (AMF-complex) might improve caper (Capparis spinosa) seedlings nutritional status, their morphological/growth performance and photosynthetic efficiency under water-deficit stress (WDS). Thus, caper plantlets inoculated with or without an AMF complex (+AMF and ?AMF, respectively) were grown under three gradually increasing WDS regimes, i.e., 75, 50 and 25% of field capacity (FC). Overall, measurements of morphological traits, biomass production and nutrient uptake (particularly P, K+, Mg2+, Fe2+ and Zn2+) showed that mycorrhizal fungi inoculation increased these variables significantly, notably in moderate and severe WDS conditions. The increased WDS levels reduced the photochemical efficiency indices (Fv/Fm and Fv/Fo) in ?AMF plants, while AMF-complex application significantly augmented these parameters. Furthermore, the photosynthetic pigments content was substantially higher in +AMF seedlings than ?AMF controls at all the WDS levels. Favorably, at 25% FC, AMF-colonized plants produce approximately twice as many carotenoids as non-colonized ones. In conclusion, AMF inoculation seems to be a powerful eco-engineering strategy for improving the caper seedling growth rate and drought tolerance in harsh environments.","output":"Mycorrhizal Fungi Inoculation Improves Capparis spinosas Yield, Nutrient Uptake and Photosynthetic Efficiency under Water Deficit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requires hospitals to meet rigorous patient satisfaction requirements for reimbursement. One metric used for patient satisfaction is call light responsiveness within a unit. AIMS: To meet target call light responsiveness benchmarks at a 45\\\\bed telemetry, medicalCsurgical nursing unit within a Magnet(?) designated hospital. METHODS: An evidence\\\\based practice (EBP) project model was utilized. The chief nursing officer worked with an EBP nurse mentor. A PICOT (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Time) question was developed to guide the literature search. Literature was critically appraised, and a resulting intervention was established. Nurse educators taught the unit nurses how to perform the intervention, and intervention integration was assessed via direct observation. Call light responsiveness data were collected to assess whether targets were met. RESULTS: Five articles were deemed as applicable to the PICOT question, and the best evidence determined that using the 4Ps (pain, presence, potty, and positioning) during structured registered nurse (RN) care rounding every 2 h improved patient outcomes. After RN education and implementation, hospital call light responsiveness began to improve. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Rounding without intention increases RN workload and does not result in improved patient outcomes or a satisfied patient. RN rounding every 2 h is effective and efficient when done with intention (i.e., adhering to the 4Ps). RN patient rounds done every 2 h with intention improved patient satisfaction and other patient outcomes such as a decrease in call light usage.","output":"Use of EBP as a Problem\\\\Solving Approach to Improve Patient Satisfaction While Overcoming the COVID Pandemic Barriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Teleradiology has become one of the most important approaches to virtual clinical diagnosis; its importance has only grown during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic. In developing countries, asking patients to take photographs of their images using a smartphone can facilitate the process and help keep its costs down. However, the images taken by patients with smartphones often are of poor quality, and there is no regulation or standard instruction about how to use smartphones to take photographs of medical examination images effectively. These problems limit the use of smartphones in remote diagnosis and treatment. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: To formulate a set of guidelines for the most appropriate and effective use of smartphones to capture images (radiographs, CT images, and MR images), and to determine whether these guidelines are more effectively adopted by patients of differing ages and genders. METHODS: In this prospective study, a set of step-by-step instructions was created with the goal of helping patients take better smartphone photographs of orthopaedic diagnostic images for transfer to telemedicine services. Following the advice of surgeons, experts in smartphone technology, imaging experts, and suggestions from patients, the instructions were modified based on clinical experience and finalized with the goals of simplicity, clarity, and convenience. Potentially eligible patients were older than 18 years, had no cognitive impairment, and used smart phones. Based on that, 256 participants (patients or their relatives and friends) who visited the orthopaedic department of our hospital from June to October 2020 potentially qualified for this study. A total of 11% (29) declined to participate, leaving 89% (227) for analysis here. Their mean age was 36  11 years, 50% were women (113 of 227), and the patient himself/herself represented in 34% (78 of 227) of participants while relatives or friends of patients made up 66% (149 of 227) of the group. In this study, the diagnoses included spinal stenosis (47% [107 of 227]), disc herniation without spinal stenosis (31% [71 of 227]), vertebral fractures (14% [32 of 227]), and other (7% [17 of 227]). Each study participant first took photographs of their original medical images based on their own knowledge of how to use the smartphone camera function; each participant then took pictures of their original images again after receiving our instructional guidance. Three senior spine surgeons (YZ, TQL, TCM) in our hospital analyzed, in a blinded manner, the instructed and uninstructed imaging files based on image clarity (the content of the image is complete, the text information in the image is clearly visible, there is neither reflection nor shadow in the image) and image position (it is not tilted, curled, inverted, or reversed). If either of these conditions was not satisfied, the picture quality was deemed unacceptable; two of three judges' votes determined the outcome. Interobserver reliability with kappa values for the three judges were 0.89 (YZ versus TQL), 0.92 (YZ versus TCM), and 0.90 (TQL versus TCM). RESULTS: In this study, the overall proportion of smartphone medical images deemed satisfactory increased from 40% (91 of 227) for uninstructed participants to 86% (196 of 227) for instructed participants (risk ratio 2.15 [95% CI 1.82 to 2.55]; p0.001). The proportion of acceptable-quality images in different age groups improved after instruction, except for in patients aged 51 years or older (3 of 17 uninstructed participants versus 8 of 17 instructed participants; RR 2.67 [95% CI 0.85 to 8.37]; p = 0.07). The proportion of acceptable-quality images in both genders improved after instruction, but there was no difference between the genders. CONCLUSION: We believe our guidelines for patients who wish to take smartphone photographs of their medical images will decrease image transmission cost and facilitate orthopaedic telemedicine consultations. However, it appears that patients older than 50 years are more likely to have difficulty with this approach, and if so, they may benefit from more hands-on assistance from clinic staff or younger relatives or friends. The degree to which our findings are culture-specific should be verified by other studies in other settings, but on the face of it, there is little reason to believe our findings would not generalize to a reasonable degree. Other studies in more heterogeneous populations should also evaluate factors related to levels of educational attainment and wealth differences, but in the meantime, our findings can give clinical teams an idea of which patients may need a little extra assistance.

CDH is a diaphragmatic discontinuity that permits abdominal viscera to herniate into the chest during development. It does not only occur in early childhood but also has been reported in adults. The most prevalent clinical sign of MH is respiratory disorder of all ages. CASE PRESENTATION: An elderly woman with a known history of diabetes, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and constipation presented to us with increased abdominal pain. Besides, her PCR test results were positive for COVID-19. She underwent diagnostic laparoscopy surgery. The incision was closed with an intracorporeal suture, and then dual mesh was fixed to diaphragmatic wall. The postoperative progress was satisfactory two weeks after surgery. Based on a negative PCR test, the patient was discharged from the hospital. DISCUSSION: The foramina of Morgagni is a defect in the costosternal trigons produced by a lack of anterior pleuroperitoneal membrane muscularization. Although gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiorespiratory discomfort are typically connected with the diagnosis and treatment of MH in youngsters, there are a few middle-aged people who, like our case, develop symptoms suddenly. Albeit a paradigm change in the 21st century deems less invasive laparoscopic surgery to be the treatment of choice, open surgical procedures via a trans-thoracic or trans-abdominal route are still used. CONCLUSION: MH is indeed uncommon in adults, but in patients with an acute onset of intestinal obstruction, the possibility of MH should be in mind. It can be fatal if it is misdiagnosed.","output":"Laparoscopic repair of an incarcerated Morgagni Hernia in a COVID-19-positive patient: A video case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the United States experienced an unprecedented event that suddenly demanded that researchers cease all nonessential activities to mitigate the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV2.

The fatality in COVID-19 cases was alarming in the initial days. This study analyzes hematological and biochemical markers of COVID-19 non-survivors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this single-center study, records of 249 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were studied for hematological profile and biochemical markers. Records of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease hospitalized between April 14, 2020, to August 15, 2020, were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Significantly, the disease mortality was associated with increased procalcitonin (P < 0.05), C-reactive protein (P < 0.05), aspartate transaminase (P < 0.05), serum potassium (P < 0.05), neutrophils count (P < 0.05), white blood cell count (P < 0.05), prothrombin time (P < 0.05) and activated prothrombin time (P < 0.05) in patients reported abnormal x-ray findings. Further, patients with abnormal radiological findings significantly showed a reduced level of lymphocyte counts (P < 0.05), oxygen saturation (P < 0.05), and partial oxygen pressure (P < 0.05). Reduced level of aspartate aminotransferase (P < 0.05), alanine aminotransferase (P < 0.05) and lactate dehydrogenase (P < 0.05) reported significant association with mortality among patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The clinicians may consider the hematological and biochemical parameters in the patients with COVID-19 in future decision-making. These indicators might support clinical decisions to identify high fatality cases and poor diagnosis in the initial admission phase. In COVID-19 patients, we recommend close monitoring on procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, neutrophils count, and white blood cell count as a clinical indicator for potential progression to critical illness.","output":"Hematological profile and biochemical markers of COVID-19 non-survivors: A retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To review what is known about COVID\\\\19 and highlight gaps in the context of Nigerian obstetric practice.

Recently, our group reported the isolation of the Melaka virus from a patient with acute respiratory disease and provided data suggesting that this new orthoreovirus is capable of human-to-human transmission and is probably of bat origin. Here we report yet another Melaka-like reovirus (named Kampar virus) isolated from the throat swab of a 54 year old male patient in Kampar, Perak, Malaysia who was suffering from high fever, acute respiratory disease and vomiting at the time of virus isolation. Serological studies indicated that Kampar virus was transmitted from the index case to at least one other individual and caused respiratory disease in the contact case. Sequence analysis of the four small class genome segments indicated that Kampar and Melaka viruses are closely related. This was confirmed by virus neutralization assay, showing an effective two-way cross neutralization, i.e., the serum against one virus was able to neutralize the other. Although the exact origin of Kampar virus is unknown, epidemiological tracing revealed that the house of the index case is surrounded by fruit trees frequently visited by fruit bats. There is a high probability that Kampar virus originated from bats and was transmitted to humans via bat droppings or contaminated fruits. The discovery of Kampar virus highlights the increasing trend of emergence of bat zoonotic viruses and the need to expand our understanding of bats as a source of many unknown viruses.","output":"Identification and Characterization of a New Orthoreovirus from Patients with Acute Respiratory Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a wide-ranging debate about the merits and demerits of searching for, and sending messages to, extraterrestrial intelligences (SETI and METI) There is however reasonable (but not universal) consensus that replying to a message from an extraterrestrial intelligence should not be done unilaterally, without consultation with wider society and the rest of the world But how should this consultation actually work?

Critically ill COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storm are believed to have a worse prognosis and increased fatality rate. In SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, cytokine storm appears important to the pathogenesis of several severe manifestations of COVID-19: acute respiratory distress syndrome, thromboembolic diseases such as acute ischemic strokes caused by large vessel occlusion and myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, and vasculitis (Kawasaki-like syndrome in children and renal vasculitis in adult).

Though some prior data have suggested sex differences in levels of physical activity, whether there are sex differences in the role of physical activity in primary stroke prevention is largely unknown. This systematic review identifies and describes recent findings on sex differences in the association between physical activity and incident (first-ever) stroke. This review also describes the current evidence on the strength of the association between physical activity and a reduced stroke risk in women in particular. METHODS: Using a prespecified strategy, PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane Central were searched to identify observational studies or trials published from 2000 to 2020 and reporting sex differences in physical activity and incident stroke. To be included, among other criteria, studies had to include sex-specific effect estimates from women, men, or both. Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles were screened to identify studies meeting the inclusion criteria, and adjusted sex-specific estimates of the association between physical activity and incident stroke for total stroke (ischemic plus hemorrhagic) or ischemic stroke were abstracted. FINDINGS: Thirty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Of 17 studies that included data on total incident stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic combined) in both women and men, 7 (41%) showed similar associations between physical activity and incident stroke between women and men, 6 (35%) suggested a significant effect in women but not in men, and 3 (18%) showed a significant effect in men but not in women. Of 10 studies that included data on ischemic stroke in women and men, 5 (50%) suggested similar effects in women and men, 4 (40%) suggested a significant effect in women but not in men, and 1 (10%) showed an effect in men but not women. In women specifically, the majority of included studies demonstrated a reduced risk for incident stroke with physical activity, with relative risk reductions ranging from 11% to 72%, though most estimates fell between 20% and 40%. IMPLICATIONS: The majority of studies indicated a clear association between physical activity and a reduction in stroke risk. Studies were split as to the potential for sex differences in this association. Future prospective investigations should identify strategies for the use of increased physical activity for primary stroke prevention, with sex-specific considerations as warranted. The data on sex-specific dose-response relationship between physical activity and stroke risk are inconclusive and warrant more research.","output":"Sex Differences in Physical Activity and Incident Stroke: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incessant spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a great threat to human health.

This form was then used by 11 licensed psychologists to rate eight graduate trainees while viewing 129, approximately 5-min video clips from their psychotherapy sessions with clients (n = 22) at a graduate program's training clinic. Generalizability analyses were used to forecast how the number of raters and clients, and length of observation time impact the dependability of ratings in various rating designs. Raters were the primary source of error variance in ratings, with rater main effects (leniency bias) and dyadic effects (rater-target interactions) contributing 24% and 7% of variance, respectively. Variance due to segments (video clips) was also substantial, suggesting that therapist performance varies within the same counseling session. Generalizability coefficients (G) were highest for crossed rating designs and reached maximum levels (G > .50) after four raters watched each therapist working with three clients and observed 15 min per dyad. These findings suggest that expert raters show consensus in ratings even without rater training and only limited direct observation.

The photocatalytic inactivation efficiency of airborne Escherichia coli (E. coli) achieved 3.4 lg order under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at 254 (UV254), which was superior to that using UV254-only treatment with 2.5 lg order under the same operating condition (95% relative humidity and retention time of 4.27 s). The effect of humidity and bacteria species on inactivation performance was also investigated. The thick cell membrane could protect bacteria from photocatalytic oxidation while high humidity increased the photocatalytic inactivation efficiency by generating more reactive oxygen species. The phenomena of photo reactivation and dark repair of airborne E. coli using UV254-only treatment was observed. However, no reactivation occurred after UV photocatalytic inactivation, and even a continuous decline under visible light. These results suggested a different inactivation mechanism between UV irradiation and UV photocatalysis that the former inactivated bacteria by damaging their DNA, whereas photocatalysis physically damaged their cell structure.","output":"Photocatalytic inactivation of airborne bacteria in a polyurethane foam reactor loaded with a hybrid of MXene and anatase TiO(2) exposing {001} facets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is perennially plagued by prolonged phases of poverty, conflict, and increased internal migration, as well as pandemic outbreaks such as Ebola and COVID19, and limited livelihood opportunities. Such unexpected or catastrophic events have rendered households vulnerable and resulted in poor health outcomes. Given this background, we intend to analyze the nutritional profile of households for a period spanning almost a decade using the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES). We construct a composite nutrition deficiency index (NDI), capturing intake of 14 different macro- and micronutrients (which we refer to as dimensions) - namely, calories, protein, calcium, zinc, folate, thiamine, niacin, iron, vitamin A, vitamin B12, vitamin D, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and vitamin E - using the popular Alkire-Foster methodology. This methodology, usually used to construct multidimensional poverty indexes, in this case helps measure the incidence, intensity, and combined extent of multinutrient deprivation. DRC's values on the multidimensional NDI vary regionally from 0.13 to 0.73. Urban DRC performs worse than rural DRC. Regions subject to the conflict and Ebola crises are the worst-affected of the nutritionally deprived regions. Deficiency in calorie and protein intake contributes to the highest values of the NDI, but we also find evidence of a double burden of malnutrition, with households lacking consumption of both macro- and micronutrients. South Kivu is the worst-performing of all regions and Mongala the best. The northern parts of DRC have fewer nutritionally deprived households, as compared with the central and southwestern parts. Our main policy recommendation is to help improve market access in urban areas so that people consume a more diverse diet. In rural areas, the government should support improving nutrition-sensitive agricultural production. Although the World Food Programme has a sustained presence in the country, uplifting households from severe hunger, active participation by the government and collaboration with multiple stakeholders is called for.","output":"Constructing a nutrition deficiency index: applications for the Democratic Republic of the Congo under a decade of humanitarian crises"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the impact of the regulator S statement requesting EU insurers to suspend dividend distributions due to the COVID-19 pandemic on share prices of insurance companies.

The statistical significance of the potential negative impact was explored using event study methodology. The empirical results suggest that the negative impact following the statementS release is not statistically significant over the chosen event window. The robustness of the results is confirmed by several statistical tests - parametric and nonparametric. The measure did not result in a fall in share prices in line with economic theory but, rather, contributed to ensuring the financial stability of the European insurance sector, supporting the real economy and consequently allowing quicker economic recovery.","output":"The impact of regulator's statement requesting EU insurers to suspend dividend distributions due to the COVID-19 pandemic on share prices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospital reorganization may result in reduced ability for the hospital to fully use its armamentarium for battling cancer.

We aimed to identify robust marker genes related to osteoporosis based on different bioinformatic methods and multiple datasets. METHODS: Three datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were utilized for analysis separately. Significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from comparing high hip and low hip low bone mineral density (BMD) groups in the first dataset were identified for Gene Ontology (GO), Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) to investigate the discrepantly enriched biological processes between high hip and low hip group. Last absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), SVM model and protein-protein interaction (PPI) regulatory network were performed and generated robust marker genes for downstream TF-target and miRNA-target prediction. RESULTS: Several DEGs between high hip BMD group and low hip BMD group were obtained. And the metabolism-related pathways such as metabolic pathways, carbon metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism shown enrichment in these DEGs. Integration with LASSO regression analysis, 8 differential expression genes (SH3BP1, NARF, ANKRD34B, RNF40, ZNF473, AKT1, SHMT1, and VASH1) in GSE62402 were identified as the optimal differential genes combination. Moreover, the SVM validation analysis in GSE56814 and GSE56815 datasets showed that the characteristic gene combinations presented high diagnostic effects, and the model AUC areas for GSE56814 was 0.899 and for GSE56815 was 0.921. Furthermore, the subcellular localization analysis of the 8 genes revealed that 4 proteins were located in the cytoplasm, 3 proteins were located in the nucleus, and 1 protein was located in the mitochondria. Additionally, the related TFs and miRNAs by performing TF-target and miRNA-target prediction for 5 genes (AKT1, SHMT1, ZNF473, RNF40 and VASH1) were investigated from PPI network.

National clinical guidance for COVID-19 states that all adults over the age of 65 should be given a CFS at the first point of contact during hospital admission. Therefore, there is a need to improve CFS documentation, specifically in acute care settings. We describe how qualitative methods facilitated an understanding of the barriers to CFS documentation in ED. Staff see the CFS as a useful tool for inter-professional communication, though there are tensions between clinical guidance and their beliefs. Staff had moral concerns about how an ED-allocated CFS might limit available treatment options for older adults.

This study aimed to find the prevalence of stress fracture among young paramilitary trainees visiting the orthopedic outpatient department of a paramilitary hospital. METHODS This was a descriptive cross-sectional study done among paramilitary trainees in a paramilitary Hospital of Nepal between April 2019 to April 2021. The study was approved by the Ethical Review Board (Reference number: 1003) of the Nepal Health Research Council. Convenience sampling was used. Anthropometric variables, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, and bone mineral density of spine and hip were determined. Data analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 17.0. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency, proportion for binary data and mean, standard deviation for continuous data. RESULTS Among 417 young paramilitary trainees, 24 (5.76%) (3.52-7.99 at 95% Confidence Interval) were found to have a stress fracture. The stress fracture patients had a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 21.47ng/mL6.98. Similarly, the bone mineral density value of the spine and hip among the patients was -1.34g/cm21.37 and 0.36g/cm21.24, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of stress fracture among young paramilitary trainee was high compared to previous studies.

During HIV-1 infection, the course of disease progression, ART response, and viral reservoir size vary in different individuals. Several factors may account for these differences; however, Fc gamma receptor gene polymorphisms, which influence receptor binding to IgG antibodies, are likely to play a key role. FcRIIa (CD32) was recently reported as a potential marker for latent HIV reservoir, however, this assertion is still inconclusive. Whether FcR polymorphisms influence the size of the viral reservoir, remains an important question in HIV cure studies. In addition, potential cure or viral suppression methods such as broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAbs) may depend on FcRs to control the virus. Here, we discuss the current evidence on the potential role played by FcR polymorphisms in HIV-1 infection, treatment and vaccine trial outcomes. Importantly, we highlight contrasting findings that may be due to multiple factors and the relatively limited data from African populations. We recommend further studies especially in sub-Saharan Africa to confirm the role of FcRIIa in the establishment of latent reservoir and to determine their influence in therapies involving bNAbs.","output":"Are Fc Gamma Receptor Polymorphisms Important in HIV-1 Infection Outcomes and Latent Reservoir Size?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A prospective 2\\\\year analysis including 322 infant patients with acute respiratory disease (ARD) hospitalized in a pediatric department in northern Italy was carried out to evaluate the role as respiratory pathogens or co\\\\pathogens of recently identified viruses.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 150 of the 322 infants (46.6%) tested positive for at least one pathogen. Ninety samples (28.0%) tested positive for RSV RNA (61.5% genotype A and 38.5% genotype B), 46 (14.3%) for hMPV RNA (71.7% subtype A and 28.3% subtype B), 28 (8.7%) for hCoV RNA (39.3% hCoV\\\\OC43, 35.7% hCoV\\\\NL63, 21.4% hCoV\\\\HKU1, and 3.6% hCoV\\\\229E), and 7 (2.2%) for hBoV DNA (of the 6 typed, 50% subtype 1 and 50% subtype 2); 21/150 samples revealed the presence of 2 or more viruses. Co\\\\infection rates were higher for hMPVs, hCoVs, and hBoV (38.3%, 46.4%, and 57.1%,) and lower for RSV (23.3%).

In March 2020, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZI) were proposed as potential treatments of COVID-19, but with warnings concerning their possible toxicity. No data are available regarding the toxicity of this treatment in haemodialysis patients. METHODS: We report the use of HCQ and AZI in a cohort of COVID-19 haemodialysis patients with focus on safety concerns. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients received 200 mg HCQ thrice daily during 10 days, and AZI 500 mg on Day 1, and 250 mg on the four following days. HCQ plasma concentrations were within the recommended range (0.1-1.0 g/mL) in all patients except one, in which maximum concentration was 1.1 g/mL. HCQ concentration raised until the third day and remained stable thereafter. No cardiac event occurred in spite of progressive lengthening of corrected QT interval (QTc) during the treatment. One patient experienced a long QTc syndrome (QTc >500 ms) without any arrhythmia episode, although HCQ concentration was in the target range. Five (23.8%) patients experienced hypoglycaemia, a well-known HCQ side-effect. SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable in nasopharyngeal swabs for a long time in haemodialysis patients (mean time 21 days). CONCLUSIONS: HCQ and AZI are safe in haemodialysis patients at these doses but can lead to long QTc syndrome and hypoglycaemia. HCQ concentrations were not correlated with side effects. We recommend monitoring of the QTc length throughout treatment, as well as glycaemia.

We have sought to identify trends in presentation, diagnosis and management of paediatric septic arthritis, with added focus on ethnicity and access to healthcare. METHODS: A ten year retrospective review of all cases < 16 years with presumed septic arthritis presenting to a tertiary referral centre between 2008 and 2018 was performed. RESULTS: A total of 103 cases met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 5.9 years (SD +/- 4.17) with a male predominance (64%). Traditional laboratory culture method isolated an organism in 66% of cases: Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen identified (61%). Incidence varied greatly by ethnicity 1:16,000 for NZ European children; 1:8760 for Pacifica and 1:4300 for Maori. Mean distance travelled by patients to reach the nearest emergency department was 38.3 km, ranging from 2 to 188 km. Assessment using NZ deprivation scores showed the Maori paediatric population were likely to reside in areas of worse socioeconomic deprivation (p = 0.0005). The majority (66%) of cases were treated surgically with a low recurrence rate (2.9%). Delayed presentation was associated with worse outcomes and more likely in patients residing > 20 km away from the nearest emergency department.

Second, the behaviour of these models is visually analysed by plotting CAMs for individual networks and determining classification performance with AUCROC curves. Thirdly, stacked ensembles techniques are imparted to provide higher generalisation on combining the fine-tuned models, in which six ensemble neural networks are designed by combining the existing fine-tuned networks.

Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs), we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron showed 3-fold higher capsid assembly and cell entry relative to Delta, a property conferred by S and N protein mutations. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had 15-fold lower efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations relative to the ancestral B.1 spike protein. A third dose of Pfizer vaccine elicited substantially higher neutralization titers against Omicron, resulting in detectable neutralizing antibodies in 8 out of 8 subjects compared to 1 out of 8 pre-boost. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody therapeutics Casirivimab and Imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1, B.1.1 or Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs. Our results suggest that Omicron is more efficient at assembly and cell entry compared to Delta, and the antibody response triggered by existing vaccines or previous infection, at least prior to boost, will have limited ability to neutralize Omicron. In addition, some currently available monoclonal antibodies will not be useful in treating Omicron-infected patients.","output":"Omicron mutations enhance infectivity and reduce antibody neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When faced with a given pathogen, the antibody response generally functions similarly across different people,1C4 but the source of this similarity has been unclear. One hypothesis was that people share a high proportion of the same VDJ-recombined antibody genes, but this has been disproven.5,6 An alternative is that people share a high proportion of functionally similar antibodies,7,8 but testing this hypothesis requires a method for measuring functional similarity that scales to the millions of antibodies per repertoire and across multiple repertoires, which is impossible experimentally.

Here, we show that this framework supports the second hypothesis, and provide the first comprehensive demonstration of overwhelming functional overlap between repertoires from 20 different individuals directly from sequence, without need of binding studies. Overlap is highest among the young and falls with age, due to the selective loss of antibodies that represent a core set of shared or public antigen-binding capacities. We reveal considerable heterogeneity in antigen-binding capacities for antibodies against influenza, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2, and show that while some of these classes shrink with age, others persist across individuals.

While PCV reduced the disease incidence, in part because of a herd immunity effect, a replacement effect was observed whereby disease was increasingly caused by serotypes not included in the vaccine. Dynamic transmission models can account for these effects to describe post-vaccination scenarios, whereas economic evaluations can enable decision-makers to compare vaccines of increasing valency for implementation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to examine epidemiological and economic models and their assumptions for their potential contributions to future research and immunisation policy. SOURCES: Pubmed, Scopus, Ovid, ISI Web of Knowledge, Centre of Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) databases were searched. CONTENT: Twenty-three dynamic transmission models and twenty-one economic models were retrieved and reviewed. Published models employed various templates, revealing several key uncertainties regarding the biology and epidemiology of pneumococcal infection. While models suggested that PCVs will reduce the burden of disease, the extent to which they are predicted to do so depended on various assumptions regarding features of pneumococcal infection and epidemiology that governed PCV cost-effectiveness as well. Such features include the duration of protection and competitive interactions between serotypes, which are unclear at present, but which directly relate to herd immunity and serotype replacement. IMPLICATIONS: Economic evaluations are not typically based on transmission dynamic models and hence omit indirect herd immunity effects. The two tools could be used in conjunction to inform decision-makers on vaccine implementation, but so far there have been few attempts to build economic evaluations on transmission dynamic models, and none in this field. Future directions for research could include studies to evaluate key parameters for the models involving herd immunity, serotype competition and the natural history of infection.","output":"Dynamic transmission models and economic evaluations of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines: a quality appraisal and limitations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large-scale worldwide production of plastics requires the use of large quantities of fossil fuels, leading to a negative impact on the environment. If the production of plastic continues to increase at the current rate, the industry will account for one fifth of global oil use by 2050. Bioplastics currently represent less than one percent of total plastic produced, but they are expected to increase in the coming years, due to rising demand. The usage of bioplastics would allow the dependence on fossil fuels to be reduced and could represent an opportunity to add some interesting functionalities to the materials. Moreover, the plastics derived from bio-based resources are more carbon-neutral and their manufacture generates a lower amount of greenhouse gasses. The substitution of conventional plastic with renewable plastic will therefore promote a more sustainable economy, society, and environment. Consequently, more and more studies have been focusing on the production of interesting bio-based building blocks for bioplastics. However, a coherent review of the contribution of fermentation technology to a more sustainable plastic production is yet to be carried out. Here, we present the recent advancement in bioplastic production and describe the possible integration of bio-based monomers as renewable precursors.

Additionally, the preterm neonate with COVID-19 from our hospital is also reported. Results The systematic review has revealed eight studies where neonates have been described to have confirmed COVID-19, with low risk of bias. Of the 10 reported cases elsewhere, only three are likely to be vertically transmitted, while seven occurred in the postperinatal period and are likely to have been postnatally acquired. All neonates had a mild course, recovered fully and were negative on retesting. Our case of COVID-19 in a 32-week premature baby from the UK was delivered by emergency caesarean section, with the mother wearing a face mask and the family having no contact with the neonate, suggesting vertical transmission. On day 33, the neonate was asymptomatic but was still RT-PCR-positive on nasopharyngeal airway swab. Conclusions Neonatal infection is uncommon, with only two previously reported cases likely to be of vertical transmission. The case we report is still RT-PCR-positive on day 28 and is asymptomatic.

Previously studies by our group and others have confirmed that PDCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein performs an important role in antagonizing retinoic acid-induced gene I-like receptor (RLR) activation. However, the mechanism of PDCoV N protein suppressing porcine type I IFN production remains unclear, especially the downstream of porcine RLR signaling pathway. In the present study, porcine IRF7 (poIRF7) was identified as the interaction protein of PDCoV N protein through LC-MS/MS. The poIRF7 (268-487aa) was the key region of binding PDCoV N protein. Although IRF7 is a conserved functional protein in species, the PDCoV N protein has been confirmed to interact with only poIRF7 and significantly decrease poIRF7-induced type I IFN production, but not human or chicken IRF7. Furthermore, PDCoV N protein can promote poIRF7 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which directly increased the K6, K11, and K29-linked polyubiquitination of poIRF7. Lysine 359 of poIRF7 was a key site in PDCoV N protein inducing poIRF7 degradation.

We first use spatial econometric techniques to document direct and indirect spillovers of new infections across county and state lines, as well as the impact of individual states' lock-down policies on infections in neighboring states. We find consistent statistical evidence that new cases diffuse across county lines, holding county level factors constant, and that the diffusion across counties was affected by the closure policies of adjacent states. Spatial impulse response functions reveal that the diffusion across counties is persistent for up to ten days after an increase in adjacent counties. We then develop a spatial version of the epidemiological SIR model where new infections arise from interactions between infected people in one state and susceptible people in the same or in neighboring states. We incorporate lock-down policies into our model and calibrate the model to match both the cumulative and the new infections across the 48 contiguous U.S. states and DC. Our results suggest that, had the states with the less restrictive social distancing measures tightened them by one level, the cumulative infections in other states would be about 5% smaller. In our spatial SIR model, the spatial containment policies such as border closures have a bigger impact on flattening the infection curve in the short-run than on the cumulative infections in the long-run.","output":"The Fragmented United States of America: The Impact of Scattered Lock-Down Policies on Country-Wide Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A global emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic demands various studies related to genes and genomes of the SARS-CoV2. Among other important proteins, the role of accessory proteins are of immense importance in replication, regulation of infections of the coronavirus in the hosts. The largest accessory protein in the SARS-CoV2 genome is ORF3a which modulates the host response to the virus infection and consequently it plays an important role in pathogenesis. In this study, an attempt is made to decipher the conservation of nucleotides, dimers, codons and amino acids in the ORF3a genes across thirty-two genomes of Indian patients. ORF3a gene possesses single and double point mutations in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes suggesting the change of SARS-CoV2's virulence property in Indian patients. We find that the parental origin of the ORF3a gene over the genomes of SARS-CoV2 and Pangolin-CoV is same from the phylogenetic analysis based on conservation of nucleotides and so on. This study highlights the accumulation of mutation on ORF3a in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes which may provide the designing therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV2.","output":"Molecular conservation and differential mutation on ORF3a gene in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose:: This paper aims to review the latest management developments across the globe and pinpoint practical implications from cutting-edge research and case studies.

Medical students are more anxious and depressed than their peers, and the prevalence of various mental health problems is on the rise.[(1,2)]With an ever increasingly competitive climate, mental morbidity and stress are seen to increase along with the years of training.[(3)] While the factors such as heavy workload and concerns about the examinations may even be essential for all-round development, they result in burnout, lack of sleep, and have an adverse effect on academic performance.[(4,5)] Physician and medical student suicides have become alarmingly common in the present day. Much priority is not afforded to the mental health of health-care personnel, despite growing evidence of untreated mental disorders in this group.[(4)] Mental health issues among medical students are also often unreported owing to stigma due to several factors, such as, fear of being evaluated poorly by faculty members, diminished respect from peers, or being perceived as unable to handle responsibilities.[(6)] A higher incidence of substance abuse is also noted in medical students, and these habits are usually new and persist throughout adulthood.[(7)] As future health-care providers, medical students require early attention and support systems for their well-being during medical school. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 pandemic has had far reaching psychosocial effects globally.[(8,9)] In March 2020, the government of India announced a nationwide lockdown, as an essential and effective measure for breaking the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission cycle. The psychosocial effects of the pandemic as well as the lockdown, such as depression, anxiety, and panic have taken a toll on the entire population and medical professionals, resident doctors and House surgeon have been no exception. The pandemic marked an end to normal day-to-day life. Uncertainty and uneasiness have pervaded in the medical student community, who have now not been exposed to classroom or clinical experience for almost 3 months due to the lockdown restrictions. Ambiguity about the future, especially in relation to examinations, curriculum, promotion to the next semester, commencement of internship, competitive examinations, and finding employment, is likely to aggravate any preexisting mental health problems in the medical student, adding to the feelings of anxiety, and self-doubt. This study assesses the mental health of medical health professionals, residents and house surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic by employing a general health questionnaire (GHQ). The prevalence of mental health issues is estimated, and associations between mental health status and other demographic variables are also studied. METHODOLOGY: This was a cross-sectional study conceptualized and designed at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Khammam,Telangana. Sample size was calculated taking prevalence value = 50%, precision = 4%,  = 0.05, and 95% confidence interval, and the minimum required sample size was 60. This study included a sample of 105 medical resident doctors and house surgeons at Mamata Medical college, Khammam, Telangana. The GHQ-28 was adapted to GoogleForms? and administered to the medical professionals at Mamata medical college. The survey was circulated extensively across Mamata medical college, and the responses were collected for a period of 1 month from april 30, 2021 to july 5, 2021. Informed consent was obtained along with the survey responses, and confidentiality issues were explained to all the respondents of the survey. Surveys with incomplete responses were excluded. The questionnaire is divided into four parts by the factor analysis. Questions (Q) 1 to Q7 are for somatic symptoms, Q8 to Q14 are for anxiety/insomnia, Q15 to Q21 are for social dysfunction, and Q22 to Q28 are for depression. Hence, a somatic symptoms score, anxiety/insomnia score, social dysfunction score, depression score, and total GHQ score are calculated. Each of the four subscores and the total score were treated as continuous measures and analyzed for association with other variables. A Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3, signifying not at all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, and much more than usual was employed for the GHQ-28. The total score hence ranged from 0 to 84. The GHQ-28 has been translated and validated in over 38 different languages since its introduction, and this study utilized the English version. We used a cutoff score of >23 to define an abnormal GHQ score. The Cronbachs alpha of reliability for the GHQ-28 has been reported to vary from 0.78 to 0.95.[(10,11)] STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Sciences, Version 20 (IBM Corp., SPSS statistics for windows, Armonk, NY, USA)[(12)] for Windows (version 21) and Microsoft Excel 2010. Categorical variables were analyzed with the Chisquare test. Statistical significance levels for all analyses were set at the P = 0.05. RESULTS: This study included 105 medical professionals including House surgeons and Resident doctors practicing in different clinical departments, working at Mamata Medical college, khammam,Telangana. Mean age for the study sample is 25.28years, there were 43 male and 62 female at total of 105 medical professionals out of which 17 were male House surgeons and 35 female house surgeons, 26 were male residents and 27 female residents. In this study 70 participants have scored >23 GHQ score. Females were shown to have higher GHQ score >23 than the male participants. A correlation coefficient was computed to assess the relationship between GHQ 28 score with the male and female residents and house surgeon. But statistically insignificant p value was emerged that is 0.57, as the p value is taken as <0.05, Chi square statistics with Yates correction is 0.0138, p value is 0.71 which is not significant at p<0.05. The questionnaire is divided into four parts by the factor analysis. Questions (Q) 1 to Q7 are for somatic symptoms, Q8 to Q14 are for anxiety/insomnia, Q15 to Q21 are for social dysfunction, and Q22 to Q28 are for depression. These individual scores were compared among the male and female participants out of whom p value was not significant for Somatic, Social dysfunction and Depression. But p value was significant for Anxiety when compared among the male and female participants which signifies that females were more prone to anxiety than male participants, as the female participants scored GHQ score of >23 more than male participants. The two-tailed P value equals 0.0122 By conventional criteria, this difference is considered to be statistically significant for Anxiety among the male and female participants. DISCUSSION: This study assessed psychological morbidity among Medical health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic, and several findings have emerged. A staggering 60 % of participants had an abnormal GHQ score, which was higher than the prevalence rates reported by other authors in similar studies in India and worldwide.[(13,-15)] Medical training-related distress is a well-known phenomenon and goes hand in hand with the difficulty and the challenges of the profession. In them present day, competition in the field of medicine is at an all-time high, and failure to contend against over 100,000s of others carries a steep cost. The realization that the pandemic is here to stay has set in, with most of the participants believing that the pandemic will continue to affect them for 6 months or more. This study found that almost one-thirds of participants felt, particularly uneasy and uncertain about their careers and future on account of this pandemic, and these participants were twice as likely to score higher on the GHQ questionnaire. This study also saw females being two times as likely to have mental health issues. Females may tend to show the higher levels of psychological distress due to a decreased sense of coherence and less social support, as hypothesized and described in other studies.[(13,16)] This study has revealed that An emphasis on early intervention and an open culture that permits the expression of personal grievances and struggles is of paramount importance. A learning environment that punishes a student for underperformance is counterproductive and not conducive to personal improvement. On the other hand, the medical profession is one that demands intense resilience and patience, and it is through friendly guidance from faculty that this goal becomes achievable for a medical student. The inclusion of mentorship programs between faculty and students and mandatory appointment of trained counsellors in medical schools is a step in the right direction. The role of yoga, meditation, and mindfulness has also been studied extensively as a means to reduce the stress and anxiety.[(17,18)] Widespread application of these modalities for the psychological well-being of medical students could prove promising and are the need of the hour if we want the health of our future generations in capable hands. CONCLUSION: Mental health issues are very common among medical professionals, which may be aggravated now during the COVID-19 pandemic. The factors such as uncertainty caused by pandemic, female sex were associated with greater mental health issues. Even disregarding the pandemic as a stressor, guidance and counselling, and intervention at the individual, group and community levels are still essential for the all-round development of medical professionals. Further studies utilizing various tools to assess mental health may be warranted. LIMITATIONS: This study was an open survey of medical professionals at Mamata Medical College, Khammam, and thus a systematic approach to sampling was followed. The GHQ-28 was merely a single tool used in this study to assess mental health and may not accurately depict the complete picture. While uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic was strongly associated with mental health problems in this study, it cannot be determined what proportion of these problems was pre-existing, to arrive at a causeeffect relationship between the pandemic and mental health problems.

METHODS: We monitored the plasma levels of type III IFNs in relation to the phenotype and the function of NK cells in a cohort of people who inject drugs (PWID) during acute HCV infection with different outcomes. RESULTS: Early acute HCV was associated with high variability in type III IFNs plasma levels and the favorable IFN\\\\3 CC genotype was associated with higher viral loads. Reduced expression of Natural Killer Group Protein 2A (NKG2A) was associated with lower IFN\\\\3 plasma levels and the CC genotype. IFN\\\\ production by NK cells was higher in individuals with the CC genotype during acute infection but this did not prevent viral persistence. IFN\\\\3 plasma levels did not correlate with function of NK cells and IFN\\\\3 prestimulation did not affect NK cell activation and function.

Lecture based learning about psychiatric emergencies is a part of the induction programme for all junior doctors starting their placements however practical learning and practice of skills in this area is not. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this issue by providing an additional challenge to the delivery of face to face teaching for junior doctors both in clinical and educational settings. Method The author offered a virtual role play based teaching session to two cohorts of Junior Doctors (GP trainees and foundation trainees) who were starting their psychiatric hospital placements at Surrey and Borders Partnership. The virtual sessions were conducted over Microsoft teams. This session had been run once before as face to face teaching (F2F) in January 2019 (N = 9) prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from this session were compared to data obtained from the virtual sessions in November 2020 and January 2021 (N = 16). Pre and post study questionnaires were administered via Microsoft Forms. Each session lasted 1 hour and consisted of 3 different role play scenarios based around acute psychiatric emergencies. One junior doctor volunteer acted as the patient in each scenario and another volunteer as the doctor. The other participants all acted as observers. Each scenario lasted 10 minutes with ten minutes for feedback from the researcher afterwards using the ALOBA framework. Categorical, ordinal data were collected using a Likert scale and general qualitative feedback was also gathered. Result The questionnaire return rate was 100% for F2F teaching and 57% for virtual teaching. 100% of participants felt that F2F role play was an acceptable way to practice skills in acute psychiatry vs 75% of participants who felt this about virtual role play. 100% of participants found that F2F role play was quite or very effective in improving their confidence and perceived competence in acute psychiatry vs 88% of participants who felt this about virtual role play. Conclusion Virtual role play based learning is an acceptable and effective method in improving the confidence and perceived competence of junior doctors undertaking on call shifts in inpatient psychiatry but it appears to be less effective than face to face role play based learning. The researcher will act upon the qualitative feedback obtained which suggested ways in which the virtual session could be improved.","output":"Evaluating virtual role play based learning to improve the confidence and competence of Junior Doctors undertaking on call shifts in inpatient Psychiatry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the concern for COVID-19, universities in Korea switched to online teaching in most chemistry courses in the spring semester, 2020 While online lectures have been available for a small number of courses in the previous semesters, it is unprecedented that most lectures should be given online In this communication, we describe how higher education in chemistry has been made in the spring semester, 2020, mainly based on the experience of the author and colleagues, and address the insights gained that we would like to share Admittedly, the experience is limited, and there are still unresolved challenges","output":"Online Teaching of Chemistry during the Period of COVID-19: Experience at a National University in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Point-of-care ultrasound can be an effective tool for pediatric emergency medicine providers in the evaluation of soft tissue lesions.

With the aid of smart facilities, the present study aimed at understanding an elder's moods based on the persons activities of daily living (ADLs). With this end in view, an explainable probabilistic graphical modeling approach, applying the Bayesian network (BN), was proposed. The proposed BN-based model was capable of defining the relationship between the elder's ADLs and moods in three different levels: Activity-based Feature (AbF), Category of Activity (CoA), and the mood state. The model also allowed us to explain the transformations among the different levels/nodes on the defined BNs. A framework featured with smart facilities, including a smart home, a smartphone, and a wristband, was utilized to assess the model. The smart home was an elderly woman's house, equipped with a set of binary-based sensors. For about five months, the ADLs' data have been recorded through daily behavioral-based information, registered by experts using a defined questionnaire. The obtained results proved that the proposed BN-based model of the current study could promisingly estimate the elder's moods and CoA states. Moreover, in contrast to the machine learning techniques that behave like a black box, the effect of each feature from the lower levels to the higher levels of information of the BNs can be traced.

CBL-CIPK gene families and their interacting complexes are involved in regulating plant responses to various environmental stimuli. To gain insight into the functional divergence of CBL-CIPK genes in honeysuckle, a total of six LjCBL and 17 LjCIPK genes were identified. The phylogenetic analysis along with the gene structure analysis divided both CBL and CBL-interacting protein kinase genes into four subgroups and validated by the distribution of conserved protein motifs. The 3-D structure prediction of proteins shown that most LjCBLs shared the same Protein Data Bank hit 1uhnA and most LjCIPKs shared the 6c9Da. Analysis of cis-acting elements and gene ontology implied that both LjCBL and LjCIPK genes could be involved in hormone signal responsiveness and stress adaptation. Protein-protein interaction prediction suggested that LjCBL4 is hypothesized to interact with LjCIPK7/9/15/16 and SOS1/NHX1. Gene expression analysis in response to salinity stress revealed that LjCBL2/4, LjCIPK1/15/17 under all treatments gradually increased over time until peak expression at 72 h. These results demonstrated the conservation of salt overly sensitive pathway genes in honeysuckle and a model of Ca(2+)-LjCBL4/LjSOS3-LjCIPK16/LjSOS2 module-mediated salt stress signaling in honeysuckle is proposed.

In the present study, we investigated the degradation, subcellular localisation, and function of TGEV N protein by examining its effects on cycle progression, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression, and cell survival. The results showed that TGEV N protein localised in the cytoplasm, inhibited IEC growth, prolonged the S-phase cell cycle by down-regulating cell cycle protein cyclin A, and was mainly degraded through the proteasome pathway. Moreover, TGEV N protein induced ER stress and activated NF-B, which was responsible for the up-regulation of IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression. This report mainly considers the functions of TGEV N protein in IEC. To be specific, in IEC, TGEV N protein induces cell cycle prolongation at the S-phase, ER stress and up-regulates IL-8 expression.

Although other diagnostic methods have been introduced, detection of viral genes on oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse-transcription real time-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays is still the gold standard. Efficient viral RNA extraction is a prerequisite for downstream performance of rRT-PCR assays. Currently, several automatic methods that include RNA extraction are available. However, due to the growing demand, a shortage in kit supplies could be experienced in several labs. For these reasons, the use of different commercial or in-house protocols for RNA extraction may increase the possibility to analyze high number of samples. Herein, we compared the efficiency of RNA extraction of three different commercial kits and an in-house extraction protocol using synthetic ssRNA standards of SARS-CoV-2 as well as in oro-nasopharyngeal swabs from six COVID-19-positive patients. It was concluded that tested commercial kits can be used with some modifications for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome by rRT-PCR approaches, although with some differences in RNA yields. Conversely, EXTRAzol reagent was the less efficient due to the phase separation principle at the basis of RNA extraction.

Our study aims were (1) to report full-length genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 collected from four COVID-19 patients in the Special Region of Yogyakarta and Central Java provinces, Indonesia; (2) to compare the clade distribution of full-length genome sequences from Indonesia (n = 60) from March to September 2020 and (3) to perform phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes from different countries, including Indonesia. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) applied in the Illumina MiSeq instrument. Full-length virus genomes were annotated using the reference genome of hCoV-19/Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 (NC_045512.2) and then visualized in UGENE v. 1.30. For phylogenetic analysis, a dataset of 88 available SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes from different countries, including Indonesia, was retrieved from GISAID. RESULTS: All patients were hospitalized with various severities of COVID-19. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that one and three virus samples belong to clade L and GH. These three clade GH virus samples (EPI_ISL_525492, EPI_ISL_516800 and EPI_ISL_516829) were not only located in a cluster with SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Asia but also those from Europe, whereas the clade L virus sample (EPI_ISL_516806) was located amongst SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Asia. Using full-length sequences available in the GISAID EpiCoV Database, 39 of 60 SARS-CoV-2 (65%) from Indonesia harbor the D614G mutation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: At a fixed dose of 1500 mg every 28 days, anti PD-L1 Durvalumab was given concomitantly to Radiotherapy and Cetuximab starting from the first week of combined treatment, followed by adjuvant Durvalumab to a maximum of 6 months after completion of radiation. The primary endpoint of the study was 2-year progression-free survival (PFS). A safety run-in was planned. Due to regulatory issues which prevented from opening multiple centers, COVID-19 pandemic and withdrawal of Durvalumab from supporting company, the study was prematurely terminated in April 2021 RESULTS: Between July 2019 and August 2020, 9 patients were enrolled in the study. All tumors had a PD-L1 Combined Positive Score > 1. Optimal drug exposure was observed, with mean relative dose intensity of 85.5% and 87.5% for Cetuximab and Durvalumab, respectively. No radiation breaks were necessary. A grade 4 mucositis lasting for 14 days corresponded to the only dose limiting toxicity we reported. At a median follow-up of 11.5 months (IQR 7.7-16.7) all surviving patients (6 out of 9) are disease-free, with 1 and 2-year PFS rates of 77.7% and 58.3%, respectively. A selective sparing of node levels in the elective volume was performed in all cases, yielding a cumulative mean dose of 37.6 Gy (SD 8.4).

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the recent acquis communautaire which introduces measures affecting the internal market of the European Union, i.e. the right of citizens of the European Union to free movement of persons. Nowadays, we are witnessing many restrictions ranging from those related to the freedom of movement of people from one Member State to another to the ones linked with trade in goods and services. The question arises as to whether the EU is adequately dealing with the public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Firstly, it should be pointed out that public health policy falls within the competence of the Member States, while the EU only supports them through its actions (Art. 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU). In this context, the paper analyses the competence of the EU regarding the health and scope of the EU Health Policy. Secondly, no fundamental market freedom is absolute, so the Member States may impose certain restrictions if they are justified. The protection of public health is certainly one of the legitimate reasons for imposing restrictions, but the question arises as to whether all the measures taken by the Member States are proportionate to the goal and if there is any softer measure that could achieve the same effect.

Will rural populations with low levels of education know how to apply community-based infection control? We undertook fieldwork in two villages in central Sierra Leone to gain insight into how rural people faced with Covid-19 assess epidemic infection risks. METHODS: Two communities were selected based on prior contrasted exposure to Ebola Virus DiseaseCone with substantial number of cases and the other having resisted infection through strong community sequestration measures. We assessed understanding of infection risks via an experimental game. This asked players to express a preference for one of two diseases, one resembling Ebola with lower risk of infection and the other resembling Covid-19 with lower risk of death. Players were not told the identity of the diseases. RESULTS: In total 107 adult villagers played the game (58% women). Half (52%) preferred the disease model with lower risk of infection, 29% preferred the model with lower risk of death, while 21% saw the combined risk of infection and death as being equivalent. Differences in reactions between the two locations were small despite different experiences of Ebola. Asked to explain their choices 48% of players cited information on infection risks modelled by the game and 31% stated that their choices reflected awareness of the need for personal action and respect for local regulations. We concluded that villagers thoughtfully assess disease risks and that some are good intuitive statisticians. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest rural people in Sierra Leone retain the lessons of experience from the Ebola outbreak of 2014C15 and will be able to apply these lessons to a new infectious disease for which have no prior practical experience. Our expectation is that rural populations will understand Covid-19 control measures, thus reducing need for draconian enforcement.","output":"How villagers in central Sierra Leone understand infection risks under threat of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The early clinical course of COVID-19 can be difficult to distinguish from other illnesses driving presentation to hospital. However, viral-specific PCR testing has limited sensitivity and results can take up to 72 h for operational reasons. We aimed to develop and validate two early-detection models for COVID-19, screening for the disease among patients attending the emergency department and the subset being admitted to hospital, using routinely collected health-care data (laboratory tests, blood gas measurements, and vital signs). These data are typically available within the first hour of presentation to hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries, within the existing laboratory infrastructure. METHODS: We trained linear and non-linear machine learning classifiers to distinguish patients with COVID-19 from pre-pandemic controls, using electronic health record data for patients presenting to the emergency department and admitted across a group of four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK (Oxford University Hospitals). Data extracted included presentation blood tests, blood gas testing, vital signs, and results of PCR testing for respiratory viruses. Adult patients (>18 years) presenting to hospital before Dec 1, 2019 (before the first COVID-19 outbreak), were included in the COVID-19-negative cohort; those presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2019, and April 19, 2020, with PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included in the COVID-19-positive cohort. Patients who were subsequently admitted to hospital were included in their respective COVID-19-negative or COVID-19-positive admissions cohorts. Models were calibrated to sensitivities of 70%, 80%, and 90% during training, and performance was initially assessed on a held-out test set generated by an 80:20 split stratified by patients with COVID-19 and balanced equally with pre-pandemic controls. To simulate real-world performance at different stages of an epidemic, we generated test sets with varying prevalences of COVID-19 and assessed predictive values for our models. We prospectively validated our 80% sensitivity models for all patients presenting or admitted to the Oxford University Hospitals between April 20 and May 6, 2020, comparing model predictions with PCR test results. FINDINGS: We assessed 155 689 adult patients presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2017, and April 19, 2020. 114 957 patients were included in the COVID-negative cohort and 437 in the COVID-positive cohort, for a full study population of 115 394 patients, with 72 310 admitted to hospital. With a sensitive configuration of 80%, our emergency department (ED) model achieved 774% sensitivity and 957% specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0939) for COVID-19 among all patients attending hospital, and the admissions model achieved 774% sensitivity and 948% specificity (AUROC 0940) for the subset of patients admitted to hospital. Both models achieved high negative predictive values (NPV; >985%) across a range of prevalences (5%). We prospectively validated our models for all patients presenting and admitted to Oxford University Hospitals in a 2-week test period. The ED model (3326 patients) achieved 923% accuracy (NPV 976%, AUROC 0881), and the admissions model (1715 patients) achieved 925% accuracy (977%, 0871) in comparison with PCR results. Sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in negative PCR results improved apparent accuracy (ED model 951%, admissions model 941%) and NPV (ED model 990%, admissions model 985%). INTERPRETATION: Our models performed effectively as a screening test for COVID-19, excluding the illness with high-confidence by use of clinical data routinely available within 1 h of presentation to hospital. Our approach is rapidly scalable, fitting within the existing laboratory testing infrastructure and standard of care of hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries.

It is not known whether sex hormones contribute to this predisposition. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of concentrations of serum testosterone, estradiol, and insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1, concentrations of which are regulated by sex hormone signaling) with COVID-19 severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study was conducted using serum samples collected from consecutive patients who presented from March through May 2020 to the Barnes Jewish Hospital in St Louis, Missouri, with COVID-19 (diagnosed using nasopharyngeal swabs). EXPOSURES: Testosterone, estradiol, and IGF-1 concentrations were measured at the time of presentation (ie, day 0) and at days 3, 7, 14, and 28 after admission (if the patient remained hospitalized). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Baseline hormone concentrations were compared among patients who had severe COVID-19 vs those with milder COVID-19 illness. RNA sequencing was performed on circulating mononuclear cells to understand the mechanistic association of altered circulating hormone concentrations with cellular signaling pathways. RESULTS: Among 152 patients (90 [59.2%] men; 62 [40.8%] women; mean [SD] age, 63 [16] years), 143 patients (94.1%) were hospitalized. Among 66 men with severe COVID-19, median [interquartile range] testosterone concentrations were lower at day 0 (53 [18 to 114] ng/dL vs 151 [95 to 217] ng/dL; P = .01) and day 3 (19 [6 to 68] ng/dL vs 111 [49 to 274] ng/dL; P = .006) compared with 24 men with milder disease. Testosterone concentrations were inversely associated with concentrations of interleukin 6 ( = ?0.43; 95% CI, ?0.52 to ?0.17; P < .001), C-reactive protein ( = ?0.38; 95% CI, ?0.78 to ?0.16; P = .004), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist ( = ?0.29; 95% CI, ?0.64 to ?0.06; P = .02), hepatocyte growth factor ( = ?0.46; 95% CI, ?0.69 to ?0.25; P < .001), and interferon èCinducible protein 10 ( = ?0.32; 95% CI, ?0.62 to ?0.10; P = .007).

Histopathological organ changes might not only be attributable to a direct virus-induced effect, but also the immune response. The aims of this study were to assess the duration of viral presence, identify the extent of inflammatory response, and investigate the underlying cause of coagulopathy. Methods: This prospective autopsy cohort study was done at Amsterdam University Medical Centers (UMC), the Netherlands. With informed consent from relatives, full body autopsy was done on 21 patients with COVID-19 for whom autopsy was requested between March 9 and May 18, 2020. In addition to histopathological evaluation of organ damage, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and the composition of the immune infiltrate and thrombi were assessed, and all were linked to disease course. Findings: Our cohort (n=21) included 16 (76%) men, and median age was 68 years (range 41-78). Median disease course (time from onset of symptoms to death) was 22 days (range 5-44 days). In 11 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 tropism, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells were present in multiple organs, most abundantly in the lungs, but presence in the lungs became sporadic with increased disease course. Other SARS-CoV-2-positive organs included the upper respiratory tract, heart, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. In histological analyses of organs (sampled from nine to 21 patients per organ), an extensive inflammatory response was present in the lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. In the brain, extensive inflammation was seen in the olfactory bulbs and medulla oblongata. Thrombi and neutrophilic plugs were present in the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, and brain and were most frequently observed late in the disease course (15 patients with thrombi, median disease course 22 days [5-44]; ten patients with neutrophilic plugs, 21 days [5-44]). Neutrophilic plugs were observed in two forms: solely composed of neutrophils with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), or as aggregates of NETs and platelets.. Interpretation: In patients with lethal COVID-19, an extensive systemic inflammatory response was present, with a continued presence of neutrophils and NETs. However, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were only sporadically present at late stages of COVID-19. This suggests a maladaptive immune response and substantiates the evidence for immunomodulation as a target in the treatment of severe COVID-19.

METHODS: 7824 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in a multicenter-international prospective registry (HOPE-COVID19). Clinical data and in-hospital complications were recorded. AP regimen, including aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs, was obtained for each patient. RESULTS: During hospitalization 730 (9.3%) patients received AP drugs with single (93%, n=680) or dual APT (7%, n=50). Patients treated with APT were older (7312 vs 6217 years, p<0.01), more frequently male (70% vs 64%, p<0.01) and had higher prevalence of diabetes (39.5% vs 17%, p<0.01). Patients treated with APT showed no differences in terms of in-hospital mortality (18% vs 19%, p=0.64, Log Rank p=0.23), need of invasive ventilation (8.7% vs 8.5%, p=0.88) and bleeding (2.1% vs 2.4%, p=0.43); However, after excluding patients treated only with anticoagulation, APT was associated with lower mortality rates (Log Rank p<0.01, relative risk 0.79, 95% CI 0.70C0.94) (Figure 1). At multivariable analysis including age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, respiratory failure, pre-hospital therapy with antiplatelet drugs, in-hospital APT, and anticoagulation therapy, in-hospital APT was associated with a lower mortality risk (relative risk 0.29, 95% CI 0.22C0.38, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: APT during hospitalization for COVID-19 could be associated with lower mortality risk without increased risk of bleeding. Randomized trials are needed to confirm these preliminary data.

Earlier detection of SARS-CoV-2 may position us to better mitigate risk of spread. Both asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission are common in outbreaks, and threshold temperatures, such as 38C, for screening for infection could miss timely detection in the majority. DesignRetrospective cohort study using electronic health records MethodsWe hypothesized that in long-term care residents, temperature trends with SARS-CoV-2 infection could identify infection in pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals earlier. We collected information about age and other demographics, baseline temperature, and specific comorbidities. We created standardized definitions, and an alternative hypothetical model to test measures of temperature variation and compare outcomes to the VA reality. Settings and participantsOur subjects were 6,176 residents of the VA NHs who underwent SARS-CoV-2 trigger testing. ResultsWe showed that a change from baseline of >0.4C identifies 47% of the SARS-CoV-2 positive NH residents early, and achieves earlier detection by 42.2 hours. Range improves early detection to 55% when paired with a 37.2C cutoff, and achieves earlier detection by 44.4 hours. Temperature elevation >0.4C from baseline, when combined with a 0.7C range, would detect 52% early, leading to earlier detection by more than 3 days in 22% of the residents. This earlier detection comes at the expense of triggering 57,793 tests, as compared to the number of trigger tests ordered in the VA system of 40,691. Conclusion and implicationsOur model suggests that current clinical screening for SARS-CoV-2 in NHs can be substantially improved upon by triggering testing using a patient-derived baseline temperature with a 0.4C degree relative elevation or temperature variability of 0.7C trigger threshold for SARS-CoV2 testing. Such triggers could be automated in facilities that track temperatures in their electronic records.","output":"Can we clinically identify pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper compares health policy responses to COVID-19 in Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom and United States of America (US) from January to November 2020, with the aim of facilitating cross-country learning.

RESULTS: The project is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation as part of the National Research Program NRP74 for a period of 48 months starting from January 2017. As of October 2021, data for the nonrandomized, quasi-experimental study and the qualitative study have been collected, and the results are expected to be published by the end of the year. Data are currently being collected for the economic evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other Swiss CRHT experiences, the CRHT intervention in Ticino represents a unique case, as the introduction of the service is backed by the closing of one of its acute wards. The proposed study will address several areas where there are evidence gaps or contradictory findings relating to the home treatment of acute mental crisis. Findings from this study will allow local services to improve their effectiveness in a challenging domain of public health and contribute to improving access to more effective care for people with severe mental disorders.

The evolution of surgical approaches and the design of elbow-specific implants over the last decades have failed to improve clinical and radiological outcomes. Studies are sparse regarding the long-term influence of surgical treatment of these types of fractures in the upper limb function. The purpose of the current study was to retrospectively review the long-term functional outcome and complications of all intraarticular (AO type B, C) distal humerus fractures treated surgically in a university hospital during the last 25 years. Material and methods The study included patients who were surgically treated for an intra-articular distal humerus fracture between March 1991 and May 2016. Our initial search, using ICD-10 codes, identified 63 patients in the specific time period. Twelve patients had died, nine declined to participate, eight had emigrated, nine could not be located and one patient was excluded as he suffered from quadriplegia unrelated to the initial injury. The remaining 25 patients (mean age at surgery 44.219.67) were included in a follow-up study protocol. Functional outcome was evaluated according to Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), Oxford Elbow Score (OES), and the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH). Pain was assessed using the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and subjects were asked to rate their satisfaction. Perioperative and late complications were recorded as well. Results The average follow-up was 158.16  73.73 months. The average score was 89.4  12.36 for MEPS, 42.68  4.03 for OES, and 8.1  15.38 for the QuickDASH. The patient satisfaction was rated 3.8  1.08 on average. The mean flexion of the affected elbow was 137.6  12.68 degrees while extension deficit was present in 14/25 patients, with a mean of 8.6  8.96 degrees. We did not observe any mal- or non-unions. The re-operation rate was 32% primarily due to stiffness and irritation from the hardware. We noticed one spontaneously resolved ulnar nerve palsy, one combined radial, and ulnar nerve palsy after extensive arthrolysis that also resolved two cases of heterotopic ossification, one case of implant failure, and two cases of infection - one superficial, which was managed with antibiotics, and the other was deep managed with surgical drainage. Conclusions In our series, we found a satisfying range of motion, good functional outcome, and adequate ability to perform daily activities at a very long follow-up.

This comes with a drawback, since CoG has a non-linear response at the periphery of the detector due to the lack of weights beyond the detector. Detectors with multiplexed readout that are based on finely segmented scintillators and coarsely segmented photosensors are known to suffer from the so called edge effect where a pile-up of the reconstructed coordinates from the edge crystals is observed. This may lead to incorrect assignment of the events to crystal pixels and result in formation of erroneous lines of response causing a degradation of spatial resolution and reduction of image contrast. To overcome abovementioned limitations in gamma ray detectors with multiplexed photosensor readout, we propose to use modified Gaussian Position Weighted Center of Gravity technique for calculation of gamma ray interaction position. Here the proposed method is applied to PET detectors with 2424 LYSO crystals read out by 8  8 SiPM array with 64:16 row/column multiplexing. Furthermore, we compared the modified Gaussian Position Weighted Center of Gravity (PW-CoG) and Truncated Center of Gravity (TCoG) coordinate reconstruction methods.

Psychological first aid (PFA) is promoted by public health authorities to provide psychological support in the context of extreme events; however, there is limited evidence for its effectiveness. As a prerequisite to conducting a randomised controlled trial to examine programme effectiveness, this project is evaluating the acceptability and feasibility of implementing and evaluating a PFA training programme ('LIVES for Families') for mental health (MH) practitioners to improve their ability to recognise and respond to COVID-19-related psychological distress among their clients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are using a triangulation mixed methods research design; complementary strands of quantitative and qualitative data are being collected in parallel and will be merged at the interpretation phase of the project. The quantitative strand uses a repeated measures design; a consecutive sample of MH practitioners (n=80) providing MH support to young people or their families are being recruited to participate in the LIVES for Families PFA training programme and complete quantitative measures at baseline (pretraining), 2-week and 6-month follow-up time points. The qualitative strand uses fundamental description and semistructured interviews with a subset of practitioners (n=30), as well as managers of MH agencies (n=20). A mixed methods joint display and associated narrative will generate a comprehensive understanding regarding acceptability and feasibility. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board approved the study (project number: 11295). Results will be shared broadly with the policy and practice community through publications, presentations and public webinars. As a brief, evidence-informed intervention, the LIVES for Families PFA training programme is suitable in its mode of delivery across care settings.

Authorities increased the number of tests performed, including the identification of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (IgG, IgA, and IgM). There was an overflooding of the market with several tests, and the presence of possible false-positive results became a challenge. The purpose of this study was to describe the seroprevalence and immunoglobulin blood levels in a group of asymptomatic individuals using the reference levels provided by the manufacturer. Methods: Levels of IgG and IgA antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were determined in blood serum by the same ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoassay) test. Patients must be free of symptoms. Results: From 20 to 22 May 2020, 938 individuals were tested. There were 441 (47%) men, age 53 years (interquartile range (IQR) = 39-63.2). The sample included 335 (35.7%) subjects aged &#8805;60 years old. Subjects with a positive test were 54 (5.8%) for IgG and 96 (10.2%) for IgA and 42 (4.5%) for both IgG and IgA. The prevalence of IgG and IgA positive test was not different in men and women and not different in individuals under 60 and over 60 years of age. Conversely, analysing only individuals with positive tests, the levels of IgG in positive subjects were significantly higher than those with an IgA positive test, 3.00 (IQR = 1.68-5.65), and 1.95 (IQR = 1.40-3.38), respectively; P = 0.017. Additionally, individuals with isolated IgA positive tests had significantly lower levels of IgA than those with both IgA and IgG positive tests: 1.95 (IQR = 1.60-2.40) and 3.15 (IQR = 2.20-3.90), respectively, P = 0.005. These latter data suggest that IgA shows a deviation of the distribution to the left in comparison to IgG distribution data. Indeed, many subjects reported as IgA positive had immunoglobulin levels slightly elevated. Conclusions: In conclusion, we strongly suggest caution in the interpretation of IgA test results.

Infection of other animals could be detrimental by causing clinical disease, allowing further mutations, and bares the risk for the establishment of a non-human reservoir. Cats were the first reported animals susceptible to natural and experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2. Given the concerns these findings raised, and the close contact between humans and cats, we aimed to develop a vaccine candidate that could reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and in addition to prevent spread among cats. Here we report that a Replicon Particle (RP) vaccine based on Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, known to be safe and efficacious in a variety of animal species, could induce neutralizing antibody responses in guinea pigs and cats. The design of the SARS-CoV-2 spike immunogen was critical in developing a strong neutralizing antibody response. Vaccination of cats was able to induce high neutralizing antibody responses, effective also against the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant. Interestingly, in contrast to control animals, the infectious virus could not be detected in oropharyngeal or nasal swabs of vaccinated cats after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Correspondingly, the challenged control cats spread the virus to in-contact cats whereas the vaccinated cats did not transmit the virus. The results show that the RP vaccine induces protective immunity preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission.

Breastfeeding support, as an evidence-based intervention by trained lay or professional breastfeeding support providers, can prevent early unintended cessation. Yet some women report dissatisfaction with support and reluctantly stop breastfeeding despite receiving this intervention. Understanding the experiences which shape how support is provided can inform effective implementation of breastfeeding support interventions. This review aims to synthesise experiences of trained breastfeeding support providers in high income settings and how these may influence their breastfeeding support practices. METHODS: A qualitative systematic review of trained breastfeeding supporters' experiences of supporting women to breastfeed, as part of a generic healthcare role or focused breastfeeding support role, will be conducted. A systematic search will be performed of the databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL +), MEDLINE ALL, Maternity and Infant Care, EMBASE, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus. Title and abstract screening using eligibility criteria will be conducted using Covidence software. Eligible papers will be agreed by the review team following full text screening and reported using PRISMA guidelines.

METHODS: The Rheumatology Study Group of the Italian Pediatric Society launched a survey to enroll patients diagnosed with KD (Kawasaki Disease Group C KDG) or KD-like (Kawacovid Group - KCG) disease between February 1st 2020, and May 31st 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory data, treatment information, and patients outcome were collected in an online anonymized database (RedCAP?). Relationship between clinical presentation and SARS-CoV-2 infection was also taken into account. Moreover, clinical characteristics of KDG during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (KDG-CoV2) were compared to Kawasaki Disease patients (KDG-Historical) seen in three different Italian tertiary pediatric hospitals (Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste; AOU Meyer, Florence; IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa) from January 1st 2000 to December 31st 2019. Chi square test or exact Fisher test and non-parametric Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test were used to study differences between two groups. RESULTS: One-hundred-forty-nine cases were enrolled, (96 KDG and 53 KCG). KCG children were significantly older and presented more frequently from gastrointestinal and respiratory involvement. Cardiac involvement was more common in KCG, with 60,4% of patients with myocarditis. 37,8% of patients among KCG presented hypotension/non-cardiogenic shock. Coronary artery abnormalities (CAA) were more common in the KDG. The risk of ICU admission were higher in KCG. Lymphopenia, higher CRP levels, elevated ferritin and troponin-T characterized KCG. KDG received more frequently immunoglobulins (IVIG) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (81,3% vs 66%; p = 0.04 and 71,9% vs 43,4%; p = 0.001 respectively) as KCG more often received glucocorticoids (56,6% vs 14,6%; p < 0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 assay more often resulted positive in KCG than in KDG (75,5% vs 20%; p < 0.0001). Short-term follow data showed minor complications. Comparing KDG with a KD-Historical Italian cohort (598 patients), no statistical difference was found in terms of clinical manifestations and laboratory data. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection might determine two distinct inflammatory diseases in children: KD and PIMS-TS. Older age at onset and clinical peculiarities like the occurrence of myocarditis characterize this multi-inflammatory syndrome. Our patients had an optimal response to treatments and a good outcome, with few complications and no deaths.

METHODS: Online Survey of patients reporting self-diagnosed new onset smell and taste disturbance during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 1 week follow-up. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-two patents completed bot an initial and follow-up survey. 86.4% reported complete anosmia and a further 11.5% a very severe loss of smell at the time of completing the first survey. At follow-up 1 week later, there is already significant improvement in self-rating of severity of olfactory loss. 80.1% report lower severity scores at follow-up, 17.6% are unchanged and 1.9% are worse. 11.5% already report compete resolution at follow up, while 17.3% report persistent complete loss of smell, with reported duration being 1 to over 4 weeks. This is reflected in the overall cumulative improvement rate of 79% patients overall in the interval between surveys. CONCLUSIONS: A review of the growing evidence base supports the likelihood that out cohort have suffered olfactory loss as part of COVID-19 infection. While early recovery rates are encouraging, long term rates will need to be further investigated and there may be an increase in patients with persistent post-viral loss as a result of the pandemic.

Osteoarthritis has acidic and inflammatory environment. Our aim was to load celastrol into HMSNs and capped with chitosan to construct a pH-responsive nanoparticle medicine (CSL@HMSNs-Cs), which is of high solubility for osteoarthritis intra-articular injection treatment. METHODS The CSL@HMSNs-Cs were assembled and the characteristics were measured. The CSL@HMSNs-Cs was applied in vitro in the chondrocytes collected from rats cartilage tissue and in vivo in the MIA induced knee osteoarthritis rats via intra-articular injection. Cytotoxicity assay, pH-responsive release, pain behavior, MRI, safranin o fast green staining, ELISA and western blot analysis were applied to evaluate the bioavailability and therapeutic effect of CSL@HMSNs-Cs. RESULTS CSL@HMSNs-Cs was stable due to the protection of the chitosan layers in alkaline environment (pH = 7.7) but revealed good solubility and therapeutic effect in acidic environment (pH = 6.0). The cytotoxicity assay showed no cytotoxicity at relatively low concentration (200 g/mL) and the cell viability of chondrocytes stimulated by IL-1 was increased in CSL@HMSNs-Cs group. Paw withdrawal threshold in CSL@HMSNs-Cs group is increased, and MRI and Safranin O Fast Green staining showed improvements in articular surface erosion and joint effusion. The upregulated expression levels of IL-1, TNF-, IL-6, MMP-3 and MMP-13 and NF-B signaling pathway of chondrocytes were inhibited in CSL@HMSNs-Cs group.

The current study aimed to examine the potential of a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) as an inhibitor of replication and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The interaction of rfhSP-D with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor was predicted via docking analysis. The inhibition of interaction between the spike protein and ACE-2 by rfhSP-D was confirmed using direct and indirect ELISA. The effect of rfhSP-D on replication and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples was assessed by measuring the expression of RdRp gene of the virus using quantitative PCR. In silico interaction studies indicated that three amino acid residues in the receptor-binding domain of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were commonly involved in interacting with rfhSP-D and ACE-2. Studies using clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases (asymptomatic, n = 7; symptomatic, n = 8) and negative control samples (n = 15) demonstrated that treatment with 1.67 M rfhSP-D inhibited viral replication by a??5.5-fold and was more efficient than remdesivir (100 M) in Vero cells. An approximately two-fold reduction in viral infectivity was also observed after treatment with 1.67 M rfhSP-D.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the excessive activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays an important role in this detrimental lung inflammation. Recently, we developed a unique class of peptide-gold nanoparticle (GNP) hybrids that act as potent nano-inhibitors of TLR4 signaling by modulating the process of endosomal acidification. In this study, we aimed to identify the key physiochemical factors that could further strengthen the anti-inflammatory activity of these nano-inhibitors, including the nanoparticle size, the density of peptides coating the nanoparticle surface, as well as the number of the effective amino acid phenylalanine (F) residues in the peptide sequence. Among these factors, we found that the nanoparticle size could significantly affect the TLR4 inhibition. Specifically, the peptide-GNP hybrids with a GNP core of 20 nm (P12(G20)) exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity on TLR4 activation and its downstream cytokine production among those with a GNP core of 13 nm (P12(G13)) and 5 nm (P12(G5)) in THP-1 cell-derived macrophages. This size-dependent anti-inflammatory effect of the hybrid P12 was also observed in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model of ALI. It was found that P12(G20) was superior to P12(G13) in prolonging the survival of mice experiencing lethal LPS challenge, decreasing the acute lung inflammation, and alleviating diffuse alveolar damage in the lungs. Interestingly, P12(G20) could also promote long-term tolerance to endotoxin. Detailed mechanistic studies demonstrated that when compared to the smaller P12(G13), the larger P12(G20) had higher cellular uptake and a stronger endosomal pH buffering capacity, contributing to its enhanced therapeutic effects on reducing TLR4 activation in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this study suggests that nanoparticle size is one key factor determining the anti-inflammatory potency of the peptide-GNP hybrids, and the hybrid P12 may serve as a promising, novel class of nanotherapeutics for modulating TLR signaling to treat ALI/ARDS. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We have developed a new class of nanoparticle-based inhibitors (i.e., peptide-GNP hybrids) targeting TLR4 signaling in macrophages. Through evidence-based engineering of the nanoparticle size, surface peptide ligand density and effective amino acid (phenylalanine, F) chain length, we identified a peptide-GNP hybrid, P12(G20), with enhanced anti-inflammatory activity. Specifically, P12(G20) was more potent in reducing inflammation in THP-1 cell-derived macrophages and in a LPS-induced ALI mouse model. More interestingly, P12(G20) facilitated long-term protection against lethal LPS challenge in vivo and induced endotoxin tolerance in vitro. We anticipate that these new hybrids would serve as the next generation anti-inflammatory nano-therapeutics for the treatment of ALI/ARDS or other acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.","output":"Size-dependent anti-inflammatory activity of a peptide-gold nanoparticle hybrid in vitro and in a mouse model of acute lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The pandemic coronavirus disease\\\\19 (COVID\\\\19) has pushed the global healthcare system to a crisis and amounted to a huge economic burden.

Patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD), particularly cirrhosis, hepatobiliary malignancies, candidates for liver transplantation, and immunosuppressed individuals after liver transplantation appear to be at increased risk of infections in general, which in turn translates into increased mortality. This is also the case for SARS-CoV-2 infection, where patients with cirrhosis, in particular, are at high risk of a severe COVID-19 course. Therefore, vaccination against various pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, administered as early as possible in patients with CLD, is an important protective measure. However, due to impaired immune responses in these patients, the immediate and long-term protective response through immunisation may be incomplete. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to the exceptionally fast development of several vaccine candidates.

Fourteen patients aged 23 (19.0; 24.8) years old (median [1rst-3rd quartiles]) with CCHS underwent a sleep interview and night-time attended polysomnography with their ventilatory support. Their sleep variables were compared to those collected in 15 healthy control subjects matched for age, sex and body mass index. RESULTS The latency to N3 sleep was shorter in patients (26.3 min [24.0; 30.1]) than in controls (49.5 min [34.3; 66.9]; P = 0.005), and sleep onset latency tended to be shorter in patients (14.0 min [7.0; 20.5]) than in controls (33.0 min [18.0; 49.0]; P = 0.052). Total sleep time, sleep stage percentages, sleep fragmentation as well as respiratory and movement index were within normal ranges and not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS Normal sleep in adult patients with CCHS and adequate ventilator support indicates that the PHOX2 gene mutations do not affect brain sleep networks.

The analysis of the results permits us to conclude: (1) in the circumstances of macroeconomic changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, entrepreneurial activity does not decrease;(2) respondents are less interested in being employed by others and more attracted to being entrepreneurs;(3) there is a growing concordance with the values that society places on entrepreneurship;and (4) there is now a greater aptitude for entrepreneurial activity. The present research is original, as it compares data obtained in different contexts of economic and social stability. It contributes to theory and practice, in the sense that it points to conclusions in the opposite direction of other studies carried out in situations of disasters of another nature, and can serve as a reference for the development of strategies to promote entrepreneurship, within higher education institutions and official entities to publicize and promote new public policies.","output":"Entrepreneurial Intention before and during COVID-19A Case Study on Portuguese University Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article describes poststructural ways of responding to the pandemic by looking for openings or gaps within more traditional ways of interacting with dilemmas.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and changes in the amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during the Covid-19 crisis. Using the Dutch Lifelines Covid-19 cohort study (n = 17,749), the amount of MVPA was measured at 15 time-points between March and December 2020, and compared with the amount before the Covid19 pandemic. For SES, the population was stratified in three education and income levels. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) of altered MVPA for low and high SES groups, with the middle SES category as the reference group. A clear socioeconomic gradient in changes in MVPA behavior was observed. Low educated individuals had significantly higher odds (OR = 1.14; CI: 1.03C1.27) of decreasing MVPA, while the high educated had significantly lower odds of decreased MVPA (OR = 0.84, CI: 0.79C0.90). Both low education (OR = 0.87; CI: 0.77C0.98) and low income (OR = 0.85; CI 0.78C0.92) had significantly lower odds to increase MVPA, while high education (OR = 1.21, CI: 1.12C1.30) and high income (OR = 1.17; CI: 1.07C1.28) had significantly higher odds to increase MVPA. Most findings were consistent over the full research period. Socioeconomic inequalities in MVPA have increased during the Covid-19 pandemic, even when Covid-19 containment measures were relaxed.

This systematic mixed studies review assesses how studies evaluate social needs resource connections and identifies patient- and caregiver-reported factors that may inhibit or facilitate resource connections. METHODS Investigators searched PubMed and CINAHL for articles published from October 2015 to December 2020 and used dual review to determine inclusion based on a priori selection criteria. Data related to study design, setting, population of interest, intervention, and outcomes were abstracted. Articles' quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data analysis was conducted in 2021. RESULTS The search identified 34 articles from 32 studies. The authors created a taxonomy of quantitative resource connection measures with 4 categories: whether participants made contact with resources, received resources, had their social needs addressed, or rated some aspect of their experience with resources. Barriers to resource connections were inadequacy, irrelevancy, or restrictiveness; inaccessibility; fears surrounding stigma or discrimination; and factors related to staff training and resource information sharing. Facilitators were referrals' relevancy, the degree of support and simplicity embedded within the interventions, and interventions being comprehensive and inclusive. DISCUSSION This synthesis of barriers and facilitators indicates areas where healthcare organizations may have agency to improve the efficacy of social needs screening and referral interventions. The authors also recommend that resource connection measures be explicitly defined and focus on whether participants received new resources and whether their social needs were addressed.","output":"Social Needs Resource Connections: A Systematic Review of Barriers, Facilitators, and Evaluation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the respiratory system, it can also have neurological consequences leading to cognitive deficits such as memory problems. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on working memory function. We developed and implemented an online anonymous survey with a working memory quiz incorporating aspects of gamification to engage participants. 5428 participants successfully completed the survey and memory quiz between 8th December 2020 and 5th July 2021 (68.6% non-COVID-19 and 31.4% COVID-19). Most participants (93.3%) completed the survey and memory quiz relatively rapidly (mean time of 8.84 minutes). Categorical regression was used to assess the contribution of COVID status, age, time post-COVID (number of months elapsed since having had COVID), symptoms, ongoing symptoms and gender, followed by non-parametric statistics. A principal component analysis explored the relationship between subjective ratings and objective memory scores. The objective memory scores were significantly correlated with participants own assessment of their cognitive function. The factors significantly affecting memory scores were COVID status, age, time post-COVID and ongoing symptoms. Our main finding was a significant reduction in memory scores in all COVID groups (self-reported, positive-tested and hospitalised) compared to the non-COVID group. Memory scores for all COVID groups combined were significantly reduced compared to the non-COVID group in every age category 25 years and over, but not for the youngest age category (18-24 years old). We found that memory scores gradually increased over a period of 17 months post-COVID-19. However, those with ongoing COVID-19 symptoms continued to show a reduction in memory scores. Our findings demonstrate that COVID-19 negatively impacts working memory function, but only in adults aged 25 years and over. Moreover, our results suggest that working memory deficits with COVID-19 can recover over time, although impairments may persist in those with ongoing symptoms.","output":"The negative impact of COVID-19 on working memory revealed using a rapid online quiz"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To study the intra-rater reliability and feasibility of the HexCom complexity assessment model by analyzing internal consistency, intra-rater reliability and response time.

This study aims to take advantage of this complexity to develop more accurate serological diagnostics. Methods: A multiplex serological assay was developed to measure IgG and IgM antibody responses to seven SARS-CoV-2 spike or nucleoprotein antigens, two antigens for the nucleoproteins of the 229E and NL63 seasonal coronaviruses, and three non-coronavirus antigens. Antibodies were measured in serum samples collected up to 39 days after symptom onset from 215 adults in four French hospitals (53 patients and 162 health-care workers) with quantitative RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and negative control serum samples collected from healthy adult blood donors before the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (335 samples from France, Thailand, and Peru). Machine learning classifiers were trained with the multiplex data to classify individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the best classification performance displayed by a random forests algorithm. A Bayesian mathematical model of antibody kinetics informed by prior information from other coronaviruses was used to estimate time-varying antibody responses and assess the sensitivity and classification performance of serological diagnostics during the first year following symptom onset. A statistical estimator is presented that can provide estimates of seroprevalence in very low-transmission settings. Findings: IgG antibody responses to trimeric spike protein (Stri) identified individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with 916% (95% CI 875-945) sensitivity and 991% (974-997) specificity. Using a serological signature of IgG and IgM to multiple antigens, it was possible to identify infected individuals with 988% (965-996) sensitivity and 993% (976-998) specificity. Informed by existing data from other coronaviruses, we estimate that 1 year after infection, a monoplex assay with optimal anti-Stri IgG cutoff has 887% (95% credible interval 634-974) sensitivity and that a four-antigen multiplex assay can increase sensitivity to 964% (809-1000). When applied to population-level serological surveys, statistical analysis of multiplex data allows estimation of seroprevalence levels less than 2%, below the false-positivity rate of many other assays. Interpretation: Serological signatures based on antibody responses to multiple antigens can provide accurate and robust serological classification of individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. This provides potential solutions to two pressing challenges for SARS-CoV-2 serological surveillance: classifying individuals who were infected more than 6 months ago and measuring seroprevalence in serological surveys in very low-transmission settings.

COVID-19 severity and mortality are strongly associated with interleukin (IL)-6 levels. High IL-6 levels are also observed in idiopathic Multicentric Castleman Disease (iMCD). Previously, we developed the first anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments and showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) production could be fully controlled by IL-6 in humans. Using mathematical modeling, with CRP as an IL-6 surrogate marker, we predicted the ability of an anti-IL-6 mAb to block plasma IL-6 activity and showed IL-6 inhibition was dependent on the extent of whole-body IL-6 production. We postulate that in patients (pts) in whom IL-6 concentration at the site of inflammation is higher than in the plasma, full blockade of plasma IL-6 activity, shown by complete CRP inhibition, is the minimum requirement to achieve clinical efficacy. CRP inhibition with tocilizumab (TCZ) in pts with COVID-19. We identified 35 published studies evaluating the efficacy or potential role of anti-IL-6 therapy in pts with severe COVID-19. Surprisingly, only one (Luo et al. J Med Virol 2020;92:814) reported dynamics of CRP reduction for individual patients throughout treatment. We fitted a hypothetical curve of CRP reduction required to completely block IL-6, based on the half-life of CRP, and added data points of CRP serum levels from pts treated with anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) therapy, TCZ, in this study. Complete reduction of CRP was not achieved in all patients: 3 pts who died had CRP levels 12.8 mg/l. Of 2 pts whose disease worsened, CRP levels were 93.5 mg/l and 6.3 mg/l. However, pts whose condition stabilized (n=9), or whose symptoms improved (n=1), had CRP levels close to the theoretical curve that is likely required to fully block IL-6 (CRP levels 5.0 mg/l). Half of these pts had been given repeated doses of TCZ. Siltuximab (SIL) treatment (NCT01024036 trial) for pts with iMCD. To assess the impact of baseline CRP levels on response to anti-IL-6 therapy, SIL, patients were divided into low and high CRP groups based on a baseline CRP level threshold of 40 mg/l (corresponding to ~40 pg/ml of IL-6;Fig 1). In patients with low baseline CRP levels (<40 mg/l;n=35), CRP levels were significantly reduced with SIL treatment on day 8 (n=26;P=0.0003) and day 15 (n=22;P=0.0043) post-dosing. In patients with high baseline CRP levels (>40 mg/l;n=17), CRP levels were significantly reduced on day 8 (n=17;P<0.0001) and day 15 (n=15;P<0.0001) post-dosing (Fig 1). A significant increase in CRP levels from day 8 to day 15 was observed in these patients (P=0.0120);this increase was not observed in patients with low baseline CRP levels (P=0.243;Fig 1). There was a negative correlation between maximum CRP and hemoglobin change (P<0.001). Inhibition of IL-6 activity by anti-IL-6 (SIL 700 mg) and anti-IL-6R (TCZ 800 mg) as monotherapy, intensified, or combined therapy. To evaluate the effect of therapy on IL-6 activity, our algorithm modeled inhibition of IL-6-(IL-6R/soluble IL-6R)-gp130 transducer complexes. This serves as a proxy for IL-6 bioactivity and accounts for the buffering capacity of gp130, which can be overwhelmed in inflammatory situations with high IL-6 concentrations. Due to uncertainty over the concentration of mAbs in alveoli relative to plasma, we modeled the effects of SIL and TCZ at local concentrations of 100%, 10%, and 1% (Fig 2) of those in plasma. Our model demonstrated that anti-IL-6 was associated with stronger inhibition of CRP than anti-IL-6R. However, only the association of both anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-6R mAbs was associated with a total blockade of CRP, which is probably necessary when IL-6 levels are associated with high risk to the patient. Different administration schedules to intensify anti-IL-6 therapy were modeled, including the repeated or combined use of anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-6R mAbs. The results form a basis to optimize treatment trategies to avoid the cytokine storm in several diseases, including cancer, iMCD, and autoimmune disorders. The feasibility of the theoretically defined approaches needs to be evaluated, particularly the potential side-effect profile for a combined treatment approach. In conclusion, in clinical practice, IL-6 inhibition should be individualized based on pathophysiology and regular CRP monitoring.

One promising approach to reduce anxiety and depression in adolescents is the neuroscience-based mindfulness intervention Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA). The objective of this individually randomized waitlist-controlled trial (RCT) was (1) to test the feasibility of TARA, delivered partially over Zoom, and (2) to assess changes in the emotional wellbeing in healthy adolescents between the ages of 14C18 years old during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Twenty-one healthy adolescents were randomized to the TARA intervention or to the waitlist control group in February 2020, just before the start of the pandemic. The TARA group intervention was delivered in person for the first five sessions and remotely over Zoom for the remaining seven sessions due to the pandemic. The participants acceptability of TARA was assessed weekly using the Child Session Rating Scale (CSRS). The primary outcome was the emotional wellbeing measured using emotional symptoms subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) pre/post-TARA. We also explored weekly changes in TARA participants wellbeing using the Child Outcome Rating Scale (CORS). Results: The overall session rating in TARA participants improved after the switch to Zoom (Cohens d = 1.2, p = 0.008). The results of the two-way ANOVA showed no statistically significant difference in the change of the SDQ emotional symptoms during the 12 weeks between the TARA group and waitlist-control group (timepoint  group interaction: F = 0.77, p = 0.38).

The aim of this study is to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression, anxiety, and mother-infant bonding among women seeking treatment for postpartum depression (PPD).Methods: Baseline data collected in two separate randomized controlled trials of a psychoeducational intervention for PPD in the same geographic region, one prior to COVID-19 (March 2019-March 2020) and one during the COVID-19 pandemic (April-October 2020), were compared. Eligible participants had an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of &#8805; 10, were &#8805; 18 years of age, had an infant < 12 months old, and were fluent in English. Outcomes included PPD (EPDS), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]), and mother-infant relationship (Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire [PBQ]). All were measured continuously and dichotomized at accepted clinical cutoffs.Results: Of the 603 participants (305 pre-COVID-19; 298 during COVID-19), mothers enrolled during the COVID-19 pandemic reported higher levels of symptoms of PPD (B = 1.35; 95% CI, 0.64 to 2.06; Cohen d = 0.31) and anxiety (B = 1.52; 95% CI, 0.72 to 2.32; Cohen d = 0.30). During COVID-19, women had 65% higher odds of clinically significant levels of depression symptoms (OR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.31) and 46% higher odds of clinically relevant anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences in mother-infant bonding.Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that rates and severity of PPD and anxiety symptoms among women seeking treatment for PPD have worsened in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, treatment-seeking mothers have consistently maintained good relationships with their infants. Considering the difficulties women with PPD face when accessing treatment, it is important that strategies are developed and disseminated to safely identify and manage PPD to mitigate potential long-term adverse consequences for mothers and their families.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT03654261 and NCT04485000.","output":"Depression, Anxiety, and Mother-Infant Bonding in Women Seeking Treatment for Postpartum Depression Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Programmed -1 frameshifting, whereby the reading frame of a ribosome on messenger RNA is shifted in order to generate an alternate gene product, is often triggered by a pseudoknot structure in the mRNA in combination with an upstream slippery sequence. The efficiency of frameshifting varies widely for different sites, but the factors that determine frameshifting efficiency are not yet fully understood. Previous work has suggested that frameshifting efficiency is related to the resistance of the pseudoknot against mechanical unfolding. We tested this hypothesis by studying the mechanical properties of a panel of pseudoknots with frameshifting efficiencies ranging from 2% to 30%: four pseudoknots from retroviruses, two from luteoviruses, one from a coronavirus, and a nonframeshifting bacteriophage pseudoknot. Using optical tweezers to apply tension across the RNA, we measured the distribution of forces required to unfold each pseudoknot. We found that neither the average unfolding force, nor the unfolding kinetics, nor the parameters describing the energy landscape for mechanical unfolding of the pseudoknot (energy barrier height and distance to the transition state) could be correlated to frameshifting efficiency. These results indicate that the resistance of pseudoknots to mechanical unfolding is not a primary determinant of frameshifting efficiency. However, increased frameshifting efficiency was correlated with an increased tendency to form alternate, incompletely folded structures, suggesting a more complex picture of the role of the pseudoknot involving the conformational dynamics.","output":"Programmed -1 frameshifting efficiency correlates with RNA pseudoknot conformational plasticity, not resistance to mechanical unfolding."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose/Background: With advances in technology there has been increased interest in and application of telemedicine in clinical practice. The need to continue providing care to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic facilitated telemedicine's rapid adoption. We evaluated the integration of telemedicine into an academic colorectal surgery practice. Methods/Interventions: All patients seen in a single center academic colorectal surgery practice from March 31, 2020 to August 31, 2020 were evaluated, and patients who were seen via telemedicine were evaluated for demographic information, diagnosis and disease history, and outcome of telemedicine visit. All physicians who provided care during this time period were asked to complete a survey regarding their experience providing telemedicine visits. Results/Outcome(s): A total of 231 telemedicine visits were performed by four providers, comprising 20% of all clinic visits during the study period. Patients were 47.6% male and 90.9% white. Most (85.7%) were established patient visits and 49 (21.2%) patients were seen for postoperative visits. Diagnoses evaluated by telemedicine included benign anorectal disease (9.1%), malignant anal disease (2.6%), inflammatory bowel disease (22.9%), benign colorectal disease (20.3%), and colorectal cancer (38.5 %). Of the 55 procedures planned during these visits, 41 (74.5%) were performed (Table). None of the four providers reported providing telemedicine visits prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, though all felt able to provide adequate care via telemedicine and were planning to continue providing telemedicine care in the future. They reported seeing the same or fewer total patients while providing telemedicine and reported comfort with evaluating a variety of pathologies, with all four reporting that they saw established colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease patients as well as postoperative visits. Three out of four providers, however, reported that 50% or more of the patients that they saw via telemedicine would need an in-person evaluation. Conclusions/Discussion: During the COVID-19 pandemic telemedicine visits were rapidly and successfully integrated into this colorectal surgery practice. These were most successfully used to facilitate care for already established patients, particularly in the long-term care of colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease patients, as well in the immediate postoperative period. This represents an exciting advancement in the clinical care of patients, though ongoing study remains to be done in how best to provide access this technology and full clinical care for colorectal surgery patients.","output":"Early experience with focused telemedicine implementation in an academic colorectal surgery practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In England, the reopening of universities in September 2020 coincided with a rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in university aged young adults. This study aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in students attending universities that had experienced a COVID-19 outbreak after reopening for the autumn term in September 2020. METHODS: A cross-sectional serosurvey was conducted during 02-11 December 2020 in students aged  25 years across five universities in England. Blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were obtained using a self-sampling kit and analysed using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 N antibody and/or an in-house receptor binding domain (RBD) assay. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in 2,905 university students was 17.8% (95%CI, 16.5-19.3), ranging between 7.6%-29.7% across the five universities. Seropositivity was associated with being younger likely to represent first year undergraduates (aOR 3.2, 95% CI 2.0-4.9), living in halls of residence (aOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.7) and sharing a kitchen with an increasing number of students (shared with 4-7 individuals, aOR 1.43, 95%CI 1.12-1.82; shared with 8 or more individuals, aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.04-2.24). Seropositivity was 49% in students living in halls of residence that reported high SARS-CoV-2 infection rates (>8%) during the autumn term. INTERPRETATION: Despite large numbers of cases and outbreaks in universities, less than one in five students (17.8%) overall had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the end of the autumn term in England. In university halls of residence affected by a COVID-19 outbreak, however, nearly half the resident students became infected and developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in University Students: cross-sectional study, December 2020, England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When Uber drivers lack trip requests in lockdown, the gig economy shows new highs of underemployment;when poorly paid cleaners of city buses or hospitals lack adequate personal protective equipment, exposure to health risks becomes even more uneven;and when disadvantaged children lack the safe haven of a classroom, lasting harm to their life chances results.

There is emerging evidence that an aberrant immune response in the initial stages of infection lead to severe disease. Many inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators are significantly higher in patients with severe dengue compared to those who develop mild infection, during febrile phase of illness. Monocytes, mast cells, and many other cells of the immune system, when infected with the DENV, especially in the presence of poorly neutralizing antibodies, leads to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of interferon signaling pathways. In addition, production of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 further leads to inhibition of cellular antiviral responses. This dysregulated and aberrant immune response leads to reduced clearance of the virus, and severe dengue by inducing a vascular leak and excessive inflammation due to high levels of inflammatory cytokines. Individuals with comorbid illnesses could be prone to more severe dengue due to low grade endotoxemia, gut microbial dysbiosis and an altered phenotype of innate immune cells. The immunosuppressive and inflammatory lipid mediators and altered phenotype of monocytes are likely to further act on T cells and B cells leading to an impaired adaptive immune response to the virus. Therefore, in order to identify therapeutic targets for treatment of dengue, it would be important to further characterize these mechanisms in order for early intervention. In this review, we discuss the differences in the innate immune responses in those who progress to develop severe dengue, compared to those with milder disease in order to understand the mechanisms that lead to severe dengue.","output":"Dysfunctional Innate Immune Responses and Severe Dengue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Containment policies and other restrictions introduced by the Spanish government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic present challenges for marginalised populations, such as people who use drugs. Harm reduction centres are often linked to social services, mental health services, and infectious disease testing, in addition to tools and services that help to reduce the harms associated with injecting drugs. This study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on these services in four autonomous communities in Spain. Methods: : This is a cross-sectional study that employed a seven-section structured survey administered electronically to 20 centres in July 2020. Data from the most heavily affected months (MarchCJune) in 2020 were compared to data from the same period in 2019. Averages were calculated with their ranges, rates, and absolute numbers. Results: : All 11 responding centres reported having had to adapt or modify their services during the Spanish state of alarm (14 MarchC21 June 2020). One centre reported complete closure for two months and four reported increases in their operating hours. The average number of service users across all centres decreased by 22% in comparison to the same period in the previous year and the average needle distribution decreased by 40% in comparison to 2019. Most centres reported a decrease in infectious disease testing rates (hepatitis B and C viruses [HBV, HCV], human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and tuberculosis [TB]) for March, April, and May in 2020 compared to the previous year. Reported deaths as a result of overdose did not increase during the state of alarm, but 2/11 (18%) centres reported an increase in overdose deaths immediately after finalisation of the state of alarm. Conclusion: Overall, Spanish harm reduction centres were able to continue operating and offering services by adjusting operating hours. The number of overall service users and needles distributed fell during the Spanish state of alarm lockdown period, suggesting that fewer clients accessed harm reduction services during this time, putting them at greater risk of reusing or sharing injecting equipment, overdosing, acquiring infectious diseases with decreased access to testing or discontinuing ongoing treatment such as methadone maintenance therapy, hepatitis C treatment, or antiretroviral therapy.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on harm reduction services in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been applied to the amplification of long DNA fragments from a variety of sources, including genomic, mitochondrial, and viral DNAs (1-5).

This project aims to identify the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle behavior of individuals in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region during confinement. METHODS: We conducted an online survey in 17 countries (Egypt, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Yemen, Syria, Palestine, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Iraq, and Sudan) from the MENA region on August and September 2020. The questionnaire included self-reported information on lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity, eating habits, smoking, watching television, social media use and sleep before and during the pandemic. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 5896 participants were included in the final analysis and 62.8% were females. The BMI of the participants was 25.4  5.8 kg/m2. Around 38.4% of the participants stopped practicing any physical activities during the confinement (P < 0.001), and 57.1% reported spending more than 2 h on social media (P < 0.001). There were no significant changes in smoking habits. Also, 30.9% reported an improvement in their eating habits compared with 24.8% reported worsening of their eating habits. Fast-food consumption decreased significantly in 48.8% of the study population. This direct/indirect exposure to COVID-19 was associated with an increased consumption of carbohydrates (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.02-1.17; P = 0.01), egg (OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.02-1.16; P = 0.01), sugar (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.02-1.16; P = 0.02), meat, and poultry (OR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.06-1.20; P < 0.01). There was also associated increase in hours spent on watching television (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.02-1.12; P < 0.01) and social media (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.01-1.18; P = 0.03).

Within such a mountain range in the north and plain lowlands in the south, Nepal provides a habitat for about 9% of global avian fauna. However, this diversity is underrated because of the lack of enough studies, especially using molecular tools to quantify and understand the distribution patterns of diversity. In this study, we reviewed the studies in the last two decades (2000?2019) that used molecular methods to study the biodiversity in Nepal to examine the ongoing research trend and focus. Although Nepalese Himalaya has many opportunities for cutting-edge molecular research, our results indicated that the rate of genetic/genomic studies is much slower compared to the regional trends. We found that genetic research in Nepal heavily relies on resources from international institutes and that too is mostly limited to research on species monitoring, distribution, and taxonomic validations. Local infrastructures to carry out cutting-edge genomic research in Nepal are still in their infancy and there is a strong need for support from national/international scientists, universities, and governmental agencies to expand such genomic infrastructures in Nepal. We particularly highlight avian fauna as a potential future study system in this region that can be an excellent resource to explore key biological questions such as understanding eco-physiology and molecular basis of organismal persistence to changing environment, evolutionary processes underlying divergence and speciation, or mechanisms of endemism and restrictive distribution of species.

Among patients subsequently referred for COVID-19 testing, we compared symptoms, laboratory/radiographic findings, and outcomes of positive versus negative patients. Results Between 4/1/2019-3/31/2020, 696 patients received longitudinal care, including 406 (58%) in the active therapy population. Among 55 patients referred for COVID-19 testing, 24 (44%) were COVID-19 positive, representing a cumulative incidence of 3.4% (longitudinal population) and 1.5% (active therapy population). Compared to COVID-19-negative patients, COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to have a supplemental oxygen requirement (11% vs. 54%, p=0.005) and to have typical COVID-19 pneumonia imaging findings (5 vs. 56%, p=0.001). Otherwise, there were no significant differences in presenting symptoms. Among COVID-negative patients, alternative etiologies included treatment-related toxicity (26%), atypical pneumonia (22%), and disease progression (22%).

The median age of diagnosis was 1.8 years (range 0.8-14.9 years). No pathogenic mutations associated with HLH were identified, but three of six possessed genetic variants of unknown significance. Infectious triggers were identified for four patients and two patients had malignancies. The average treatment duration was 8 weeks with 3.5-5.5 years of follow up. No patient needed escalation of therapy to include etoposide. All patients achieved remission. Anakinra was well tolerated without significant adverse effects. CONCLUSION Initial treatment with anakinra (with or without dexamethasone) is a feasible treatment alternative for patients with secondary HLH and may allow for avoidance of etoposide. We recommend early initiation of anakinra when HLH is suspected. A broader investigation of the use of anakinra as a first-line agent for HLH is ongoing.","output":"The use of anakinra in the treatment of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Networking technologies are fast evolving to support the request for ubiquitous Internet access that is becoming a fundamental need for the modern and inclusive society, with a dramatic speed-up caused by the COVID-19 emergency. Such evolution needs the development of networks into disaggregated and programmable systems according to the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm. Wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) optical transmission and networking is expanding as physical layer technology from core and metro networks to 5G x-hauling and inter- and intra-data-center connections requiring the application of the SDN paradigm at the optical layer based on the WDM optical data transport virtualization. We present the fundamental principles of the open-source project Gaussian Noise in Python (GNPy) for the optical transport virtualization in modeling the WDM optical transmission for open and disaggregated networking. GNPy approximates transparent lightpaths as additive white and Gaussian noise channels and can be used as a vendor-agnostic digital twin for open network planning and management. The quality-of-transmission degradation of each network element is independently modeled to allow disaggregated network management. We describe the GNPy models for fiber propagation, optical amplifiers, and reconfigurable add/drop multiplexers together with modeling of coherent transceivers from the back-to-back characterization. We address the use of GNPy as a vendor-agnostic design and planning tool and as physical layer virtualization in software-defined optical networking.","output":"GNPy model of the physical layer for open and disaggregated optical networking [Invited]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a large volume of publications, a barrage of non-reviewed preprints on various professional repositories and a slew of retractions in a short amount of time. METHODS: We conducted an e-survey using a cloud-based website to gauge the potential sources of trustworthy information and misinformation and analyzed researchers', clinicians', and academics' attitude toward unpublished items, and pre- and post-publication quality checks in this challenging time. RESULTS: Among 128 respondents (mean age, 43.2 years; M:F, 1.1:1), 60 (46.9%) were scholarly journal editors and editorial board members. Social media channels were distinguished as the most important sources of information as well as misinformation (81 [63.3%] and 86 [67.2%]). Nearly two in five (62, 48.4%) respondents blamed reviewers, editors, and misinterpretation by readers as additional contributors alongside authors for misinformation. A higher risk of plagiarism was perceived by the majority (70, 58.6%), especially plagiarism of ideas (64.1%) followed by inappropriate paraphrasing (54.7%). Opinion was divided on the utility of preprints for changing practice and changing retraction rates during the pandemic period, and higher rejections were not supported by most (76.6%) while the importance of peer review was agreed upon by a majority (80, 62.5%). More stringent screening by journal editors (61.7%), and facilitating open access plagiarism software (59.4%), including Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms (43.8%) were among the suggested solutions. Most (74.2%) supported the need to launch a specialist bibliographic database for COVID-19, with information indexed (62.3%), available as open-access (82.8%), after expanding search terms (52.3%) and following due verification by academics (66.4%), and journal editors (52.3%). CONCLUSION: While identifying social media as a potential source of misinformation on COVID-19, and a perceived high risk of plagiarism, more stringent peer review and skilled post-publication promotion are advisable. Journal editors should play a more active role in streamlining publication and promotion of trustworthy information on COVID-19.","output":"Information and Misinformation on COVID-19: a Cross-Sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Determine the real-world incidence of acute gout prophylaxis (AGP) prescribing when a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) is initiated and describe characteristics of AGP prescribing. METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis from 2007 to 2017 using medical and prescription claims from an administrative database (IQVIA&#8482; Health Plan Claims Database) among adult patients with a diagnosis of gout. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients receiving AGP among all patients newly initiated on XOI therapy. Secondary endpoints included incidence proportions of acute flare and of XOI discontinuation among patients who received AGP compared to those who did not. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used in univariate analysis of proportions between treatment groups. RESULTS: A total of 7414 patients were included for analysis. There were 697 patients (9.4%) who received AGP with XOI initiation and colchicine alone was the most common medication used among patients who received prophylaxis (n = 303, 43.4%). The incidence proportion of patients with an acute gout flare within 3 months of index was 21.5% in the AGP cohort and 12.7% in the no prophylaxis cohort (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients who discontinued XOI within 12 months of initiation was 38.7% in the AGP cohort and 46.2% in the no prophylaxis cohort (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In the real world, the proportion of patients who receive AGP with initiation of XOI therapy is low and discontinuation of XOI within 12 months of initiation is significant. In this analysis, use of AGP was not associated with a lower risk of acute gout flare after initiation of XOI therapy. Key Points a? Real-world acute gout prophylaxis (AGP) prescribing with xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) initiation is very low despite current guideline recommendations a?

Employment data from the Current Population Survey and Current Employment Statistics (CES) programs, which are administered by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, are used to assess the impact of COVID-19 on construction employment. The impact of COVID-19 is defined as a change in 12-month employment from 2019 to 2020;the study mostly focuses on April and September, 2020. Analyzing CES survey data reveals that women in the construction workforce declined by 11.9% in April 2020, when COVID-19 caused an overall 15.6% decline in the US construction labor market. The study also reveals that Black or African American communities are disproportionately impacted by job loss in the US construction industry. In September 2020, the 12-month decline in construction employment among Black or African Americans was 29.6%, compared to 5.8% for the overall decline in construction employment. States in the north of the US suffered a rapid decline in construction employment during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty states suffered a higher 12-month decline in construction average weekly earnings in September compared to April, which reveals the persistent impact of the pandemic on the industry.

We sought to compare the outcomes of patients who underwent elective open, laparoscopic, and robotic total abdominal colectomy. METHODS The NIS database was used to examine the clinical data of patients who underwent an elective total colectomy procedure during 2009-2012. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to compare the three surgical approaches. RESULTS We sampled a total of 26,721 patients who underwent elective total colectomy. Of these, 16,780 (62.8 %) had an open operation, while 9934 (37.2 %) had a minimally invasive approach (9614 laparoscopic surgery, and 326 robotic surgery). The most common indication for an operation was ulcerative colitis (31 %). Patients who underwent open surgery had significantly higher mortality and morbidity compared to laparoscopic (AOR 2.48, 1.30, P < 0.01) and robotic approaches (AOR 1.04, 1.30, P < 0.01 and P = 0.04, respectively). There was no significant difference in mortality and morbidity between the laparoscopic and robotic approaches (AOR 0.96, 1.03, P = 0.10, P = 0.78). However, conversion rate of laparoscopic surgery to open was significantly higher than that of robotic approach (13.3 vs. 1.5 %, P < 0.01). Patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery had significantly lower total hospital charges compared to patients who underwent open surgery (mean difference = $21,489, P < 0.01). Also, total hospital charges for a robotic approach were significantly higher than for a laparoscopic approach (mean difference = $15,595, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Minimally invasive approaches to total colectomy are safe, with the advantage of lower mortality and morbidity compared to an open approach. Although there was no significant difference in the morbidity between minimally invasive approaches, robotic surgery had a significantly lower conversion rate compared to laparoscopic approach. Total hospital charges are significantly higher in robotic surgery compared to laparoscopic approach.","output":"Comparison of open, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches for total abdominal colectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Novel Corona Virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) is a positive-sense single-strand RNA virus form coronaviridae family, responsible for corona virus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) with rapid transmission. The aim of this study is characterization of major viral proteins, prediction of antigen proteasomal cleavage pattern, MHC class I processing and presentation, B- and T-cell epitopes, and anti-inflammatory epitopes of 2019-nCoV, compared with SARS-CoV. Methods: : The aminoacid sequence of spike surface (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, envelop (E) protein and nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein were obtained from NCBI. The sequences were aligned by MEGA 7.0 and modeled by SWISS-MODEL. The proteasomal cleavage pattern, MHC class I processing and T-cells epitopes were predicted via IEDB analysis and EPISOFT. The B-cell epitopes were predicted by BepiPred 2.0. Also, prediction of anti-inflammatory epitopes was performed by AntiFlam. Results: : Two major antigen proteins, S glycoprotein and M glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV, respectively, have 26.57% and 20.59% less efficiency in proteasomal cleavage and presentation to MHC class I, comparing SARS-CoV. There are less B-cell predicted epitopes in 2019-nCoV, comparing SARS-CoV. The anti-inflammatory properties of 2019-nCoV S glycoprotein and N protein is higher than SARS-CoV . Discussion: It seems that the evolution of 2019-nCoV is on the way of deficiency in antigen presenting to MHC class I and escaping from cellular immunity. Also, the predicted hotspot epitopes potentially can be used to induction of adaptive cellular immunity against 2019-nCoV.

We compare health-related net benefit (HRNB) and GDP losses associated with government responses of the UK, Ireland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden from UK healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: We compared observed cases, hospitalisations, and deaths under \\"mitigation\\" to modelled events under \\"no mitigation\\" to 20th July 2020. We thus calculated healthcare costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and HRNB at 20,000/QALY saved by each country. On per population (i.e. per capita) basis, we compared HRNB with forecast reductions in 2020 GDP growth (overall or compared to Sweden as minimal mitigation country) and qualitatively and quantitatively described government responses. RESULTS: The UK saved 3.17 (0.32-3.65) million QALYs, 33 (8-38) billion healthcare costs, and 1416 (220-1637) HRNB per capita at 20,000/QALY. Per capita, this is comparable to 1,455 GDP loss using Sweden as comparator and offsets 46.1 (7.1-53.2)% of total 3075 GDP loss.Germany, Spain, and Sweden had greater HRNB per capita. These also offset a greater percentage of total GDP losses per capita. Ireland fared worst on both measures. Countries with more mask wearing, testing, and population susceptibility had better outcomes. Highest stringency responses did not appear to have best outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our exploratory analysis indicates the benefit of government covid-19 responses may outweigh their economic costs.

Still, the danger of further waves of infections is omnipresent, and it is apparent that every containment policy must be carefully evaluated and possibly replaced by a different, less restrictive policy before it can be lifted. Tracing of contacts and consequential breaking of infection chains is a promising strategy to help contain the disease, although its precise impact on the epidemic is unknown. OBJECTIVE In this work, we aim to quantify the impact of tracing on the containment of the disease and investigate the dynamic effects involved. DESIGN We developed an agent-based model that validly depicts the spread of the disease and allows for exploratory analysis of containment policies. We applied this model to quantify the impact of different approaches of contact tracing in Austria to derive general conclusions on contract tracing. RESULTS The study displays that strict tracing complements other intervention strategies. For the containment of the disease, the number of secondary infections must be reduced by about 75%. Implementing the proposed tracing strategy supplements measures worth about 5%. Evaluation of the number of preventively quarantined persons shows that household quarantine is the most effective in terms of avoided cases per quarantined person. LIMITATIONS The results are limited by the validity of the modeling assumptions, model parameter estimates, and the quality of the parametrization data. CONCLUSIONS The study shows that tracing is indeed an efficient measure to keep case numbers low but comes at a high price if the disease is not well contained. Therefore, contact tracing must be executed strictly, and adherence within the population must be held up to prevent uncontrolled outbreaks of the disease.","output":"Evaluation of Contact-Tracing Policies against the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria: An Agent-Based Simulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of novel vaccines and improving existing vaccines is critical to addressing areas of unmet or under-addressed health needs globally and to improving existing vaccination coverage and equity.

The modeling approach permits to avoid unrealistic effects of traditional diffusion models in epidemiology, like infinite propagation speed on large scales and mass migration dynamics. A construction based on the transport formalism of kinetic theory allows to give a clear model interpretation to the interactions between infected and susceptible in compartmental space-dependent models. In addition, in a suitable scaling limit, our approach permits to couple the two populations through a consistent diffusion model acting at the urban scale.

OT in the brain and blood has extensive functions in both mental and physical activities. These functions are mediated by OT receptors (OTRs) that are distributed in a broad spectrum of tissues with dramatic sexual dimorphism. In both sexes, OT generally facilitates social cognition and behaviors, facilitates parental behavior and sexual activity and inhibits feeding and pain perception. However, there are significant differences in OT levels and distribution of OTRs in men from women. Thus, many OT functions in men are different from women, particularly in the reproduction. In men, the reproductive functions are relatively simple. In women, the reproductive functions involve menstrual cycle, pregnancy, parturition, lactation, and menopause. These functions make OT regulation of womens health and disease a unique topic of physiological and pathological studies. In menstruation, pre-ovulatory increase in OT secretion in the hypothalamus and the ovary can promote the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and facilitate ovulation. During pregnancy, increased OT synthesis and preterm release endow OT system the ability to promote maternal behavior and lactation. In parturition, cervix expansion-elicited pulse OT secretion and uterine OT release accelerate the expelling of fetus and reduce postpartum hemorrhage. During lactation, intermittent pulsatile OT secretion is necessary for the milk-ejection reflex and maternal behavior. Disorders in OT secretion can account for maternal depression and hypogalactia.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, is the etiologic agent responsible for the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. The productive SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on the virus entry into cells expressing the Angiotensin-Converting enzyme 2, ACE2. Indeed, viral entry into cells is mostly mediated by the early interaction between the viral spike protein, S, and its ACE2 receptor. The S/ACE2 complex is, thus, the first contact point between the incoming virus and its cellular target and it has been consequently considered an attractive therapeutic target. In order to characterize further this interaction and the cellular processes engaged in the entry step of the viruswehave set up various in silico, in vitro and in cellula systems allowing to specifically monitor the S/ACE2 association based on the expertise of our team in virus/host interactions. We perform computational modelization of the SARS-CoV-2 S/ACE2 complex as well as its biochemical and biophysic monitoring using pull down, alphaLISA and bilayer interferometry (BLI). This led us to determine the kinetic parameters of the S/ACE2 association and dissociation steps. In parallel to these in vitro approaches we developed in cellula transduction assays using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral vector and HEK293TACE2cell lines generated in collaboration with theVect'UB platform. This led us to recapitulate the early replication stage of the infection mediated by S/ACE2 interaction as well as to detect cell fusion induced by the interaction. Finally, a cell imaging system has been setup to directly monitor the S/ACE2 interaction in a cellular context and a flux cytometry assay has been developed to quantify this association at the surface of the cells. All these different approaches are now available for both fundamental and therapeutic purpose aiming to characterize the entry step of the initial SARS-CoV-2 strain and its variants. They could also be used for investigating the possible chemical modulation of this interaction and, thus, identifying newantiviral agent as well as newchemical tools for dissecting this entry step.","output":"In silico, in vitro and in cellula models for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 spike/human ACE2 complex, viral entry and cell fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using empirical ethnographic data, and citing UK allotments as a case study, this think piece examines changes in the use of urban growing spaces as a response to a national crisis.

Verdc., Fabaceae) is an important legume crop cultivated widely in the arid and semiarid regions. During a survey carried out in the Mysore district (Karnataka, India, October 2021), horse gram plants showed the symptoms of southern blight disease. Disease incidence ranged from 20-27% in the approximate 52 hectares of horse gram fields evaluated. The symptoms initiated as tan lesions and the developing mycelial threads colonized the infected root-stem interface, causing girdling; lesions on leaves enlarged and developed into distinct spots. Infected parts (leaves & stem) (n=30) were collected in poly bags and incubated in a moist chamber overnight, followed by surface sterilization of small segments of stem, leaf with 2% NaOCl, rinsed with sterile water (SW), and placed onto the potato dextrose agar (PDA, HiMedia Lab, Mumbai) supplemented with chloramphenicol (40 mg/L). The plates were incubated at room temperature (28  2C) for 5-7 days. The fungal colonies developed from the diseased segments were sub-cultured through hyphal tipping to fresh PDA plates and pure cultures were obtained. Fungal colonies with dense, aerial whitish-cottony mycelia with uniformly globoid sclerotia (0.5?2.9 mm) were observed after 10?12 days of incubation. Sclerotia were white in the beginning and turned to brown later. The average number of sclerotia produced per plate ranged from 112 to 320 (n = 20). To determine the identity of the isolated fungal pathogen, ITS-rDNA was amplified and sequenced using ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990) primers. The amplified PCR product was purified and sequenced directly. The ITS sequences (OM037658 & OM037659) shared 100% (630/643bp) sequence similarity to Athelia rolfsii (KY640622.1, AB075298). The phylogenetic tree (Neighbour-Joining method) constructed based on ITS-rDNA region confirmed that the sequences shared a common clade with reference sequence of A. rolfsii. Thus the identity was confirmed based on micromorphology and phylogenetic analysis. Pathogenicity tests were conducted on a total of 20 plants (5-6 weeks old) in greenhouse conditions (at 28  2C and 70% relative humidity) by inoculating with sclerotia from 15 days old cultures on stem and leaves and 14 plants were found infected after 5 days of post-inoculation, while uninoculated control plants remained healthy.

The target of RT-qPCR is to assess the expression level of the SARS-CoV-2 gene through cycle threshold values (CT-value). AIM: The purpose of this study was to analyze the association between the level of SARS-CoV-2 gene expression and the severity of COVID-19 in patients hospitalized. METHOD: This research is an analytic observational study with the cross-sectional method. While the research sample was taken using a consecutive sampling technique from the Medical Records of Sumedang Hospital and Cideres Hospital, West Java, Indonesia, from December 2020 to March 2021. Patient parameters include analysis of age, sex, comorbidity, and disease severity. The severity of the patient is classified based on complaints and oxygen saturation. The expression level of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene and E gene was assessed by calculating the relative quantification by comparing the expression of the E and N gene with the expression of the internal control gene by the Livak formula (2-CT Formula). RESULT: The Spearman correlation test showed that there was a relationship between the expression of SARS-CoV-2 genes E and N genes with the severity of COVID-19 patients (with r = 0.374 and p < 0.0001) and (with r = 0.452 and p < 0.0001).

Our major aim was to identify common baseline clinical features that could help recognise adult patients at high risk of having COVID-19. DESIGN: We conducted a scoping review of all the evidence available at LitCovid, until 23 March 2020. SETTING: Studies conducted in any setting and any country were included. PARTICIPANTS: Studies had to report the prevalence of sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms and comorbidities specifically in adults with a diagnosis of infection by SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: In total, 1572 publications were published on LitCovid. We have included 56 articles in our analysis, with 89% conducted in China and 75% containing inpatients. Three studies were conducted in North America and one in Europe. Participants age ranged from 28 to 70 years, with balanced gender distribution. The proportion of asymptomatic cases were from 2% to 79%. The most common reported symptoms were fever (4%C99%), cough (4%C92%), dyspnoea/shortness of breath (1%C90%), fatigue (4%C89%), myalgia (3%C65%) and pharyngalgia (2%C61%), while regarding comorbidities, we found cardiovascular disease (1%C40%), hypertension (0%C40%) and cerebrovascular disease (1%C40%). Such heterogeneity impaired the conduction of meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The infection by COVID-19 seems to affect people in a very diverse manner and with different characteristics.

We sought to examine healthcare providers' clinical barriers, patient questions, and overall experiences related to care delivery for these patients during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Members of the Advocacy Committee of the Cancer and Aging Research Group along with the Association of Community Cancer Centers developed a 20-question survey for healthcare providers of older adults with cancer. Eligible participants were recruited by email sent through professional organizations' listservs, email blasts, and social media. This manuscript reports the qualitative data from the survey's three open-ended questions. Free text, open-ended survey items were analyzed by two independent coders for identification of common themes using NVivo software. Theme agreement was reached through consensus and count comparisons of participant responses were made. RESULTS: Healthcare system organizational challenges and meeting basic needs and support were commonly reported themes among respondents (n = 274). Barriers to care delivery included organizational challenges, patients' access to resources and support, concerns for patients' mental and physical health, and telehealth challenges. Respondents reported older adults were asking about their health and cancer care as well as access to basic needs and supports. Providers described worrying about patients' mental health, fear of personal safety, frustration in multi-level institutions, as well as experiencing positive leadership and communication. CONCLUSION: Providers are faced with balancing their concerns for personal and patient safety.

However, the feasibility of pre-procedural stent size estimation using QISS MRA would merit investigation. PURPOSE To evaluate the feasibility of QISS MRA for pre-procedural stent size estimation in PAD patients compared to computed tomography angiography (CTA). STUDY TYPE Retrospective. SUBJECTS Thirty-three PAD patients (68  9 years, 18 men, 15 women). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE Two-dimensional balanced steady-state free precession QISS MRA at 1.5 T and 3 T. ASSESSMENT All patients received QISS MRA and CTA of the lower extremity run-off followed by interventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Stenotic lesion length and diameter were quantified (AMF and AVS with 3 and 13 years of experience in cardiovascular imaging, respectively) to estimate the dimensions of the stent necessary to restore blood flow in the treated arteries. Measured dimensions were adjusted to the closest stent size available. STATISTICAL TESTS The Friedman test with subsequent pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the estimated stent dimensions between QISS MRA, CTA, and the physical stent size used for intervention. Intra-class correlation (ICC) analysis was performed to assess inter-reader agreement. Significant differences were considered at P < 0.05. RESULTS No significant difference was observed between estimated stent diameter by QISS MRA or CTA compared to physical stent diameter (8.9  2.9 mm, 8.8  3.0 mm, and 8.8  3.8 mm, respectively; 2 = 1.45, P = 0.483). There was a significant underestimation of stent length for both QISS MRA and CTA, compared to physical stent length (45.8  27.8 mm, 46.4  29.3 mm, and 50.4  34.0 mm, respectively; 2 = 11.96) which could be corrected when measurements were adjusted to the next available stent length (2 = 2.38, P = 0.303). Inter-reader assessment showed good to excellent agreement between the readers (all ICC 0.81).

RNA secondary structure profile can record whether each base is paired with others. Hence, accurate prediction of secondary structure profile can help to deduce the secondary structure and binding site of RNA. RNA secondary structure profile can be obtained through biological experiment and calculation methods. Of them, the biological experiment method involves two ways: chemical reagent and biological crystallization. The chemical reagent method can obtain a large number of prediction data, but its cost is high and always associated with high noise, making it difficult to get results of all bases on RNA due to the limited of sequencing coverage. By contrast, the biological crystallization method can lead to accurate results, yet heavy experimental work and high costs are required. On the other hand, the calculation method is CROSS, which comprises a three-layer fully connected neural network. However, CROSS can not completely learn the features of RNA secondary structure profile since its poor network structure, leading to its low performance. RESULTS: In this paper, a novel end-to-end method, named as RPRes, was proposed to predict RNA secondary structure profile based on Bidirectional LSTM and Residual Neural Network. CONCLUSIONS: RPRes utilizes data sets generated by multiple biological experiment methods as the training, validation, and test sets to predict profile, which can compatible with numerous prediction requirements. Compared with the biological experiment method, RPRes has reduced the costs and improved the prediction efficiency. Compared with the state-of-the-art calculation method CROSS, RPRes has significantly improved performance.","output":"A novel end-to-end method to predict RNA secondary structure profile based on bidirectional LSTM and residual neural network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cohort study assesses anxiety, depression, mood, and fear of workplace violence in a cohort of young physicians in China before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak.","output":"Mental Health of Young Physicians in China During the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corneal dystrophies represent a group of progressive, genetically transmitted disorders with variable pathological, histological, and clinical manifestations.

METHODS: An online questionnaire was sent to residents of 9 postgraduate schools in Lombardy and Piedmont, investigating demographics, changes in radiological workload, involvement in COVID-19-related activities, research, distance learning, COVID-19 contacts and infection, changes in training profile, and impact on psychological wellbeing. Descriptive and &#967;2 statistics were used. RESULTS: Among 373 residents invited, 300 (80%) participated. Between March and April 2020, 44% (133/300) of respondents dedicated their full time to radiology; 41% (124/300) engaged in COVID-19-related activities, 73% (90/124) of whom working in COVID-19 wards; 40% (121/300) dedicated > 25% of time to distance learning; and 66% (199/300) were more involved in research activities than before the pandemic. Over half of residents (57%, 171/300) had contacts with COVID-19-positive subjects, 5% (14/300) were infected, and 8% (23/300) lost a loved one due to COVID-19. Only 1% (3/300) of residents stated that, given the implications of this pandemic scenario, they would not have chosen radiology as their specialty, whereas 7% (22/300) would change their subspecialty. The most common concerns were spreading the infection to their loved ones (30%, 91/300), and becoming sick (7%, 21/300).

Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity, mortality and disability worldwide. The pathophysiology of sepsis is very complicated and is not yet fully understood. Worse still, the development of effective therapeutic agents is still an unmet need and a great challenge. Gases, including nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), are small-molecule biological mediators that are endogenously produced, mainly by enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Accumulating evidence suggests that these gaseous mediators are widely involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Many sepsis-associated alterations, such as the elimination of invasive pathogens, the resolution of disorganized inflammation and the preservation of the function of multiple organs and systems, are shaped by them. Increasing attention has been paid to developing therapeutic approaches targeting these molecules for sepsis/septic shock, taking advantage of the multiple actions played by NO, CO and H(2)S. Several preliminary studies have identified promising therapeutic strategies for gaseous-mediator-based treatments for sepsis. In this review article, we summarize the state-of-the-art knowledge on the pathophysiology of sepsis; the metabolism and physiological function of NO, CO and H(2)S; the crosstalk among these gaseous mediators; and their crucial effects on the development and progression of sepsis. In addition, we also briefly discuss the prospect of developing therapeutic interventions targeting these gaseous mediators for sepsis.","output":"Gases in Sepsis: Novel Mediators and Therapeutic Targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The repercussions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are being felt throughout the world to this day.

A nasopharyngeal swab for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was positive for both cases. After recovering from COVID-19, both patients developed signs and symptoms suggestive of mucormycosis, which were confirmed by a fungal smear. They were managed with liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) and other adjunctive medicines. The first patient developed a massive bout of epistaxis during surgical debulking of his fungal mass. He underwent anterior nasal packing and emergency digital subtraction angiogram which revealed an aneurysm of the right ICA which was treated by coiling of the aneurysm and parent artery occlusion of the right ICA. The second patient had a history of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis which was managed by LAmB, surgical debulking, and posaconazole. He was not in regular follow-up and did not fully complete his antifungal therapy. Later, he presented with recurrent episodes of epistaxis followed by a massive bout of bleeding from both nostrils which upon evaluation revealed a thin-walled aneurysm of the left cavernous ICA.

ALI is associated with increased pulmonary microvascular hyperpermeability and alveolar flooding. The small Rho GTPases, RhoA and Rac1 are central regulators of vascular permeability through cytoskeleton rearrangements. RhoA and Rac1 have opposing functional outcome: RhoA induces an endothelial contractile phenotype and barrier disruption, while Rac1 stabilizes endothelial junctions and increases barrier integrity. In ALI, RhoA activity is increased while Rac1 activity is reduced. We have shown that the activation of RhoA in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated ALI, is dependent, at least in part, on a single nitration event at tyrosine (Y)(34). Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if the inhibition of Rac1 is also dependent on its nitration. Our data show that Rac1 inhibition by LPS is associated with its nitration that mass spectrometry identified as Y(32), within the switch I region adjacent to the nucleotide-binding site. Using a molecular modeling approach, we designed a nitration shielding peptide for Rac1, designated NipR2 (nitration inhibitor peptide for the Rho GTPases 2), which attenuated the LPS-induced nitration of Rac1 at Y(32), preserves Rac1 activity and attenuates the LPS-mediated disruption of the endothelial barrier in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC). Using a murine model of ALI induced by intratracheal installation of LPS we found that NipR2 successfully prevented Rac1 nitration and Rac1 inhibition, and more importantly attenuated pulmonary inflammation, reduced lung injury and prevented the loss of lung function. Together, our data identify a new post-translational mechanism of Rac1 inhibition through its nitration at Y(32). As NipR2 also reduces sepsis induced ALI in the mouse lung, we conclude that Rac1 nitration is a therapeutic target in ALI.","output":"RAC1 nitration at Y(32) IS involved in the endothelial barrier disruption associated with lipopolysaccharide-mediated acute lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Undergraduate biology students often graduate without exposure to authentic research experiences Laboratory courses follow a one or two week fail-proof experiment resembling a cookbook recipe, lacking the uncertainty of genuine research Techniques in molecular biology cover an array of skills essential to succeed in a biotechnological laboratory today This lab course is based on the teaching of concepts while imparting the skills and applications of modern techniques, providing students with theoretical concepts and laboratory skills We prepare students to carry-out scientific protocols that can be applied to a future workforce setting Students are immersed in a 10-week series of labs with the objective to use molecular cloning to make a novel gene therapy vector;therapies are designed to inhibit the expression of genes of the virus that causes Covid-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Students are introduced to PubMed and Genbank to research the background of SARS-CoV-2 and its target genes;the Spike gene (S), the membrane gene (M) the nucleocapsid gene (N) and the envelope gene (E) Students use the DNA software, Serial Cloner, as a tool to evaluate DNA sequences and mFOLD to analyze RNA structure Students generate and visualize the design of an antisense gene therapy directed against one of the target viral genes Using our gene therapy platform, students generate a vector with a unique target Subsequently student-generated vectors were transfected into mammalian tissue culture cells that express the target genes (S, M, N or E) and RNA and protein was collected to measure the efficacy of the gene therapy vector to reduce the expression of the target viral gene","output":"Design, Synthesis and Testing of an Anti-Covid Gene Therapy: Integration of Authentic Research into an Undergraduate Laboratory Course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article discusses the use of the Most Significant Change (MSC) technique in a mixed-methods evaluation of a pilot wellbeing programme for obstetrics and gynaecology doctors-in-training introduced at a large public hospital during Melbourne, Australias second coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown, which occurred from 7 July to 26 October 2020.

Theory of planned behavior was the framework to explain the intentions of Korean nurses for SARS patients care. METHODS A convenient sample of six hundreds and seventy nine clinical nurses from four university-affiliated hospitals located in Seoul and in Kyung-gi province was used. Self-administered (83-items) questionnaire was used to collect data. Intentions, attitude, subjective norm, perceive behavioral control, behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs, and control beliefs were the study variables. All items were measured using 7-point Likert scale (-3 to +3). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation method, and stepwise multiple regression methods. RESULTS Intentions and attitudes toward SARS patient care among Korean clinical nurses were moderate, but their subjective norm and perceive behavioral control of SARS patients care were negative. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that attitude toward SARS patient care, perceived behavioral control, subjective norm were the determinants of the intentions for SARS patients care as theory proposed. Among the behavioral beliefs, \\"SARS-patient caring would be a new experience\\", \\"during SARS-patient caring, I should be apart from my family\\", \\"after completing SARS-patient caring, I would be proud of myself being able to cope with a stressful event\\" and \\"with my SARS-patient caring, patients could recover from SARS\\" were the significant determinants. Among the normative beliefs, colleague approval, spouse approval, and physician approval were significant determinants of the intentions. Among the control beliefs, \\"SARS-patient caring would be a challenge\\" \\"SARS-patient caring is a professional responsibility\\", \\"tension during the care of SARS patients\\" and \\"support from team members\\" were the significant determinants of the intentions.

Second, we find evidence of a segregation effect, since mobility contraction is stronger in municipalities in which inequality is higher and for those where individuals have lower income per capita. Our results highlight both the social costs of lockdown and a challenge of unprecedented intensity: On the one hand, the crisis is inducing a sharp reduction of fiscal revenues for both national and local governments; on the other hand, a significant fiscal effort is needed to sustain the most fragile individuals and to mitigate the increase in poverty and inequality induced by the lockdown.","output":"Economic and social consequences of human mobility restrictions under COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To describe the prognostic value of pulmonary artery (PA) trunk enlargement on the admission of in-hospital patients with severe COVID-19 infection by unenhanced CT image. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In-hospital patients confirmed COVID-19 from January 18, 2020, to March 7, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. PA trunk diameters on admission and death events were collected to calculate the optimum cutoff using a receiver operating characteristic curve. According to the cutoff, the subjects on admission were divided into two groups. Then the in-hospital various parameters were compared between the two groups to assess the predictive value of PA trunk diameter. RESULTS: In the 180 enrolled in-hospital patients (46.99  14.95 years; 93 (51.7%) female, 14 patients (7.8%) died during their hospitalization. The optimum cutoff PA trunk diameter to predict in-hospital mortality was > 29 mm with a sensitivity of 92.59% and a specificity of 91.11%. KaplanCMeier survival curves for PA trunk diameter on admission showed that a PA trunk diameter > 29 mm was a significant predictor of subsequent death (log-rank < 0.001, median survival time of PA > 29 mm was 28 days). CONCLUSION: PA trunk enlargement can be a useful predictive factor for distinguishing between mild and severe COVID-19 disease progression.","output":"Pulmonary artery trunk enlargement on admission as a predictor of mortality in in-hospital patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As electronic cigarette (E-cig) use, also known as vaping, has rapidly increased in popularity, data regarding potential pathologic effects are recently emerging. Recent associations between vaping and lung pathology have led to an increased need to scrutinize E-cigs for adverse health impacts. Our previous work (and others) has associated vaping with Ca(2+)-dependent cytotoxicity in cultured human airway epithelial cells. Herein, we develop a vaped e-liquid pulmonary exposure mouse model to evaluate vaping effects in vivo. Using this model, we demonstrate lung pathology through the use of preclinical measures, that is, the lung wet: dry ratio and lung histology/H&E staining. Further, we demonstrate that acute vaping increases macrophage chemotaxis, which was ascertained using flow cytometry-based techniques, and inflammatory cytokine production, via Luminex analysis, through a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism. This increase in macrophage activation appears to exacerbate pulmonary pathology resulting from microbial infection. Importantly, modulating Ca(2+) signaling may present a therapeutic direction for treatment against vaping-associated pulmonary inflammation.","output":"Acute vaping exacerbates microbial pneumonia due to calcium (Ca(2+)) dysregulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite high morbidity and mortality of ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, no specific therapy has been established till date Though in vitro studies identified various molecules as possible therapies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), these findings call for substantiation by human studies We conducted this review aiming at reporting evidences on therapies used so far globally for management of COVID-19 in clinical settings We searched electronic databases as PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE and extracted 612 possible studies as on May 31, 2020 We included original studies of any epidemiological design done on human COVID-19 patients and measured clinical outcomes Finally, following removal of duplicates and studies meeting exclusion criteria, we derived 22 studies, of which eight were clinical trials, seven were case reports and case series, and seven were observational studies The most reported therapies were hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (eight studies) and lopinavir/ritonavir (four studies) We conclude from the evidence generated so far that interferon combined with antivirals, remdesivir, umifenovir and favipiravir were mostly associated with better clinical outcomes The therapeutic effect of HCQ was established initially by two clinical trials;one of them showing a reinforcing effect by azithromycin but subsequent studies did not elicit any effectiveness rather increased rate of adverse events was reported Lopinavir/ritonavir was found beneficial when administered with interferon and ribavirin, but one clinical trial on its sole use proved contrary As many clinical trials are in process, we expect to get concrete evidences on repurposing of existing drugs based on less biased, high powered studies","output":"Exploring Repurposing Potential of Existing Drugs in the Management of COVID-19 Epidemic: A Critical Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread like wildfire and affected almost every stratum of society.

METHODS: A questionnaire survey was sent to all Finnish postal services employees aged  50 years in 2016 and 44% (n = 2096) replied to the survey (mean age 56.3, 40% women). Employees intention to retire before statutory retirement was measured on a scale of 1C5 and dichotomized. The quality of work community was defined by four composite variables: equality at work, flexibility at work, supportive work environment and health or other reason and trichotomized by their tercile values. Odds ratio (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of quality of work community with intention to retire were calculated separately for men and women using log binomial regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: About one-third of respondents intended to retire early with no significant gender difference in retirement intention. Low equality at work (women OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.60C4.81; men 2.84, 1.80C4.48) and low flexibility at work (women 3.30, 1.94C5.60; men 2.91, 1.88C4.50) was associated with higher likelihood of intention to retire. Among women intention to retire was found less likely due to low supportive work environment (0.52, 0.31C0.89) and among men due to intermediate health or other reason (0.65, 043C0.98).

In this paper, we focus on this issue by employing a unique, extensive dataset of online food and non-alcoholic beverages prices gathered automatically from the webpages of major online retailers in Poland since 2009. We perform a real-time nowcasting experiment by using a highly disaggregated framework among popular, simple univariate approaches. We demonstrate that pure estimates of online price changes are already effective in nowcasting food inflation, but accounting for online food prices in a simple, recursively optimized model delivers further gains in the nowcast accuracy. Our framework outperforms various other approaches, including judgmental methods, traditional benchmarks, and model combinations. After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, its nowcasting quality has improved compared to other approaches and remained comparable with judgmental nowcasts. We also show that nowcast accuracy increases with the volume of online data, but their quality and relevance are essential for providing accurate in-sample fit and out-of-sample nowcasts.

DESIGN: A regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) analysis of daily service-level activity. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Mental healthcare data were extracted from 10 UK providers. OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily (weekly for one site) deaths from all causes, referrals and discharges, inpatient care (admissions, discharges, caseloads) and community services (face-to-face (f2f)/non-f2f contacts, caseloads): Adult, older adult and child/adolescent mental health; early intervention in psychosis; home treatment teams and liaison/Accident and Emergency (A&E). Data were extracted from 1 Jan 2019 to 31 May 2020 for all sites, supplemented to 31 July 2020 for four sites. Changes around the commencement and lifting of COVID-19 lockdown policy (23 March and 10 May, respectively) were estimated using a RDiT design with a difference-in-difference approach generating incidence rate ratios (IRRs), meta-analysed across sites. RESULTS: Pooled estimates for the lockdown transition showed increased daily deaths (IRR 2.31, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.87), reduced referrals (IRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.70) and reduced inpatient admissions (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.83) and caseloads (IRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91) compared with the pre lockdown period. All community services saw shifts from f2f to non-f2f contacts, but varied in caseload changes. Lift of lockdown was associated with reduced deaths (IRR 0.42, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.66), increased referrals (IRR 1.36, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.60) and increased inpatient admissions (IRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.42) and caseloads (IRR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12) compared with the lockdown period. Site-wide activity, inpatient care and community services did not return to pre lockdown levels after lift of lockdown, while number of deaths did. Between-site heterogeneity most often indicated variation in size rather than direction of effect.

Many individuals turned immediately to music, as evidenced by people singing from balconies, watching live concerts on social media, and group singing online. In this article, we show how these musical adaptations can be understood through the latest advances in the social neuroscience of music-an area that, to date, has been largely overlooked. By streamlining and synthesizing prior theory and research, we introduce a model of the brain that sheds light on the social functions and brain mechanisms that underlie the musical adaptations used for human connection. We highlight the role of oxytocin and the neurocircuitry associated with reward, stress, and the immune system. We show that the social brain networks implicated in music production (in contrast to music listening) overlap with the networks in the brain implicated in the social processes of human cognition-mentalization, empathy, and synchrony-all of which are components of herding; moreover, these components have evolved for social affiliation and connectedness. We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic could be a starting point for an improved understanding of the relationship between music and the social brain, and we outline goals for future research in the social neuroscience of music.

Detecting the accurate three-dimensional location of both the fistula and leakage is essential for surgical treatment. Videofluoroscopy is usually used for locating these; however, its imaging is two-dimensional. We evaluated pharyngeal leakage and fistulae using Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT), known for its three-dimensional high spatial resolution imaging, taken in a sitting position, with oral contrast (contrast CBCT). METHODS: Pharyngeal leakage and fistulae were evaluated in a total of 31 subjects by sequentially performing videofluoroscopy and contrast CBCT. The detection accuracy of videofluoroscopy and contrast CBCT for leakage and fistula, as well as the ability to determine the extent and depth for surgical planning, were investigated and compared. RESULTS: Videofluoroscopy and contrast CBCT showed suspicious leakage and/or fistula in six and three of the 31 subjects, respectively. Surgical findings revealed the presence of leakage and/or fistula in three of the 31 subjects. The positive predictive values of videofluoroscopy and contrast CBCT were 50% (3/6) and 100% (3/3), respectively. Contrast CBCT provided more precise images, showing the extent and depth of leakage and fistula in three-dimensions. CONCLUSION: The present study's results indicate the usefulness of contrast CBCT in terms of accurate diagnosis of leakage and fistula, due to its three-dimensional imaging being performed with the patient in a sitting position.

However, copper interactions with bacteria in a biofilm state are less studied. This work aims at better understanding the difference in biofilm inhibition of bulk, cold-sprayed, and shot-peened copper surfaces and gaining further insights on the underlying mechanisms using optical and scanning electron microscopy to investigate the topography and microstructure of the surfaces. The biofilm inhibition ability is reported for all surfaces. Results show that the biofilm inhibition performance of cold sprayed copper, while initially better, decreases with time and results in an almost identical performance than as-received copper after 18h incubation time. The shot-peened samples with a rough and ultrafine microstructure demonstrated an enhanced biofilm control, especially at 18 hr. The biofilm control mechanisms were explained by the diffusion rates and concentration of copper ions and the interaction between these ions and the biofilm, while surface topography plays a role in the bacteria attachment at the early planktonic state. Furthermore, the data suggest that surface topography plays a key role in antiviral activity of the materials tested, with a smooth surface being the most efficient.

Similar to most picornaviruses, PvPV is non-enveloped RNA virus, with a particle diameter of approximately 30 nm. The sequence of the positive single-stranded RNA genome with a length of 10,550 nts was characterized by using genome sequencing and reverse transcription PCR. The existence of PvPV related proteins was further proved by confirmation of viral amino acid sequences, using mass spectrometry analysis. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genomic sequence revealed that PvPV was more closely related to the Wenzhou shrimp virus 8 than to any other dicistroviruses in the order Picornavirales. Genomic sequence conservative domain prediction analysis showed that the PvPV genome encoded a large tegument protein UL36, which was unique among the known dicistroviruses and different from other dicistroviruses. According to these molecular features, we proposed that PvPV is a new species in the family Dicistroviridae.

Methods Close contacts of nine early travel-related cases in the United States were identified. Close contacts meeting criteria for active monitoring were followed, and selected individuals were targeted for collection of additional exposure details and respiratory samples. Respiratory samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results There were 404 close contacts who underwent active monitoring in the response jurisdictions; 338 had at least basic exposure data, of whom 159 had at least 1 set of respiratory samples collected and tested.

Using Registry data, we evaluated the frequency of concurrent venous thromboembolism in cancer patients prior to treatment initiation by cancer type. METHODS The Cancer-VTE Registry is an ongoing (March 2017-September 2020) prospective cohort study using a nationwide, multicentre clinical registry. Participants aged 20 years with colorectal, lung, stomach, pancreatic, breast or gynecologic cancer, confirmed staging, 6 months life expectancy post-registration and who had undergone venous thromboembolism screening were managed with routine clinical care. Venous thromboembolism frequency at registration was evaluated. RESULTS Of 9735 participants, 571 (5.9%) had venous thromboembolism at baseline, including asymptomatic [5.5% (n = 540)] and symptomatic venous thromboembolism [0.3% (n = 31)]. Most participants with venous thromboembolism (n = 506, 5.2%) had deep vein thrombosis only; 65 (0.7%) had pulmonary embolism with/without deep vein thrombosis. The prevalence of distal and proximal deep vein thrombosis was 4.8% (n = 466) and 0.9% (n = 83), respectively. The highest prevalence of venous thromboembolism was for pancreatic cancer (8.5%) and the lowest for breast cancer (2.0%). Venous thromboembolism prevalence increased as cancer stage advanced. CONCLUSIONS Although there was a marked difference in venous thromboembolism by cancer type, the data suggest that cancer stage is an important risk factor for venous thromboembolism.

Changes in health care design, delivery, and payment will create more opportunities for population health nursing to continue nursing's long-standing efforts in pursuit of health equity and social justice.","output":"Nursing is a health equity and social justice movement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: An airway-associated fire in an operating room can have devastating consequences for patients. Breathing circuit warmers (BCWs) are widely used to provide heated and humidified anesthetic gases and eventually prevent hypothermia during general anesthesia. Herein, we describe a case of a BCW-related airway fire. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case, an electrical short within a BCW wire caused a fire inside the circuit. Simultaneously, the fire was extinguished, ventilation was stopped, and the endotracheal tube was disconnected from the BCW. The patient was exposed to the fire for less than 10 s, resulting in burns to the trachea and bronchi. Immediately after airway burn, bronchoscopy showed no edema or narrowing except for soot in the trachea and both main bronchus. After the inhalation burn event, prophylactic antibiotics, bronchodilator, mucolytics nebulizer, and corticosteroid nebulizer were started. On bronchoscopy 3 days after the inhalation burn, mucosal erythematous edema was observed and the inflammatory reaction worsened. The inflammatory reaction showed aggravation for up to 2 weeks, and then gradually recovered, and the epithelium and mucous membrane of the upper respiratory tract returned to normal after 4 weeks. Eventually, the patient recovered without long-term complications and was successfully discharged. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a fire caused by BCW. We wanted to share our experience of how we responded to an airway-related fire in an OR and treated the patient. It cannot be overemphasized that the electrical medical appliance associated with the airways are fatal to the patient in the event of a fire, so caution should always be exercised.","output":"Incidental operating room fire from a breathing circuit warmer system: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The coronavirus class of respiratory viruses - including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) - has been associated with central nervous system (CNS) disease. In fact, multiple mechanisms of CNS involvement have been proposed, making it difficult to identify a unitary syndrome that can be the focus of clinical work and research. Neuropsychologists need to understand the potential cognitive and psychological sequelae of COVID-19 and the impact of the interventions (e.g., ICU, ventilation) that have been used in treating patients with severe forms of the illness. METHOD We briefly review the literature regarding the neurological and neuropsychological effects of similar coronaviruses, the limited information that has been published to date on COVID-19, and the literature regarding the long-term cognitive and psychological effects of undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS We discuss the roles that neuropsychologists can play in assessing and treating the cognitive difficulties and psychiatric symptoms described. CONCLUSIONS At this time, the mechanisms, correlates, and effects of COVID-19 are poorly understood, but information gleaned from the literature on similar viruses and utilized interventions should help inform neuropsychologists as they begin to work with this population.","output":"Neuropsychological functioning in severe acute respiratory disorders caused by the coronavirus: implications for the current COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater-based monitoring of the spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, also referred to as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), has been suggested as a tool to support epidemiology An extensive sampling campaign, including nine municipal wastewater treatment plants, has been conducted in different cities of the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) on the same day in April 2020, close to the first peak of the corona crisis Samples were processed and analysed for a set of SARS-CoV-2-specific genes, as well as pan-genotypic gene sequences also covering other coronavirus types, using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) Additionally, a comprehensive set of chemical reference parameters and bioindicators was analysed to characterize the wastewater quality and composition Results of the RT-qPCR based gene analysis indicate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic traces in different raw wastewaters Furthermore, selected samples have been sequenced using Sanger technology to confirm the specificity of the RT-qPCR and the origin of the coronavirus A comparison of the particle-bound and the dissolved portion of SARS-CoV-2 virus genes shows that quantifications must not neglect the solid-phase reservoir The infectivity of the raw wastewater has also been assessed by viral outgrowth assay with a potential SARS-CoV2- host cell line in vitro, which were not infected when exposed to the samples This first evidence suggests that wastewater might be no major route for transmission to humans Our findings draw attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in raw and treated wastewater in Germany C Suitability for COVID-19 surveillance and potential transmission risks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Avian rotavirus isolates were used to infect normal chicken spleen cells, lymphoblastoid T cell lines transformed by Marke's disease virus, an avian leukosis virus-transformed B cell line, and a reticuloendotheliosis virus-transformed line, which is a pre-B, pre-T cell line.

However, data is limited in patients that underwent recent DDKT. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study evaluated the differences in demographics and post-transplant outcomes between those who tested positive and negative for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by polymerase chain reaction, after undergoing recent DDKT. The treatments and outcomes for the SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were assessed. Patients who underwent DDKT from 3/2020 to 8/2020 were included and followed until 9/2020. RESULTS: 201 DDKT recipients were analyzed [14(7%) SARS-CoV-2-positive and 187(93%) negative]. There was no difference in delayed graft function and biopsy-proven rejection between both groups. The patient survival at the end of the study follow-up was lower among SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (Table 1). The median time from DDKT to COVID-19 diagnosis was 45 (range: 8-90) days; 5(36%) patients required intensive care unit and 4(29%) required mechanical ventilation; steroids were used in all the patients, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and convalescent plasma (CP) in 7(50%) patients each, remdesivir in 6(43%) and tocilizumab in 1(7%); 9(64%) patients recovered, 3(21%) died and two were still requiring mechanical ventilation at the end of the follow-up.

However, limited studies have addressed the involvement of interdisciplinarity into architectural undergraduate curricula. The study seeks to expand the literature on this topic, namely by offering an alternative model for teaching an Interdisciplinary Design Course (IDC), mainly in architectural engineering departments, with the participation of engineering departments. The authors hypothesize that by the adoption of the IDC, architecture students would have a better understanding of the nature of AEC interdisciplinary design knowledge. The study aims to highlight the value of the IDC and to test the hypothesis. A qualitative research methodology has been adopted, including the design of an experiment and then the application of a case study comprising four instructors and 24 students from four departments in the Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University. Students design process, teamwork attitude, and own experiences on the IDC have been recorded using direct observation, interviews, and surveys. Data have been analyzed using descriptive statistics to identify the effectiveness and challenges of the experiment, in addition to the comparison with the traditional design studio. The results have shown the students satisfaction with collaboration with their peers from other disciplines, as it boosted their understanding of the integrated design process and increased their knowledge about each others discipline. In addition, architecture students commended the IDC much more than the traditional design studio.

As countries across the world loosen their lockdown restrictions, the assumption is generally made that the risk of COVID-19 transmission is lower outdoors, and this assumption has shaped decisions about what activities can re-commence, the circumstances in which they should re-commence, and the conditions under which they should re-commence. This is important for events and activities that generate outdoor gatherings of people, including both participatory and spectator sport events, protests, concerts, carnivals, festivals, and other celebrations. The review, which was designed to be undertaken rapidly in 15 days, returned 14 sources of evidence of outdoor transmission of COVID-19, and a further 21 sources that were used to set the context and understand the caveats that should be considered in interpreting the review findings. The review found very few examples of outdoor transmission of COVID-19 in everyday life among c. 25,000 cases considered, suggesting a very low risk. However risk of outdoor transmission increases when the natural social distancing of everyday life is breached, and gathering density, circulation and size increases, particularly for an extended duration. There was also evidence that weather had a behavioural effect on transmission, with temperatures that encourage outdoor activity associated with lower COVID-19 transmission. Due to lack of surveillance and tracing systems, and confounding factors and variables, there was no evidence that robustly tested transmission at outdoor mass gatherings (circa 10,000+ people), which are as likely to generate transmission from the activities they prompt (e.g. communal travel and congregation in bars) as from outdoor transmission at the gathering itself. The goal of hosts and organisers of events and activities that generate outdoor gatherings of people is to prevent the escalation of risk from sporadic transmission to the risk of transmission through a cluster outbreak. Considerations for such hosts and organisers include: (1) does the gathering prompt other behaviours that might increase transmission risk?; (2) for each part of the event or activity, how dense is the gathering, how much do people circulate, how large is the gathering, and how long are people there?; (3) is rapid contact tracing possible in the event of an outbreak? These considerations should take place relevant to the size of the underlying risk, which includes the rate of infection in the community and the likely attendance of vulnerable groups. Risk must be balanced and mitigated across the risk factors of density, circulation, size and duration. No one risk factor presents an inherently larger risk than any other, but neither is any one risk factor a magic bullet to eliminate risk.","output":"Rapid Scoping Review of Evidence of Outdoor Transmission of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent estimates suggest that up to 34% of frontline workers in healthcare (FLWs) at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic response are reporting elevated symptoms of psychological distress due to resource constraints, ineffective treatments, and concerns about self-contamination However, little systematic research has been carried out to assess the mental health needs of FLWs in Europe, or the extent of psychological suffering in FLWs within different European countries of varying outbreak severity Accordingly, this project will employ a mixed-methods approach over three work packages to develop best-practice guidelines for alleviating psychological distress in FLWs during the different phases of the pandemic Work package 1 will identify the point and long-term prevalence of psychological distress symptoms in a sample of Irish and Italian FLWs, and the predictors of these symptoms Work package 2 will perform a qualitative needs assessment on a sample of Irish and Italian FLWs to identify sources of stress and resilience, barriers to psychological care, and optimal strategies for alleviating psychological distress in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic Work package 3 will synthesise the findings from the preceding work packages to draft best practice guidelines, which will be co-created by a multidisciplinary panel of experts using the Delphi method The guidelines will provide clinicians with a framework for alleviating psychological distress in FLWs, with particular relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic, but may also have relevance for future pandemics and other public health emergencies","output":"The identification of needs and development of best practice guidance for the psychological support of frontline healthcare workers during and after COVID-19: A protocol for the FLoWS project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, such as stay-at-home-orders, have significantly altered daily routines and lifestyles.

The clinical outcomes of the two methods were retrospectively compared in this study. The C method was used in 19 lesions of 18 cases, and the CS method was used in 20 lesions of 19 cases. Primary lung cancer was the most frequent diagnosis (22 lesions of 21 cases). There were no differences between the two groups in the size and depth of the lesions.

RESULTS Out of 248 subjects who should have been assessed, 38% received some form of unilateral spatial neglect assessment. Only 13% were assessed with a standardized assessment and of these, 4% within 48 h post stroke or within 48 h of the patient regaining consciousness as recommended by clinical practice guidelines for stroke. Bivariate analysis found significant associations between severity of cognitive impairment and being ever assessed, as well as between the severity of motor deficits of the upper extremity and being ever assessed.

DHF/DSS occur mainly due to secondary infection by a heterotype DV infection in children and adults but in infants even primary infection by DV causes DHF/DSS. Clinical manifestations of DHF/DSS are more significantly associated with death in infants compared with older children. Vertical transmission of DV and anti-DV IgG has been well reported and is responsible for the pathogenesis of DV disease and its manifestations in infants. The complex pathogenesis of DHF/DSS during primary dengue in infants, with multiple age-related confounding factors, offers unique challenges to investigators. Dengue in infants is not often studied in detail due to practical limitations, but looking at the magnitude of DHF/DSS in infants and the unique opportunities this model provides, there is a need to focus on this problem.

Vaccine safety, speed of development, and low perceived disease risk were commonly cited as factors for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among this group. Purpose and Methods In a secondary analysis based on a cross-sectional, structured survey, the authors aimed to assess the associations between self-reported vaccine hesitancy and a number of sociodemographic and COVID-19 vaccine perception factors using data from 3,295 healthcare providers (physicians, nurses, community health workers, other healthcare providers) in 23 countries. Findings 494 (15.0%) of the participants reported vaccine hesitancy, of whom 132 (4.0%) would outright refuse to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Physicians were the least hesitant. Vaccine hesitancy was more likely to occur among those with less than the median income and, to a lesser degree, younger age. Safety and risk concerns and lack of trust that vaccines would be equitably distributed were strongly associated with hesitancy, less so were concerns about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Interpretation Findings suggest a need to address safety and risk concerns through tailored messaging, training, and/or incentive approaches among healthcare providers, as well as the need for international and national vaccination efforts to ensure equitable distribution.","output":"Factors affecting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare providers in 23 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last decade, technology enabled learning has thrived in the health care professional education arena.

This report summarizes DMSC progress from its initial meeting on 11/2019 to 3/2021. Outcomes/Impact DMSC participation has included 106 individuals from 20 health care and community-based organizations. DMSC has conducted four quarterly general assembly meetings. DMSC has facilitated member education through its quarterly meetings, group emails, and DMSC Groupsite shared documents. Shared education and resources have included information on STI epidemiology, STI testing shortages, CDC STI updates, and local STI health alerts. DMSC workgroups have developed products including a one-page congenital syphilis infographic highlighting jurisdictional epidemiology and treatment algorithms, including state specific recommendations for universal third trimester syphilis screening during pregnancy and a provider counseling guide for safe sex during COVID-19.

The focus here is on the biggest killers, plague, typhus, smallpox, tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, dysentery, childhood infections, pneumonia, and influenza. Many other infectious diseases including puerperal fever, relapsing fever, malaria, syphilis, meningitis, tetanus and gangrene caused thousands of deaths. This review of preventive measures, public health interventions and changes in behavior that reduced the risk of severe infections puts the response to recent epidemic challenges in historical perspective. Two new respiratory viruses have recently caused pandemics: an H1N1 influenza virus genetically related to pig viruses, and a bat-derived coronavirus causing COVID-19. Studies of infectious diseases emerging in human populations in recent decades indicate that the majority were zoonotic, and many of the causal pathogens had a wildlife origin. As hunter-gatherers, humans contracted pathogens from other species, and then from domesticated animals and rodents when they began to live in settled communities based on agriculture. In the modern world of large inter-connected urban populations and rapid transport, the risk of global transmission of new infectious diseases is high. Past and recent experience indicates that surveillance, prevention and control of infectious diseases are critical for global health.

However, no tailored options exist for the design and implementation of VR for ABI rehabilitation and, more specifically, traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation. In addition, the evidence base lacks systematic reviews of immersive VR use for TBI rehabilitation. Recommendations for this population are important because of the many complex and diverse impairments that individuals can experience. OBJECTIVE This study aims to conduct a two-part systematic review to identify and synthesize existing recommendations for designing and implementing therapeutic VR for ABI rehabilitation, including TBI, and to identify current evidence for using immersive VR for TBI assessment and treatment and to map the degree to which this literature includes recommendations for VR design and implementation. METHODS This review was guided by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). A comprehensive search of 11 databases and gray literature was conducted in August 2019 and repeated in June 2020. Studies were included if they met relevant search terms, were peer-reviewed, were written in English, and were published between 2009 and 2020. Studies were reviewed to determine the level of evidence and methodological quality. For the first part, qualitative data were synthesized and categorized via meta-synthesis. For the second part, findings were analyzed and synthesized descriptively owing to the heterogeneity of data extracted from the included studies. RESULTS In the first part, a total of 14 papers met the inclusion criteria. Recommendations for VR design and implementation were not specific to TBI but rather to stroke or ABI rehabilitation more broadly. The synthesis and analysis of data resulted in three key phases and nine categories of recommendations for designing and implementing VR for ABI rehabilitation. In the second part, 5 studies met the inclusion criteria. A total of 2 studies reported on VR for assessment and three for treatment. Studies were varied in terms of therapeutic targets, VR tasks, and outcome measures. VR was used to assess or treat impairments in cognition, balance, and anxiety, with positive outcomes. However, the levels of evidence, methodological quality, and inclusion of recommendations for VR design and implementation were poor. CONCLUSIONS There is limited research on the use of immersive VR for TBI rehabilitation. Few studies have been conducted, and there is limited inclusion of recommendations for therapeutic VR design and implementation. Future research in ABI rehabilitation should consider a stepwise approach to VR development, from early co-design studies with end users to larger controlled trials. A list of recommendations is offered to provide guidance and a more consistent model to advance clinical research in this area.","output":"Recommendations for the Design and Implementation of Virtual Reality for Acquired Brain Injury Rehabilitation: Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This study offers a descriptive overview of changes in fertility plans during the COVID-19 crisis in a sample of the young population (18-34) in Italy, Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom The data were collected between 27 March and 7 April 2020 RESULTS Our results show that fertility plans have been negatively revised in all countries, but not in the same way In Germany and France fertility plans changed moderately, with many people still planning or postponing their decision to have a child In Italy, however, the proportion of abandoners is much higher than in the other countries, and the proportion of those deciding to postpone their plans is lower Moreover, across countries the demographic characteristics of individuals appear to be associated with fertility plans in different ways In Italy, abandoners are common among individuals younger than 30 and those without a tertiary education In Germany, abandoners are slightly more prevalent in the regions most affected by COVID-19 In the United Kingdom, the individuals that most frequently abandoned their fertility plans are those who expect the crisis to have a dramatic negative effect on their future income Finally, in France and Spain we do not observe a clear pattern of revision of fertility plans CONTRIBUTION These results suggest that different mechanisms are at work, possibly due to the different economic, demographic, and policy pre-crisis background and post-crisis prospects Low-fertility contexts in particular appear to be more at risk of a fertility loss due to the crisis","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on fertility plans in Italy, Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Publisher Summary Enveloped viruses enter cells by fusing their lipid bilayer membrane with a cellular membrane. Most viral fusion proteins require priming by proteolytic processing, either of the fusion protein itself or of an accompanying protein. The priming step, which often occurs during transport of the fusion protein to the cell surface but may also occur extracellularly, then prepares the fusion protein for triggering by events that accompany attachment and uptake. Two classes of viral fusion proteins have been identified so far by structural studies. The fusion of two bilayers that these proteins catalyze is likely to proceed by the same pathway in both cases. That is, these proteins are like enzymes that have different structures but that still catalyze the same chemical reaction. It is found that bilayer fusion reaction is common to all the enveloped viral entry pathways.

However, the novel mRNA technology being used in COVID-19 and other novel vaccines fundamentally changes how we should consider muscle's active role in protein production and subsequent protective immunity. Following exercise, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation drives total protein translation increases in skeletal muscle. We hypothesize that this 4-24 hour window of opportunity can be exploited to augment exogenous mRNA translation. To evaluate the feasibility of this approach, we first interrogated mTOR using fully differentiated C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle myotubes that were transfected with mRNA encoding for enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or FLAG-tagged Comirnaty SARS-CoV-2 Spike sequence in mTOR modulating conditions. Myotube transfection in the presence of rapamycin (Figure 1A) and resveratrol (Figure 1B) showed significant decreases in protein translation as measured by eGFP fluorescence, indicating that exogenous mRNA translation can be decreased pharmacologically by inhibiting the mTOR pathway. To simulate exercise enhanced protein synthesis, we treated myotubes with insulin-like growth-factor 1 (IGF-1), as this protein is not only upregulated following exercise but also signals through an overlapping pathway with mechanoreceptors. Transfections with mRNA encoding for either eGFP or Comirnaty-FLAG during IGF-1 treatment showed a dose dependent increase in eGFP fluorescence (Figure 1C) and a significant increase in Comirnaty-FLAG translation as measured by ELISA (Figure 1D). Current studies are investigating the use of electrical stimulation induced contraction on C2C12 myotubes prior to transfection as well as in vivo models of exercise and intramuscular mRNA injections. The implications of these results may impact future mRNA therapies to utilize exercise, or modulation of intracellular signaling pathways affected by exercise, as a method to improve vaccine-induced exogenous protein production.","output":"Exploiting exercise and mTOR enhanced protein synthesis to augment mRNA vaccine translation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess pain and compare its severity in preterm infants during application of nasal-continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) and heated, humidified high-flow nasal cannulae (HHHFNC). STUDY DESIGN An observational cross-sectional study. Sixty preterm infants, categorized into nCPAP (n=37) and HHHFNC groups (n=23). Pain response was assessed using Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), duration of first cry and salivary-cortisol concentrations. RESULT The PIPP scores were significantly higher in the nCPAP compared with HHHFNC group (10 (7-12) vs 4 (2-6), P<0.01). None of the infants in the HHHFNC group had severe pain defined as a PIPP score >12, compared with 5 (13.5%) infants in the nCPAP group. Salivary-cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in nCPAP group compared with the HHHFNC group (5.0 (3.6-5.9) vs 1.6 (1.0-2.3) nmol l(-1), P<0.01). A lower incidence of cry was observed for infants in the HHHFNC group compared with the nCPAP group (11 (47.8%) vs 30 (81.1%), P<0.001), however, the duration of first cry was not significantly different between groups.

There were no significant differences between groups with regard to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SpO2) and heart rate. CONCLUSION The application of HHHFNC in preterm infants is associated with less pain compared with nCPAP, as it is associated with less PIPP scores and lower salivary-cortisol concentrations.","output":"Assessment of pain during application of nasal-continuous positive airway pressure and heated, humidified high-flow nasal cannulae in preterm infants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, was signed into law on December 27 (Pub L No 116-260) This massive piece of legislation includes provisions comprising the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Relief Act of 2020 (Division EE of the appropriations act) and Additional Coronavirus Response and Relief (Division N of the appropriations act)","output":"Selected Provisions of Coronavirus and FY 2021 Appropriations Legislation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel influenza A(H7N9) virus has caused 2013 spring and 2013C2014 winter waves of human infections since its first emergence in China in March 2013. Exposure to live poultry is a risk factor for H7N9 infection. Public psychobehavioral responses often change during progression of an epidemic. METHODS: We conducted population-based surveys in southern China to examine human exposure to live poultry, and population psychological response and behavioral changes in the two waves. In Guangzhou, an urban area of Guangdong province, we collected data using telephone surveys with random digit dialing in May-June 2013 and again in December 2013 to January 2014. In Zijin county, a rural area of the same province, we used door-to-door surveys under a stratified sampling design in July 2013 and again in December 2013 to January 2014. All responses were weighted by age and sex to the respective adult populations. FINDINGS: Around half of the urban respondents (53.8%) reported having visited LPMs in the previous year in the first survey, around double that reported in the second survey (27.7%). In the rural surveys, around half of the participants reported raising backyard poultry in the past year in the first survey, increasing to 83.2% participants in the second survey. One third of urban subjects supported the permanent closure of LPMs in the first and second surveys, and factors associated with support for closure included female sex, higher level of worry towards H7N9, and worry induced by a hypothetical influenza-like illness. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated high human exposure to live poultry and low support for permanent closure of markets in both urban and rural residents regardless of increased worry during the epidemic.","output":"Live Poultry Exposure and Public Response to Influenza A(H7N9) in Urban and Rural China during Two Epidemic Waves in 2013-2014"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Peru started its national vaccination campaign in February 2021 using Sinopharm vaccine, targeting healthcare personnel on its initial phase. Although the immunogenicity of this vaccine was tested in clinical trials, there are no studies that evaluated the humoral response post vaccination in Peru. METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional study, which objective was to evaluate the humoral immunogenicity triggered by the Sinopharm vaccine in Peruvian physicians. We collected demographic and epidemiologic data via an electronic. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1/S2 antibodies were measured by chemiluminescense (Liaison?). A positive test was defined as >15 U/ml, which has correlation of 95% with neutralizing antibodies measured by plaque reduction neutralizing test. RESULTS: 92 participants were enrolled in the study. The epidemiologic characteristics are described in table 1. The mean level of antibodies measured at least 2 weeks from the second vaccine dose was 67.5  70.5 U/ml. 85.7% of the study cohort had positive S1/S2 antibodies. In the univariate analysis, an imperfect negative correlation was found between the level of antibodies and participants age (r= -0.24; regression F test 5.25; p = 0.0242). A weak negative correlation was observed between the antibody titer and the time elapsed from the second vaccine dose and the day of antibody measurement (r= -0.17). A higher antibody level post vaccine was found in individuals who worked in COVID units (105.5 U / mL vs 58.2 U / mL; p = 0.0125), and in participants with history of COVID (216.5 U / mL vs 81.2 U / mL; p = < 0.0000).

This has prompted questions on the evolutionary relationship of these cell types, and if ancient r-opsins were non-photosensory. A molecular profiling approach in the marine bristleworm Platynereis dumerilii revealed shared and distinct features of cephalic and non-cephalic r-opsin1-expressing cells. Non-cephalic cells possess a full set of phototransduction components, but also a mechanosensory signature. Prompted by the latter, we investigated Platynereis putative mechanotransducer and found that nompc and pkd2.1 co-expressed with r-opsin1 in TRE cells by HCR RNA-FISH. To further assess the role of r-Opsin1 in these cells, we studied its signaling properties and unraveled that r-Opsin1 is a G&#945;q-coupled blue light receptor. Profiling of cells from r-opsin1 mutants versus wild-types, and a comparison under different light conditions reveals that in the non-cephalic cells light - mediated by r-Opsin1 - adjusts the expression level of a calcium transporter relevant for auditory mechanosensation in vertebrates. We establish a deep-learning-based quantitative behavioral analysis for animal trunk movements and identify a light- and r-Opsin-1-dependent fine-tuning of the worm's undulatory movements in headless trunks, which are known to require mechanosensory feedback. Our results provide new data on peripheral cell types of likely light sensory/mechanosensory nature. These results point towards a concept in which such a multisensory cell type evolved to allow for fine-tuning of mechanosensation by light. This implies that light-independent mechanosensory roles of r-opsins may have evolved secondarily.","output":"Characterization of cephalic and non-cephalic sensory cell types provides insight into joint photo- and mechanoreceptor evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) can have a significantly negative impact on quality of life (QoL).

However, the early phases of emergence can hinge upon ecological sustainability of the virus population, which is a product of both within-host population growth and between-host transmission. Insufficient growth or transmission can force virus extinction before the latter phases of emergence, where genetic adaptations that improve host use may occur. We examined the early phase of emergence by studying the population dynamics of RNA phages in replicated laboratory environments containing native and novel host bacteria. To predict the breadth of transmission rates allowing viral persistence on each species, we developed a simple model based on in vitro data for phage growth rate over a range of initial population densities on both hosts. Validation of these predictions using serial passage experiments revealed a range of transmission rates for which the native host was a source and the novel host was a sink. In this critical range of transmission rates, periodic exposure to the native host was sufficient for the maintenance of the viral population on the novel host. We argue that this effect should facilitate adaptation by the virus to utilize the novel host--often crucial in subsequent phases of emergence.","output":"Viral ecology and the maintenance of novel host use."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to slow the spread of the CoViD-19 pandemic, governments around the world have enacted a wide set of policies limiting the transmission of the disease.

The objective of this study is to explain the quantitative effects of these policies on determining the course of the pandemic, allowing for factors like seasonality or virus strains with different transmission profiles. To do so, the study develops an agent-based simulation model, which explicitly takes into account test demand and behavioral changes following positive tests.

The paper finds that during a period where vaccination rates rose from 5 to 40%, seasonality and rapid testing had the largest effect on reducing infection numbers.

Experimental tests are performed referring to an unbalanced and small dataset composed by healthy and diseased leaves. In order to achieve a high accuracy on the explored CNN models, a fine-tuning of their hyperparameters is performed. Furthermore, some variations are done on the raw dataset to increase the quality and variety of the leaves images. Preliminary results provide a point-of-view for selecting CNNs architectures for leaves diseases identification based on accuracy, precision, recall and F1 metrics. The comparison demonstrates that without considerably lengthening the training, ZFNet achieves a high accuracy and increases it by 10% after 50 K iterations being a suitable CNN model for identification of diseased leaves using datasets with a small variation, number of classes and dataset sizes.","output":"Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Classification of Diseased Leaves: The Impact of Dataset Size and Fine-Tuning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To examine our website and social media audience data to define the number of African users and review the effects of COVID-19 on our viewership from Africa, and look ahead to potential opportunities. METHODS: Google Analytics was used to investigate the number of CTisus.com users from Africa across a three-year period: April 2018-March 2019, April 2019-March 2020, and April 2020-March 2021. The percent difference between 18/19 - 19/20 and 19/20 - 20/21 was identified. Each country was categorized into North, South, East, West, or Central Africa, based on the United Nations Statistical Division, and the percent difference was calculated for all five regions. The number of followers of our YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter channels in each African country was also analyzed, again classifying each country into regions. RESULTS: Forty-six of the fifty-four countries in Africa, and all four territories, accessed CTisus.com between April 2018 to March 2021. Northern Africa represented 49.87% of our website visits from all African countries. Southern Africa constituted 18.84% of our traffic and Eastern Africa 18.60%, while Western and Central Africa provided 11.90% and 0.79%, respectively. We found a 27% increase in website traffic from Africa between a non-COVID year and a complete pandemic year. Facebook statistics revealed that 20,782 likes to our page came from Africa, and 20,987 of our followers. Similarly, 15,391 of our YouTube views and 728 of our Twitter followers came from Africa. CONCLUSION: We have been successful in achieving a 27% increase in website traffic from Africa to our radiology social media offerings. This increase since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic is encouraging, especially when noting that we do not have any paid advertising.

In the absence of a gold standard treatment, the rapid development of a safe and effective vaccine is considered the most promising way to control the pandemic. In recent years, traditional vaccine technologies have seemed insufficient to provide global protection against the rapid spread of emerging pandemics. Therefore, the establishment of novel approaches that are independent of whole pathogen cultivation, cost-effective, and able to be rapidly developed and produced on a large scale are of paramount importance for global health. This article summarizes the current efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, including the ongoing and future anticipated clinical trials. We also provide plastic and reconstructive surgeons with insight into the novel technologies currently utilized for COVID-19 vaccine development, focusing on the very promising viral-vector-based and gene-based vaccine technologies. Each platform has its own advantages and disadvantages related to its efficacy and ability to induce certain immune responses, manufacturing capacity, and safety for human use. Once the fundamental key challenges have been addressed for viral-vector-based and gene-based vaccines, these novel technologies may become helpful in winning the fight against COVID-19 and transforming the future of health care.","output":"The Race for a COVID-19 Vaccine: Current Trials, Novel Technologies, and Future Directions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"College\\\\age students who vape are five to seven times more likely than nonvaping peers to contract COVID\\\\19, according to a study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health.

Partial irreversible pulpitis is the initial stage of this damage, confined to the coronal pulp whilst the radicular pulp shows little or no sign of infection. Preserving the pulp with sustained vitality and developing minimally invasive biologically based therapies are key themes within contemporary clinical practice. However, root canal treatment involving complete removal of the pulp is often the only option (other than extraction) given to patients with irreversible pulpitis, with substantial NHS and patient incurred costs. The European Society of Endodontologys (ESE 2019) recent consensus statement recommends full pulpotomy, where the inflamed coronal pulp is removed with the goal of keeping the radicular pulp vital, as a more minimally invasive technique, potentially avoiding complex root canal treatment. Although this technique may be provided in secondary care, it has not been routinely implemented or evaluated in UK General Dental Practice. METHOD: This feasibility study aims to identify and assess in a primary care setting the training needs of general dental practitioners and clinical fidelity of the full pulpotomy intervention, estimate likely eligible patient pool and develop recruitment materials ahead of the main randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of full pulpotomy compared to root canal treatment in pre/molar teeth of adults 16 years and older showing signs indicative of irreversible pulpitis. The feasibility study will recruit and train 10 primary care dentists in the full pulpotomy technique. Dentists will recruit and provide full pulpotomy to 40 participants (four per practice) with indications of partial irreversible pulpitis. DISCUSSION: The Pulpotomy for the Management of Irreversible Pulpitis in Mature Teeth (PIP) study will address the lack of high-quality evidence in the treatment of irreversible pulpitis, to aid dental practitioners, patients and policymakers in their decision-making. The PIP feasibility study will inform the main study on the practicality of providing both training and provision of the full pulpotomy technique in general dental practice.

To develop a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for predicting tissue distribution of CQ and apply it to optimize dosage regimens, a PBPK model, with parameterization of drug distribution extrapolated from animal data, was developed to predict human tissue distribution of CQ. The physiological characteristics of time-dependent accumulation was mimicked through an active transport mechanism. Several dosing regimens were proposed based on PBPK simulation combined with known clinical exposureCresponse relationships. The model was also validated by clinical data from Chinese patients with COVID-19.

Careful design of a vaccine prioritization strategy across socio-demographic groups is an imminent and crucial public policy challenge given that (1) the eventual vaccine supply will be highly constrained for at least the first several months of the vaccination campaign, and (2) there are stark differences in transmission and severity of impacts from SARS-CoV-2 across groups. Previous experience with vaccine development mid-pandemic offers limited insights for SARS-CoV-2 prioritization: SARS and Zika vaccine development was incomplete when those outbreaks ended and the epidemiology of endemic human influenza viruses differ substantially from that of SARS-CoV-2. We assess the optimal allocation of a limited and dynamic COVID-19 vaccine supply in the U.S. across socio-demographic groups differentiated by age and essential worker status. The transmission dynamics are modeled using a compartmental (SEIR) model parameterized to capture our current understanding of the transmission and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, including key sources of group heterogeneity (susceptibility, severity, and contact rates). We investigate tradeoffs between three alternative policy objectives: minimizing infections, years of life lost, or deaths. Moreover, we model dynamic vaccine prioritization policies that respond to changes in the epidemiological status of the population as SARS-CoV-2 continues its march. Because contacts tend to be concentrated within age groups, there is diminishing marginal returns as vaccination coverage increases in a given group, increasing the groups protective immunity against infection and mortality. We find that optimal prioritization consistently targets older essential workers. However, depending on the policy objective, younger essential workers are prioritized to minimize infections or seniors in order to minimize mortality. Optimal prioritization outperforms non-targeted vaccination strategies by up to 18% depending on the outcome optimized. For example, in our baseline model, cumulative mortality decreased on average by 17% (25,000 deaths in the U.S. population) over the course of the outbreak.","output":"Optimal Dynamic Prioritization of Scarce COVID-19 Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma (CP) has been described as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given paucity of data, we sought to describe characteristics of CP recipients in survivors and non-survivors. METHODS: We conducted retrospective review of electronic medical records which included any patient with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test who received CP at an 890-bed quaternary care hospital in Southeast Michigan between March-May 2020. Data collected included: demographics, co-morbidities, mSOFA score on admission, laboratory values, and treatment. Outcomes assessed included inflammatory markers and clinical status based on an 8-point ordinal scale(a). These values were recorded on admission, the date of CP (day 1), day 3, 7, and day 30 post-CP. Patient outcomes were stratified by ordinal scale score and compared using Mann-Whitney U tests to examine differences in clinical characteristics: scale of 1C4 (meaningful survivor), 5C7 (survivor), and 8 (non-survivor). RESULTS: Results of our study are summarized in Table 1 and 2. Non-survivors were older than survivors (62 vs 71 years; p=0.026). There was no statistically significant difference between patient gender, race, number of days from positive PCR test to CP, treatments, and co-morbidities. There was a trend toward higher mSOFA score on admission in non-survivors (p=0.056).

In this study, we hypothesized that intensive hunting and enduring fear of humans have caused moose and other forest ungulates to partly avoid areas near human infrastructure (perceived hunting risk), with positive cascading effects on recruitment of trees. Using data from the Norwegian forest inventory, we found decreasing browsing pressure and increasing tree recruitment in areas close to roads and houses, where ungulates are more likely to encounter humans. However, although browsing and recruitment were negatively related, reduced browsing was only responsible for a small proportion of the higher tree recruitment near human infrastructure. We suggest that the apparently weak cascading effect occurs because the recorded browsing pressure only partly reflects the long-term browsing intensity close to humans. Accordingly, tree recruitment was also related to the density of small trees 5-10 years earlier, which was higher close to human infrastructure. Hence, if small tree density is a product of the browsing pressure in the past, the cascading effect is probably stronger than our estimates suggest. Reduced browsing near roads and houses is most in line with risk avoidance driven by fear of humans (behaviorally mediated), and not because of excessive hunting and local reduction in ungulate density (density mediated).","output":"Moose in our neighborhood: Does perceived hunting risk have cascading effects on tree performance in vicinity of roads and houses?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a new public health catastrophe forbidding the world.

Studies of COVID-19 prevalence were collected by conducting an online search of published articles, preprints, and government reports that were publicly disseminated prior to 18 September 2020. The systematic review encompassed 113 studies, of which 27 studies (covering 34 geographical locations) satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Age-specific IFRs were computed using the prevalence data in conjunction with reported fatalities 4 weeks after the midpoint date of the study, reflecting typical lags in fatalities and reporting. Meta-regression procedures in Stata were used to analyze the infection fatality rate (IFR) by age. Our analysis finds a exponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19. The estimated age-specific IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. Moreover, our results indicate that about 90% of the variation in population IFR across geographical locations reflects differences in the age composition of the population and the extent to which relatively vulnerable age groups were exposed to the virus. These results indicate that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. Moreover, the overall IFR for COVID-19 should not be viewed as a fixed parameter but as intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections.

Risk factors for initial and repeated respiratory viral infections in young infants in resource-limited settings have not been well described. METHODS: From 2011 to 2014, a birth cohort of infants in rural Nepal was enrolled and followed with weekly household-based active surveillance for respiratory symptoms until 6 months of age. Respiratory illness was defined as having any of the following: fever, cough, wheeze, difficulty breathing, and/or a draining ear. We tested nasal swabs of infants with respiratory illness for multiple respiratory viruses by using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The risk of primary and repeated infections with the same virus was evaluated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Of 3528 infants, 1726 (49%) had a primary infection, and 419 (12%) had a repeated infection. The incidences of respiratory viral infection in infants were 1816 per 1000 person-years for primary infections and 1204 per 1000 person-years for repeated infection with the same virus. Exposure to other children and male sex were each associated with an increased risk for primary infection (risk ratios, 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06C1.20] and 1.14 [95% CI, 1.02C1.27], respectively), whereas higher maternal education was associated with a decreased risk for both primary and repeated infections (risk ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.95C0.98]).

Although, the incidence of co-infections could be up to 94.2% in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the fate of co-infections among SARS-CoV-2 infected hosts often depends on the balance between the host's protective immunity and immunopathology. Predominantly identified co-pathogens of SARS-CoV-2 are bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Legionella pneumophila and Clamydia pneumoniae followed by viruses including influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. The cross-talk between co-pathogens (especially lung microbiomes), SARS-CoV-2 and host is an important factor that ultimately increases the difficulty of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19.

RESULTS: A total of 23 18F-FDG PET-CT scans with pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of COVID-19 and available laboratory data were included: 14 positive (cases) and 9 negative (controls) for COVID-19 infection, representing a low prevalence of COVID-19 pneumonia (1.3%). Serum lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimers tended to be increased in COVID-19 cases. Extra-parenchymal lung findings were found in 42.9% of patients with COVID-19, most frequently as mediastinal and hilar nodes with 18F-FDG uptake (35.7%), followed by incidental pulmonary embolism in two patients (14.3%). In the control group, extra-pulmonary findings were observed in a single patient (11.1%) with 18F-FDG uptake located to mediastinal, hilar, and cervical nodes. Nasopharyngeal and hepatic SUVmax were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: In cancer patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia, 18F-FDG PET-CT findings are more frequently limited to thoracic structures, suggesting that an early and silent distant involvement is very rare. Pulmonary embolism is a frequent and potentially severe finding raising special concern. PET-CT can provide new pathogenic insights about this novel disease.","output":"Assessment of extra-parenchymal lung involvement in asymptomatic cancer patients with COVID-19 pneumonia detected on 18F-FDG PET-CT studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diagnosis of pneumonia is both simple and complex.

Vascular function is determined by structural and functional properties of the arterial vessel wall, which consists of three layers, namely the adventitia, media, and intima. Key cells in shaping the vascular wall architecture and warranting proper vessel function are vascular smooth muscle cells in the arterial media and endothelial cells lining the intima. Pathological alterations of this vessel wall architecture called vascular remodeling can lead to insufficient vascular function and subsequent ischemia and organ damage. One major pathomechanism driving this detrimental vascular remodeling is atherosclerosis, which is initiated by endothelial dysfunction allowing the accumulation of intimal lipids and leukocytes. Inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and modified lipids further drive vascular remodeling ultimately leading to thrombus formation and/or vessel occlusion which can cause major cardiovascular events. Although it is clear that vascular wall remodeling is an elementary mechanism of atherosclerotic vascular disease, the diverse underlying pathomechanisms and its consequences are still insufficiently understood.","output":"Inflammatory Mediators in Atherosclerotic Vascular Remodeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Over the past 20 years or so, the drug misuse scenario has seen the emergence of both prescription-only and over-the-counter (OTC) medications being reported as ingested for recreational purposes. OTC drugs such as antihistamines, cough/cold medications, and decongestants are reportedly the most popular in being diverted and misused. Objective: While the current related knowledge is limited, the aim here was to examine the published clinical data on OTC misuse, focusing on antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine, promethazine, chlorpheniramine, and dimenhydrinate), dextromethorphan (DXM)- and codeine-based cough medicines, and the nasal decongestant pseudoephedrine. Methods: A systematic literature review was carried out with the help of Scopus, Web of Science databases, and the related gray literature. For data gathering purposes, both the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and PROSPERO guidelines were followed (PROSPERO identification code CRD42020209261). Results: After completion of the selection, eligibility, and screening phases, some 92 articles were here taken into consideration; case reports, surveys, and retrospective case series analyses were included. Findings were organized according to the specific OTC recorded. Most articles focused here on DXM (n = 54) and diphenhydramine (n = 12). When specified, dosages, route(s) of administration, toxicity symptoms (including both physical and psychiatric ones), and outcomes were here reported. Conclusion: Results from the systematic review showed that the OTC misusing issues are both widespread worldwide and popular; vulnerable categories include adolescents and young adults, although real prevalence figures remain unknown, due to a lack of appropriate monitoring systems. Considering the potential, and at times serious, adverse effects associated with OTC misusing issues, healthcare professionals should be vigilant, and ad hoc preventative actions should be designed and implemented.","output":"Focus on Over-the-Counter Drugs' Misuse: A Systematic Review on Antihistamines, Cough Medicines, and Decongestants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) stresses the importance of active case-finding (ACF) for early detection of tuberculosis (TB), especially in the 30 high-burden countries that account for almost 90% of cases globally. OBJECTIVE: To describe the attitudes of National TB Programme (NTP) managers related to ACF policy development, implementation and scale-up in the 30 high-burden countries, and to review national TB strategic plans. METHODS: This was a mixed-methods study with an embedded design: A cross-sectional survey with NTP managers yielded quantitative and qualitative data. A review of national TB strategic plans complemented the results. All data were analyzed in parallel and merged in the interpretation of the findings. RESULTS: 23 of the 30 NTP managers (77%) participated in the survey and 22 (73%) national TB strategic plans were reviewed. NTP managers considered managers in districts and regions key stakeholders for both ACF policy development and implementation. Different types of evidence were used to inform ACF policy, while there was a particular demand for local evidence. The NSPs reflected the NTP managers unanimous agreement on the need for ACF scale-up, but not all included explicit aims and targets related to ACF. The NTP managers recognized that ACF may decrease health systems costs in the long-term, while acknowledging the risk for increased health system costs in the short-term. About 90% of the NTP managers declared that financial and human resources were currently lacking, while they also elaborated on strategies to overcome resource constraints. CONCLUSION: NTP managers stated that ACF should be scaled up but reported resource constraints. Strategies to increase resources exist but may not yet have been fully implemented, e.g. generating local evidence including from operational research for advocacy.

CGMs measure interstitial fluid glucose levels to provide information about glucose levels, which identify fluctuation that would not have been identified with conventional self-monitoring. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a classical tool to measure glycaemic changes. However, the effectiveness of glucose control, hypoglycemia, weight change, quality of life and user satisfaction, are needed to evaluate and compare CGMs and SMBG amongst adults with T2D. METHODS The review will compare the various forms of CGM systems (i.e flash CGM, real-time CGM, retrospective CGM) versus SMBG or usual intervention regarding diabetes management amongst adults with T2D. The following databases will be searched: Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus and grey literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, PsycEXTRA, ProQuest Dissertations, Google Scholar and Theses Global) for the identification of studies. The studies involving adults (aged  18 years old) will be included. We will only include and summarise randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with respect to authors, publication type, year, status and type of devices. Studies published in English between February 2010 and March 2020, will be included as the field of CGMs amongst T2D patients has emerged over the last decade. Primary outcomes will be HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin level) (mmol/L), body weight (kg), time spent with hypoglycaemia (< 70 mg/dl) or hyperglycaemia ( 180 mg/dl), blood pressure (< 140/90 mmHg is considered as good management) and quality of life (understanding and feeling of living situation based on culture and value system). Secondary outcome measures will be user satisfaction (patient or treatment/intervention satisfaction or satisfaction scale) and barriers (physical and mental difficulties or issues). Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be conducted independently by at least two reviewers. A third reviewer will determine and resolve discrepancies. Moreover, the quality of the evidence of the review will be assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool (GRADE).

Our results showed that the conformational plasticity of PPAR(), especially the H2 & S245 loop, H2 &  loop and AF-2 surface, is markedly affected by binding of full/partial agonists. To fully take the dynamic behavior of PPAR() into account, the VS approach effectively sorts out five commercial agents with reported antineoplastic properties. Among them, ZINC03775146 (gusperimus) and ZINC14087743 (miltefosine) might be novel PPAR() agonists with the potential for chemoprophylaxis, that simultaneously take part in a flexible switch of the AF-2 surface and state change of the  loop. Furthermore, the dynamic structural coupling between the H2 & S245 and H2 &  loops offers enticing hope for PPAR()-targeted therapeutics, by blocking kinase accessibility to PPAR().

Patients were treated with the same protocol and followed-up for 24 months, in a scheduled basis of every month for the first year and every 3 months for the second year. Primary end points were: (i) Combined end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and/or death and (ii) The presence of major or minor relapse during follow-up and secondary endpoint was the combination of ESRD and reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  50%. Results: A total of 92 patients (M/F 39/53, mean age 59.1  15 years) diagnosed with FNGN due to ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), 36 (39.1%) patients diagnosed with PR3-ANCA, 39 (42.4%) patients diagnosed with MPO-ANCA, and 17 (18.5%) patients diagnosed with ANCA(-) were included.

However, the effect of DKK1 expression on protein expression, and whether such proteins are altered in disease, is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aim to test whether DKK1 induced protein signature obtained in vitro were associated with markers of AD pathology as used in the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) framework as well as with clinical outcomes. METHODS: We first overexpressed DKK1 in HEK293A cells and quantified 1,128 proteins in cell lysates using aptamer capture arrays (SomaScan) to obtain a protein signature induced by DKK1. We then used the same assay to measure the DKK1-signature proteins in human plasma in two large cohorts, EMIF (n = 785) and ANM (n = 677). RESULTS: We identified a 100-protein signature induced by DKK1 in vitro. Subsets of proteins, along with age and apolipoprotein E ?4 genotype distinguished amyloid pathology (A + T-N-, A+T+N-, A+T-N+, and A+T+N+) from no AD pathology (A-T-N-) with an area under the curve of 0.72, 0.81, 0.88, and 0.85, respectively. Furthermore, we found that some signature proteins (e.g., Complement C3 and albumin) were associated with cognitive score and AD diagnosis in both cohorts.

Our purpose in this report is to collect, summarize, and articulate all essential information about antiviral drugs that may or may not be efficient for treating COVID-19. Clinical evidence about these drugs and their possible mechanisms of action are also discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To conduct a comprehensive review, different keywords in various databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar, were searched relevant articles, especially the most recent ones, were selected and studied. These selected original research articles, review papers, systematic reviews, and even letters to the editors were then carefully reviewed for data collection. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 is the newest member of the coronavirus family, and there are still no promising therapies or particular antiviral compounds to fight it. After entering the body, SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the cells by attaching to specific lung cell receptors, called angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. Then, by employing cell division machinery, it replicates through a complex mechanism and spreads throughout the patient's body. Various antiviral drugs, including anti-influenza/HIV/HCV drugs, have been applied for treating COVID-19 patients. Due to the similarity of the structure and transcriptional mechanism of COVID-19 to a number of viruses, some of the listed drugs have been beneficial against SARS-CoV-2. However, the effectiveness of others is in an aura of ambiguity and doubt.

In this large, multicentre, retrospective, regional study from Norway, our primary objective was to report the results of a strategic diagnostic stewardship intervention, targeting diagnostic yield from lower respiratory tract sampling. The secondary objective was to report hospitalized CAP aetiology and the diagnostic yield of various anatomical sampling locations. METHODS: Medical records from cases diagnosed with hospitalized CAP were collected retrospectively from March throughout May for three consecutive years at six hospitals. Between year one and two, we launched a diagnostic stewardship intervention at the emergency room level for the university teaching hospital only. The intervention was multifaceted aiming at upscaling specimen collection and enhancing collection techniques. Year one at the interventional hospital and every year at the five other emergency hospitals were used for comparison. RESULTS: Of the 1280 included cases of hospitalized CAP, a microbiological diagnosis was established for 29.1% among 1128 blood cultures and 1444 respiratory tract specimens. Blood cultures were positive for a pathogenic respiratory tract microbe in 4.9% of samples, whereas upper and lower respiratory tract samples overall provided a probable microbiological diagnosis in 21.3% and 47.5%, respectively. Expectorated or induced sputum overall provided aetiology in 51.7% of the samples. At the interventional hospital, the number of expectorated or induced sputum samples were significantly increased, and diagnostic yield from expectorated or induced sputum was significantly enhanced from 41.2 to 62.0% after the intervention (p = 0.049). There was an over-representation of samples from the interventional hospital during the study period. Non-typeable Haemophilus influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 25.3% and 24.7% of microbiologically confirmed cases, respectively.

This disease frequently features cardiac amyloid fibril deposits that originate from dissociation of the tetrameric protein, transthyretin (TTR). Unlike hereditary TTR (ATTRm) amyloidosis, where amino acid replacements destabilize the native protein, in ATTRwt amyloidosis, amyloid-forming TTR lacks protein sequence alterations. The initiating cause of fibril formation in ATTRwt amyloidosis is unclear, and thus, it seems plausible that other factors are involved in TTR misfolding and unregulated accumulation of wild-type TTR fibrils. We believe that clusterin (CLU, UniProtKB P10909), a plasma circulating glycoprotein, plays a role in the pathobiology of ATTRwt amyloidosis. Previously, we have suggested a role for CLU in ATTRwt amyloidosis based on our studies showing that (1) CLU codeposits with non-native TTR in amyloid fibrils from ATTRwt cardiac tissue, (2) CLU interacts only with non-native (monomeric and aggregated) forms of TTR, and (3) CLU serum levels in patients with ATTRwt are significantly lower compared to healthy controls. In the present study, we provide comprehensive detail of compositional findings from mass spectrometry analyses of amino acid and glycan content of CLU purified from ATTRwt and control sera. The characterization of oligosaccharide content in serum CLU derived from patients with ATTRwt amyloidosis is novel data. Moreover, results comparing CLU oligosaccharide variations between patient and healthy controls are original and provide further evidence for the role of CLU in ATTRwt pathobiology, possibly linked to disease-specific structural features that limit the chaperoning capacity of CLU.","output":"Glycosylation of Serum Clusterin in Wild-Type Transthyretin-Associated (ATTRwt) Amyloidosis: A Study of Disease-Associated Compositional Features Using Mass Spectrometry Analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Susac Syndrome (SuS) is an autoimmune endotheliopathy impacting the brain, retina and cochlea that can clinically mimic multiple sclerosis (MS).

Methods 3T MRI including myelin water imaging and diffusion basis spectrum imaging were acquired for 7 SuS, 10 MS and 10 HC participants. Non-lesional white matter was analyzed in the corpus callosum (CC) and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Groups were compared using ANCOVA with Tukey correction. Results SuS CC myelin water fraction (mean 0.092) was lower than MS(0.11, p = 0.01) and HC(0.11, p = 0.04). Another myelin marker, radial diffusivity, was increased in SuS CC(0.27m2/ms) compared to HC(0.21m2/ms, p = 0.008) and MS(0.23m2/ms, p = 0.05).

Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) face an elevated risk of VAP, although susceptibility varies widely. Because mechanisms underlying VAP predisposition remained unknown, we assessed lower respiratory tract host immune responses and microbiome dynamics in 36 patients, including 28 COVID-19 patients, 15 of whom developed VAP, and eight critically ill controls. We employed a combination of tracheal aspirate bulk and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Two days before VAP onset, a lower respiratory transcriptional signature of bacterial infection was observed, characterized by increased expression of neutrophil degranulation, toll-like receptor and cytokine signaling pathways. When assessed at an earlier time point following endotracheal intubation, more than two weeks prior to VAP onset, we observed a striking early impairment in antibacterial innate and adaptive immune signaling that markedly differed from COVID-19 patients who did not develop VAP. scRNA-seq further demonstrated suppressed immune signaling across monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and T cells. While viral load did not differ at an early post-intubation timepoint, impaired SARS-CoV-2 clearance and persistent interferon signaling characterized the patients who later developed VAP. Longitudinal metatranscriptomic analysis revealed disruption of lung microbiome community composition in patients who developed VAP, providing a connection between dysregulated immune signaling and outgrowth of opportunistic pathogens. Together, these findings demonstrate that COVID-19 patients who develop VAP have impaired antibacterial immune defense weeks before secondary infection onset.","output":"Impaired antibacterial immune signaling and changes in the lung microbiome precede secondary bacterial pneumonia in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plasma membrane integrity is essential for cellular homeostasis.

After further investigation of the functional regions inferred from the proteins of SARS coronavirus, we discovered that Indinavir does not dock on any active sites of the protease, which may give rise to concern in regards to the efficacy of Indinavir. On the other hand, the docking site of Remdesivir is not compatible with any known functional regions, including template binding motifs, polymerization motifs and nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) binding motifs. However, when we tested the active form (CHEMBL2016761) of Remdesivir, the docking site revealed a perfect dock in the overlapping region of the NTP binding motif. This result suggests that Remdesivir could be a potential therapeutic agent. Clinical trials still must be done in order to confirm the curative effect of these drugs.","output":"Potential Therapeutic Agents for COVID-19 Based on the Analysis of Protease and RNA Polymerase Docking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), is a highly infectious RNA virus. A still-debated percentage of patients develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after infection, whose symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue. Acute and life-threatening respiratory symptoms are experienced by 10-20% of symptomatic patients, particularly those with underlying medical conditions that includes diabetes, COPD and pregnancy. One of the main challenges in the containment of COVID-19 is the identification and isolation of asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic individuals. As communities re-open, large numbers of people will need to be tested and contact-tracing of positive patients will be required to prevent additional waves of infections and enable the continuous monitoring of the viral loads COVID-19 positive patients. A number of molecular assays are currently in clinical use to detect SARS-CoV-2. Many of them can accurately test hundreds or even thousands of patients every day. However, there are presently no testing platforms that enable more than 10,000 tests per day. Here, we describe the foundation for the REcombinase Mediated BaRcoding and AmplificatioN Diagnostic Tool (REMBRANDT), a high-throughput Next Generation Sequencing-based approach for the simultaneous screening of over 100,000 samples per day. The REMBRANDT protocol includes direct two-barcoded amplification of SARS-CoV-2 and control amplicons using an isothermal reaction, and the downstream library preparation for Illumina sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. This protocol represents a potentially powerful approach for community screening, a major bottleneck for testing samples from a large patient population for COVID-19.","output":"REMBRANDT: A high-throughput barcoded sequencing approach for COVID-19 screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the conversation in higher education shifts from diversity to inclusion, the attrition rates of students in the STEM fields continues to be a point of discussion. Combined with the demand for expansion in the STEM workforce, various retention reforms have been proposed, implemented, and in some cases integrated into policy following evidence of success. Still, new findings, technological advances, and socio-cultural shifts inevitably necessitate an on-going investigation as to how students approach learning. Among other factors, students who enter college without effective study skills are at much greater risk of being unsuccessful in their coursework. In order to construct an equitable learning environment, a mechanism must be developed to provide underprepared students with access to resources or interventions designed to refine the skills they need to be successful in the course. Early, reliable assessments can provide predictions of individual student outcomes in order to guide the development and implementation of such targeted interventions. In the present study, a model is developed to predict students' odds of success based their study approaches, as measured by their responses to twelve survey items from an existing instrument used in the Chemistry Education Research literature designed to measure students' deep and surface learning approaches. The model's prediction specificity ranges from 66.5% to 86.9% by semester. Two distinct sets of lower-performing students are identified in the data: those who align predominantly with surface approaches to learning versus those who indicate using both deep and surface approaches to learning. This supports the idea of a tailored approach to interventions, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.

Monocytes/macrophages are considered key immune cells in infections and downregulation of the surface expression of monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR (mHLA-DR) expression within the major histocompatibility complex class II reflects a state of immunosuppression, also referred to as injury-associated immunosuppression. As the role of immunosuppression in CoronavirusDisease2019 (COVID-19) disease is currently unclear, we seek to explore the level of mHLA-DR expression in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In a preliminary prospective monocentric observational study, 16 COVID-19 positive patients (75% male, median age: 68 [interquartile range 59C75], Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II [APACHE-II] score in 9 intensive care unit [ICU] patients: 30 [interquartile range 25C32]) with acute respiratory failure were included. Standardized quantitative assessment of mHLA-DR on cluster of differentiation (14+) (CD14+) cells was performed using calibrated flow cytometry at baseline (ICU admission) and at days 3 and 5 after ICU admission. Baseline data were compared to hospitalized noncritically ill COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: While normal mHLA-DR expression was observed in all hospitalized noncritically ill patients (n=7), 89% (8 of9) critically ill patients with COVID-19Cinduced acute respiratory failure showed signs of downregulation of mHLA-DR at ICU admission. mHLA-DR expression at admission was significantly lower in critically ill patients (median, [quartiles]: 9280 antibodies/cell [6114, 16,567]) as compared to the noncritically ill patients (30,900 antibodies/cell [26,777, 52,251]), with a median difference of 21,508 antibodies/cell (95% confidence interval [CI], 14,118C42,971), P=.002. Reduced mHLA-DR expression was observed to persist until day 5 after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: When compared to noncritically ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease showed reduced mHLA-DR expression on circulating CD14+ monocytes at ICU admission, indicating a dysfunctional immune response. This immunosuppressive (monocytic) phenotype remained unchanged over the ensuing days after ICU admission. Strategies aiming for immunomodulation in this population of critically ill patients should be guided by an immune-monitoring program in an effort to determine who might benefit best from a given immunological intervention.","output":"Reduced Monocytic Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR Expression Indicates Immunosuppression in Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Distance learning, which became widespread in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has been a burdensome challenge for students and lecturers. This study investigated the relationship between academic self-efficacy and burnout in first-year nursing students who participated in distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study included 69 first-year nursing students at Jenderal Achmad Yani University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Data were collected in September 2020 through self-efficacy and burnout questionnaires that were distributed via email and social media for 2 weeks. The responses were analyzed using the gamma test. RESULTS: Most respondents were women (78.3%), with an average age of 19 years. Most nursing students had a moderate level of academic self-efficacy (72.5%), while only 13.0% of respondents had a low level of academic self-efficacy. However, 46.4% of students experienced severe burnout during distance learning. Cross-tabulation showed that students with moderate self-efficacy were more likely to experience severe burnout (24 respondents) (P<0.01 and r=-0.884). Exhaustion was the burnout dimension most closely associated with academic self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: Students perceived distance learning as burdensome and reported high levels of exhaustion, which may negatively impact their academic achievement. Interventions to improve academic self-efficacy may foster students' confidence, potentially leading to reduced burnout levels.

In response, the contactless channel (i.e. shopping online, self-collecting and returning parcels via delivery lockers) is ideally positioned to fulfil consumers shopping / logistics needs while avoiding all unnecessary social interactions. Thus, this study examines the factors that motivate consumers migration to the contactless channel by viewing consumers channel choice as both health-related and shopping behaviours. Anchored on the synthesised insights of protection motivation theory and automation acceptance theory, the conceptual framework and a series of hypotheses are proposed. The survey instrument is used for data collection, and the data are analysed using structural equation modelling. Our findings reveal that perceived channel characteristics such as compatibility and trust directly contribute to the relative value of the contactless channel;these characteristics are also correlated where trust perception reinforces compatibility perception. The channel characteristics are further influenced by consumers perceived susceptibility of COVID-19;that is, susceptibility perception enhances channel compatibility but decreases consumers trust in the contactless channel. However, the impacts of susceptibility become insignificant with a low level of severity perception, confirming the stage-based conceptualisation of severity. Furthermore, the severity perception of COVID-19 is found to amplify the positive impacts of susceptibility perception but attenuate its negative impact. Our study promotes a deeper integration between the health and service literature and encourages more interdisciplinary studies in this nexus. Considering the practical context of social distancing, our findings suggest a struggle between compatibility and trust that shapes consumers behaviours.","output":"Contactless channel for shopping and delivery in the context of social distancing in response to COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic resection rectopexy (LRR) and laparoscopic ventral rectopexy (LVR) are favored for the treatment for rectal prolapse (RP) in the USA and Europe, respectively. This study aims to compare these two surgical techniques. METHODS All patients who underwent LRR because of RP between January 2000 and January 2012 at Cleveland Clinic Florida (Weston, FL, USA) were identified, and all relevant characteristics were entered in a database. This same analysis was also conducted for all patients who underwent LVR in the Meander Medical Center (Amersfoort, the Netherlands) between January 2004 and January 2012. These two cohorts were retrospectively compared with regard to complications, functional results and recurrence. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (all female, mean age 50.1 years) were included in the LRR cohort at a mean follow-up of 57 (range 2-140; standard deviation (SD)  41.2) months. The LVR group consisted of 40 patients (36 females and 4 males) with a mean age of 67.0 years and a mean follow-up of 42 (range 2-82; SD  23.8) months. A significant reduction in constipation was observed in both cohorts after surgery: 57 versus 21% after LRR and 55 versus 23% after LVR (both P < 0.05). The incidence of incontinence also significantly decreased in both groups: 15% after LVR (55% before surgery) and 4% after LRR (61 % before surgery). Direct comparison of these two techniques showed a trend to significance (P = 0.09). Significantly, more complications occurred after LRR (n = 9: 1 major, 8 minor) then after LVR (n = 3: 2 major, 1 minor) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Both LVR and LRR are effective for the treatment for RP. Although both techniques offer significant improvements in functional symptoms, continence may be better after LRR.

METHODS: UK Biobank (England) participants with baseline assessment 2006-2010, followed in hospital discharge records to 2017 and death records to 2020. Demographic and preexisting common diagnoses association tested with hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (March 16 to April 26, 2020), alone or with mortality, in logistic models. RESULTS: Of 269 070 participants aged older than 65, 507 (0.2%) became COVID-19 hospital inpatients, of which 141 (27.8%) died. Common comorbidities in hospitalized inpatients were hypertension (59.6%), history of fall or fragility fractures (29.4%), coronary heart disease (21.5%), type 2 diabetes (type 2, 19. 9%), and asthma (17.6%). However, in models adjusted for comorbidities, age group, sex, ethnicity, and education, preexisting diagnoses of dementia, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, depression, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension emerged as independent risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization, the first 5 remaining statistically significant for related mortality. Chronic kidney disease and asthma were risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization in women but not men.

PATIENT CONCERNS A 24 year-old male was referred originally by his optician at the Emergency Eye Department of the Leicester Royal Infirmary in October 2018 with visual field changes affecting the nasal field of vision in both eyes on routine eye examination. The patient reported ongoing headaches over the last 6 weeks to 8 weeks associated with simultaneous peripheral visual field changes. He also reported rapid loss of weight over the same period of time. DIAGNOSIS Binasal congruous hemianopia secondary to FVL. INTERVENTIONS Full past medical and ocular history was obtained. The patient underwent full ophthalmic examination including dilated fundoscopy. Visual acuity was recorded with Snellen Chart. Color vision was assessed with Ishihara plates. Peripheral vision was assessed with both Humphrey visual fields and Goldmann visual fields. Optical coherence tomography of the macula and discs was also performed. Neuroimaging investigations included Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain. Electrophysiology investigations included Electroretinogram and visual evoked potentials. Patient was also tested for syphilis. OUTCOMES Humphrey visual fields and Goldmann visual fields confirmed the presence of complete binasal field defects. Optical coherence tomography, electroretinogram, visual evoked potentials, CT, MRI were all unremarkable. Ocular examination was normal. Finally, syphilis serology was negative. After 1 year of follow-up, the visual field changes have remained the same. CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge, this is the fourth case described in the literature with complete congruous binasal hemianopia due to FVL. We advocate thorough investigations with multimodal imaging of the fundus, neuroimaging and syphilis serology to exclude serious organic causes for binasal field defects prior to labeling such a field defect functional.

However, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) do not fully adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) models. A review and evidence synthesis were conducted to identify associations of SES factors with hospital readmission and mortality in AMI patients. METHODS : Multiple electronic databases were queried to identify studies assessing risk for AMI-related mortality or hospital readmissions and SES factors. Identified studies were screened by title and abstract. Full-text reviews followed for articles meeting the inclusion criteria, including quality assessments. Data were extracted from all included studies, and evidence synthesis was performed to identify associations between SES factors and outcome variables. RESULTS : Ten studies were included in the review. One study showed that Black patients had higher AMI-related readmission rates compared to White patients (mean difference 4.3% [SD 1.4%], p<0.001). Another study showed that income inequality was associated with increased risk of AMI-related readmissions (RR 1.18 [95% CI], 1.13-1.23). One study found that unemployed individuals experienced significantly greater rates of AMI-related mortality than those working full-time (HR 2.08, 1.51-2.87). According to another study, lack of health insurance was associated with worse rates for in-hospital AMI-related mortality (OR 1.77, 1.72-1.82). Based on one study, AMI-related mortality was higher in those with <8 years of education compared to those with >16 years (17.5% vs. 3.5%, p<0.0001). Five of six studies found a significant association between ZIP code/neighborhood/location and AMI-related readmission or mortality. CONCLUSION : Race, ZIP code/neighborhood/location, insurance status, income/poverty, and education comprise SES factors found to be associated with AMI-related mortality and/or readmission outcomes.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the NC Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT), NC's legislatively mandated statewide syndromic surveillance system for the years 2019 and 2020. Frequencies of January - November 2020 NC ED visits were compared to frequencies of 2019 visits for selected injury mechanisms, classified according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) injury diagnosis and mechanism codes. RESULTS: In 2020, the total number of injury-related visits declined by 19.5% (N = 651,158) as compared to 2019 (N = 809,095). Visits related to motor vehicle traffic crashes declined by a greater percentage (29%) and falls (19%) declined by a comparable percentage to total injury-related visits.

Here we describe an AI strategy, retro drug design, or RDD, to generate novel small molecule drugs from scratch to meet predefined requirements, including but not limited to biological activity against a drug target, and optimal range of physicochemical and ADMET properties. Traditional predictive models were first trained over experimental data for the target properties, using an atom typing based molecular descriptor system, ATP. Monte Carlo sampling algorithm was then utilized to find the solutions in the ATP space defined by the target properties, and the deep learning model of Seq2Seq was employed to decode molecular structures from the solutions. To test feasibility of the algorithm, we challenged RDD to generate novel drugs that can activate {\\\\mu} opioid receptor (MOR) and penetrate blood brain barrier (BBB). Starting from vectors of random numbers, RDD generated 180,000 chemical structures, of which 78% were chemically valid. About 42,000 (31%) of the valid structures fell into the property space defined by MOR activity and BBB permeability. Out of the 42,000 structures, only 267 chemicals were commercially available, indicating a high extent of novelty of the AI-generated compounds. We purchased and assayed 96 compounds, and 25 of which were found to be MOR agonists. These compounds also have excellent BBB scores.

Any potential drug formulation has to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and specific to metastatic brain tumors without causing unacceptable adverse effects. Here, we developed transferrin-functionalized chimeric polymersomes carrying siRNA against polo-like kinase 1 (Tf@TBP-CPs-siPLK1) for treating brain metastatic MDA-MB 231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) xenografts in mice. To facilitate the loading of siPLK1, chimaeric polymersomes (CPs) were designed with spermine in the watery core and transferrin-binding peptide (TBP) at the surface, enabling attachment of transferrin after the siRNA loading step and thereby circumventing interference of transferrin with siRNA loading. Tf@TBP-CPs-siPLK1 encapsulating 3.8 wt% siRNA had a mean size of about 50 nm and a neutral zeta potential in phosphate buffer (PB). By virtue of the presence of transferrin, Tf@TBP-CPs demonstrated greatly (ca. 5-fold) enhanced internalization in MDA-MB 231 cells and transcytosis in the endothelial (bEnd.3) monolayer model in vitro as well as markedly improved accumulation in the orthotopically xenografted MDA-MB 231 tumor in the brain in vivo compared with control CPs lacking transferrin, supporting that transferrin mediates efficient BBB penetration and high specificity towards MDA-MB 231 cells.

Lockdown measures, shown to be effective in reducing the number of new cases, may not have been effective in the same way for all, failing to protect the most vulnerable populations. This survey aims to assess social inequalities in the trends in COVID-19 infections following lockdown. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey conducted among the general population in France in April 2020, during COVID-19 lockdown. Ten thousand one hundred one participants aged 18-64, from a national cohort who lived in the three metropolitan French regions most affected by the first wave of COVID-19. The main outcome was occurrence of possible COVID-19 symptoms, defined as the occurrence of sudden onset of cough, fever, dyspnea, ageusia and/or anosmia, that lasted more than 3 days in the 15 days before the survey. We used multinomial regression models to identify social and health factors related to possible COVID-19 before and during the lockdown. RESULTS: In all, 1304 (13.0%; 95% CI: 12.0-14.0%) reported cases of possible COVID-19. The effect of lockdown on the occurrence of possible COVID-19 was different across social hierarchies. The most privileged class individuals saw a significant decline in possible COVID-19 infections between the period prior to lockdown and during the lockdown (from 8.8 to 4.3%, P = 0.0001) while the decline was less pronounced among working class individuals (6.9% before lockdown and 5.5% during lockdown, P = 0.03). This differential effect of lockdown remained significant after adjusting for other factors including history of chronic disease. The odds of being infected during lockdown as opposed to the prior period increased by 57% among working class individuals (OR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.00-2.48). The same was true for those engaged in in-person professional activities during lockdown (OR = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.03-2.29). CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown was associated with social inequalities in the decline in COVID-19 infections, calling for the adoption of preventive policies to account for living and working conditions. Such adoptions are critical to reduce social inequalities related to COVID-19, as working-class individuals also have the highest COVID-19 related mortality, due to higher prevalence of comorbidities.","output":"When lockdown policies amplify social inequalities in COVID-19 infections: evidence from a cross-sectional population-based survey in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective This study investigated the mental development of children with Angelman syndrome (AS) in China and evaluated the relationship between neurodevelopment and molecular subtype, age, epilepsy, and sex using the Chinese version of the Griffith Mental Development Scale (GMDS-C) to provide detailed baseline data regarding neurodevelopment with AS in China. Methods Participants were recruited from the AS Natural History Study. The GMDS-C was used to evaluate all participants' mental age and developmental quotients. The general quotient (GQ) and quotients of five subscales (sports, personal-social, auditory language, eye-hand coordination, and comprehensive performance) were calculated. Results A total of 119 children (average age: 42.12 months; range, 7.5-95.5 months) with a genetic diagnosis of AS were enrolled. The median GQ score of the GMDS was 29.6 points (95% confidence interval, 28.6-33.25). The children had relatively good locomotor and personal-social skills but poor language skills. Overall, 89% (106/119) had mental ages younger than 24 months for all five subscales. The non-deletion group (i.e., without deletion in chromosome 15q11-13) had higher GQs and locomotor, personal-social, and performance subscale quotients. The GQ was significantly different among the three age subgroups and significantly correlated with age. Compared with the non-epilepsy group, the epilepsy group had lower GQs and lower quotients for the locomotor, personal-social, speech, language, and eye-hand coordination subscales.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 208,806 social media user-generated content (UGC) pieces were collected from Twitter in three countries C the USA, UK and Australia. The analysis of this big qualitative data was performed using machine learningCbased software C Leximancer. Findings: Positive and negative sentiment towards panic buying during the COVID-19 crisis was observed in the UGC. No significant differences in social media UGC sentiment between the three countries were found;however, differences did exist in key themes. This suggests that the focus, not the sentiment, of consumers responses to panic buying differed across countries. Social media users follow their location-based and topic-consonant social herd, rather than the global herd. Research limitations/implications: This study was the first to show that social media users herd mentality differs in a crisis. The herd mentality of social networks is dependent on factors such as the geographic location of the social network (herd), which can differ from the global herds reaction, specifically in terms of topics evident in UGC. Practical implications: Operations and supply chain managers need to include social media UGC analysis in their strategies in crisis management responses. The topics, not the sentiment, of consumers responses to panic buying require managerial actions. Originality/value: This is the first study to show that herd mentality during a crisis, such as COVID-19, is not unidimensional and varies according to the location of the social media network with profound implications for operations and supply chain managers. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Supply chain insights from social media users responses to panic buying during COVID-19: the herd mentality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regdanvimab has decreased the time to clinical recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and lowered the rate of oxygen therapy according to the results from Phase 2 randomized controlled trial.

Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells is a high priority for deciphering its mystery and curbing its spread. A virus surface spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. To fulfill its function, SARS-CoV-2 spike binds to its receptor human ACE2 (hACE2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is proteolytically activated by human proteases. Here we investigated receptor binding and protease activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike using biochemical and pseudovirus entry assays. Our findings have identified key cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. First, SARS-CoV-2 RBD has higher hACE2 binding affinity than SARS-CoV RBD, supporting efficient cell entry. Second, paradoxically, the hACE2 binding affinity of the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike is comparable to or lower than that of SARS-CoV spike, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 RBD, albeit more potent, is less exposed than SARS-CoV RBD. Third, unlike SARS-CoV, cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is preactivated by proprotein convertase furin, reducing its dependence on target cell proteases for entry. The high hACE2 binding affinity of the RBD, furin preactivation of the spike, and hidden RBD in the spike potentially allow SARS-CoV-2 to maintain efficient cell entry while evading immune surveillance. These features may contribute to the wide spread of the virus. Successful intervention strategies must target both the potency of SARS-CoV-2 and its evasiveness.","output":"Cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aims of this study were to characterize new SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled all over Italy and to reconstruct the origin and the evolutionary dynamics in Italy and Europe between February and June 2020.

METHODS: The spatial distribution of morbidity, mortality and case fatality was mapped using hierarchical Bayesian smoothed indirectly standardised ratios. Indirectly standardised ratios were used to evaluate the association between deprivation and the outcome measures. We looked separately at morbidity and mortality in the 10 districts with the highest and 10 districts with the lowest share of Roma population. RESULTS: Compared with the national average, the relative incidence of cases was 30%C36% lower in the most deprived quintile but the relative mortality and case fatality were 27%C32% higher. Expressed as incidence ratios relative to the national average, the most deprived municipalities had a relative incidence ratio of 0.64 (CI: 0.62 to 0.65) and 0.70 (CI: 0.69 to 0.72) for males and females, respectively. The corresponding figures for mortality were 1.32 (CI: 1.20 to 1.44) for males and 1.27 (CI: 1.16 to 1.39) for females and for case fatality 1.27 (CI: 1.16 to 1.39) and 1.32 (CI: 1.20 to 1.44) for males and females, respectively. The excess death rate (per 100 000) increased with deprivation levels (least deprived: 114.12 (CI: 108.60 to 119.84) and most deprived: 158.07 (CI: 149.30 to 167.23)). The 10 districts where Roma formed the greatest share of the population had an excess mortality rate 17.46% higher than the average for the most deprived quintile. CONCLUSIONS: Those living in more deprived municipalities had a lower risk of being identified as a confirmed COVID-19 case but had a higher risk of death. An inverse association between trends in morbidity and mortality by socioeconomic conditions should be a cause for concern and points to the need for responses, including those involving vaccination, to pay particular attention to inequalities and their causes.","output":"Unequal burden of COVID-19 in Hungary: a geographical and socioeconomic analysis of the second wave of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A link between exposure to the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and respiratory disease has been suggested. Viral infections are the major cause of asthma exacerbations. We aimed to assess whether there is a relation between NO(2) exposure and the severity of asthma exacerbations caused by proven respiratory viral infections in children. METHODS: A cohort of 114 asthmatic children aged between 8 and 11 years recorded daily upper and lower respiratory-tract symptoms, peak expiratory flow (PEF), and measured personal NO(2) exposures every week for up to 13 months. We took nasal aspirates during reported episodes of upper respiratory-tract illness and tested for infection by common respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria with RT-PCR assays. We used generalised estimating equations to assess the relation between low (<75 g/m(3)), medium (75C14 g/m(3)), and high (>14 g/m(3)) tertiles of NO(2) exposure in the week before or after upper respiratory-tract infection and the severity of asthma exacerbation in the week after the start of an infection. FINDINGS: One or more viruses were detected in 78% of reported infection episodes, and the medians of NO(2) exposure were 5 (IQR 36C63), 10 (87C120), and 21 g/m(3) (168C429) for low, medium, and high tertiles, respectively. There were significant increases in the severity of lower respiratory-tract symptom scores across the three tertiles (06 for all viruses [p=005] and >2 for respiratory syncytial virus [p=001]) and a reduction in PEF of more than 12 L/min for picornavirus (p=004) for high compared with low NO(2) exposure before the start of the virus-induced exacerbation.

In the past years, research mainly focused on understanding the role played by alpine streams' internal factors such as aquatic environmental variables, as well as physical and hydrological conditions, on the shaping of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. More recently, external factors such as terrestrial environments were included in analyses worldwide. In particular, the inherent properties constituting the ecological niche of specific species were considered as factors regulating dispersal and influencing community construction. The objective of this study was to reveal the distribution pattern and the driving factors regulating aquatic biodiversity in alpine streams. We hypothesized that the altitudinal distribution of aquatic macroinvertebrates could be explained by the interaction of the aquatic environment with both species' ecological niche and the terrestrial environment surrounding their habitat, and that rare species display a more pronounced pattern than widespread dominant species. To test these hypotheses, samples were collected from two alpine streams situated on opposite slopes of Biluo Snow Mountain in Yunnan Province, China. Results of statistical analyses showed poor explanatory power from aquatic environmental factors, while the differences in vegetation type and the ecological niche of the species played an important role in determining the distribution pattern of aquatic biodiversity. Furthermore, we found that the altitudinal distribution pattern of aquatic biodiversity exhibits a bimodal type, with rare species fitting the bimodal peaks.

OBJECTIVE To examine the relationships between physicians' and other providers' primary specialties and their opioid prescribing practices among patients with chronic noncancer pain (CNCP). METHODS Prescriptions for opioids filled by 81,459 Medicaid patients with CNCP in North Carolina (USA), 18 to 64 years of age, enrolled at any point during a one-year study period were examined. 2<?span> statistics were used to examine bivariate differences in prescribing practices according to specialty. For multivariable analyses, maximum-likelihood logistic regression models were used to examine the effect of specialty on prescribing practices, controlling for patients' pain diagnoses and demographic characteristics. RESULTS Of prescriptions filled by patients with CNCP, who constituted 6.4% of the total sample of 1.28 million individuals, 12.0% were for opioids. General practitioner?family medicine specialists and internists were least likely to prescribe opioids, and orthopedists were most likely. Across specialties, men were more likely to receive opioids than women, as were white individuals relative to other races?ethnicities.

This issue increases the demand for accurate and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. While accurate and rapid detection is critical for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, the appropriate course of treatment must be chosen to help patients and prevent its further spread. Testing platform accuracy with high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 is equally important for clinical, regional, and global arenas to mitigate secondary transmission rounds.

Finally, the role of new technologies in countering COVID-19 is also introduced to assist researchers in the development of accurate and timely detection of coronaviruses. As coronavirus continues to affect human lives in a detrimental manner, the development of rapid and accurate virus detection methods could promote COVID-19 diagnosis accessible to both individuals and the mass population at patient care.

The use of appropriate SRL strategies helps students acquire new knowledge more efficiently. We investigated the use of SRL strategies in individual learning from expository science hypertext, the correlations between different measures of self-regulation, and the differences in SRL between more and less successful students. A sample of 443 ninth graders from 15 different schools participated in the study. A variety of off- and online measures were used to measure SRL. Data were collected from student traces, questionnaires, tests scores, and notes. Low correlations between the off- and online measures of SRL suggest that they measure different aspects of SRL use in learning digital science texts. Student achievement in science positively correlated with their use of SRL strategies. Students with higher knowledge gains reported the higher use of deep cognitive strategies, higher motivation for learning, and used a higher number of strategies in note-taking while learning. The results of this study may have practical implications for teachers to support student SRL and for developers of digital learning materials to incorporate SRL scaffolding into learning topics.","output":"What Can Off- and Online Measures Tell about Students Self-Regulation and Their Achievement While Learning Science Expository Hypertext"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prejudicial linking of infection with ethnic minority status has a long-established history, but in some ways this association may have intensified under the contemporary circumstances of the \\"new public health\\" and globalization. This study analyzes this conflation of ethnicity and disease victimization by considering the stigmatization process that occurred during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Toronto. The attribution of stigma during the SARS outbreak occurred in multiple and overlapping ways informed by: (i) the depiction of images of individuals donning respiratory masks; (ii) employment status in the health sector; and (iii) Asian-Canadian and Chinese-Canadian ethnicity. In turn, stigmatization during the SARS crisis facilitated a moral panic of sorts in which racism at a cultural level was expressed and rationalized on the basis of a rhetoric of the new public health and anti-globalization sentiments. With the former, an emphasis on individualized self-protection, in the health sense, justified the generalized avoidance of those stigmatized. In relation to the latter, in the post-9/11 era, avoidance of the stigmatized other was legitimized on the basis of perceiving the SARS threat as a consequence of the mixing of different people predicated by economic and cultural globalization.","output":"Stigmatized ethnicity, public health, and globalization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global efforts around the world are focused on to discuss several health care strategies for minimizing the impact of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) on the community.

Mathematical models with computational simulations are effective tools that help global efforts to estimate key transmission parameters and further improvements for controlling this disease. This is an infectious disease and can be modeled as a system of non-linear differential equations with reaction rates. This work reviews and develops some suggested models for the COVID-19 that can address important questions about global health care and suggest important notes. Then, we suggest an updated model that includes a system of differential equations with transmission parameters. Some key computational simulations and sensitivity analysis are investigated. Also, the local sensitivities for each model state concerning the model parameters are computed using three different techniques: non-normalizations, half normalizations, and full normalizations. Results based on the computational simulations show that the model dynamics are significantly changed for different key model parameters. Interestingly, we identify that transition rates between asymptomatic infected with both reported and unreported symptomatic infected individuals are very sensitive parameters concerning model variables in spreading this disease. This helps international efforts to reduce the number of infected individuals from the disease and to prevent the propagation of new coronavirus more widely on the community.

METHODS: 200 convalescent COVID-19 patients who had symptoms related to decreased digestive and respiratory function were randomly divided to either receive Ludangshen oral liquid or placebo for 2 weeks. The severity of clinical symptoms including fatigue, anorexia, abdominal distension, loose stools, and shortness of breath were assessed by visual analogue scale and observed at before and after treatment. The improvement and resolution rates of clinical symptoms were evaluated. Full analysis set (FAS) and per-protocol set (PPS) were used for statistical analyses. Adverse events were recorded during the study. RESULTS: 8 patients did not complete the study. After 2 weeks of treatment, both FAS and PPS results showed that patients in Ludangshen group had significantly lower score of fatigue, anorexia, loose stools, and shortness of breath than placebo group (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference in distention (P > 0.05). The improvement rate of fatigue, anorexia, distension, loose stools and shortness of breath were significantly higher in Ludangshen group (P < 0.05), as well as the resolution rates (P < 0.05) except for shortness of breath (P > 0.05). There were two cases of adverse events, with one nose bleeding in Ludangshen group and one headache in placebo group. CONCLUSION: The study suggested that two weeks of Ludangshen oral liquid treatment may have certain effects for convalescent COVID-19 patients on improving digestive and respiratory symptoms including fatigue, anorexia, loose stools and shortness of breath, which may be one of the choices for management of convalescent COVID-19 patients with digestive and respiratory symptoms.","output":"Ludangshen oral liquid for treatment of convalescent COVID-19 patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats are the second most diverse order of mammals and key species for ecosystem functioning, providing a wide range of ecosystem services, from pest control to seed dispersal.

Placebo-controlled phase 3 efficacy trial is still standard for authorizing vaccines in majority of the world. However, due to lack of cases or participants in parts of the world, this has not always been feasible. An alternative to efficacy trial is immunobridging, in which the immune response or correlates of protection of a vaccine candidate is compared against an approved vaccine. Here we describe a case study where our candidate vaccine, MVC-COV1901, has been granted for emergency use authorization (EUA) locally based on the non-inferiority immunobridging process. Methods The per protocol immunogenicity (PPI) subset from the MVC-COV1901 phase 2 trial was used for this study and consisted of 903 subjects who have received two doses of MVC-COV1901 as scheduled in the clinical trial. The comparator set of population consisted of 200 subjects of [] 20 years of age who were generally healthy, and have received two doses of AstraZeneca ChAdOx nCOV-19 (AZD1222) recruited from Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare. Results MVC-COV1901 was shown to have a geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio lower bound 95% confidence internal (CI) of 3.4 against the comparator vaccine and a seroconversion rate of 95.5% at the 95% CI lower bound, which both exceeded the criteria set by the Taiwan regulatory authority for EUA approval. These results supported the EUA approval of MVC-COV1901 by the Taiwanese regulatory authority in July 2021. Following the consensus of the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA), countries from the Access Consortium has recently adopted the use of immunobridging studies as acceptable for authorizing COVID-19 vaccines in lieu of efficacy data.

In an attempt to comprehend the wide discrepancy in patient response to COVID-19 and the factors that potentially modulate it, we summarize the findings relating PA to inflammation and immunity. A distinction is drawn between moderate intensity and high intensity physical exercise based on the high lactate production observed in the latter. We hypothesize that, the lactate production associated with high intensity anaerobic exercise is implicated in the modulation of several components of the innate and adaptive immunity. In this review, we also summarize these immunomodulatory effects of lactate. These include increasing serum IL-6 levels, the main mediator of cytokine storms, as well as affecting NK cells, Macrophages, Dendritic cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. The implications of high lactate levels in athletic performance are highlighted where athletes should undergo endurance training to increase VO2 max and minimize lactate production. Tumor models of hypoxia were also reported where lactate levels are elevated leading to increased invasiveness and angiogenesis. Accordingly, the novel lactate blocking strategy employed in cancer treatment is evaluated for its potential benefit in COVID-19 in addition to the readily available beta-blockers as an antagonist to lactate.

The adjusted proportion of poor sleepers increased from 29% to 56.2% (95% C.I.: 50.9 C 61.6%) among SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals, but only to 40.7% (95% C.I.: 35.3 C 46.1%) in their seronegative counterparts (p<0.001). Likewise, progression from a good to a poor sleeper status was higher among seropositive individuals than in their seronegative counterparts (38.1% versus 22.3%; p<0.001), after adjusting for relevant covariates.

Although patients cite physicians as trusted information sources on diet and weight loss, studies suggest that the management of nutrition-related disorders is hindered by insufficient medical education and training. Objectives of this study were to: (1) Quantify nutrition-related learning objectives (NLOs) in UK postgraduate medical training curriculums and assess variation across specialties; (2) assess inclusion of nutrition-related modules; (3) assess the extent to which NLOs are knowledge-, skill-, or behaviour-based, and in which Good Medical Practice (GMP) Domain(s) they fall. 43 current postgraduate curriculums, approved by the General Medical Council (GMC) and representing a spectrum of patient-facing training pathways in the UK, were included. NLOs were identified using four keywords: nutrition, diet, obesity, and lifestyle. Where a keyword was used in a titled section followed by a number of objectives, this was designated as a module. Where possible, NLOs were coded with the information to address objective 3. A median of 15 NLOs (mean 24) were identified per curriculum. Eleven specialties (25.6%) had five or less NLOs identified, including General Practice. Surgical curriculums had a higher number of NLOs compared with medical (median 30 and 8.5, respectively), as well as a higher inclusion rate of nutrition-related modules (100% of curriculums versus 34.4%, respectively). 52.9% of NLOs were knowledge-based, 34.9% skill-based, and 12.2% behaviour-based. The most common GMP Domain assigned to NLOs was Domain 1: Knowledge, Skills and Performance (53.0%), followed by Domain 2: Safety and Quality (20.6%), 3: Communication, Partnership and Teamwork (18.7%), and 4: Maintaining Trust (7.7%). This study demonstrates considerable variability in the number of nutrition-related learning objectives in UK postgraduate medical training. As insufficient nutrition education and training may underlie inadequate doctor-patient discussions, the results of this analysis suggest a need for further evaluation of nutrition-related competencies in postgraduate training.","output":"Are We Neglecting Nutrition in UK Medical Training?

The highest number of MERS-CoV cases are from Saudi-Arabia, the major worldwide hotspot for this disease. In the absence of neither effective treatment nor a ready-to-use vaccine and with yet an incomplete understanding of its epidemiological cycle, prevention and containment measures can be derived from mathematical models of disease epidemiology. We constructed 2-strain models to predict past outbreaks in the interval 2012-2016 and derive key epidemiological information for Macca, Madina and Riyadh. We approached variability in infection through three different disease incidence functions capturing social behavior in response to an epidemic (e.g. Bilinear, BL; Non-monotone, NM; and Saturated, SAT models). The best model combination successfully anticipated the total number of MERS-CoV clinical cases for the 2015-2016 season and accurately predicted both the number of cases at the peak of seasonal incidence and the overall shape of the epidemic cycle. The evolution in the basic reproduction number (R0) warns that MERS-CoV may easily take an epidemic form. The best model correctly captures this feature, indicating a high epidemic risk (1&#8804;R0&#8804;2,5) in Riyadh and Macca and confirming the alleged co-circulation of more than one strain. Accurate predictions of the future MERS-CoV peak week, as well as the number of cases at the peak are now possible.

The authors retrospectively investigated adverse events (AEs) by data-mining a self-reporting database to better understand toxicities, especially since it has been used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: A reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect the risk signals from the data in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system database (FAERS). The definition relied on system organ class (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). RESULTS: The search retrieved 1,598 baricitinib-associated cases within the reporting period: 86 PTs with significant disproportionality were retained. Infections including 'herpes zoster,' 'oral herpes,' and 'herpes virus infection' were found at a similar rate to those reported in trials, and such events were rare. Reports emerged for several thrombotic adverse events, while these events were also rare. Unexpected safety signals as opportunistic infections were detected. Serious outcomes as death and life-threatening outcomes accounted for 9.76% of the reported cases. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of these AEs does not appear above the background expected.

Oxidative stress is a known OM mediator and pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to the amplification of the immune response. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible associations of rs4880 (superoxide dismutase 2, SOD2 47 C/T), rs7943316 (catalase, CAT ?21 A/T), rs1800629 (tumor necrosis factor , TNF-  ?308 G/A), and rs1800795 (interleukin 6, IL-6 ?174 G/C) polymorphisms with chemo-induced OM occurrence and severity in oncopediatric patients. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a single-center, observational cross-sectional study with sample collection of oral epithelial cells from 95 children and adolescents with hematological cancers who underwent chemotherapy, followed by genomic DNA extraction. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed with PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism). Demographic data and information concerning OM occurrence were obtained from dental charts of the multidisciplinary oral care team. Information on OM severity was obtained from appropriately-filled Oral Assessment Guide records. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted with Student's T test, chi-squared test, and Fisher's exact test, with p0.05. RESULTS: The mean age was 10 years-old and most patients were male individuals (57.89%). Female sex was considered a protective factor for OM occurrence (OR=4.83; CI=[1.14; 16.57]). The AA genotype for CAT was the most frequent amongst individuals with severe OM (p=0.04). The GA genotype for TNF-  was the most frequent amongst individuals without severe OM (p=0.03). For SOD2 and IL-6 , the most frequent genotypes were CT and GG respectively for all groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: The AA genotype for CAT ?21 A/T was a tendency among the group with severe OM.

We aimed to develop a model for respiratory depressant effects of propofol with remifentanil in patients undergoing endoscopy with sedation. Data were available for 136 patients undergoing endoscopy with sedation. Participants randomly received infusions of propofol and remifentanil. Predicted plasma concentrations, outputted by infusion pumps, were available. Transcutaneous arterial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) was measured. Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling methods. Covariate relationships were investigated for age, noxious stimuli (endoscopy tube insertion), and A118G genotype for the -opioid receptor (OPRM1). Participants had a median (range) age of 64.0 (25.0-88.0) years, weight of 70.0 (35.0-98.0) kg, and height of 164.0 (147.0-190.0) cm. Seven percent were recessive homozygous for OPRM1 polymorphism.

Developments of sensitive, rapid, and affordable diagnostic methods are necessary to improve the clinical management of infectious diseases. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) systems have emerged as a robust biosensing platform due to their label-free mechanism, which allows the detection and quantification of a wide range of biomolecules. The high sensitivity and short detection time offered by QCM-based biosensors are attractive for the early detection of infections and the routine monitoring of disease progression. Herein, the strategies employed in QCM-based biosensors for the detection of infectious diseases are extensively reviewed, with a focus on prevalent diseases for which improved diagnostic techniques are in high demands.

Her impact on travel writing as an unmarried European woman traveler, at the beginning of the twentieth century, without income, local connections or colonial rank is notable. This chapter provides close reading, through a postcolonial feminist lens, of two first edition volumes of Starks autobiographical travel books written during 1928C1939. The analysis explores the commercial nexus of Orientalism, which is the term that refers to Western depictions of the Eastern world (Said E, Orientalism. Pantheon, New York, 1998). It discusses Starks work in relation to conceived reader expectations, as well as her distinctly ambivalent attitude to British colonialism and colonials. I suggest that Starks ambiguous role, as insider-outsider both within and between the Arab region and British Empire, poses provocative questions about the interrelationships of gender, self and Other within commercialized Orientalist discourse (Ballaster R, Fabulous orients. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2005). Stark makes specific discursive moves, not only as a traveler across continents, but in literary, ethnographic and gender terms. These moves manage to disrupt fixed framings, images and descriptions of Arab people, places and gender practices. This chapter therefore makes a unique contribution to theorizing Starks work and, also, travel writing more generally, locating it as an import discursive genre that is always underpinned by moving practices of gender, politics and power.","output":"Freya Starks Tales of Travel on the Coast of Incense"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Americans expect postsecondary education to not only end in a credential but also a good job Yet, even before the pandemic, higher education was not leading to a good career for many individuals, especially the students from disadvantaged backgrounds who most need it According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2020), about 40% of recent graduates are underemployed, working in jobs that do not require their level of education--with women and Black graduates especially likely to be doing so Now more than ever, it's imperative for policy makers and institutional leaders to commit to expanding high-quality postsecondary opportunities that can meet today's students where they are and deliver on the promise of a personally and professionally rewarding career One such opportunity is competency-based education (CBE) Not only can CBE guide institutions toward postsecondary opportunities that are flexible, affordable, and workforce aligned;it can do so while ensuring equity and student success remain at the forefront","output":"Competency-Based Education: A Clear, Equitable Path Forward for Today's Learners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The last two years, despite the very serious COronaVIrus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, have been quite productive in the field of molecular endocrinology and metabolism and our journal section has contributed extensively on that [...].","output":"Molecular Endocrinology and Metabolism in 2021: Whats New"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Case summary A 3-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat presented for further investigation of a swollen left eyelid and a hard, non-painful bony swelling over the left frontal sinus.

The leukoerythroblastic reaction or leukoerythroblastosis is defined by the presence in peripheral blood of nucleated erythroid cells and immature myeloids. Among its most frequent causes is medullary invasion by solid tumors and hematological neoplasms, so the recognition and consequent study of this reaction is extremely important. To date, only a single case of COVID-19 disease associated with a leukoerythroblastic reaction has been reported worldwide in adult patients. METHODOLOGY: In the following manuscript we describe the presence of leukoerythroblastosis in a male hospitalized for COVID-19, in which multiple causes were ruled out. RESULTS: The patient had resolution of the leukoerythroblatosis as his respiratory symptoms resolved. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 disease could be a new known cause of a leukoerythroblastic reaction, although we believe that a greater number of reported cases is necessary to affirm that the association was not random.","output":"Reaccin leucoeritroblstica asociada a infeccin por COVID-19.

Numerous hotels have ceased operations. Because of the increasing influence of blogs, various industries have adopted blogs as a publicity and marketing strategy. Companies utilize consumers trust and loyalty toward bloggers to effectively contact them. Hence, bloggers play a crucial role in the hotel industry. No past study has researched blogger selection by hotel managers. In this study, an innovative mixed multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model including importance-performance analysis (IPA), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is established to assist hotel managers in selecting bloggers. We firstly collect the selection criteria via interviews with hotel managers and a review of literature on blogger selection. Messages with stick are understood, remembered, and have an enduring influence on opinions and behavior. Hence, we also introduce the concept of stick to the selection criteria. Based on IPA and the literature review, a hierarchical structure for blogger selection is constructed. Then, AHP and TOPSIS are integrated to assist the case company managers to select suitable bloggers.","output":"Selecting Bloggers for Hotels via an Innovative Mixed MCDM Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Taste dysfunction (TD) has been recognised, together with olfactory dysfunction, as a key presenting symptom of COVID-19.

A group of 361 adults with pain participated in this study. They responded to an online survey and provided information on sociodemographic issues, pain, fatigue, perceived health, and quality of life. The data showed that most participants suffered moderate to severe pain and interferences with pain treatment and an increase in pain intensity during the lockdown. Most participants also informed us that fatigue had worsened during the lockdown (62%). Importantly, females with lower monthly family income and lower education have been found to be associated with greater levels of pain and fatigue. Despite this, participants perceived themselves as having good health and good quality of life. The findings from this study can be used to inform policy and specific responses for future COVID-19 waves and future pandemics where social distancing measures must be implemented.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 Social Distancing Measures in Individuals with Chronic Pain Living in Spain in the Late Stages of the Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We were interested to read the review paper on COVID\\\\19 by Ludvigsson in Acta Paediatrica (1).

This study aimed to characterize changes to clinical protocols during the first wave of COVID-19 and compare outcomes to historical controls. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study at a university fertility center examining all patients who underwent medically indicated FP cycles during the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) COVID-19 Task Force-recommended suspension of fertility treatment (March 17CMay 11, 2020) and patients from the same time period in 2019. FP care was modified for safety during the first wave of COVID-19 with fewer monitoring visits and infection control measures. FP cycle characteristics and outcomes were compared across years. Results: The volume of cycles was nearly 30% higher in 2020 versus 2019 (27 vs. 19). Diagnoses, age, and anti-Mullerian hormone were similar between cohorts. More patients elected to pursue embryo cryopreservation over oocyte cryopreservation in 2020 versus 2019 (45.8% vs. 5.2%, p < 0.005). Patients managed during COVID-19 had fewer monitoring visits (5  1 vs. 6  1, p = 0.02), and 37.5% of cycles utilized a blind trigger injection. There was no difference in total days of ovarian stimulation (11  1 vs. 11  2, p > 0.05), but 2020 cycles utilized more gonadotropin (4770  1480 vs. 3846  1438, p = 0.04).

The aim of this study was to potentially characterize the prevalence, associated factors and to establish a prognostic nomogram to predict the overall survival (OS) of NSCLC patients with bone metastasis. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was used to collected NSCLC cases during 2010C2015. The cases with incomplete clinicopathological information were excluded. Finally, 484 NSCLC patients with bone metastasis were included in the present study and randomly divided into the training (n=340) and validation (n=144) cohorts in a ratio of 7:3 based on R software. NSCLC patients with bone metastasis were selected to investigate predictive factors for OS and cancer-specific survival (CSS) using the multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. A nomogram incorporating these prognostic factors was developed and evaluated by a concordance index (C-index), calibration plots, and risk group stratifications. RESULTS: In the Cox proportional hazards model, sex, race, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) N, T stage, liver metastasis, and chemotherapy were regarded as prognostic factors of OS. The nomogram based on sex, race, AJCC N, T stage, liver metastasis and chemotherapy was developed for cancer-specific death to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate with good performance. The C-index of established nomogram was 0.695 for cancer-specific death in the study population with an acceptable calibration.

Whether arrhythmias, frequently described in severe COVID-19, are disease-specific and thus promote strokes is unclear. We investigated the occurrence of arrhythmias and stroke during rhythm monitoring in critically ill patients with COVID-19, compared with severe pneumonia of other origins. Methods and Results: This retrospective study included 120 critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation in three European tertiary hospitals, including n =60 COVID-19, matched according to risk factors for the occurrence of arrhythmias in n = 60 patients from a retrospective consecutive cohort of severe pneumonia of other origins. Arrhythmias, mainly atrial fibrillation (AF), were frequent in COVID-19. However, when compared with non-COVID-19, no difference was observed with respect to ventricular tachycardias (VT) and relevant bradyarrhythmias (VT 10.0 vs. 8.4 %, p = ns and asystole 5.0 vs. 3.3%, p = ns) with consequent similar rates of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (6.7 vs. 10.0%, p = ns). AF was even more common in non-COVID-19 (AF 18.3 vs. 43.3%, p = 0.003; newly onset AF 10.0 vs. 30.0%, p = 0.006), which resulted in a higher need for electrical cardioversion (6.7 vs. 20.0%, p = 0.029). Despite these findings and comparable rates of therapeutic anticoagulation (TAC), the incidence of stroke was higher in COVID-19 (6.7.% vs. 0.0, p = 0.042). These events also happened in the absence of AF (50%) and with TAC (50%). Conclusions: Arrhythmias were common in severe COVID-19, consisting mainly of AF, yet less frequent than in matched pneumonia of other origins. A contrasting higher incidence of stroke independent of arrhythmias also observed with TAC, seems to be an arrhythmia-unrelated disease-specific feature of COVID-19.","output":"Higher Incidence of Stroke in Severe COVID-19 Is Not Associated With a Higher Burden of Arrhythmias: Comparison With Other Types of Severe Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Com o objetivo de avaliar a ingest?o calrica e caractersticas fecais de c?es adultos em manuten??o e em atividade, dois grupos de animais foram utilizados, sendo o primeiro grupo composto por 4 c?es ativos da ra?a Border Collie e o segundo composto por 14 c?es de ra?as variadas.

Aim and objectives: To evaluate the association between NLR and the disease severity and mortality in COVID-19. Materials and methods: After approval from Institutional Ethics Committee, this prospective cohort study was carried out in a tertiary-care teaching medical institute of Central India. COVID-19 patients of the age group 18 years and above admitted during the study period were included. Cases were categorized into four groups as asymptomatic (Group A), mild (Group B), moderate (Group C), and severe (Group D) based on clinical symptoms, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and chest imaging. NLR was calculated by doing a complete blood count at the time of hospitalization by the Mindray BC-6000 auto hematology analyzer. The outcome of the disease was classified as recovery and death during hospitalization. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the ability of NLR at admission to predict severe COVID-19 or mortality. Ordinal regression analysis was used to assess the impact of NLR on disease severity and mortality. Results: Mean NLR was significantly higher in the severe COVID-19 group as compared to the mild/moderate group and in deceased as compared to discharged cases. ROC curve analysis revealed NLR to be an excellent predictor of disease severity as well as a prognostic parameter for risk of death. NLR was found to be a significant independent positive predictor for contracting the severe disease (Odds ratio 1.396, 95% CI=1.112-1.753, p=0.004) and mortality (Odds ratio 1.276, 95% CI=1.085-1.499, p=0.003).

OBJECTIVE: To present the position of the European Association of Urology (EAU) in 2021 and provide recommendations for the use of PSA testing as part of a risk-adapted strategy for the early detection of prostate cancer. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The authors combined their review of relevant literature, including the EAU prostate cancer guidelines 2021 update, with their own knowledge to provide an expert opinion, representing the EAU's position in 2021. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The EAU has developed a risk-adapted early prostate cancer detection strategy for well-informed men based on PSA testing, risk calculators, and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, which can differentiate significant from insignificant prostate cancer. This approach largely avoids the overdiagnosis/overtreatment of men unlikely to experience disease-related symptoms during their lifetime and facilitates an early diagnosis of men with significant cancer to receive active treatment. It also reduces advanced-stage diagnosis, thereby potentially reducing prostate cancer-specific mortality and improving quality of life. Education is required among urologists, general practitioners, radiologists, policy makers, and healthy men, including endorsement by the European Commission to adapt the European Council's screening recommendations in its 2022 plan and requests to individual countries for its incorporation into national cancer plans. CONCLUSIONS: This risk-adapted approach for the early detection of prostate cancer will reverse current unfavourable trends and ultimately save lives. PATIENT SUMMARY: The European Association of Urology has developed a patient information leaflet and algorithm for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. It can identify men who do not need magnetic resonance imaging or a biopsy and those who would not show any symptoms versus those with more aggressive disease who require further tests/treatment. We need to raise awareness of this algorithm to ensure that all well-informed men at risk of significant prostate cancer are offered a prostate-specific antigen test. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: A risk-adapted early prostate cancer detection strategy, incorporating prostate-specific antigen testing, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, risk calculators, and biomarkers, will avoid overdiagnosis/overtreatment of insignificant cancers and ensure early detection and treatment of significant cancers, thereby improving quality of life and reducing prostate cancer-related deaths.","output":"Prostate-specific Antigen Testing as Part of a Risk-Adapted Early Detection Strategy for Prostate Cancer: European Association of Urology Position and Recommendations for 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The relationships between human population movement (HPM) and health are a concern at global level. In the case of malaria, those links are crucial in relation to the spread of drug resistant parasites and to the elimination of malaria in the Greater Mekong sub-Region (GMS) and beyond. The mobile and migrant populations (MMP) who are involved in forest related activities are both at high risk of being infected with malaria and at risk of receiving late and sub-standard treatment due to poor access to health services. In Cambodia, in 2012, the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) identified, as a key objective, the development of a specific strategy for MMPs in order to address these challenges. A population movement framework (PMF) for malaria was developed and operationalized in order to contribute to this strategy. METHODS: A review of the published and unpublished literature was conducted. Based on a synthesis of the results, information was presented and discussed with experienced researchers and programme managers in the Cambodian NMCP and led to the development and refinement of a PMF for malaria. The framework was tested for face and content validity with national experts through a workshop approach. RESULTS: In the literature, HPM has been described using various spatial and temporal dimensions both in the context of the spread of anti-malarial drug resistance, and in the context of malaria elimination and previous classifications have categorized MMPs in Cambodia and the GMS through using a number of different criteria. Building on these previous models, the PMF was developed and then refined and populated with in-depth information relevant to Cambodia collected from social science research and field experiences in Cambodia. The framework comprises of the PMF itself, MMP activity profiles and a Malaria Risk Index which is a summation of three related indices: a vulnerability index, an exposure index and an access index which allow a qualitative ranking of malaria risk in the MMP population. Application of currently available data to the framework illustrates that the highest risk population are those highly mobile populations engaged in forest work. CONCLUSION: This paper describes the process of defining MMPs in Cambodia, identifying the different activities and related risks to appropriately target and tailor interventions to the highest risk groups. The framework has been used to develop more targeted behaviour change and outreach interventions for MMPs in Cambodia and its utility and effectiveness will be evaluated as part of those interventions.","output":"Malaria and the mobile and migrant population in Cambodia: a population movement framework to inform strategies for malaria control and elimination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Due to the unexpected spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there was a serious crisis of emergency medical system collapse.

The remaining 15 (68.2%) patients with abnormal scans had predominant non-fibrotic changes like ground-glass opacities (GGOs), consolidation, cavity, or nodule. The most common presenting symptoms at the follow-up examination were dyspnoea (81.8%), cough (54.1%) followed by fatigue in 40.9% of patients. Conclusion: This study concluded that most of the severe COVID-19 patients have some residual radiological findings during medium-term follow-up. Fibrotic-like lesions are present in almost all patients but most of them get resolved with time. True fibrotic features like honeycombing are rarely seen as residual lung sequelae.","output":"Radiological Lung Sequelae of Severe COVID-19: A Retrospective Observational Study From a Dedicated COVID Centre of Eastern India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is a newly discovered coronavirus that the World Health Organization has officially announced in March 2020 as a pandemic. It is a new virus in the medical field with no specific treatment. Besides, they have not discovered all the symptoms but only some of them. Covid-19 is spreading very fast as the medical systems worldwide cannot hospitalize all the patients, which leads to an increase in the number of the virus death. This work will use the power of deep learning and transfer learning to give faster diagnoses for infection in Covid-19 using X-ray images. The proposed approach is a modified version from Visual Geometry Group (VGG 16). It uses the architecture of the VGG16 with modification to achieve higher accuracy. The model was trained to classify X-ray images into two classes;normal (healthy) and Covid-19 (sick) classes. The model can then predict any uploaded X-ray image class as normal or Covid 19. The achieved accuracy by modified VGG 16 is 99.7%. The model is evaluated through a confusion matrix, precision, accuracy, recall, and f measure. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Covid-19 Detection From Chest X-Rays Using Modified VGG 16 Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all schools in China shifted to online learning in the spring of 2020. For many schools located in the rural areas of western China, however, it was their first attempt at online learning, and the critical question regarding the effectiveness of online learning on academic performance remains to be answered. In this study, we tracked 125 Grade 10 students in a rural high school in western China, and we compared their academic performance before and after the online learning practice. In addition, four hierarchical regression models were computed to explore the influencing factors of post-pandemic academic performance in different subjects. The results indicated that online learning did not increase students' academic performance in the rural high school and significant drop of performance was seen in mathematics and English. Students' demographic features had little influence on the change of academic performance, as prior academic performance remained the most important predictor of the post-pandemic academic performance. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Online Academic Performance during the COVID-19: Evidence from a Rural High School in Western China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Switzerland had one of highest incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Europe during the second wave. Schools were open as in most of Europe with specific preventive measures in place. However, the frequency and transmission of acute unrecognized, asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infections in schools during this time of high community transmission is unknown. Thereof, our aim was to pilot a surveillance system that detects acute SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools and possible transmission within classes. Method 14 out of the randomly selected sample of the Ciao Corona cohort study participated between December 1 and 11, a time when incidence rate for SARS-CoV-2 infections was high for the canton of Zurich. We determined point-prevalence of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections of pupils attending primary and secondary school. A buccal swab for polymerase chain reaction PCR and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to detect SARS-CoV-2 were taken twice 1 week apart (T1 and T2) in a cohort of children from randomly selected classes. A questionnaire assessed demographics and symptoms compatible with a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the past 5 days. Results Out of 1299 invited children, 641 (49%) 6- to 16-year-old children and 66 teachers from 14 schools and 67 classes participated in at least 1 of 2 testings. None of the teachers and 1 child had a positive PCR at T1, corresponding to a point-prevalence in children of 0.2% (95% CI 0.0% to 1.1%), and no positive PCR was detected at T2. The child with positive PCR at T1 was negative on the RDT at T1 and both tests were negative at T2. There were 7 (0.6%) false positive RDTs in children and 2 (1.7%) false positive RDTs in teachers at T1 or T2 among 5 schools (overall prevalence 0.7%). All 9 initially positive RDTs were negative in a new buccal sample taken 2 hours to 2 days later, also confirmed by PCR. 35% of children and 8% of teachers reported mild symptoms during the 5 days prior to testing. Conclusion In a setting of high incidence setting of SARS-CoV-2 infections, unrecognized virus spread within schools was very low. Schools appear to be safe with the protective measures in place (e.g. clearly symptomatic children have to stay at home, prompt contact tracing with individual and class-level quarantine, and structured infection prevention measures in school). Specificity of the RDT was within the lower boundary of performance and needs further evaluation for its use in schools. Given the very low point prevalence even in a setting of very high incidence, a targeted test, track, isolate and quarantine (TTIQ) strategy for symptomatic children and school personel adapted to school settings is likely more suitable approach than surveillance on entire classes and schools.","output":"Surveillance of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections in school children and point-prevalence during a time of high community transmission in Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Bronchoscopy and related procedures have unambiguously been affected during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 (SARS COV-2).

It is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of various kidney diseases by causing cellular injury and tissue inflammation, resulting in sclerosis and fibrosis. These deleterious effects are, consequently, targeted in the development of novel therapies that inhibit the formation of C5b-9, such as eculizumab. To clarify how C5b-9 contributes to kidney disease and to predict which patients benefit from such therapy, knowledge on deposition of C5b-9 in the kidney is essential. Because immunohistochemical staining of C5b-9 has not been routinely conducted and never been compared across studies, we provide a review of studies on deposition of C5b-9 in healthy and diseased human kidneys. We describe techniques to stain deposits and compare the occurrence of deposits in healthy kidneys and in a wide spectrum of kidney diseases, including hypertensive nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, C3 glomerulopathy, and thrombotic microangiopathies such as the atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, vasculitis, interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, kidney tumors, and rejection of kidney transplants. We summarize how these deposits are related with other histological lesions and clinical characteristics. We evaluate the prognostic relevance of these deposits in the light of possible treatment with complement inhibitors.","output":"Deposition of the Membrane Attack Complex in Healthy and Diseased Human Kidneys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Exploration of the factors that influence hospital doctors antibiotic prescribing decisions when treating children with respiratory symptoms in UK emergency departments. METHODS: A qualitative study using semistructured interviews based on a critical incident technique with 21 physicians of different grades and specialties that treat children in the UK. Interviews were audio-recorded then transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four themes were identified. These themes illustrate factors which influence clinician prescribing. The three principal themes were authorities, pressures and risk. The fourth transcending theme that ran through all themes was clinician awareness and complicity (knowing but still doing). CONCLUSIONS: Hospital doctors prescribe antibiotics even when they know they should not. This appears to be due to the influence of those in charge or external pressures experienced while weighing up the immediate and longer term risks but clinicians do this with full insight into their actions. These findings have implications for invested parties seeking to develop future antimicrobial stewardship programmes. It is recommended that stewardship interventions acknowledge and target these themes which may in turn facilitate behaviour change and antimicrobial prescribing practice in emergency departments.","output":"Understanding doctors emergency department antibiotic prescribing decisions in children with respiratory symptoms in the UK: a qualitative study"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(O,[["render",P]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/42.md","filePath":"drive/42.md"}'),V={name:"drive/42.md"},N=Object.assign(V,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[w(R)]))}});export{E as __pageData,N as default};
