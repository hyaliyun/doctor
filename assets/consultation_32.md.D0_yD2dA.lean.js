The feature of high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions.

Later, or mid-century, the extended and cyclical relations between malnutrition and infections were elegantly described,2 and diabetes was also early identified as a condition making people especially vulnerable to pathogens.7 An interwoven world Today, however, the increasing diversity of reliable quality tools that are available to assess immune function have facilitated the remarkable increases in our comprehension of the design of both the innate and adaptive immune system.2 Scientific advances have also brought with them an emerging understanding of the web of genes, the immune system and nutritional status, including energy metabolism and the gut microbiota, although many puzzles still remain to be solved.3 8 The current challenge is to capture the complexity of this multidimensional relationship, interacting via multiple direct and indirect pathways,3 while at the same time tracing and understanding the effect of single nutrients of special importance.9 10 As the immune system develops and forms from conception to adulthood,3 a natural decline in immune function is usually inevitable with age.4 However, this decline may be slowed through optimal nutrition, as well as optimisation of other lifestyle factors such as physical activity and sedentariness, stressors and sleep, throughout the life course.9 All are of great importance. The importance of these are bluntly reflected in food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs), represented as recommendations for a variety and diversity of whole vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts, seeds, grains and pulses, along with some meats, eggs, dairy products and fish, if selected, as discussed in the paper by Calder.4 This type of healthy diet is a tactical aproach to build a healthy body and a strong immune system, as emphasised by the WHO and other organisations during the pandemic,18 especially when eaten at the expense of more ultraprocessed food items.19 Nutrition is a balancing act Furthermore, the diet described previously would for most people provide ample amount of the micronutrients that have been suggested to be of special importance for the immune system.4 However, vitamin D as one of the key micronutrients for the immune system has been given special focus by several papers in the collection.12 13 The vitamin is found in only an handful of foods and populations with low sun exposure have been found to be prone to low status, especially during the winter months. Special conditions: clinical setting However, with advancing age and for high-risk groups, a nutrient-rich diet is not always enough to meet needs for micronutrients.4 14 While high intakes should be avoided, there may be a a role for immune-targeted supplements that might be necessary to achieve the intake of nutrients needed for an optimally functioning immune system.4 Furthermore, there is one thing to enhance the public health nutritional status, through preventive actions, while the clinical situation of an active disease is another situation altogether.","output":"Nutrition is key to global pandemic resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the article were to discuss the implementation of infection prevention and control strategies in health facilities in South Sudan These strategies were: ensuring triage, early recognition, and source control, applying standard precautions for all patients, implementing empiric additional precautions for suspected cases of COVID-19, issuing new guidance, policies and protocols for IPC as appropriate, and using environmental and engineering controls (e g , reorganizing health facilities to create isolation rooms, improving airflow in existing rooms)","output":"COVID-19 and infection prevention and control in health facilities.

COVID-19 was diagnosed based on the typical clinical presentation and positive polymerase chain reaction test in nasopharyngeal swabs. All patients were treated in different hospitals repurposed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A standard histological study was performed with hematoxylin and eosin, toluidine blue, and van Gieson staining. Serial paraffin slices were studied immunohistochemically with antibodies to CD3, D68, CD20, perforin, and toll-like receptors (TLR) 4 and 9.Results In none of the cases, myocarditis was suspected clinically, added to the diagnosis or indicated as a possible cause of death. IHD and acute myocardial infarction were mentioned as error diagnoses not confirmed by the postmortem examination. The morphological examination of the heart identified signs of lymphocytic myocarditis consistent with Dallas criteria for this diagnosis. Myocardial infiltrate was characterized in detail, and a combined inflammatory damage of endocardium and pericardium was described. The immunohistochemical study with cell infiltrate typing confirmed the presence of CD3-positive  lymphocytes and the increased expression of TLR-4.

The ECS plays a proven role in the management of several neurological, cardiovascular, immunological, and other relevant chronic conditions. Endocannabinoid or endogenous cannabinoid are endogenous lipid molecules which connect with cannabinoid receptors and impose a fashionable impact on the behavior and physiological processes of the individual. Arachidonoyl ethanolamide or Anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol or 2-AG were the endocannabinoid molecules that were first characterized and discovered. The presence of lipid membranes in the precursor molecules is the characteristic feature of endocannabinoids. The endocannabinoids are released upon rapid enzymatic reactions into the extracellular space via activation through G-protein coupled receptors, which is contradictory to other neurotransmitter that are synthesized beforehand, and stock up into the synaptic vesicles.

Excessive neuroinflammation, including microglial activation and T-cell responses, has been identified as a critical factor associated with neurodegeneration in retinal ischemia. Baicalein is a natural flavonoid reported to have broad anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective bioactivities. Herein, the effects of baicalein on microglia activation in vitro and in vivo were investigated. We found that baicalein exhibited robust anti-inflammatory effect on cultured human and mouse microglia, as demonstrated by decreased induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFB). Proteomic analysis further unraveled baicaleins effect on modulating IL-17 signaling pathways and its upstream regulator IL-1. Intravitreal administration of baicalein in the mouse model of retinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury attenuated microglial activation and retinal T-cell infiltration, particularly the T helper 17 cells. Additionally, baicalein was shown to exert neuroprotective effects by significantly reducing the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss after I/R injury, leading to an improved retinal function and spatial vision. These results suggest that baicalein, a natural flavonoid, acts as a negative regulator of activated microglia and immune responses both in vitro and in vivo, effectively alleviating neurodegeneration in retinal I/R injury.

DESIGN: We utilized a three-phase, modified electronic Delphi (eDelphi) process, followed by a discussion round to generate consensus on the definition of physiological decompensation and on criteria to identify decompensation. We then validated the criteria using a retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. SETTING: Quaternary academic medical center. PATIENTS: Adult patients admitted to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania who had triggered a rapid response team (RRT) response between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-nine experts participated in the eDelphi. Participation was high across the three survey rounds (first round: 93%, second round: 94%, and third round: 98%). The expert panel arrived at a consensus definition of physiological decompensation, An acute worsening of a patients clinical status that poses a substantial increase to an individuals short-term risk of death or serious harm. Consensus was also reached on criteria for physiological decompensation. Invasive mechanical ventilation, severe hypoxemia, and use of vasopressor or inotrope medication were bundled as criteria for our novel decompensation metric: the adult inpatient decompensation event (AIDE).

Zooplankton were collected at different depths intervals (0-10m, 10-20 m, 20-30m, 30-40m) at early morning, middle day, evening and night in the studied site. The results revealed that zooplankton species (Daphnia pulex, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Neobosmina chilensis, Mesocyclops araucanus, and Tropocyclops prasinus) are abundant in surface zones at night, early morning and evening, whereas at middle day the zooplankton abundances are high at deep zones. The results agree with observations for Argentinean and North American lakes where these daily migration patterns in crustacean zooplankton species were reported due mainly natural ultraviolet radiation exposure, whereas for northern hemisphere lakes the vertical migration is due to combined effect of natural ultraviolet radiation and fish predation exposure.","output":"Daily vertical distribution of zooplankton in two oligo-mesotrophic north Patagonian lakes (39 S, Chile)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In France, the regular and compulsory detection of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) and Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) in flocks of breeding and laying hens is based on bacteriological examination of environmental swabs and faeces samples. The aim of this study was to compare this bacteriological examination with a serological method (ELISA) developed in our laboratory. This ELISA was first evaluated by use of artificially infected hens. During these experimental infection studies, several groups of hens were inoculated with SE, ST, different vaccines and different Salmonella serovars to calculate the experimental parameters of our ELISA. Then, in a field study, 43 flocks were followed monthly using two bacteriological samples (environmental swab and pool of faeces) and 20 serological samples (sera or yolks). Twenty-seven flocks without SE or ST gave a negative serological response throughout their surveillance. Among the 10 various serovars different from SE and ST isolated in this study, S. Heidelberg, S. Agona and S. Hadar gave seropositive results in seven flocks. Consequently, this ELISA was not specific of SE and ST as it detected serovars sharing or not common antigens with SE and ST. Seropositive results were also obtained each month for two flocks where no Salmonella could be isolated. Finally, in seven flocks found infected with SE or ST, the positive ELISA results appeared later than the bacteriological detection. Therefore, for the detection of chicken flocks recently infected with SE or ST, bacteriological examination currently used in France seems to be more appropriate than this ELISA.","output":"Evaluation of a French ELISA for the detection of Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium in flocks of laying and breeding hens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionWe aim to quantify adherence of positive airway pressure (PAP) initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare the effects of remote versus face-to-face (FTF) education in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).MethodsProspective cohort study in a tertiary National Health Service (NHS) hospital sleep disorders centre in London, United Kingdom, involving 141 patients aged >18 years with newly diagnosed OSA initiating PAP during the first national coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown in 2020.

METHODS Children <18 years of age, from a single-site outbreak, who satisfied a clinical case definition for SARS, with subsequent serologic confirmation, were treated according to a standard protocol and prospectively monitored. RESULTS Forty-four children were included. The median age was 12 years. Forty-two children (95.5%) demonstrated an epidemiologic link. Fever, cough, malaise, coryza, sputum production, headache, myalgia, lymphopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels were common presenting features. Radiographic findings were nonspecific, but high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax was an early diagnostic aid. A specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV yielded positive results for <50% of children. Of 9 children who developed hypoxemia, 8 were treated with methylprednisolone. Of 5 children who received intensive care, 3 required assisted ventilation. All children recovered, and serious adverse events in response to treatment were not observed. The outcomes at 3 to 6 months after disease onset, including exercise tolerance, pulmonary functions, and psychologic status, were favorable. An age of >12 years was associated with methylprednisolone therapy for severe illness. After exclusion of the only infant, an age of >12 years was associated with oxygen requirements. Sore throat, high neutrophil count at presentation, and peak neutrophilia were independent factors predicting severe illness. The clinical case definition demonstrated good sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (97.8%, 92.7%, 88%, and 98.7%, respectively) for diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSIONS Children are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. Teenagers resemble adults with respect to disease progression and may develop severe illness. The short-term to medium-term outcomes are good. Sore throat and initial and peak neutrophilia seem to be predictors of severe illness.

Although all three enzymatically active OAS proteins in humans--OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3--synthesize 2-5A upon binding dsRNA, it is unclear which are responsible for RNase L activation during viral infection. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) technology to engineer human A549-derived cell lines in which each of the OAS genes or RNase L is knocked out. Upon transfection with poly(rI):poly(rC), a synthetic surrogate for viral dsRNA, or infection with each of four viruses from different groups (West Nile virus, Sindbis virus, influenza virus, or vaccinia virus), OAS1-KO and OAS2-KO cells synthesized amounts of 2-5A similar to those synthesized in parental wild-type cells, causing RNase L activation as assessed by rRNA degradation. In contrast, OAS3-KO cells synthesized minimal 2-5A, and rRNA remained intact, similar to infected RNase L-KO cells. All four viruses replicated to higher titers in OAS3-KO or RNase L-KO A549 cells than in parental, OAS1-KO, or OAS2-KO cells, demonstrating the antiviral effects of OAS3. OAS3 displayed a higher affinity for dsRNA in intact cells than either OAS1 or OAS2, consistent with its dominant role in RNase L activation. Finally, the requirement for OAS3 as the major OAS isoform responsible for RNase L activation was not restricted to A549 cells, because OAS3-KO cells derived from two other human cell lines also were deficient in RNase L activation.","output":"Activation of RNase L is dependent on OAS3 expression during infection with diverse human viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE In the Union for International Cancer Control classification, extrinsic muscle involvement in oropharyngeal cancers is systematically defined as a T4a tumor, although the term extrinsic may incorrectly imply that these muscles are outside the tongue. Our aim was to describe the topography of extrinsic tongue muscles and show that their involvement in oropharyngeal cancers does not always correspond to T4a staging. METHODS This cadaveric study was based on dissections of the tongues of ten healthy subjects. Dissections were carried out using sections, and careful macroscopic examination with a 3.5-diopter magnifying glass allowed the identification of muscles from their origin to their termination. Imagery and histology were excluded to stay as close as possible to the clinical evaluation. RESULTS The sample comprised seven men and three women, with a mean age 82 years. In all the ten cases, the extrinsic muscles were located at the periphery of the tongue. The genioglossus was the only deep extrinsic muscle, extending to the periphery and under the mucous membrane of the tongue. As a result, a T1 tumor can invade the mucous membrane and affect the extrinsic muscles without transforming into a T4a tumor. CONCLUSION As extrinsic tongue muscles are peripheral and submucosal, the use of the term \\"deep\\" is erroneous, as is the systematic usage of extrinsic muscles to define T4a oropharyngeal cancers. This study attempts to explain this error, which is recurrent in the different editions of the Union for International Cancer Control and American Joint Committee on Cancer.","output":"TNM Classification: Are Cancers With Extrinsic Tongue Muscle Involvement Systematically T4a?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Facial gender recognition is a crucial research topic due to its comprehensive use cases, including a demographic gender survey, visitor profile identification, targeted advertisement, access control, security, and surveillance from CCTV. For these real-time applications, the face of a person can be oriented to any angle from the camera axis, and the person can be of any age group, including juveniles. A child's face consists of immature craniofacial feature points in texture and edge compared to an adult face, making it very hard to recognize gender using the child's face. Real-word faces captured in an unconstrained environment make the gender prediction system more complex to identify correctly due to orientation. These factors reduce the accuracy of the existing state-of-the-art models developed so far for real-time facial gender prediction. This paper presents the novelty of facial gender recognition for juveniles, adults, and unconstrained-oriented faces. The progressive calibration network (PCN) detects rotation-invariant faces in the proposed model. Then, a Gabor filter is applied to extract unique edge and texture features from the detected face. The Gabor filter is invariant to illumination and produces texture and edge features with redundant feature coefficients in large dimensions. Gabor has drawbacks such as redundancy and a large dimension resolved by the proposed meanDWT feature optimization method, which optimizes the system's accuracy, the size of the model, and computational timing. The proposed feature engineering model is classified with different classifiers such as Na?ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM with linear, and RBF kernel. Its results are compared with the state-of-the-art techniques; detailed experimental analysis is presented and concluded to support the argument.

As a neurologist team, for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), we compared the situations of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) treatment from 2019 to 2020 to investigate the influence of COVID-19 pandemic on the attendance and prognosis of the IVT patients. METHODS: We collected the messages of objects who had received IVT (Bridging surgery was ruled out) during 2019C2020. We analyzed differences in age, gender, time from onset to start IVT, door to needle time (DNT), pretreatment NIHSS score, postoperative NIHSS score, and so on. Statistical tests were also performed to respectively compare the discharged modified Rankin score (mRS) and discharged NIHSS score between two years. RESULTS: Since the onset of COVID-19 restrictions in Wenzhou, we observed a significant reduction of 24.7% (p = 0.023) from 267(2019) to 201(2020) of received IVT on hospital admission.

Although the response is initiated with protective purposes, the effect may be detrimental when not regulated. The physiological control of neuroinflammation is mainly achieved via regulatory mechanisms performed by particular cells of the immune system intimately associated with or within the nervous system and named non-neuronal cells. In particular, mast cells (within the central nervous system and in the periphery) and microglia (at spinal and supraspinal level) are involved in this control, through a close functional relationship between them and neurons (either centrally, spinal, or peripherally located). Accordingly, neuroinflammation becomes a worsening factor in many disorders whenever the non-neuronal cell supervision is inadequate. It has been shown that the regulation of non-neuronal cellsand therefore the control of neuroinflammationdepends on the local on demand synthesis of the endogenous lipid amide Palmitoylethanolamide and related endocannabinoids. When the balance between synthesis and degradation of this bioactive lipid mediator is disrupted in favor of reduced synthesis and/or increased degradation, the behavior of non-neuronal cells may not be appropriately regulated and neuroinflammation exceeds the physiological boundaries. In these conditions, it has been demonstrated that the increase of endogenous Palmitoylethanolamideeither by decreasing its degradation or exogenous administrationis able to keep neuroinflammation within its physiological limits. In this review the large number of studies on the benefits derived from oral administration of micronized and highly bioavailable forms of Palmitoylethanolamide is discussed, with special reference to neuroinflammatory disorders.","output":"Palmitoylethanolamide: A Nutritional Approach to Keep Neuroinflammation within Physiological BoundariesA Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Both, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) and SARS-COV-2 infection cause a set of immunologic changes that respectively vary during the course of the treatment or the disease. Objective: To review immune changes brought along by each of these entities and how they might interrelate. Methods: We start presenting a brief review of the structure of the new coronavirus and how it alters the functioning of the human immune system. Subsequently, we describe the immune changes induced by AIT and how these changes could be favorable or unfavorable in the allergic patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a particular point of time during the evolving infection. Results: We describe how a healthy immune response against SARS-CoV-2 develops, versus an immune response that is initially suppressed by the virus, but ultimately overactivated, leading to an excessive production of cytokines (cytokine-storm-like). These changes are then linked to the clinical manifestations and outcomes of the patient. Reviewing the immune changes secondary to AIT, it becomes clear how AIT is capable of restoring a healthy innate immunity. Investigators have previously shown that the frequency of respiratory infections is reduced in allergic patients treated with AIT. On the other hand it also increases immunoregulation. Conclusion: As there are many variables involved, it is hard to predict how AIT could influence the allergic patient's reaction to a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We aimed to measure the impact of COVID-19 on the uptake of hospital-based care at a national level. DESIGN: The study period (weeks ending 5 January to 28 June 2020) encompassed the pandemic announcement by the World Health Organization and the initiation of the UK lockdown. We undertook an interrupted time-series analysis to evaluate the impact of these events on hospital services at a national level and across demographics, clinical specialties and National Health Service Health Boards. SETTING: Scotland, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients receiving hospital care from National Health Service Scotland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Accident and emergency (A&E) attendances, and emergency and planned hospital admissions measured using the relative change of weekly counts in 2020 to the averaged counts for equivalent weeks in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Before the pandemic announcement, the uptake of hospital care was largely consistent with historical levels. This was followed by sharp drops in all outcomes until UK lockdown, where activity began to steadily increase. This time-period saw an average reduction of ?40.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: ?47.7 to ?33.7) in A&E attendances, ?25.8% (95% CI: ?31.1 to ?20.4) in emergency hospital admissions and ?60.9% (95% CI: ?66.1 to ?55.7) in planned hospital admissions, in comparison to the 2018C2019 averages.

Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Uganda inclusive, implemented lockdowns, curfew, banning of both private and public transport systems, and mass gatherings to minimize spread. Social control measures for COVID-19 are reported to increase violence and discrimination globally, including in Uganda as some may be difficult to implement resulting in the heavy deployment of law enforcement. Media reports indicated that cases of violence and discrimination had increased in Uganda's communities following the lockdown. We estimated the incidence and factors associated with experiencing violence and discrimination among Ugandans during the COVID-19 lockdown to inform control and prevention measures. METHODS: In April 2020, we conducted a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data under the International Citizen Project (ICP) to assess adherence to public health measures and their impact on the COVID-19 outbreak in Uganda. We analyzed data on violence and discrimination from the ICP study. We performed descriptive statistics for all the participants' characteristics and created a binary outcome variable called experiencing violence and/or discrimination. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with experiencing violence and discrimination. RESULTS: Of the 1726 ICP study participants, 1051 (58.8%) were males, 841 (48.7%) were currently living with a spouse or partner, and 376 (21.8%) had physically attended work for more than 3 days in the past week. Overall, 145 (8.4%) experienced any form of violence and/or discrimination by any perpetrator, and 46 (31.7%) of the 145 reported that it was perpetrated by a law enforcement officer. Factors associated with experiencing violence or discrimination were: being male (AOR = 1.60 CI:1.10-2.33), having attended work physically for more than 3 days in the past week (AOR = 1.52 CI:1.03-2.23), and inability to access social or essential health services since the epidemic started (AOR = 3.10 CI:2.14-4.50). CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of Ugandan residents experienced violence and/or discrimination during the COVID-19 lockdown, mostly perpetrated by law enforcement officers.

In this review, the current evidence on the potential role of ginger and its active compounds in the prevention of ageing is discussed.","output":"Ginger for Healthy Ageing: A Systematic Review on Current Evidence of Its Antioxidant, Anti-Inflammatory, and Anticancer Properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During pregnancy early third trimester immunization against SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 confers optimal immunity to the neonate.","output":"Preliminary results on transmission of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 antibodies to the fetus and serum neutralizing activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed lives across the world. In the UK, a public health driven policy of population \\"lockdown\\" has had enormous personal and economic impact. METHODS: We compare UK response and outcomes with European countries of similar income and healthcare resources. We calibrate estimates of the economic costs as different % loss in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) against possible benefits of avoiding life years lost, for different scenarios where current COVID-19 mortality and comorbidity rates were used to calculate the loss in life expectancy and adjusted for their levels of poor health and quality of life. We then apply a quality-adjusted life years (QALY) value of 30,000 (maximum under national guidelines). RESULTS: There was a rapid spread of cases and significant variation both in severity and timing of both implementation and subsequent reductions in social restrictions. There was less variation in the trajectory of mortality rates and excess deaths, which have fallen across all countries during May/June 2020. The average age at death and life expectancy loss for non-COVID-19 was 79.1 and 11.4 years, respectively, while COVID-19 were 80.4 and 10.1 years; including adjustments for life-shortening comorbidities and quality of life plausibly reduces this to around 5 QALY lost for each COVID-19 death. The lowest estimate for lockdown costs incurred was 40% higher than highest benefits from avoiding the worst mortality case scenario at full life expectancy tariff and in more realistic estimations they were over 5 times higher. Future scenarios showed in the best case a QALY value of 220k (7xNICE guideline) and in the worst-case 3.7m (125xNICE guideline) was needed to justify the continuation of lockdown. CONCLUSION: This suggests that the costs of continuing severe restrictions are so great relative to likely benefits in lives saved that a rapid easing in restrictions is now warranted.","output":"\\"Stay at Home, Protect the National Health Service, Save Lives\\": A cost benefit analysis of the lockdown in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: COVID-19 is the current viral pandemic. Its consequences are multifaceted and refer to individual and public physical, mental, and economic states. Therefore, viral outbreaks raise many fears and concerns, both among policymakers and individuals. In light of these fears, we explore the central aspects of viral victimization, compared to another significant threat of this century: terrorism. Analysis: There are many similarities between terrorism and the current pandemic which manifest within the physical, economic, social, and psychological aspects of victimization. To address the multidimensional nature of the pandemic's impact we coined the term viruism. Though terrorism and viruism are not the deadliest of threats, they evoke high levels of fear and cause enormous financial, social, and psychological effects. Conclusion: We recommend exploring the psychosocial mechanisms that account for public reaction to viruism. Identifying such mechanisms will contribute to developing more effective practices in managing the fear of viruism and in decreasing its emotional toll.

Here we test the ability of DNA aptamers to interact with the spike (S-)protein of the SARS-CoV-2 viral capsid. The S-protein, a trimer made up of several subdomains, develops the crucial function of recognizing the ACE2 receptors on the surface of human cells, and subsequent fusioning of the virus membrane with the host cell membrane. In order to achieve this, the S1 domain of one protomer switches between a closed conformation, in which the binding site is inaccessible to the cell receptors, and an open conformation, in which ACE2 can bind, thereby initiating the entry process of the viral genetic material in the host cell. Here we show, by means of state-of-the-art molecular simulations, that small DNA aptamers experimentally identified can recognize the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, and characterize the details of the binding process. We find that their interaction with different subdomains of the S-protein can effectively block, or at least considerably slow down the opening process of the S1 domain, thereby significantly reducing the probability of virus-cell binding. We provide evidence that, as a consequence, binding of the human ACE2 receptor may be crucially affected under such conditions. Given the facility and low cost of fabrication of specific aptamers, the present findings could open the way to both an innovative viral screening technique with sub-nanomolar sensitivity, and to an effective and low impact curative strategy.","output":"DNA Aptamers Block the Receptor Binding Domain at the Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to the novelty of COVID?19 there is lack of evidence-based recommendations regarding the mechanical ventilation of these patients.

Loss-of-function mutations in the stefin B gene (CSTB) gene were reported in patients with Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1). We have identified an interaction between stefin B and nucleosomes, specifically with histones H2A.Z, H2B, and H3. In synchronized T98G cells, stefin B co-immunoprecipitated with histone H3, predominantly in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Stefin B-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts entered S phase earlier than wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In contrast, increased expression of stefin B in the nucleus delayed cell cycle progression in T98G cells. The delay in cell cycle progression was associated with the inhibition of cathepsin L in the nucleus, as judged from the decreased cleavage of the CUX1 transcription factor. In vitro, inhibition of cathepsin L by stefin B was potentiated in the presence of histones, whereas histones alone did not affect the cathepsin L activity. Interaction of stefin B with the Met-75 truncated form of cathepsin L in the nucleus was confirmed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments in the living cells. Stefin B could thus play an important role in regulating the proteolytic activity of cathepsin L in the nucleus, protecting substrates such as transcription factors from its proteolytic processing.","output":"Stefin B interacts with histones and cathepsin L in the nucleus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To systematically examine the dynamic changes and time sequence in corneal epithelial cell apoptosis after excessive ultraviolet B irradiation. METHODS Ultraviolet B (144 mJ/cm2) was used to irradiate rat corneal epithelial cells for 2 h. Cell morphology was observed on differential interference contrast microscopy, and the numbers of the different kinds of apoptotic cells were counted using the ImageJ software. Cell viability was measured with the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5- diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide method. Cell apoptotic rate and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were detected using flow cytometric analyses. The expression levels of 3 apoptotic genes were measured with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction at different time points within 0-24 h after irradiation. RESULTS After 144-mJ/cm2 ultraviolet B irradiation for 2 h, the expression levels of caspase-8 and Bax were highest at 0 h; furthermore, the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased at 0 h and remained constant for 6 h in a subsequent culture. At 6 h, caspase-3 was activated. The decrease in cell viability and increase in apoptotic rate peaked at 6 h. The caspase-3 expression level decreased within 12-24 h, which led to a decline in apoptotic rate and change in apoptotic stage.

Interestingly, lower incidence and mortality rates have been observed in women from Africa compared to their cohorts from other continents. Also, in the US non-Hispanic Black females have lower COVID-19 and death rates compared to their white counterparts. It's unclear why this significant difference exists; however, the ovarian function, genetics and immunological statuses could play a major role.

The racial differences in lifestyle, age and inaccessibility to contraceptive usage might also play a role. Here, we provide insight on how the high levels of estrogen in African women might contribute to the lower cases and fatalities in Africa. Specifically, estrogen might offer protection against COVID-19 by suppressing hyper-production of cytokines, promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines, stimulating antibody production and suppressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.

However, periprocedural outcome needs to be assessed for aiding treatment decision. PURPOSE To compare efficacy rates and periprocedural outcome (technical success, session time, hospitalization time, and complications) after renal tumor treatment with laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). MATERIAL AND METHODS The initial experience with 49 (treated with LPN) and 84 (treated with RFA) consecutive patients for a single renal tumor (diameter  5 cm, limited to the kidney) during 2007-2014 was evaluated. Patient and tumor characteristics, efficacy rates, and periprocedural outcome were collected retrospectively. The stratified Mantel Haenzel and Van Elteren tests, adjusted for tumor complexity (with the modified R.E.N.A.L nephrometry score [m-RNS]), were used to assess differences in treatment outcomes. RESULTS Primary efficacy rate was 98% for LPN and 85.7% for RFA; secondary efficacy rate was 93.9% for LPN and 95.2% for RFA; and technical success rate was 87.8% for LPN and 100% for RFA. Median session (m-RNS adjusted P < 0.001; LPN 215 min, RFA 137 min) and median hospitalization time were longer after LPN (m-RNS adjusted P < 0.001; LPN 5 days, RFA 2 days). Side effects were uncommon (LPN 2%, RFA 4.8%). Complications were more frequent after LPN (m-RNS adjusted P < 0.001; LPN 42.9%, RFA 10.7%). CONCLUSION Both methods achieved equivalent secondary efficacy rates. RFA included several treatment sessions, but session and hospitalization times were shorter, and complications were less frequent than for LPN.

Provision of telemonitoring programs in addition to usual care has demonstrated improved effectiveness in managing patients with heart failure (HF). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the potential clinical and health economic outcomes of a telemonitoring program for management of patients with HF during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of health care providers in Hong Kong. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to compare the outcomes of a care under COVID-19 (CUC) group and a telemonitoring plus CUC group (telemonitoring group) in a hypothetical cohort of older patients with HF in Hong Kong. The model outcome measures were direct medical cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the model assumptions and the robustness of the base-case results. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the telemonitoring group showed a higher QALY gain (1.9007) at a higher cost (US $15,888) compared to the CUC group (1.8345 QALYs at US $15,603). Adopting US $48,937/QALY (1  the gross domestic product per capita of Hong Kong) as the willingness-to-pay threshold, telemonitoring was accepted as a highly cost-effective strategy, with an incremental cost-effective ratio of US $4292/QALY. No threshold value was identified in the deterministic sensitivity analysis. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, telemonitoring was accepted as cost-effective in 99.22% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the current outpatient care alone under the COVID-19 pandemic, the addition of telemonitoring-mediated management to the current care for patients with HF appears to be a highly cost-effective strategy from the perspective of health care providers in Hong Kong.","output":"Cost-effectiveness of a Telemonitoring Program for Patients With Heart Failure During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Hong Kong: Model Development and Data Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To explore the mechanism of the bone anabolic action of p27 deficiency, we first confirmed that osteoblast formation and osteogenesis were significantly increased in p27 deficient mice compared with their wild-type littermates. Microarray analysis of differential gene expression profiles, followed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blots revealed that p27 deletion significantly upregulated the expression of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Gli1 and 2 and their target gene Bmi1 in bone tissue, and significantly down regulated the expression of the negative regulators of the Shh pathway Sufu, Patched 1 and Gli3 in bone tissue. The Shh antagonist KAAD-cyclopamine or vismodegib significantly reduced osteogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in vitro and osteoblastic bone formation in vivo. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation and double luciferase assay demonstrated that p27 inhibited Shh transcription mediated via E2F4. Bmi1 knockout blocked the increase of osteoblastic bone formation induced by p27 deficiency in vivo. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the signaling pathway Shh-Gli-Bmi1 plays a critical role in p27 deficiency induced bone anabolic action, suggesting that Bmi1 may be an important therapeutic target for osteoporosis induced by activation of p27 signaling or inactivation of sonic hedgehog signaling.","output":"A Sonic Hedgehog-Gli-Bmi1 signaling pathway plays a critical role in p27 deficiency induced bone anabolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effectiveness of the financial market is reflected in the financial crisis which mostly results in credit risk.

Blood samples were obtained at a median of 2.8 (interquartile, 2.1C3.7) and 6.1 (5.3C7.2) months after baseline (symptom onset and/or first positive virus detection). The immune profiles of activation, senescence, exhaustion, and regulatory cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were detected by a plaque reduction neutralization test. In available nasopharyngeal swabs at baseline, SARS-CoV-2 levels were quantified by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). RESULTS: Overall, COVID-19 patients had higher levels of immune activation, exhaustion, and regulatory cells compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Within the COVID-19 group, activated and senescent cells were higher in adults than in children and inversely correlated with the nAbs levels. Conversely, Tregs and Bregs regulatory cells were higher in COVID-19 children compared to adults and positively correlated with nAbs. Higher immune activation still persisted in adults after 6 months of infection, while children maintained higher levels of regulatory cells. SARS-CoV-2 levels did not differ among age classes. CONCLUSIONS: Adults displayed higher immune activation and lower production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs than children. The different immune response was not related to different viral load. The higher expression of regulatory cells in children may contribute to reduce the immune activation, thus leading to a greater specific response against the virus.","output":"Asymptomatic and Mild SARS-CoV-2 Infections Elicit Lower Immune Activation and Higher Specific Neutralizing Antibodies in Children Than in Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Charging patterns of electric vehicles (EVs) are affected by the global COVID-19 lockdown, which forced people to stay home.

How Right Now (HRN) C and its Spanish-language counterpart, Qu Hacer Ahora (QHA) C is an evidence-based, culturally-relevant communication campaign designed to promote and strengthen the emotional well-being and resiliency of populations adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with support from the CDC Foundation, the campaign aims to help all Americans but has a specific focus on some of the disproportionately affected groups, including adults over 65 and their caregivers, individuals with pre-existing physical and mental health conditions, people experiencing violence, and those experiencing economic distress. Based on rapid, but robust, formative research, HRN offers audience-centric messages representing the real, everyday experiences and emotions that these audiences are having and addresses them in actionable ways. These include messages that address the social and structural barrier that disproportionately-affected groups have been facing long before the pandemic  and which are felt more acutely now. This paper provides an overview of the rapid, mixed-method, culturally-responsive formative research process undertaken to inform the development of HRN. Specifically, it describes how HRNs disproportionately-affected audiences describe and discuss their emotiona well-being during COVID-19 through the lens of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). We introduce a secondary theory, Vital Conditions for Health and Well-Being (VCHW), which conceptualizes holistic well-being and the conditions that give rise to it and identifies levers for community change and improvement.

Findings suggest that HRNs priority audiences emotional well-being and SDOH are interconnected. Disruptions in SDOH du to the COVID-19 pandemic can lead to emotional well-being challenges (e.g., anxiety) for HRNs priority audiences. While some disruptions may lead some people to adapt, connect with others, and be more resilient, there is a disparate impact of emotional well-being amid COVID-19 for those already experiencing disparities linked to SDOH.

Data was entered prospectively and clinical outcomes updated over time via an online database (REDCap). Clinical variables were compared with clinical outcomes using multivariable regression analysis, with logistic regression used to develop a prediction model for mortality. Participants recorded whether any of the operators tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of the procedure. Findings: The cohort comprised 1605 tracheostomy cases from 126 UK hospitals. The median time from intubation to tracheostomy was 15 days (IQR 11, 21). 285 (18%) patients died following the procedure. 1229 (93%) of the survivors had been successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation at censoring and 1049 (81%) had been discharged from hospital.

Inequalities in general practice, including additional roles, have not been examined in recent years, which is a meaningful gap in the literature. Previous research has found that workforce inequalities are associated with health outcome inequalities. AIM: To examine recent trends in general practice workforce inequalities. DESIGN & SETTING: A longitudinal study using quarterly General Practice Workforce datasets from 2015C2020 in England. METHOD: The slope indices of inequality (SIIs) for GPs, nurses, total direct patient care (DPC) staff, PAs, pharmacists, and paramedics per 10 000 patients were calculated quarterly, and plotted over time, with and without adjustment for patient need. RESULTS: Fewer GPs, total DPC staff, and paramedics per 10 000 patients were employed in more deprived areas. Conversely, more PAs and pharmacists per 10 000 patients were employed in more deprived areas. With the exception of total DPC staff, these observed inequalities widened over time. The unadjusted analysis showed more nurses per 10 000 patients employed in more deprived areas. These values were not significant after adjustment but approached a more equal or pro-poor distribution over time.

Except representative manifestation of pneumonia and acute respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 patients have also shown different levels of liver injury or liver dysfunction. The aim of our study was to explore the probable clinical severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients and their liver dysfunction. METHOD: A combination of computer and manual retrieval was used to search in Medline through PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science. Review Manager 5.3 software was used to examine the heterogeneity among the studies and to calculate the combined effect value (OR, 95CI). Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias test were also performed. RESULTS: We found a significant connection between liver dysfunction and mortality of COVID-19 patients with a pooled OR of 1.98 (95% CI 1.39C2.82; P = 0.0002). There was a significant association between AST and severity of COVID-19 with a pooled OR of 4.48 (95% CI 3.24C7.21; P < 0.001), and a pooled WMD of 3.35 (95% CI, 2.07 to 4.64; P < 0.001). In addition, there was a significant difference between TBIL and severity of COVID-19, with a pooled OR of 1.91 (95% CI 1.40C2.60; P < 0.001), and with a pooled WMD of 1.18 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.58; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The mortality and severity of COVID-19 patients are significantly associated with liver dysfunction. The non-survivors and severe COVID-19 patients have elevated serum AST levels than the survivors and non-severe COVID-19 patients.

Proper attention to the growth of heifers is paramount to producing heifers that achieve adequate stature and body weight before first breeding and calving. Timely entry of heifers into the milking herd by 2 years of age, or their first eligible calving season in seasonal pasture-based dairy enterprises, can be facilitated by applying synchronization of estrus and ovulation in addition to traditional detection of estrus by visual or other means. Because fertility is better in heifers than in lactating cows, artificial insemination of heifers with semen from the best available progeny-tested bulls is a wise investment to ensure genetic gain of economically important traits. Annual culling rates of 25C33% necessitate a supply of herd replacement heifers. Application of gender-biased semen to produce more female offspring is also warranted for increasing the replacement population. The main goal of a heifer replacement program is to develop heifers at minimal cost and in a timely manner to obtain heifers of desired size and body weight so that they attain puberty, establish pregnancy, calve easily, and achieve their maximum genetic lifetime milk production as cows.","output":"Replacement Management in Cattle | Breeding Standards and Pregnancy Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multilingualism refers to the high degree of proficiency in two or more languages in the written and oral communication modes.

This system is needed to achieve early detection of such emergencies. Furthermore, such health awareness system should be capable of predicting the outbreaks patterns to facilitate future countermeasure planning. This health awareness system should cover large scale regions that can be extended to multiple countries, continents and ultimately the globe. Many advanced and industrial countries are still struggling in building such system effectively even with the availability of resources and domain experts. The realization of a reliable health awareness system is accompanied with multiple challenges such as the availability of resources and experts, the global agreements about the system from the legislative and control point of view and the availability of the infrastructure that will support the system functionality with a reasonable cost. This paper presents a novel global health awareness system that overcomes the aforementioned challenges. The system is exploiting the emerging cloud computing services availability over the globe. To handle the large scale requirements, we introduce a multi-tier based cloud system that spans over four tiers starting from the monitored subjects to a centralized global cloud system. Also, we present a mixed integer optimization formulation to tackle the issues related to the latency of detecting outbreaks.

The chimney graft (CG) technique may be the only option for urgent high-risk patients who are unfit for open repair and have no adequate sealing zone. This single-center experience provides long-term results of CGs with endovascular repair for urgent and complex aortic lesions. METHODS Between July 2006 and October 2012, 51 patients (16 women) with a median age of 77 years (interquartile range, 72-81 years), were treated urgently (within 24 hours [61%]) or semiurgently (within 3 days [39%]) with endovascular aortic repair and visceral CGs (n = 73). Median follow-up was 2.3 years (interquartile range, 0.8-5.0 years) for the whole cohort, 3 years for 30-day survivors, and 4.8 years for patients who are still alive. RESULTS Five patients (10%) died within 30 days. All of them had a sacrificed kidney. All-cause mortality was 57% (n = 29), but the chimney- and procedure-related mortality was 6% (n = 3) and 16% (n = 8), respectively. Chimney-related death was due to bleeding, infection, renal failure, and multiple organ failure. There were two postoperative ruptures; both were fatal although not related to the treated disease. The primary and secondary long-term CG patencies were 89% (65 of 73) and 93% (68 of 73), respectively. Primary type I endoleak (EL-I) occurred in 10% (5 of 51) of the patients, and only one patient had recurrent EL-I (2%; 1 of 51). No secondary endoleak was observed. Chimney-related reintervention was required in 16% (8 of 51) of the patients because of EL-I (n = 3), visceral ischemia (n = 4), and bleeding (n = 2). The reinterventions included stenting (n = 5), embolization (n = 3), and laparotomy (n = 2). Thirty-one visceral branches were sacrificed (9 celiac trunks, 9 right, and 13 left renal arteries). Among the 30-day survivors, 8 of 17 patients (47%) with a sacrificed kidney required permanent dialysis; of these, seven underwent an urgent index operation. The aneurysm sac shrank in 63% (29 of 46) of cases. CONCLUSIONS The 6% chimney-related mortality and 93% long-term patency seem promising in urgent, complex aortic lesions of a high-risk population and may justify a continued yet restrictive applicability of this technique. Most endoleaks could be sealed endovascularly. However, sacrifice of a kidney in this elderly cohort was associated with permanent dialysis in 47% of patients.","output":"Outcome of visceral chimney grafts after urgent endovascular repair of complex aortic lesions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM-Rad3-related (ATR) are apical kinases that orchestrate the multifaceted DNA damage response (DDR) to a variety of genotoxic insults and regulate genomic stability. Whether RNA virus also manipulates the hosts DDR machine to facilitate replication is largely unknown. In this study, we revealed that single-stranded RNA virus replication specifically elicits host ATM- and ATR-mediated pathway activation and boosts their expression. The activated ATM and ATR are hijacked to the virus replication factory in the cytoplasm and facilitate viral gene expression and replication. Specific inhibitors targeting ATM and ATR strikingly block the viral proliferation and replication and inhibit expression of virus proteins. Our results reveal a novel, or otherwise noncanonical, conserved function of ATM/ATR outside DDR in promoting the replication of single-stranded RNA virus and provide an important mechanism of hostCpathogen interactions.

It is shown that Remdesivir, a nucleoside drug that was originally invented for the Ebola virus, is effective in suppressing the replication of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. Similarly, Galidesivir, Favipiravir, Ribavirin, N4-hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931), and EIDD-2801 (a prodrug of EIDD-1931) were also found to be effective against COVID-19. However, the mechanisms of action of these drugs are not yet fully understood. For example, in some experimental studies, these drugs were proposed to act as a RNA-chain terminator, while in other studies, these were proposed to induce base-pair mutations above the error catastrophe limit to stall the replication of the viral RNA. To understand the mutagenic effects of these drugs, the role of different tautomers in their base-pairing abilities is studied here in detail by employing a reliable dispersion-corrected density functional theoretic method. It is found that Remdesivir and Galidesivir can adopt both amino and imino tautomeric conformations to base-pair with RNA bases. While the insertions of G and U are preferred against the amino tautomers of these drugs, the insertion of C is mainly possible against the imino tautomers. However, although Favipiravir and Ribavirin can make stable base pair interactions by using their keto and enol tautomers, the formation of the latter pairs would be less probable due to the endothermic nature of the products. Interestingly, the insertions of all of the RNA bases are found to be possible against the keto tautomer of Favipiravir, while the keto tautomer of Ribavirin has a clear preference for G. Remarkably, due to the negligible difference in the stability of EIDD-2801 and EIDD-1931, these tautomers would coexist in the biological environment. The insertion of G is found to be preferred against EIDD-1931 and the incorporations of U, A, and G are preferred opposite EIDD-2801. These findings suggest that base-pair mutations are the main causes of the antiviral properties of these drugs.","output":"Role of different tautomers in the base-pairing abilities of some of the vital antiviral drugs used against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We tracked aggregate midazolam and morphine bolus doses per patient as our metric.

Amplification of viral RNA by (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the current gold standard test for confirmation of infection, although it presents known shortcomings: long turnaround times (3-4 hours to generate results), potential shortage of reagents, false-negative rates as large as 15-20%, the need for certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained personnel. Thus there is a need for alternative, faster, less expensive and more accessible tests. We developed two machine learning classification models using hematochemical values from routine blood exams (namely: white blood cells counts, and the platelets, CRP, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, LDH plasma levels) drawn from 279 patients who, after being admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) emergency-room with COVID-19 symptoms, were screened with the rRT-PCR test performed on respiratory tract specimens. Of these patients, 177 resulted positive, whereas 102 received a negative response.

Cannabis product types were defined (by relative tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and cannabidiol [CBD] content) and respondents were asked to reference product labels. Questions focused on use patterns and subjective effects on 36 predefined symptoms (rated -2-markedly worse to +2-markedly better). Results: 1,881 people with PD responded (58.5% men; mean age 66.5; 50.5% <3 years of PD). 73.0% of respondents reported medicinal use, though 30.8% did not inform their doctor. 86.7% knew their type of cannabis product: 54.6% took higher CBD, 30.2% higher THC, and 15.2% took similar amounts of THC and CBD products.

This study updates data on anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD) binding antibodies (bAb) and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) levels in individuals with homologous vaccination 3-4 months after receiving the booster dose. METHODS Fifty-five healthcare workers (HCW) from Padova University-Hospital were asked to collect serum samples for determining antibodies (Ab) at 12 (t12) and 28 (t28) days, at 6 months (t6m) after their first Comirnaty/BNT162b2 inoculation, and 3-4 months after receiving the 3rd homologous booster dose. HCW were monitored weekly for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ab titers were measured by two chemiluminescent immunoassays, one targeting the S-RBD immunoglobulin G (IgG), and one surrogate viral neutralization test (sVNT), measuring NAb. RESULTS Twenty of the HCW had natural COVID-19 infection (COVID+) at different times, before either the first or the second vaccination. Median S-RBD IgG and NAb levels and their interquartile ranges 3-4 months after the 3rd dose were 1,076 (529-3,409) kBAU/L and 15.8 (11.3-38.3) mg/L, respectively, for COVID-, and 1,373 (700-1,373) kBAU/L and 21 (12.8-53.9) mg/L, respectively, for COVID+.

The pooled estimate of sensitivity for CT was 0.95 (95% CI C 0.88-0.98) and specificity was 0.31 (95% CI C 0.035-0.84). It was found that specificity of initial RT-PCR(100%) was higher than CT(31%). With respect to sensitivity, CT(95%) was superior to RT-PCR(91%) p (0.000) CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity of CT is significantly higher than RT-PCR for detecting COVID-19 infection, however as CT findings are not specific. Since CT scans are readily available, protocols can be developed to utilise it to minimalize delay in planning surgery.","output":"147 A Meta-Analysis Comparing the Diagnostic Accuracy of Initial RT-PCR And CT Scan in Suspected COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Existing collaborations among public health practitioners, veterinarians, and ecologists do not sufficiently consider illegal wildlife trade in their surveillance, biosafety, and security (SB&S) efforts even though the risks to health and biodiversity from these threats are significant We highlight multiple cases to illustrate the risks posed by existing gaps in understanding the intersectionality of the illegal wildlife trade and zoonotic disease transmission We argue for more integrative science in support of decision-making using the One Health approach Opportunities abound to apply transdisciplinary science to sustainable wildlife trade policy and programming, such as combining on-the-ground monitoring of health, environmental, and social conditions with an understanding of the operational and spatial dynamics of illicit wildlife trade We advocate for (1) a surveillance sample management system for enhanced diagnostic efficiency in collaboration with diverse and local partners that can help establish new or link existing surveillance networks, outbreak analysis, and risk mitigation strategies;(2) novel analytical tools and decision support models that can enhance self-directed local livelihoods by addressing monitoring, detection, prevention, interdiction, and remediation;(3) enhanced capacity to promote joint SB&S efforts that can encourage improved human and animal health, timely reporting, emerging disease detection, and outbreak response;and, (4) enhanced monitoring of illicit wildlife trade and supply chains across the heterogeneous context within which they occur By integrating more diverse scientific disciplines, and their respective scientists with indigenous people and local community insight and risk assessment data, we can help promote a more sustainable and equitable wildlife trade ?

At present, data are conflicting, with no consensus on whether exercise performance is affected by MC phase. OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of the MC on exercise performance and provide evidence-based, practical, performance recommendations to eumenorrheic women. METHODS This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Four databases were searched for published experimental studies that investigated the effects of the MC on exercise performance, which included at least one outcome measure taken in two or more defined MC phases. All data were meta-analysed using multilevel models grounded in Bayesian principles. The initial meta-analysis pooled pairwise effect sizes comparing exercise performance during the early follicular phase with all other phases (late follicular, ovulation, early luteal, mid-luteal and late luteal) amalgamated. A more comprehensive analysis was then conducted, comparing exercise performance between all phases with direct and indirect pairwise effect sizes through a network meta-analysis. Results from the network meta-analysis were summarised by calculating the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking curve (SUCRA). Study quality was assessed using a modified Downs and Black checklist and a strategy based on the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. RESULTS Of the 78 included studies, data from 51 studies were eligible for inclusion in the initial pairwise meta-analysis. The three-level hierarchical model indicated a trivial effect for both endurance- and strength-based outcomes, with reduced exercise performance observed in the early follicular phase of the MC, based on the median pooled effect size (ES0.5 = - 0.06 [95% credible interval (CrI): - 0.16 to 0.04]). Seventy-three studies had enough data to be included in the network meta-analysis. The largest effect was identified between the early follicular and the late follicular phases of the MC (ES0.5 = - 0.14 [95% CrI: - 0.26 to - 0.03]). The lowest SUCRA value, which represents the likelihood that exercise performance is poor, or among the poorest, relative to other MC phases, was obtained for the early follicular phase (30%), with values for all other phases ranging between 53 and 55%. The quality of evidence for this review was classified as \\"low\\" (42%). CONCLUSION The results from this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that exercise performance might be trivially reduced during the early follicular phase of the MC, compared to all other phases. Due to the trivial effect size, the large between-study variation and the number of poor-quality studies included in this review, general guidelines on exercise performance across the MC cannot be formed; rather, it is recommended that a personalised approach should be taken based on each individual's response to exercise performance across the MC.","output":"The Effects of Menstrual Cycle Phase on Exercise Performance in Eumenorrheic Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brains are indispensable drivers of human progress.

Death due to COVID-19 shows a steep rise in relation to age. Comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, and cardiovascular disease also increase susceptibility. It has been reported that T-cell regulatory dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; cluster of differentiation 26 (CD26)) binds to the external spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 as a receptor, for the viral entry into the host cell. CD26 is expressed on many cells, including T and natural killer (NK) cells of the immune system, as a membrane-anchored form. A soluble form (sCD26) is also found in the blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Approach and results: To investigate a possible relationship between sCD26 levels, age and pathology, serum samples were collected from control, T2DM and age-related dementia (ARD) subjects. A significant reduction in serum sCD26 levels was seen in relation to age. ARD and T2DM were also associated with lower levels of sCD26. The analysis of blood smears revealed different cellular morphologies: in controls, CD26 was expressed around the neutrophil membrane, whereas in T2DM, excessive sCD26 was found around the mononucleated cells (MNCs). ARD subjects had abnormal fragmented platelets and haemolysis due to low levels of sCD26. Conclusions: These findings may help to explain the heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. High serum sCD26 levels could protect from viral infection by competively inhibiting the virus binding to cellular CD26, whereas low sCD26 levels could increase the risk of infection. If so measuring serum sCD26 level may help to identify individuals at high risk for the COVID-19 infection.","output":"Investigation of CD26, a potential SARS-CoV-2 receptor, as a biomarker of age and pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) confronts policy makers with the problem of measuring the effectiveness of containment strategies, balancing public health considerations with the economic costs of social distancing measures.

An analytic solution is presented. The model reproduces official COVID-19 cases counts of a large number of regions and countries that surpassed the first peak of the outbreak. A single unbiased feedback parameter is extracted from field data and used to formulate an index that measures the efficiency of containment strategies (the CEI index). CEI values for a range of countries are given. For two variants of the controlled-SIR model, detailed estimates of the total medical and socio-economic costs are evaluated over the entire course of the epidemic. Costs comprise medical care cost, the economic cost of social distancing, as well as the economic value of lives saved. Under plausible parameters, strict measures fare better than a hands-off policy.

Increase public awareness of stroke warning signs may help to activate emergency medical services and reduce prehospital delay. Our objectives were to survey the recognition of stroke warning signs among residents of Yuzhong District in Chongqing, China, and determine the proportion of these residents who would make an emergency call (120, in China) if suddenly faced with unexpected stroke warning signs and analyze the relationship between recognition of stroke warning signs and the response of calling for emergency assistance. METHODS In 2011, a population-based face-to-face interview survey using a multistage sampling method was conducted in Yuzhong District, Chongqing. We assessed residents' recognition of stroke warning signs and the proportion of those who would call the emergency number, 120, if suddenly encountering unexpected stroke warning signs. The association between the knowledge of stroke warning signs and activation of 120 was examined. RESULTS A total of 1101 participants completed the questionnaire. Only 15.6% of respondents knew all 5 stroke warning signs; 17.6% reported that they would call 120 for all 5 stroke warning signs. Recognition of stroke warning signs was associated with the response of calling 120 (odds ratios, 1.92-3.34). Even among those who knew all 5 warning signs of stroke, only 35.5% (95% confidence interval, 28.3-42.6) would call 120 for all 5 signs.

Most caregivers reported mild to moderate burden, all reported either normal or high resilience levels, and types of social support were similar. However, interviews and survey findings were not always consistent. Major themes that emerged from the analysis included (1) advocating for and protecting their loved one, (2) coping with caregiving, (3) uncertain future, (4) rewards of caregiving, and (5) need to optimize communication with family.

Methods: This was a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study conducted in a population of patients infected with 2019-nCoV in Cameroon. Patients receiving corticosteroids irrespective of the route of administration within 3 months prior to recruitment and those with any hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis disease were excluded. We reviewed the medical records of patients to collect socio-demographic and clinical data. Patients were then sampled at 8 am for serum cortisol assay by the competitive ELISA method. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's test to compare means. The significance level was set at p<0.05. Results: : We included 80 covid+ patients, predominantly males (45, 56.3%) with a mean age of 4313 years. The co-morbidities found were hypertension (9, 11.3%), diabetes mellitus (7, 8.8%), cardiovascular disease (8, 10%) and obesity (4, 5%). The most common symptoms were asthenia (44, 55%), fever (36, 45%) and respiratory symptoms (75, 93.7%). The non-severe form was the most common (70, 87.5%).

Further issues remain to be clarified, including whether the genotype of rabbit HEV differs from human and swine HEV genotype 3 and whether rabbit HEV can infect human and other animals. HEV was found in farmed rabbits in several geographic areas of China, in USA and more recently in France. The prevalence of antibodies against HEV was 36%, 57% and 55% in rabbits from Virginia (USA), Gansu Province and Beijing (China), respectively. HEV RNA was detected in 16.5% of serum samples from farmed rabbits in Virginia, 7.5% in Gansu Province and 7.0% in Beijing. HEV RNA was detected in 7% of bile samples from farmed rabbits and in 23% of liver samples from wild rabbits in France. The full-length genomic sequences analysis indicates that all the rabbit strains belong to the same clade. Nucleotide sequences were 72.2C78.2% identical to HEV genotypes 1C4. Comparison with HEV sequences of human strains circulating in France and reference sequences identified a human strain closely related to rabbit HEV. A 93-nucleotide insertion in the X domain of the ORF1 of the human strain and in all the rabbit HEV strains was found.

Topographical information for the plasma-treated pNIPAAM coatings obtained by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements evidenced a more compact surface for Ar treatment due to combined etching and redeposition, while for oxygen, a clear increase of pores diameter is noticed. The chemical surface composition as determined by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy showed the specific modifications induced by plasma treatment, namely strong oxidation for oxygen plasma treatment illustrated by eight times increase of O-C=O contribution and respectively an increase of C-N/O=C-N bonds in the case of ammonia plasma treatment. Structural information provided by FTIR spectroscopy reveals a significant increase of the carboxylic group upon argon and mostly oxygen plasma treatment and the increase in width and intensity of the amide-related groups for the ammonia plasma treatment. The biological investigations evidenced that L929 fibroblast cells viability is increased by 25% upon plasma treatment, while the cell attachment is up to 2.8 times higher for the oxygen plasma-treated surface compared to the initial spin-coated pNIPAAM. Moreover, the cell detachment process proved to be up to 2-3 times faster for the oxygen and argon plasma-treated surfaces and up to 1.5 times faster for the ammonia-treated surface. These results show the versatility of plasma treatment for inducing beneficial chemical modifications of pNIPAAM surfaces that allows the tuning of cellular response for improving the attachment-detachment process in view of tissue engineering.","output":"Chemistry-Induced Effects on Cell Behavior upon Plasma Treatment of pNIPAAM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic brought about an abrupt transition from face-to-face to online learning, which caught higher education institutions off guard. Universities had to scramble for solutions to ensure that learning was not disrupted and there was adequate technological infrastructure to conduct classes online;that academics were capacitated to conduct virtual teaching and that students had access to the necessary technology and internet connectivity. To understand this move, this study explored student teachers' experiences of the emergency transition to online learning during the COVID-19 lockdown at a South African university. The study was underpinned by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and adopted a qualitative research design, generating data from ten fourth-year student teachers using a Zoom focus group discussion and analysing the data using an inductive thematic framework. The discussion focused on the students' views on digital equity and access to technology;the teaching and learning modalities they were exposed to;their proficiency with the technology and training received;assessment as well as views on the learning management system (LMS, which is Moodle in this case). The study found that among the issues that universities had to deal with were the digital divide;constrained pedagogical approaches;inadequate proficiency in the use of the learning management system;the fact that the quality and integrity of assessment were somewhat compromised as well as students' unfavourable living conditions which make learning from home difficult. ? 2021 University of Pretoria.

Commonly, the metadata of the given documents and the hierarchy of the labels are available in real-world applications. However, most existing studies focus on only modeling the text information, with a few attempts to utilize either metadata or hierarchy signals, but not both of them. In this paper, we bridge the gap by formalizing the problem of metadata-aware text classification in a large label hierarchy (e.g., with tens of thousands of labels). To address this problem, we present the MATCH solution -- an end-to-end framework that leverages both metadata and hierarchy information. To incorporate metadata, we pre-train the embeddings of text and metadata in the same space and also leverage the fully-connected attentions to capture the interrelations between them. To leverage the label hierarchy, we propose different ways to regularize the parameters and output probability of each child label by its parents. Extensive experiments on two massive text datasets with large-scale label hierarchies demonstrate the effectiveness of MATCH over state-of-the-art deep learning baselines.","output":"MATCH: Metadata-Aware Text Classification in A Large Hierarchy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We aimed to examine the impacts of digital healthy diet literacy (DDL) and healthy eating behaviors (HES) on fear of COVID-19, changes in mental health, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among front-line healthcare workers (HCWs).

It seems that the two strategies should be similar, since shortening the interaction time between susceptible and infected individuals somehow increases the chances for contact between susceptible individuals.

Cells infected with MVA/Sor MVA/S-HA synthesized a 200-kDa protein, which was recognized by antibody raised against a synthetic peptide of SARS-CoV S or the epitope tag in Western blot analyses. Further studies indicated that S was N-glycosylated and migrated in SDS polyacrylamide gels with an apparent mass of approximately 160 kDa after treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F. The acquisition of resistance to endoglycosidase H indicated trafficking of S to the medial Golgi compartment, and confocal microscopy showed that S was transported to the cell surface. Intranasal or intramuscular inoculations of BALB/c mice with MVA/S produced serum antibodies that recognized the SARS S in ELISA and neutralized SARS-CoV in vitro.

The shortest adult profile, PROMIS-29, looks set to replace existing short-form instruments in research and clinical practice. The objective of this study was to undertake the first psychometric evaluation of the Norwegian PROMIS-29, following a postal survey of a random sample of 12,790 Norwegians identified through the National Registry of the Norwegian Tax Administration. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess structural validity. Fit to the Rasch partial credit model and differential item functioning (DIF) were assessed in relation to age, gender, and education. PROMIS-29 scores were compared to those for the EQ-5D-5L and the Self-assessed Comorbidity Questionnaire (SCQ), for purposes of assessing validity based on a priori hypotheses. RESULTS: There were 3200 (25.9%) respondents with a mean age (SD) of 51 (20.7, range 18 to 97 years) and 55% were female. The PROMIS-29 showed satisfactory structural validity and acceptable fit to Rasch model including unidimensionality, and measurement invariance across age and education levels. One pain interference item had uniform DIF for gender but splitting gave satisfactory fit. Domain reliability estimates ranged from 0.85 to 0.95. Correlations between PROMIS-29 domain, SCQ and EQ-5D scores were largely as expected, the largest being for scores assessing very similar aspects of health. CONCLUSIONS: The Norwegian version of the PROMIS-29 is a reliable and valid generic self-reported measure of health in the Norwegian general population.

For each country, the SIR models fitting cumulative infective case data within 5% error are analyzed. It is observed that the basic reproduction number and the mean duration of the infectious period can be estimated only in cases where the spread of the epidemic is over (for China and South Korea in the present case). Nevertheless, it is shown that the timing of the maximum and timings of the inflection points of the proportion of infected individuals can be robustly estimated from the normalized data. The validation of the estimates by comparing the predictions with actual data has shown that the predictions were realized for all countries except USA, as long as lock-down measures were retained.","output":"What Can We Estimate From Fatality and Infectious Case Data Using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) Model?

For employees with high job-insecurity, their job continuity in the future is threatened. Thus, they may not be willing to take risks to do additional work that is future-oriented. To our knowledge, the effect of job insecurity on employees taking charge has rarely been studied. As a result, the purpose of our study is to investigate whether, how, and when job insecurity will influence taking charge. Drawing on the conservation of resources theory and proactive motivation model, we develop a theoretical model. Moreover, we employed a multi-wave and multi-source survey to test our predictions. Based on the data from 194 full-time employees paired with their direct supervisors, the results provided consistent support for the proposed hypotheses. Specifically, the results indicate that job insecurity prohibits employees taking charge behaviors through deteriorating their work engagement. Furthermore, employees perception of interactional justice moderates the negative influence of job insecurity on their work engagement and, consequently, their taking charge behaviors.

Although I have endeavored to cover all aspects of structural virology and to acknowledge relevant individuals, I know that I have favored taking examples from my own experience in telling this story. I am anxious to apologize to all those who I might have unintentionally offended by omitting their work. The first knowledge of virus structure was a result of Stanley's studies of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and the subsequent X-ray fiber diffraction analysis by Bernal and Fankuchen in the 1930s. At about the same time it became apparent that crystals of small RNA plant and animal viruses could diffract X-rays, demonstrating that viruses must have distinct and unique structures. More advances were made in the 1950s with the realization by Watson and Crick that viruses might have icosahedral symmetry. With the improvement of experimental and computational techniques in the 1970s, it became possible to determine the three-dimensional, near-atomic resolution structures of some small icosahedral plant and animal RNA viruses. It was a great surprise that the protecting capsids of the first virus structures to be determined had the same architecture. The capsid proteins of these viruses all had a 'jelly-roll' fold and, furthermore, the organization of the capsid protein in the virus were similar, suggesting a common ancestral virus from which many of today's viruses have evolved. By this time a more detailed structure of TMV had also been established, but both the architecture and capsid protein fold were quite different to that of the icosahedral viruses. The small icosahedral RNA virus structures were also informative of how and where cellular receptors, anti-viral compounds, and neutralizing antibodies bound to these viruses. However, larger lipid membrane enveloped viruses did not form sufficiently ordered crystals to obtain good X-ray diffraction. Starting in the 1990s, these enveloped viruses were studied by combining cryo-electron microscopy of the whole virus with X-ray crystallography of their protein components. These structures gave information on virus assembly, virus neutralization by antibodies, and virus fusion with and entry into the host cell. The same techniques were also employed in the study of complex bacteriophages that were too large to crystallize. Nevertheless, there still remained many pleomorphic, highly pathogenic viruses that lacked the icosahedral symmetry and homogeneity that had made the earlier structural investigations possible. Currently some of these viruses are starting to be studied by combining X-ray crystallography with cryo-electron tomography.","output":"Structure of viruses: a short history."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to COVID\\\\19, diagnostic delays and a surge of advanced head and neck cancer (HNC) is anticipated.

Pleural cultures obtained grew Candida albicans, which was initially thought to be a possible contaminant;however repeat pleural cultures continued to exhibit C. albicans as did a sputum culture. His WBC count and CRP continued to elevate despite pleural drainage and antibiotics, and he was transferred for a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) evaluation. Fluconazole was initiated. Patient had clinical improvement with fluconazole and continued chest tube drainage, so he did not undergo VATS. He was discharged on oral antimicrobials and apixaban. DISCUSSION: This is the first described case of fungal empyema secondary to COVID-19. Fungal empyema represents less than <1% pleural infections with C. albicans being the most common pathogen. Overall mortality is as high as 73%, and most patients are critically ill. Patients should have prompt chest tube drainage, and in cases of failure with rising CRP or persistent sepsis, early thoracic surgery consultation is appropriate as evidenced by two small studies (n=20 and 70) where early VATS vs. chest tube resulted in decreased hospital stay and rates of treatment failure. CONCLUSION(S): Clinicians should consider fungal empyema in recovered COVID-19 patients presenting with a complicated pleural space. Chest tube drainage and IV antifungal coverage are effective initial therapies along with early evaluation for possible VATS. Reference #1: Davies HE, Davies RJO, Davies CWH.

STUDY DESIGN Thirteen patients with cervical myoma were treated by LAVH combined with temporary endovascular balloon occlusion of the bilateral internal iliac arteries from September 2008 to October 2010. Preoperative evaluation of cervical myoma was made by ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional computerized tomographic angiography, and curative management was made by LAVH combined with temporary endovascular balloon occlusion of the bilateral internal iliac arteries. RESULTS Nine patients with extracervical myoma and 4 patients with intracervical myoma were successfully managed by LAVH combined with temporary endovascular balloon occlusion of the bilateral internal iliac arteries. For extracervical myomas, the median extirpated uterine weight was 591 g (range 360-1010 g). Median duration required for placement of balloon occlusion catheter was 60 min (range 47-69 min). Median surgical duration was 98.5 min (range 77-149 min). Median duration of endovascular balloon occlusion of the bilateral internal iliac arteries was 66 min (range 42-98 min). The median estimated blood loss was 355 mL (range 50-1950 mL). For intracervical myomas, the median extirpated uterine weight was 513 g (range 302-710 g). Median duration required for placement of balloon occlusion catheter was 63 min (range 42-76 min). Median surgical duration was 96.5 min (range 92-100 min). Median duration of endovascular balloon occlusion of the bilateral internal iliac arteries was 49 min (range 44-60 min). The median estimated blood loss was 210 mL (range 150-650 mL). Transfusion of preoperatively donated autologous blood negated the need for bank blood. There were no major interventional radiological and surgical complications in the present case series.

PURPOSE: to provide an updated view regarding the early experience obtained from the management of KTRs with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A narrative review was conducted using PubMed database to identify relevant articles written in English/Spanish, and published through May 15, 2020. Search terms included: \\"coronavirus\\", \\"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"COVID-19\\", \\"COVID\\", \\"renal transplantation\\", and \\"kidney transplantation\\". Case series were considered eligible, and case reports excluded. Thirty-four articles were included in the review. RESULTS: KTRs should be considered immunocompromised hosts: potential risk for infection, non-negligible comorbidity, and exposure to long-term immunosuppression. Only single center small retrospective experiences are still available regarding KTRs with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in KTRs are similar to that observed for the general population, being fever and cough the most frequently observed. Mild-to-moderate symptomatic KTRs can be managed in an outpatient setting, while patients exhibiting severe symptoms must be addmited to hospital. More rapid clinical progression, and higher complication and death rates have been observed for hospitalized KTRs, requiring hemodyalisis or ventilatory support. Lymphopenia, elevated serum markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, IL-6, D-dimer), and chest-X-ray findings consistent with pneumonia are linked to worse prognosis. A number of antiviral therapies have been used. However, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions regarding their efficacy at this point. Baseline immunosupression regimen should be adjusted in a case-by-case manner. However, it poses a significant challenge.","output":"Early experience with COVID-19 in kidney transplantation recipients: update and review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused nations to adopt unprecedented control measures in order to curb its spread. As the first nation to respond, China's aggressive control measures appeared to have been effective in suppressing the first wave and keeping new cases under control. Here, we provide the historical context and details of China's public health response to COVID-19. We highlight the lessons and impact of the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, which demonstrated the importance of transparency, surveillance and testing laboratories during an outbreak. We provide an overview of China's response strategy that was based on the principles of early detection, isolation, management and treatment and involved not only the large-scale coordination of multiple governmental bodies but also grass-root community participation throughout the country. These community-based organizations conducted active surveillance for febrile cases and provided support for those in quarantine and communities in lockdown. Importantly, these broader measures were supported by digital technology, including the extensive use of internet-based platforms and mobile applications (APPs). While there have been no significant increases in case numbers since April, there is still much concern over a second wave, considering the resumption of work and school, the lifting of travel restrictions and the outbreaks occurring globally. Control measures has since been implemented by provincial authorities, which includes continued surveillance and rapid testing. Although China's strict control measures may not suit every nation, the principles of early detection and isolation continue to hold true and have been a cornerstone of the initial and ongoing response to the COVID-19.","output":"The public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China: a narrative review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A duplex TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay was developed for the detection of California (CAL) serogroup viruses and Cache Valley virus (CVV), for use in human surveillance.

In the UK, the COVID19-Psychological Research Consortium Study (C19PRC) launched to evaluate the psychological impact of COVID-19 in the general population and its implications. The project was then extended to Italy and several other countries. This article provides an overview of the Italian C19PRC study and its replication of two specific findings from the UK C19PRC. In the first part, the relationship between anxiety and somatic symptomatology is examined. In the second part, we analyze the association between several factors and psychological health outcomes: depression/anxiety, traumatic stress, COVID-19 anxiety. In line with the study conducted in the UK, an online survey was administered to the adult Italian general population. The sample included 1038 respondents (age, mean = 49.94, SD = 16.14, 51.15% females) taken from four regions: Lombardia, Veneto, Lazio, and Campania. The relationship between predictors and outcomes was evaluated by means of logistic regression models. Somatic indices showed a positive association with anxiety, worse somatic symptoms were associated with mourning a loss of a beloved one due to COVID-19 and with precarious health conditions. Females showed a higher incidence of psychological issues. No differences in anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress were found across regions but the Campania region showed the most severe somatic symptomatology. In the second analysis, the factors associated with more severe psychological outcomes (i.e., anxiety and/or depression, traumatic stress, and COVID-19 related anxiety) were younger age, the presence of minors in the household, traumatic stressors, and precarious health conditions. No differences across regions emerged. The Italian results correspond to the UK findings for anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress. Both in the UK and Italy, the factors associated with worse psychological health were gender (female), younger age, having children, pre-existing health issues (both for oneself or someone close), and the moderate/high perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 within one month. In Italy, unlike the UK, lower household income and having (had) COVID-19 were not associated with poorer mental health. The psychological impact of COVID-19 can last for months; future research should explore all aspects of the psychological burden of COVID-19 in order to implement psychological interventions and promote psychological health.","output":"The Italian COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (IT C19PRC): General Overview and Replication of the UK Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown is a situation associating social and physical isolation, limited care access, psychological stress, and potential adoption of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours such as smoking. In a cohort of outpatients with chronic cardiac diseases, including congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic coronary syndromes (CCS), we aimed to evaluate the impact of Covid-19 outbreak on tobacco consumption. Patients and methods During the 6th week of lockdown (which had started on March, 17th), 150 randomly selected CHF patients (from the Dijon HF-Clinic) and 250 CCS patients from the RICO survey were invited to answer an anonymous questionnaire. The 20-min lasting phone interview was conducted by 8 trained research assistants. The questionnaire, which was validated through internal and external control procedures, addressed medical, lifestyle topics and psychological distress through Kessler 6 score (K6) 5. Results Among the 400 patients, 325 were responders (81.2%), including 201 CCS and 124 CHF. Among the current smokers (n =43), 13 (30.3%) declared increased tobacco consumption, including one woman who started smoking during the lockdown and one man who relapsed after quitting. The main reported explanations for increased smoking was stress (7) and inactivity (5); none declared the influence of media messages on a potential protective effect of nicotine as a cause of increase. Main results are summarized in Table 1. Conclusion During COVID-19 lockdown, a significant rate of cardiac patients has increased their tobacco consumption, which is often associated with psychological distress and other deleterious lifestyle behaviours, in particular in men. These alarming findings may have major implications for disease destabilization and event recurrence in such high-risk patients at both short and long term. This may help to define preventive strategies to target after lockdown relief in chronic cardiac populations.","output":"Alarming increased rate of smoking and associated lifestyle behaviours in patients with chronic cardiac diseases during COVID-19 pandemic related lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ceci dit, pour qu'un.e enseignant.e puisse entrer dans l'un de ces groupes pour surveiller, encourager la participation et vrifier que l'activit se droule comme il faut, on doit souvent attendre une vingtaine de secondes (ou plus) pour chaque dplacement virtuel.

This study aims to evaluate the inhibitory efficiency of the organic acids and phenolic compounds present in Brassica oleracea (Tronchuda Cabbage) against spike glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2. Thirty-seven phytocompounds are screened on the basis of their molecular weight (<500 g/mol) and 14 ligands are docked using Autodock Vina and Autodock4 (version 4.2.6). The stability of the top five docked complexes was analyzed using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. ADMET analysis is performed for the top five compounds and their targets are identified using SwissTargetPrediction. Phytoactives from B. oleracea namely Astragalin, 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid, 4-p-coumaroylquinic acid and sinapoyl-D-glucoside showed high binding affinities and free energy of binding during molecular docking and MD simulation studies ( 8.5C9.0 kcal/mol) for the spike glycoprotein trimer of SARS-CoV2. The ADMET analysis revealed that these phytocompounds have good solubility in the aqueous phase and that they don't penetrate the blood brain barrier. Moreover, there is no P-gp substrate inhibition, CYP1A2 inhibition, CYP2C19 inhibition, CYP2C9 inhibition, CYP2D6 inhibition and CYP3A4 inhibition observed for these compounds. Additionally, zero PAINS alerts were reported.

Several studies have reported that the microcirculation responds adequately to hypoxia in COVID-19 patients by increasing oxygen availability, in contrast to the inadequate response observed in patients with bacterial sepsis. Red blood cells (RBCs), the key cells for oxygen transport, and notably their rheology, are altered during bacterial sepsis, but few data are available in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective, non-interventional study, shape was assessed on admission (or inclusion for the volunteers) using Pearsons second coefficient of dissymmetry (PCD) on the histogram obtained with a flow cytometer technique. A null value represents a perfect spherical shape. RBC deformability was determined using ektacytometry by the elongation index in relation to the shear stress (0.3 to 50 Pa) applied to the RBC membrane. A higher elongation index indicates greater RBC deformability. Results were compared across groups. Scanning electronic microscopy was performed on RBCs from COVID-19 patients. RBC shape and deformability were also assessed on days 3 and 7 in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-nine ICU patients were included (30 with COVID-19 ARDS and 19 with bacterial sepsis). ARDS was more severe in patients with COVID-19 than in those with sepsis (PaO(2)/FiO(2) 99 [73C154] vs. 270 [239C295] mmHg p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation was more frequently required (87 vs. 21%; p < 0.001). Mortality was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients (15/30 [50%] vs. 4/19 [21%], p = 0.046). RBCs were significantly more spherical in septic patients (PCD ?0.40 [?0.56; ?0.18]) than in healthy volunteers (PCD ?0.54 [?0.66; ?0.49]) but not than in COVID-19 patients (?0.48 [?0.55; ?0.43]). In COVID-19 non-survivors (n = 11), sphericity was more marked on day 7 (PCD ?0.40 [?0.47; ?0.28]) than on day 1 (PCD vs. ?0.49 [?0.59; ?0.44]); p = 0.045. At ICU admission, RBC deformability was altered for all shear stress values studied in septic patients compared to COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers (maximum elongation index for septic patients: 0.600 [0.594C0.630] vs. 0.646 [0.637C0.653] for COVID-19 patients and 0.640 [0.635C0.650] for healthy volunteers; both p < 0.001). In the 18 COVID-19 patients studied for 7 days, RBC deformability did not change over time and was not related to outcome. At day 1, RBCs from COVID-19 patients showed a normal structure on scanning electronic microscopy. CONCLUSION: In contrast to the significantly altered shape and decreased deformability in patients with bacterial sepsis, RBCs from severely hypoxemic COVID-19 patients had normal deformability on admission, and this pattern did not change over the first week despite a more spherical shape in non-survivors. As RBCs are the key cell for oxygen transport, this maintenance of normal deformability may contribute to the adequate microcirculatory response to severe hypoxia of the microcirculation that has been observed in these patients.","output":"Red Blood Cell Shape and Deformability in Patients With COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 or coronavirus is a disease affecting the global population.

A sensitive and reliable serological diagnostic assay is required, so laboratories can effectively and quickly detect ASFV infection. The p30 protein is abundantly expressed early in cells and has excellent antigenicity. Therefore, this study aimed to produce and characterize p30 monoclonal antibodies with an ultimate goal of developing a monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for ASFV antibody detection. Three monoclonal antibodies against p30 protein that were expressed in E. coli were generated, and their characterizations were investigated. Furthermore, a blocking ELISA based on a monoclonal antibody was developed. To evaluate the performance of the assay, 186 sera samples (88 negative and 98 positive samples) were analyzed and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to determine the cutoff value. Based on the ROC analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.997 (95% confidence interval: 99.2 to 100%). Besides, a diagnostic sensitivity of 97.96% (95% confidence interval: 92.82 to 99.75%) and a specificity of 98.96% (95% confidence interval: 93.83 to 99.97%) were achieved when the cutoff value was set to 38.38%. Moreover, the coefficients of inter- and intra-batches were <10%, indicating the good repeatability of the method.

In addition, its use has been validated for methemoglobinemia and malaria treatment. In this study, we first evaluated the virucidal activity of methylene blue against Influenza Virus H1N1 upon different incubation times and in the presence or absence of light activation, and then against SARS-CoV-2. We further assessed the therapeutic activity of methylene blue by administering it to cells previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we examined the effect of co-administration of the drug together with immune serum. Our findings reveal that methylene blue displays virucidal preventive or therapeutic activity against Influenza Virus H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and in the absence of UV activation. We also confirm that MB antiviral activity is based on several mechanisms of action as the degradation of genomic RNA is only observed in the presence of light and after long exposure.

For biomaterials in bone reconstruction, the promotion of osteogenic differentiation and reduction of inflammation are desirable. Fibrillar coatings are interesting because of fibrils' high surface area-volume ratio, aiding adsorption and adhesion. Fibrils also serve as a matrix for the immobilization of biomolecules with biological activity, such as the phenolic compound phloroglucinol (PG), the subunit of marine polyphenols. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of PG coatings on fibroblast- and osteoblast-like cells to increase the osseointegration of titanium implants. Collagen fibril coatings, containing PG at low and high concentrations, were produced on titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) scaffolds generated by additive manufacturing (AM). These coatings, especially PG-enriched coatings, reduced hydrophobicity and modulated the behavior of human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 and mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 cell lines. Both osteoblastic and fibroblastic cells spread and adhered well on PG-enriched coatings. Coatings significantly reduced the inflammatory response. Moreover, osteogenic differentiation was promoted by collagen coatings with a high PG concentration. Thus, the enrichment of collagen fibril coatings with PG is a promising strategy to improve Ti6Al4V implants for bone contact in orthopedics and dentistry and is worthy of further investigation.","output":"Phenolic-Enriched Collagen Fibrillar Coatings on Titanium Alloy to Promote Osteogenic Differentiation and Reduce Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic has infected millions of people The conjunctival epithelium is easily exposed to infectious droplets and body fluids making eyes a potential route and reservoir of the infection The CD147 and ACE2 receptor has been demonstrated in ocular surface cells, which implies that these cells may facilitate as a portal of entry for transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Despite low viral load in tears and conjunctival swab, the negative RT-PCR results cannot exclude the possibility of the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in ocular secretions Pathogens might be transported by constant tear flow through the lacrimal duct system to the respiratory tract causing infection Eyes are unlikely to be the main transmission route, however, their role in the transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 cannot be overlooked Therefore, proper eye protection should be instituted while attending Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 positive individuals, especially by health professionals ?

A survey was conducted with aim to determine the digestive surgery services provided during the COVID-19 pandemic, optimize safety for patients and clinicians, and safeguard health-care services. METHODS: An online survey was conceived and circulated to members of the Indonesian Society of Digestive Surgeons. The survey was conducted in two phases, in April 2020 and July 2020, to evaluate changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Early in the pandemic (April 2020), the median number of major digestive surgeries performed monthly declined from 20 cases (range. 3-100 cases) to 1 case (range. 0-10 cases) (P < .001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Most of the cases in April 2020 addressed emergency problems, but more definitive surgeries were performed during the later period of the survey. The importance of screening for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction has increased over time, and a more comprehensive screening methodology incorporating real-time polymerase chain reaction, chest CT, and rapid antibody test were evident in 31.37% of July 2020 responses.

Many elective and nonessential surgeries were postponed worldwide in an effort to minimize spread of disease, as well as to conserve resources. Our goal with this article is to review current practice guidelines in setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on available data and literature. METHODS: Websites pertaining to surgical and medical societies, and government agencies were reviewed, along with recently published literature to identify recommendations related to COVID-19 and plastic surgery procedures. RESULTS: Clinical practice modifications are recommended during the pandemic in outpatient and perioperative settings. Use of personal protective equipment is critical for aerosol-generating procedures, such as surgery in the head and neck area. Care for trauma and malignancy should continue during the pandemic; however, definitive reconstruction could be delayed for select cases. Specific recommendations were made for surgical treatment of cancer, trauma, and semiurgent reconstructive procedures based on available data and literature. CONCLUSIONS: The risk and benefit of each reconstructive procedure should be carefully analyzed in relation to necessary patient care, minimized COVID-19 spread, protection of health care personnel, and utilization of resources. Recommendations in this article should be taken in the context of each institute's resources and prevalance of COVID-19 in the region.

Paracetamol, an antipyretic frequently employed in patients with cerebral damage, may cause hypotension. We evaluated the cerebral and hemodynamic effects of intravenous (IV) paracetamol for the control of fever in Neuro-Intensive Care Unit (NICU) patients. METHODS This is a prospective observational study in which we enrolled 32 NICU patients: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH, n = 18), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI, n = 10), Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH, n = 2) and Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS, n = 2). RESULTS The administration of paracetamol resulted in a decrease of core body temperature (Tc) (p = 0,0001), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (p = 0,0006), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) (p = 0,0033), and jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjVO2) (p = 0.0193), and in an increase of arteriojugular venous differences of oxygen (AVDO2) (p = 0.0012). The proportion of patients who had an infusion of norepinephrine increased from 47 % to 75 % (p = 0.0039 McNemar Test). When intracranial pressure (ICP) at the start of paracetamol infusion (t-0) was compared with the measurement of ICP after 2 h, a significant correlation was observed (r = 0.669, p = 0.0002). This marked and significant correlation can be explained by the fact that for the higher levels of ICP assessed at t-0 (greater than 15 mmHg), we observed a marked reduction of ICP concomitant with the decrease of Tc. No problems related to norepinephrine administration and/or increase in dosage were observed. CONCLUSION Paracetamol administration is effective but exposes patients to hypotensive episodes that must be recognized and treated expeditiously to prevent further damage to the injured brain.","output":"Intravenous paracetamol for fever control in acute brain injury patients: cerebral and hemodynamic effects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We give an elementary introduction to hyperk\\\\\\"ahler manifolds, survey some of their interesting properties and some open problems.","output":"Hyperk\\\\\\"ahler manifolds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVD-19) emerged as a pandemic in December 2019. Infection has spread quickly and renal transplant recipients receiving chronic immunosuppression have been considered a population at high risk of infection, complications and infection-related death. During this year a large amount of information from nationwide registries, multicentre and single-centre studies have been reported. The number of renal transplant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was higher than in the general population, but the lower threshold for testing may have contributed to its better identification. Major complications such as acute kidney injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome were very frequent in renal transplant patients, with a high comorbidity burden, but further studies are needed to support that organ transplant recipients receiving chronic immunosuppression are more prone to develop these complications than the general population. Kidney transplant recipients experience a high mortality rate compared with the general population, especially during the very early post-transplant period. Despite the fact that some studies report more favourable outcomes in patients with a kidney transplant than in patients on the kidney waiting list, the higher mortality described in the very early post-transplant period would advise against performing a kidney transplant in areas where the spread of infection is high, especially in recipients >60 years of age.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns have deprived people of major sources of social support and coping, with others representing threats. Hence, a major stressor during the pandemic has been a sense of social disconnection and loneliness. This study explores how peoples experience of compassion and feeling socially safe and connected, in contrast to feeling socially disconnected, lonely and fearful of compassion, effects the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on post-traumatic growth and post-traumatic stress. METHODS: Adult participants from the general population (N = 4057) across 21 countries worldwide, completed self-report measures of social connection (compassion for self, from others, for others; social safeness), social disconnection (fears of compassion for self, from others, for others; loneliness), perceived threat of COVID-19, post-traumatic growth and traumatic stress. RESULTS: Perceived threat of COVID-19 predicted increased post-traumatic growth and traumatic stress. Social connection (compassion and social safeness) predicted higher post-traumatic growth and traumatic stress, whereas social disconnection (fears of compassion and loneliness) predicted increased traumatic symptoms only. Social connection heightened the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on post-traumatic growth, while social disconnection weakened this impact. Social disconnection magnified the impact of the perceived threat of COVID-19 on traumatic stress. These effects were consistent across all countries. CONCLUSIONS: Social connection is key to how people adapt and cope with the worldwide COVID-19 crisis and may facilitate post-traumatic growth in the context of the threat experienced during the pandemic. In contrast, social disconnection increases vulnerability to develop post-traumatic stress in this threatening context. Public health and Government organizations could implement interventions to foster compassion and feelings of social safeness and reduce experiences of social disconnection, thus promoting growth, resilience and mental wellbeing during and following the pandemic.","output":"The role of social connection on the experience of COVID-19 related post-traumatic growth and stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationships between physical activity, sleep behaviors, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during the current COVID-19 pandemic in college students.

PURPOSE: To describe an approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) strategy development at a school of pharmacy aimed at stakeholder investment and infrastructure that can address systemic challenges in various healthcare settings. SUMMARY: The UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy utilized an organizational approach focused on infrastructure to produce a diverse and inclusive school community. The Office of Organizational Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) established vision and mission statements to represent the school's commitment and conducted a comprehensive environmental scan to compose a shared vision. Students, faculty, staff, and alumni participated in a series of retreats, symposiums, and focus groups to identify opportunities to cultivate a diverse and inclusive school community. A working group comprised of key leaders in the school developed and launched a 3-year DEI Strategic Plan along with initiatives and metrics for year 1. The plan's 3 priorities were (1) to recruit and retain diverse talent, (2) to prepare culturally intelligent professionals, and (3) to build an inclusive community. The ODI collaborated with internal and external stakeholders, which included students, faculty, staff, postdocs, alumni, and partners from health systems, industry, and other institutions and organizations, to initiate, implement, and monitor progress through an organizational approach to establish accountability and greater commitment. CONCLUSION: An organizational approach to DEI strategy through stakeholder engagement and infrastructure increased commitment and shared ownership among members of the school community.

Although significant efforts have been made to develop such therapies, there are currently no approved treatments for COVID-19. One of the potential therapeutic targets is the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which mediates viral entry into host cells. It has been shown that targeting S protein could neutralize viruses and hinder their binding to the cells. Among known viral neutralizing agents, aptamers potential in neutralizing the SARS-Cov-2 virus has not yet been revealed. In addition, aptamers could also be used for targeted delivery of drugs and other genetic elements, such as siRNAs, to the cells. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are reliable tools for gene knockdown via RNA degradation. siRNAs have been implemented previously against some viruses, including SARS-CoV, to target its genome. Recently, potential siRNA sequences and their targets in the SARS-CoV-2 genome have been reported, and the efficiency of siRNAs in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection is being revealed. An alternative antiviral approach we propose here relies on an aptamer-siRNA-based system for the treatment of COVID-19. These aptamers could neutralize viruses by hindering their receptor-mediated endocytosis, and siRNAs could suppress the expression of viral genes and halt various aspects of its pathogenesis whenever the aptamers fail to neutralize the virus.","output":"An aptamer/ siRNA Chimera against The SARS-CoV-2: A Dual Therapeutic Strategy for The Virus Neutralizing and RNA Interfering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Due to its high transmissibility, measures aimed at reducing the spread of SARS CoV2 have become mandatory. Different organizations have recommended performing polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) as part of the preoperative screening of surgical patients. We aimed to determine the performance of PCR testing to detect asymptomatic carriers. METHODS: Observational study carried out at a tertiary care center. We compared the results of preoperative real-time reverse-transcription-PCR test (RT-PCR) performed on a cohort of patients pending surgery with the results we would have expected assuming the epidemiological data released by government offices. RESULTS: We registered no positives in the 2,722 preoperative RT-PCR tests performed in our health care area between epidemiological Weeks 18 to 21, meaning a cumulative incidence trending to zero. Assuming public epidemiological data, the probabilistic projection of potential asymptomatic individuals ranged from 0.27*10e -4 (according to official data of new cases diagnosed by PCR) to 4.69*10e -4 if we assumed cases confirmed by IgG test in our province. Assuming a RT-PCR sensitivity of 95%, to obtain a positive result we should perform 38,461 and 2,028 tests respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In scenarios of very low prevalence and despite high sensitivity scores, indiscriminate preoperative RT-PCR screening is of a questionable effectiveness for detecting asymptomatic carriers.

SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment. These properties may enable aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia, promising to yield a widely deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic and/or early infection therapeutic agent to stem the worst pandemic in a century.","output":"An ultra-potent synthetic nanobody neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by locking Spike into an inactive conformation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"En ligne  : https://budget.gc.ca/fes-eea/2020/themes/building-back-better-rebatir-mieux-fr.html 3 Loewenson R, Accoe K, Bajpai N, et al.

We aimed to track molecular evolution and spread of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Esteio (Southern Brazil) using phylogenetics and phylodynamics inferences from 21 new genomes in global and regional context. Importantly, the case fatality rate (CFR) in Esteio (3.26%) is slightly higher compared to the Rio Grande do Sul (RS) state (2.56%) and the entire Brazil (2.74%). RESULTS: We provided a comprehensive view of mutations from a representative sampling from May to October 2020, highlighting two frequent mutations in spike glycoprotein (D614G and V1176F), an emergent mutation (E484K) in spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) characteristic of the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages, and the adjacent replacement of 2 amino acids in Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (R203K and G204R). E484K was found in two genomes from mid-October, which is the earliest description of this mutation in Southern Brazil. Lineages containing this substitution must be subject of intense surveillance due to its association with immune evasion. We also found two epidemiologically-related clusters, including one from patients of the same neighborhood. Phylogenetics and phylodynamics analysis demonstrates multiple introductions of the Brazilian most prevalent lineages (B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.248) and the establishment of Brazilian lineages ignited from the Southeast to other Brazilian regions.

This concerns not only resources but, above all, the physical and psychological boundaries of nursing professionals. The question of how care for others and self-care of nurses in intensive care units are related to each other in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic has not been addressed in public and scientific discourse so far. ARGUMENTS: The present contribution reflects this relationship with reference to the Code of Ethics of the International Council of Nurses, particularly considering principlism and the Care Ethics according to Joan Tronto. As a result, it shows a corridor of ethically justifiable care with several borders, above all: (1) self-care must not be given up completely for the benefit of care for others, and (2) a categorical subordination of care for others to self-care is ethically not justifiable. CONCLUSION: The article makes an important contribution to a differentiated ethical consideration of the rights and responsibilities of intensive care nurses as moral actors within the pandemic in Germany. It, thus, provides a first starting point for a broad social and political discourse which is urgently needed not only during but also after the pandemic in order to improve the situation of intensive care nurses and those who are cared for.","output":"Intensivpflege in Zeiten der COVID-19 Pandemie: Zur Frage des Verh?ltnisses von Frsorge und Selbstsorge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Diabetes has been linked with poorer outcomes in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. However, the question to whether continue or withdraw metformin therapy in COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus remains contentious. This study aims to investigate the association between metformin and poor COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: Eligible studies published up to 21 October 2020 were included and appraised for validity, importance, and applicability. The included studies were further ranked according to the level of evidence (LOE). Results: Nine studies were included for further assessments, of which seven studies stated that metformin was not associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes (LOE II-V), while the other two with poorer designs stated otherwise (LOE V). Although metformin may increase the risk of developing acidosis and lactic acidosis (LOE IV), the observed risks were more accentuated in patients with severe COVID-19 disease or kidney impairment and in patients with > 2 daily metformin doses. Interestingly, one study revealed that metformin may even yield therapeutic role in reducing the risk of COVID-19 mortality (LOE II), although further studies are required to confirm these findings. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that metformin may be safely continued in COVID-19 patients.

METHOD The study included 464 adults with mucormycosis. Basic demographic data were collected. Patient history of COVID infection, its severity, duration of treatment, and oxygen use was taken to assess the association. History of use of antibiotics, steroids, antivirals, biologicals, and other complementary treatments was sought. History of diabetes and other comorbidities was noted. Patients were investigated for mucor confirmation using a nasal swab KOH mount, nasal endoscopy with biopsy, and radiological investigations were done to assess the extent. RESULTS Out of 464 patients, 175 were known diabetics, and 157 were treated with steroids during COVID infection. Out of 287 post-COVID patients, 125 (44%) had rhino-mucormycosis (RM), 102 (35%) had rhino-oculo-mucormycosis (ROM) and 60 (21%) had rhino-oculo-cerebral-mucormycosis (ROCM). 162 did not have a history of COVID, of which 93 (57%) had RM, 48 (30%) had ROM and 21 (13%) had ROCM.

However, in this review, we aim to explore the history, evolution of all coronaviruses and the associated viral outbreaks along with the diagnostics for COVID-19 in the twenty-first century. MAIN BODY: We have focused on different RNA viruses viz. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, their classification, and the various disease outbreaks caused by them. In the subsequent section, the comparison of different RNA viruses affecting humans has been made based on the viral genome, structure, time of the outbreak, mode of spread, virulence, causative agents, and transmission. Due to the current mayhem caused by the rapidly emerging virus, special attention is given to SARS-CoV-2, its genome updates, and infectivity. Finally, the current diagnostic techniques such as nucleic acid testing (real time-polymerase chain reaction and loop-mediated isothermal amplification), CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPR based DETECTR assay, CRISPR based SHERLOCK test, AIOD-CRISPR, FELUDA, CREST), chest radiographs (computed tomography, X-ray), and serological tests (Lateral flow assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, chemiluminescent immunoassay, neutralization assay, nano-sensors, blood test, viral sequencing) with their pros and cons, and future diagnostic prospective have been described.

Compared to pre-COVID-19 times, 67% of people changed their eating habits and increased consumption of foods containing added sugars. Women and men with low adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) were more likely to be physically inactive (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.01, respectively). Results from logistic regression showed a three times higher risk of being inactive if adherence to the MedDiet was low (p < 0.0001), especially in men between 26 and 35 years. Lower levels of distress were reported in males who were physically active (89%) (p < 0.001). Our findings may help to identify effective lifestyle interventions during restrictive conditions.","output":"Changes in Lifestyle and Dietary Habits during COVID-19 Lockdown in Italy: Results of an Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the eHealth ecosystems evolution during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects on the progression of care for patients with chronic cardiovascular disease. Design/methodology/approach: To attain the aim of the study, this study chose to adopt a qualitative method that matches the complexity of the issue. The study was conducted in a real context through 44 face-to-face semi-structured interviews of key informants at different levels of the Italian eHealth service ecosystem, via Microsoft Teams. The interviews were carried out from June 2020 to January 2021. In this research, we adopted an abductive approach that enabled a process where the theoretical framework and the data analysis evolved at the same time. Findings: The study results were used to develop a conceptual framework that considers the key factors enabling and constraining the evolutionary process of the eHealth service ecosystem. In particular, the drivers that emerged from the study were actor role empowerment, actorCnetwork engagement and resource reconfiguration while the inhibitors were inter- and intra-actor misalignment, resource myopia and the platformisation gap. The findings also revealed the pivotal role of the meso level in the development of the eHealth service ecosystem, boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: By adopting a service ecosystem perspective, this paper contributes, at both a theoretical and a managerial level, to a better understanding of the dynamics related to the diffusion of eHealth. The study identifies the main issues that researchers, managers and policymakers should address to support the evolution of the eHealth service ecosystem, with particular regard to chronic cardiovascular disease. ? 2021, Roberta Sebastiani and Alessia Anzivino.","output":"The long and winding road of eHealth.

A total of 30 interviews were conducted through conference calls. The findings proved that major issues faced by the restaurants are the massive decline in sales, massive layoffs, no economic activity, and no relief from the government. The major changes required in the existing business models highlighted by the interviewees are proper sanitization, changes in the sitting area, change in menus, and the need for innovative ideas to attract the customers back.

BDC2.5 T cells in BDC2.5 CD4+ T cell receptor transgenic Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice (BDC2.5 + NOD mice) can abruptly invade the pancreatic islets resulting in severe insulitis that progresses rapidly but rarely leads to spontaneous diabetes. This prevention of diabetes is mediated by T regulatory (Treg) cells in these mice. In this study, we investigated the role of interleukin 10 (IL-10) in the inhibition of diabetes in BDC2.5 + NOD mice by generating Il-10-deficient BDC2.5 + NOD mice (BDC2.5 + Il-10 -/- NOD mice). Our results showed that BDC2.5 + Il-10 -/- NOD mice displayed robust and accelerated diabetes development. Il-10 deficiency in BDC2.5 + NOD mice promoted the generation of neutrophils in the bone marrow and increased the proportions of neutrophils in the periphery (blood, spleen, and islets), accompanied by altered intestinal immunity and gut microbiota composition. In vitro studies showed that the gut microbiota from BDC2.5 + Il-10 -/- NOD mice can expand neutrophil populations. Moreover, in vivo studies demonstrated that the depletion of endogenous gut microbiota by antibiotic treatment decreased the proportion of neutrophils. Although Il-10 deficiency in BDC2.5 + NOD mice had no obvious effects on the proportion and function of Treg cells, it affected the immune response and activation of CD4+ T cells. Moreover, the pathogenicity of CD4+ T cells was much increased, and this significantly accelerated the development of diabetes when these CD4+ T cells were transferred into immune-deficient NOD mice. Our study provides novel insights into the role of IL-10 in the modulation of neutrophils and CD4+ T cells in BDC2.5 + NOD mice, and suggests important crosstalk between gut microbiota and neutrophils in type 1 diabetes development.","output":"IL-10 Deficiency Accelerates Type 1 Diabetes Development via Modulation of Innate and Adaptive Immune Cells and Gut Microbiota in BDC2.5 NOD Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona virus or most popularly known as the Covid-19 has paralyzed the people movement as well as various sectors that includes the education sector. Henceforth, it gave a breakthrough for academia to venture themselves into work from home with the aid of information technology. It is known as online teaching and learning (OTL). Frequent and continuous usage of OTL to conduct lessons for learners from home may take a toll on the health aspect of academicians. Demographic factors associating with the factors related to ergonomic settings among academicians will be the focus of this study. Data was collected from private universities in Malaysia by using online platform. Association rules technique based on unsupervised approach had been used to find interesting patterns between demographics and ergonomic settings. With association rules, finding co-occurrences of demographics factors leading to the factors of ergonomic settings is the main strength of the technique. Despite many researchers in the past has done ergonomics studies in various areas/fields, only simple and descriptive statistical techniques were used. At present, there is no research work reported using the association rules technique in the educational field in the context of ergonomics. Association rules algorithms FP-Growth and Apriori were used and the evaluation metrics used in this study were support, confidence and lift. The results from this study indicated that the academic group with demographic factors (Married, Male) particularly vulnerable to the risk of mental health while the academic group (Married, Female, Years of experience is less than 10 years) did not have adequate ergonomics facilities at home and lacked a better sense of interpretation of the information provided to them by the management in the process of executing OTL.

METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were divided into the following groups: no intervention, rapid restriction, regular exercise, and rapid restriction combined with regular exercise. Rats in the exercise group performed climbing exercise for 4 weeks. All rats consumed food ad libitum, and those in the rapid restriction group fasted for the last 3 days with no water on the last 1 day. RESULTS: Despite no significant differences in body weight among the groups, the kidney weight was decreased when rapid restriction and regular exercise were combined. Rapid restriction reduced the urine volume and increased the urine osmolality, whereas regular exercise did not. Rapid restriction but not regular exercise increased the levels of circulating aldosterone and the renal expression levels of the ion channel SGK-1 compared to those without rapid restriction, indicating the stimulation of RAAS. Conversely, VPS showed no significant response to these interventions. Moreover, rapid restriction combined with regular exercise induced the renal expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased the active forms of apoptotic effector caspase-3 compared with the no intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Functional significance may differ between VPS and RAAS in water homeostasis in response to rapid restriction. Moreover, the combination of rapid restriction and regular exercise has potentially deleterious effects on the kidney.","output":"Differential roles of VPS and RAAS in water homeostasis and a risk for kidney dysfunction in rats undergoing rapid fasting/dehydration with regular exercise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AimsObsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder, which is the sixth largest contributor to non-fatal health loss globally. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, aside from its impact on physical health, has also had its effects on mental health. This study aimed to explore the frequency of new onset OCD symptomology in medical students amidst COVID-19 pandemic and its association with potential sociodemographic parameters.MethodThis cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students studying in Pakistani medical colleges. Data were collected after ethical approval from 1st January 2020 to 20th January 2020 during the second COVID-19 wave. Participants with a history of diagnosed psychiatric illness such as OCD, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety and those taking relevant medications were excluded from the study. The online questionnaire included Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and Revised Padua Inventory-Contamination Subscale (PI-CS), which were used to assess OCD symptoms and aversion for contamination respectively. Participants filled Y-BOCS twice, once for pre-pandemic score (based on self-recall), and a second time during 2nd wave of COVID-19. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS v23.0 (Armonk, N.Y., USA).ResultThe study included 711 participants (Males: 29.8%, Mean age: 21.59  1.52 years) from over 46 medical colleges and over 44 cities of Pakistan. The mean pre-pandemic and mid-2nd wave Y-BOCS scores were 11.86  6.02 and 15.61  7.41 respectively. The mean PI-CS score was 17.27  9.17. Twenty five percent (n = 176) of students developed new onset OCD symptomology during pandemic, while seventy percent (n = 497) suffered from worsened Y-BOCS score during pandemic. New onset OCD symptomology was associated with age less than 20 years (p = 0.02), higher PI-CS score (p = 0.001) and studying in preclinical years (p = 0.002). Worsening of YBOCS score had significant association with female gender (p = 0.02), attending pandemic related awareness seminar (p = 0.027), studying in preclinical years (p &lt; 0.001) and age less than 20 years (p &lt; 0.001).

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to explore the impact of perceived exercise benefits and barriers, exercise outcome expectations, and depressive symptoms on polycystic ovary syndromeCspecific health-related quality-of-life. METHODS: A survey link was posted on polycystic ovary syndrome Facebook groups. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (n = 935) answered questionnaires about demographics, polycystic ovary syndromeCspecific health-related quality-of-life, exercise benefits and barriers, exercise outcome expectations, and depressive symptoms. Data were collected using Qualtrics, transferred to SPSS, and statistically analyzed using regression analyses. Mean responses were reported for the questionnaires, with exercise benefits and barriers means divided for a ratio. RESULTS: Respondents were 32  10.6 years of age, mostly White (72%), and employed full-time (65%). The total mean scores were health-related quality-of-life, 2.7  0.1; exercise outcome expectation, 2.4  0.8; and depressive symptoms, 12.4  5.8. The benefit/barrier ratio was 0.9. HRQoL increased 0.32 points for every additional perceived exercise benefit and 0.61 points for every additional exercise outcome expectation (EOE). HRQoL was reduced by 1.19 points for every additional perceived exercise barrier and 2.82 points for every additional one-point increase of the depressive symptoms score. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents reported low health-related quality-of-life, greater exercise barriers than benefits, neutral exercise outcome expectations, and high depressive symptoms. These results suggest that promoting exercise benefits, overcoming exercise barriers, and addressing management of depressive symptoms are important foci of future efforts to improve health-related quality-of-life among women with polycystic ovary syndrome.","output":"The impact of exercise perceptions and depressive symptoms on polycystic ovary syndromeCspecific health-related quality of life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world in a short period of time and with a heterogeneous pattern.

To date, heterogeneous findings and methodologies have limited clinicians' and researchers' ability to meaningfully synthesise existing literature. In this context, there is a need to clarify mental health outcomes in a homogeneous sample, controlling for key methodological differences and applying a consistent definition of concussion across studies. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SportDiscus, Scopus and PubMed. ELIGIBILITY Peer-reviewed studies published between 1980 and June 2020 that prospectively examined mental health outcomes after paediatric concussion, defined as per the Berlin Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport. RESULTS Sixty-nine articles characterising 60 unique samples met inclusion criteria, representing 89 114 children with concussion. Forty articles (33 studies) contributed to a random effects meta-analysis of internalising (withdrawal, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress), externalising (conduct problems, aggression, attention, hyperactivity) and total mental health difficulties across three time points post-injury (acute, persisting and chronic). Overall, children with concussion (n=6819) experienced significantly higher levels of internalising (g=0.41-0.46), externalising (g=0.25-0.46) and overall mental health difficulties compared with controls (g=0.18-0.49; n=56 271), with effects decreasing over time. SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS Our review highlights that mental health is central to concussion recovery. Assessment, prevention and intervention of mental health status should be integrated into standard follow-up procedures. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying observed relationships between mental health, post-concussion symptoms and other psychosocial factors.

In tissue culture, PTC299 manifests robust, dose-dependent, and DHODH-dependent inhibition of SARS CoV-2 replication (EC50 range, 2.0 to 31.6 nM) with a selectivity index >3,800. PTC299 also blocked replication of other RNA viruses, including Ebola virus. Consistent with known DHODH requirements for immunomodulatory cytokine production, PTC299 inhibited the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A (also called IL-17), IL-17F, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tissue culture models. The combination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, cytokine inhibitory activity, and previously established favorable pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles render PTC299 a promising therapeutic for COVID-19.","output":"The DHODH Inhibitor PTC299 Arrests SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Suppresses Induction of Inflammatory Cytokines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To minimize sample dilution effect on SARS-CoV-2 pool testing, we assessed analytical and diagnostic performance of a new methodology, namely swab pooling.

We have analyzed the interaction of measles virus with cell surface proteins, using an overlay binding assay with cellular proteins immobilized on nitrocellulose. Among surface-biotinylated proteins from a human rectal tumor cell line (HRT), measles virus was able to bind only to a 67-kDa protein that was identified as MCP. The virus recognized different isoforms of MCP expressed from human (HRT and HeLa) and simian (Vero) cell lines. The binding of measles virus to MCP was abolished after cleavage of the disulfide bonds by reducing agents as well as after enzymatic release of N-linked oligosaccharides. By contrast, removal of sialic acid or O-linked oligosaccharides did not affect the recognition of MCP measles virus. These data indicate that the receptor determinant of MCP is dependent on a conformation of the protein that is maintained by disulfide bonds and N-glycans present in the complement binding domains. Our results are consistent with a role of MCP as primary attachment site for measles virus in the initial stage of an infection.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preoperative and 6-month postoperative AzBio sentence scores in quiet were compared between groups along with the number of missed appointments as well as datalogged information regarding average CI wear time and average hours in various sound environments such as quiet, speech, and speech-in-noise. RESULTS: The Control Group averaged 36.5% improvement for AzBio in quiet scores while the Pandemic Group averaged only 17.2% improvement, a difference that was both statistically and clinically significant (p = 0.04; g = 0.64). Patients in the Pandemic Group were nearly twice as likely to miss CI programming appointments than the Control Group. The Pandemic Group wore their CI 1.2 less hours per day on average, and while the Pandemic Group spent similar times in quiet and speech environments to the Control Group, the Pandemic Group spent less time in speech with presence of background noise. CONCLUSIONS: While social distancing and quarantine measures are crucial to limiting spread of COVID-19, these precautions may have negatively impacted early speech performance for elderly cochlear implant recipients.

Moreover, potential differences with regard to demographic variables, school type, state, and participation in state health promotion initiatives are determined. METHODS: As part of the international COVID Health Literacy Network, an online-based study was conducted from March to April 2021 with 2186 school principals from the German federal states of Baden-Wrttemberg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, and North Rhine-Westphalia. The implementation status of COVID-19-related school health promotion was assessed using a self-developed instrument. After examining the factorial structure of the instrument, univariate and bivariate data analyses were performed. RESULTS: Three dimensions of implementing school health promotion can be identified: (1) COVID-19-related support for pupils, (2) health promoting design of teaching, learning, and working conditions, and (3) the principles of Health Promoting Schools. A low level of implementation is observed for aspects of teaching, learning, and working conditions as well as for participation and cooperation with community stakeholders. Significant differences are observed, with female, older, and primary school principals reporting a higher implementation status, while for federal states non-homogenous differences are found. Stratified by participation in state health promotion initiatives, only schools with a certificate in health promotion show a higher level of implementation.

In 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread around the world. Approximately 5% of infected patients are critical cases that require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). In these patients, COVID-19 can be complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multi-organ failure, including kidney and heart failure. OBJECTIVE. Summarize the recommendations included in the Guidelines for Care of Critically Ill Adult Patients with COVID-19 in the Americas, version 3, published by the Pan American Health Organization in 2021 to guide the management of critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 treated in the ICU, and address key aspects of implementation of the recommendations. METHODOLOGY. The guidelines and their recommendations were summarized. In addition, a systematic search was carried out in Pubmed, Lilacs, Health Systems Evidence, Epistemonikos, and gray literature on studies carried out in the Region of the Americas, in order to identify barriers, facilitators, and implementation strategies. RESULTS. Forty-three recommendations are presented that address the identification of markers and risk factors for mortality, infection prevention and control, specimen collection, supportive care (ventilatory and hemodynamic), pharmacological treatment, early rehabilitation, use of imaging studies, prevention of complications, and discharge criteria for critical patients with COVID-19.

Diabetes complications are leading to Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). The early stages of DR may have either no sign or cause minor vision problems, but later stages of the disease can lead to blindness. DR diagnosis is an exceedingly difficult task because of changes in the retina during the disease stages. An automatic DR early detection method can save a patient's vision and can also support the ophthalmologists in DR screening. This paper develops a model for the diagnostics of DR.

A number of medically-relevant zoonotic pathogens are negative-strand RNA viruses (NSVs). NSVs are derived from different virus families. Examples like Ebola are known for causing severe symptoms and high mortality rates. Some, like influenza, are known for their ease of person-to-person transmission and lack of pre-existing immunity, enabling rapid spread across many countries around the globe. Containment of outbreaks of NSVs can be difficult owing to their unpredictability and the absence of effective control measures, such as vaccines and antiviral therapeutics. In addition, there remains a lack of essential knowledge of the hostCpathogen response that are induced by NSVs, particularly of the immune responses that provide protection. Vaccines are the most effective method for preventing infectious diseases. In fact, in the event of a pandemic, appropriate vaccine design and speed of vaccine supply is the most critical factor in protecting the population, as vaccination is the only sustainable defense. Vaccines need to be safe, efficient, and cost-effective, which is influenced by our understanding of the hostCpathogen interface. Additionally, some of the major challenges of vaccines are the establishment of a long-lasting immunity offering cross protection to emerging strains. Although many NSVs are controlled through immunisations, for some, vaccine design has failed or efficacy has proven unreliable. The key behind designing a successful vaccine is understanding the hostCpathogen interaction and the host immune response towards NSVs. In this paper, we review the recent research in vaccine design against NSVs and explore the immune responses induced by these viruses. The generation of a robust and integrated approach to development capability and vaccine manufacture can collaboratively support the management of outbreaking NSV disease health risks.","output":"Investigating the Interaction between Negative Strand RNA Viruses and Their Hosts for Enhanced Vaccine Development and Production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Cohort study to evaluate the presence of objective signs and subjective symptoms of dry eye disease (DED) in post-COVID-19 patients compared to control. METHODS: Prospective, observational, single-center, cohort study. Sixty-four post-COVID-19 patients and fifty control were recruited. All participants underwent a complete ophthalmological examination including: Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire (OSDI), Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundus examination, Schirmer test type 1, Tear Break Up Time test (tBUT), evaluation of conjunctival hyperemia, corneal staining and tear film osmolarity test. RESULTS: OSDI score was higher in the post-COVID19 group in the quantitative and qualitative analysis (respectively p<0.001 and p =0.012). Mean tBUT in post-COVID-19 patients was 6.95  4.07 sec compared to a mean tBUT of 10.12  3.90 sec in the control group. The post-COVID-19 group showed a higher number of patients with a simultaneous impairment of OSDI score and tBUT (p = 0.019). The Schirmer test results were strikingly significant both in the quantitative and qualitative analysis (p <0.001 and p = 0.0014 respectively). Both quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed a significant difference in terms of tear osmolarity in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the ocular surface assessment of post-COVID-19 patients with heathy control a statistically significant increase of DED has emerged both in subjective and objective evaluations. Our clinical results support the findings that suggested a susceptibility of the ocular surface to the virus and it underlines the importance of the ocular surface assessment in post-COVID-19 patients for a correct diagnosis and therapy.","output":"Ocular Surface Impairment After Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIMS Standard approaches to trial design and analyses can be inefficient and non-pragmatic. Failure to consider a range of outcomes impedes evidence-based interpretation and reduces power. Traditional approaches synthesizing information obtained from separate analysis of each outcome fail to incorporate associations between outcomes and recognize the cumulative nature of outcomes in individual patients, suffer from competing risk complexities during interpretation, and since efficacy and safety analyses are often conducted on different populations, generalizability is unclear. Pragmatic and efficient approaches to trial design and analyses are needed. METHODS Approaches providing a pragmatic assessment of benefits and harms of interventions, summarizing outcomes experienced by patients, and providing sample size efficiencies are described. Ordinal outcomes recognize finer gradations of patient responses. Desirability of outcome ranking is an ordinal outcome combining benefits and harms within patients. Analysis of desirability of outcome ranking can be based on rank-based methodologies including the desirability of outcome ranking probability, the win ratio, and the proportion in favor of treatment. Partial credit analyses, involving grading the levels of the desirability of outcome ranking outcome similar to an academic test, provides an alternative approach. The methodologies are demonstrated using the acute stroke or transient ischemic attack treated with aspirin or ticagrelor and patient outcomes study (SOCRATES; NCT01994720), a randomized clinical trial. RESULTS Two 5-level ordinal outcomes were developed for SOCRATES. The first was based on a modified Rankin scale. The odds ratio is 0.86 (95% confidence interval = 0.75, 0.99; p = 0.04) indicating that the odds of worse stroke categorization for a trial participant assigned to ticagrelor is 0.86 times that of a trial participant assigned to aspirin. The 5-level desirability of outcome ranking outcome incorporated and prioritized survival; the number of strokes, myocardial infarction, and major bleeding events; and whether a stroke event was disabling. The desirability of outcome ranking probability and win ratio are 0.504 (95% confidence interval = 0.499, 0.508; p = 0.10) and 1.11 (95% confidence interval = 0.98, 1.26; p = 0.10), respectively, implying that the probability of a more desirable result with ticagrelor is 50.4% and that a more desirable result occurs 1.11 times more frequently on ticagrelor versus aspirin. CONCLUSION Ordinal outcomes can improve efficiency through required pre-specification, careful construction, and analyses. Greater pragmatism can be obtained by composing outcomes within patients. Desirability of outcome ranking provides a global assessment of the benefits and harms that more closely reflect the experience of patients. The desirability of outcome ranking probability, the proportion in favor of treatment, the win ratio, and partial credit can more optimally inform patient treatment, enhance the understanding of the totality of intervention effects on patients, and potentially provide efficiencies over standard analyses. The methods provide the infrastructure for incorporating patient values and estimating personalized effects.","output":"Methodologies for pragmatic and efficient assessment of benefits and harms: Application to the SOCRATES trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High resolution data from all-atom molecular simulations is used to parameterize a Martini 3 coarse-grained (CG) model of cellulose I allomorphs and cellulose type-II fibrils.

Furthermore, our CG model poses a very small deviation from the native-like structure, making it appropriate to capture large conformational changes such as those that occur during the self-assembly process.

The disease soon became a pandemic and was formally named as coronavirus disease or COVID-19. The causative virus has been named as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The most common complication in COVID-19-affected patients appears to be acute respiratory distress syndrome. At present, mainly symptomatic treatments are being given to COVID-19 patients, and no drug has been proved to cure the disease. There has been vying among pharmaceutical and researcher to devise a cure. The phytotherapy or the phytomedicines have been acknowledged as effective immunity booster and potential to eliminate the viral infection. The Chinese approach toward traditional herbal medicines has already being acknowledged as antiviral and RNA synthesis inhibitors globally. The secondary metabolites of plants such as alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenoids have been the source of countless medicinal compounds. For example, well-known antimalarial chloroquine phosphate (analogue of quinine, originally extracted from the bark of cinchona tree) has broad-spectrum antiviral activities. Antiviral phytomedicines have already been used in past two coronavirus outbreaks, that is, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Ethnobotany or the folklore knowledge of medicinal plants, for instance, has also played a major role in the development of new drugs for centuries.

Physicochemical evaluations of PFV-Lip-PTX revealed spheroid-like regular vesicles of about 120 nm in diameter with negative charge. An in vitro release study indicated that PTX was released from the liposomes in a controlled and sustained manner. A cellular uptake study indicated that PFV-Lip-PTX exhibited higher internalization efficiency in MCF-7 cells than non-modified liposomes. It was also demonstrated that PFV modification improved the cytotoxicity of PTX via a hydrophobic interaction between the PFV-Lip and cell lipid membranes compared with non-modified liposomes. Moreover, in vivo studies demonstrated that the PFV-modified liposomes led to highly efficient targeting and accumulation in an MCF-7 xenograft tumor and improved the antitumor efficacy of PTX.

Blunt trauma acts as the leading cause of injury and it may affect both the anterior and posterior parts of the globe. Prompt diagnosis, early management, and sustained follow-up are mandatory for an optimal outcome. PURPOSE: This report presents a one-step surgery management process for an intricate case of blunt facial trauma with complex ophthalmic and nasal injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 45-year-old male with blunt force trauma of the left eye from a wooden block, suffered from naso-orbital-ethmoidal fractures, eyelid laceration with canalicular, close-globe injuries of traumatic cataract and vitreous hemorrhage with retinal detachment. A simultaneous one-step surgery was performed by a trauma team of ophthalmological and ENT surgeons during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic to lessen the risk of cross-transmission. After ruling out the possibility of open-globe rupture, traumatic cataract extraction, retinal detachment surgery, the repair of an eyelid laceration with canalicular involvement, and septorhinoplasty were performed on concomitantly. RESULTS: Anatomical success was achieved for the repair of the nasoorbitoethmoidal (NOE) type II fracture and close-globe injuries, including the anatomical reattachment of the retina. However, the functional outcome remained unsatisfactory. Visual acuity failed to show further improvement at a later follow-up. Traumatic optic neuropathy was, at the final follow-up, considered to be the cause of the suboptimal visual acuity. CONCLUSION: A single-step multi-procedure for a complex ophthalmic blunt trauma, as demonstrated in this case, may be beneficial for reducing the complications that might arise due to treatment delay. The complex nature of the injury, however, creates the higher possibility for residual post-operative complications. Risks of residual functional impairment should be considered in such complex trauma prior to surgery, to determine the surgical prognostic value and provide appropriate consent to the patient.","output":"Multiple Approaches for Managing Complex Ophthalmic Blunt Trauma: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are essential for critical biological processes such as translation regulation and mRNA processing, and misfunctions of these proteins are associated with diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. SERBP1 (SERPINE1 mRNA Binding Protein 1) is an RBP that comprises two RG/RGG repeat regions yet lacks other recognizable RNA-binding motifs. It is involved in mRNA maturation, and translational regulation. It was initially identified as a hyaluronic acid binding protein, but recent studies have identified central roles for SERBP1 in brain function and development, especially neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. SERBP1 regulates One-carbon metabolism and epigenetic modification of histones, and increased SERBP1 expression in cancers such as leukemia, ovarian, prostate, liver and glioblastoma is correlated with poor patient outcomes. Despite these important regulatory roles for SERBP1, little is known about its structural and dynamic properties, nor about the molecular mechanisms governing its interaction with mRNA. Here, we define SERBP1 as an intrinsically disordered protein, containing highly conserved elements that were shown to be functionally important. The RNA binding activity of SERBP1 was explored using solution NMR and other biophysical techniques. The outcome of these experiments revealed that SERBP1 preferentially samples compact conformations including a central, stable -helix and show that SERBP1 recognizes G-rich RNA sequences at the C-terminus involving the RGG box and neighboring residues. Despite the role in RNA recognition, the RGG boxes do not seem to stabilize the central helix and the central helix does not participate in RNA binding. Further, SERBP1 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation, mediated by salt and RNA, and both RGG boxes are necessary for the efficient formation of condensed phases. Together, these results provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms of SERBP1 functions in physiological and pathological processes.","output":"Structural Characterization of the RNA-Binding Protein SERBP1 Reveals Intrinsic Disorder and Atypical RNA Binding Modes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveTo determine the extent to which family physicians closed their doors altogether or for in-person visits during the pandemic, their future practice intentions, and related factors.

The aim of this multicenter phase II prospective study was to evaluate the role of MRD in identifying pts unlikely to be cured by IFRT, for whom an immunotherapy consolidation could improve outcome. Methods: 110 pts with stage I/II FL were enrolled and treated with 24 Gy IFRT. Peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples were centralized to the FIL (Fondazione Italiani Linfomi) MRD Network of EuroMRD-certified laboratories. In BCL2/IGH+ pts at baseline by both nested PCR (NEST) and RQ-PCR (RQ) in BM a/o PB, MRD was analyzed after IFRT and every 6 months over a 3-year period. Pts with MRD+ by both NEST and RQ in BM a/o PB after IFRT or who became MRD+ during the follow-up were treated with 8 weekly doses of the anti-CD20 MoAb ofatumumab (OFA). The primary objective of the study was to define the efficacy of immunotherapy in obtaining a negative MRD. Results: Of the 106 evaluable pts, 50 were males. Median age was 55 y (29-83). The FLIPI score was 0 in 59% of pts, 1 in 35%, 2 in 6%. 68% of pts had inguinal site involvement. At baseline, 30% of pts had a BCL2/IGH rearrangement (30 MBR, 1 MBR and mcr, 1 mcr) in BM a/ o PB;the concordance between compartments was 90%. All but one pt achieved a clinical response after IFRT;one additional pt died soon after IFRT of unrelated causes. MRD evaluation after IFRT revealed the persistence of BCL2/IGH+ cells in PB a/o BM in 60% of pts. MRD + pts, either after IFRT (n = 18) or in case of conversion to MRD+ during the follow-up (n = 6), received OFA, obtaining a conversion to MRD-in 22/24 pts (91.7%-CI 73.0-99.0), significantly superior to the expected 50% (Fig). After a median F-U of 38 m, 17 pts who achieved a MRD-with OFA are still negative;5 converted to MRD+ (2 received OFA retreatment, achieving a second MRD-;2 pts were not re-treated due to Sars-Cov2 pandemic;1 relapsed). A clinical relapse or progression was observed in 23 pts: 18 (24.6%) among the 73 no marker pts and 5 (15.6%) among the 32 BCL2/IGH+ at baseline (p = 0.3), with no significant difference in PFS (p = 0.25). Two early relapses were observed among the 12 pts who became MRD-after IFRT and 3 among the 24 treated at least once with OFA (1 MRD+, 1 MRD-, 1 converted from MRD-to MRD+). Only 1 Pt relapsed while MRD-after OFA. Conclusions: MRD data indicate that RT alone is often insufficient to eradicate the disease, inducing a MRD-only in 40% of pts, notably long-lasting only in half of them. The primary objective of this study-MRD conversion after immunotherapy-was largely achieved. The strategy of an immunotherapy consolidation after IFRT in MRD+ pts allowed increasing molecular responses. However, this strategy is applicable only to 30% of enrolled pts.

Methods We evaluated standard blood laboratory parameters of 655 COVID-19 patients suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, who underwent PCR testing in one of five hospitals in Vienna, Austria. Additionally, clinical characteristics and 28-day outcome were obtained from medical records. We compared standard blood laboratory parameters, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between positive and negative PCR-tested patients and evaluated the ability of those parameters to distinguish between groups. Results Of the 590 study patients including 276 females and 314 males, aged between 20 and 100 years, 208 were tested positive by means of PCR. Patients with positive compared to negative PCR-tests had significantly lower levels of leukocytes, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and thrombocytes; while significantly higher levels were detected with hemoglobin, C-reactive-protein (CRP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), activated-partial-thromboplastin-time (aPTT), creatine-kinase (CK), lactatedehydrogenase (LDH), alanine-aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), and lipase.

The main symptom in subjects who developed immunity was fever. Antibodies were found in subjects with forced coexistence with quarantined or infected subjects. The mutual spatial distance by categories has shown higher relative prevalence of IgG positive and IgM negative cases in close proximity but also far from the infected, with respect to an intermediate distance. This suggests that subjects living in thinly populated areas could come in contact with the virus more likely due to intentional/relational proximity, while those living nearby could also be infected through random proximity.","output":"Epidemiological study in a small rural area of Veneto (Italian region) during Sars-Cov-2 Pandemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, aloe-emodin was identified as a potential interferon (IFN)-inducer by screening compounds from Chinese herbal medicine.

However, Borrelia species from both the Lyme disease (LD) and relapsing fever (RF) groups harbor an amino acid transport and catabolism system, the Arginine Deiminase System (ADI), that could potentially augment intracellular L-arginine required for growth. RF spirochetes contain a \\"complete\\", four gene ADI (arcA, B, D, and C) while LD spirochetes harbor arcA, B, and sometimes D but lack arcC (encoding carbamate kinase). In this study, we evaluated the role of the ADI system in bacterial survival and virulence and discovered important differences in RF and LD ADIs. Both in vitro and in a murine model of infection, B. hermsii cells significantly reduced extracellular L-arginine levels and that reduction was dependent on arginine deiminase expression. Conversely, B. burgdorferi did not reduce the concentration of L-arginine during in vitro growth experiments nor during infection of the mammalian host, suggesting a fundamental difference in the ability to directly utilize L-arginine compared to B. hermsii. Further experiments using a panel of mutants generated in both B. burgdorferi and B. hermsii, identified important differences in growth characteristics and ADI transcription and protein expression. We also found that the ADI system plays a key role in blood and spleen colonization in RF spirochetes. In this study we have identified divergent metabolic strategies in two closely related human pathogens, that ultimately impacts the host-pathogen interface during infection.","output":"The arginine deaminase system plays distinct roles in Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia hermsii"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Azithromycin has been hypothesized to have activity against SARS-CoV-2. Objective To determine whether oral azithromycin in outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to absence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms at day 14. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized clinical trial of azithromycin vs matching placebo conducted from May 2020 through March 2021. Outpatients from the US were enrolled remotely via internet-based surveys and followed up for 21 days. Eligible participants had a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test result (nucleic acid amplification or antigen) within 7 days prior to enrollment, were aged 18 years or older, and were not hospitalized at the time of enrollment. Among 604 individuals screened, 297 were ineligible, 44 refused participation, and 263 were enrolled. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment randomization. Interventions Participants were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to a single oral 1.2-g dose of azithromycin (n = 171) or matching placebo (n = 92). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was absence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms at day 14. There were 23 secondary clinical end points, including all-cause hospitalization at day 21. Results Among 263 participants who were randomized (median age, 43 years; 174 [66%] women; 57% non-Hispanic White and 29% Latinx/Hispanic), 76% completed the trial. The trial was terminated by the data and safety monitoring committee for futility after the interim analysis. At day 14, there was no significant difference in proportion of participants who were symptom free (azithromycin: 50%; placebo: 50%; prevalence difference, 0%; 95% CI, -14% to 15%; P > .99). Of 23 prespecified secondary clinical end points, 18 showed no significant difference. By day 21, 5 participants in the azithromycin group had been hospitalized compared with 0 in the placebo group (prevalence difference, 4%; 95% CI, -1% to 9%; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance Among outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, treatment with a single dose of azithromycin compared with placebo did not result in greater likelihood of being symptom free at day 14.

Thus, international shipping deteriorates drastically. Simultaneously, social distancing increased the need for immediate online consumption and fast home delivery. In the non-digital world, products still need to be shipped to their destination using trucks, trains, airplanes, and ships. Simultaneously, requirements for volumes of goods, transport costs, external limiting factors, etc., must be precisely defined. The article aims to find the optimal location selection solution based on the created mathematical model of the Modified Steiner-Weber Problem with restrictive conditions. The model alows for the central warehouse's optimal location and minimizes distribution costs from the central warehouse to subwarehouses/branches located in individual EU countries. The mathematical model has been applied to a case study of a selected e-commerce dealing, which has established branches in capital cities but does not have an established central warehouse. Systematization of literature sources and approaches to solving the problem of e-commerce distribution center location showed that 86% of the studied companies plan to use on-demand warehousing in the next three to five years. Therefore, the need for warehousing would be preserved. The authors noted that they do not necessarily need to have it in-house. Consequently, fulfillment centers and warehouses would likely continue to be a significant component in the future logistics system. This research would like to stress how important the management of the effective optimization of e-commerce distribution center location is and how to achieve it. The success of Amazon in the US, Europe, and Alibaba in China has genuinely redefined consumer expectations. With the emergence of services like Amazon Prime, consumers now expect same-day delivery.

Most vaccines use two-dose regimens. In turn, single-dose vaccines also have high potential, since, on the one hand, they simplify the vaccination program, make it more accessible and convenient for more people around the world, and on the other hand, they are better suited for subsequent revaccination. However, there is not enough data on the effectiveness of single-dose vaccine variants against new genetic lines to assess their current potential. It is not clear how much a single dose of immunization protects against the globally dominant delta variant. In this work, we investigated the effectiveness of a single dose vaccine (Sputnik Light, the first component of Sputnik V vaccine) against the Delta variant in Moscow. MethodsTo assess the effectiveness of one dose of viral vector vaccine based on rAd26 against the delta variant in Moscow, we used data from the Moscow registries of vaccination against COVID-19 and the incidence of COVID-19. The availability of data on the number of seropositive residents of Moscow made it possible to consider the size of the immune layer formed because of a previous COVID-19 disease or vaccination. To calculate the effectiveness, the proportion of COVID-19 cases among those vaccinated with a single dose and the proportion of cases among those who were not vaccinated in July 2021. ResultsOur data indicate that throughout July 2021, the dominant variant of the coronavirus at the level of 99.5% in Moscow was the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant and its subsidiary lines. Considering the immune layer of 46% allowed us to calculate the effectiveness of a one-shot vaccine against the delta variant in Moscow during the first three months after vaccination at the level of 69.85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.08 to 74.70). In the 18-29-year-old group, the overall vaccine efficacy against the delta variant was 88.61%, in the 18-59 group - 75.28%. Sputnik Light demonstrates higher efficacy against Delta variant than many two-shot vaccines. ConclusionThe results indicate a high efficacy of a single immunization first component of Sputnik V vaccine against delta variant among young and middle-aged people, at least during the first 3 months after receiving the one-shot vaccine.","output":"One-shot immunization with Sputnik Light (the first component of Sputnik V vaccine) is effective against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant: efficacy data on the use of the vaccine in civil circulation in Moscow"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies of safety and quality will determine the optimum use of this option.","output":"Virtual Care Takes Off During COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction and Objectives: COVID-19 has generated negative consequences for people's mental health This is the case of Peru, one of the Latin American countries most affected by the pandemic In this sense, the objective of the study was to translate and validate the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) into Spanish Material and Method: The participants were 704 university students of health sciences (Mage = 23 39 years, SD = 3 45) who were administered the CAS in Spanish, the Mental Health Inventory-5 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 item The CAS was translated into Spanish using the forward and backward method Reliability and evidence of validity based on internal structure and relationship with other variables were examined Results: The factor analysis confirmed the one-dimensional factor structure of the CAS (2 = 7 62, df = 5, p = 18, 2 / gl = 1 52, CFI = 99, RMSEA = 03 [90% CI 00, 06 ];SRMR = 02, WRMR = 52);In addition, the factor loadings were large and significant (from 68 to 87) The five CAS items showed acceptable corrected total test item correlations (from 64 to 74) Reliability due to internal consistency was good ( = 0 89;ordinal = 0 89) The validity evidence based on the relationship with other CAS variables was supported by the positive correlation with depression (r = 52, p 01) and negative with subjective well-being (r = - 50, p 01) Furthermore, depression mediates the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and subjective well-being (bootstrap value = - 24, 95% CI = - 28, - 20) Conclusion: The Spanish version of the CAS has evidence of validity and reliability to measure anxiety by COVID-19 in a sample of Peruvian university students","output":"Spanish translation and validation of a brief measure of anxiety by the COVID-19 in students of health sciences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic thrust health care professionals around the globe to the frontlines to care for those affected by this medical crisis.

They are generally many folds costlier than other OADs. This is a simulatory analysis to assess the incremental cost escalation and risk reduction with their hypothetical substitution/addition in prescriptions of high-risk patients. Methods A simple simulation of cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using prescriptions of T2DM patients with established cardiovascular (CV) or renal disease or high-risk factors. SGLT-2 and DPP-IV inhibitors with proven benefits/safety were substituted or added in place of other OADs. Increments in treatment costs were calculated, and the anticipated decrease in hazards was extrapolated from cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) and real-world studies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results Prescriptions of 351 patients with a mean age of 58.04  8.67 years were analyzed. The median annual acquisition cost of drug therapy for diabetes per patient was found to be Indian national rupee (INR) 8,964.4 for the original prescriptions when calculated using median retail prices of drugs prescribed for diabetes. Upon substituting one of the SGLT-2 inhibitors for the other OADs in the regimen, the cost increased to INR 12,265 (increase by 36.8%) for dapagliflozin, and INR 26,718 and INR 29,419 (increase by ~200%), respectively, for canagliflozin and empagliflozin. Upon calculating the ICERs, additional cost to prevent one all-cause death with dapagliflozin substitution is INR 660,020-25,384,369; INR 2,223,326 with empagliflozin substitution and INR 8,069,818 with canagliflozin substitution. The ICER for prevention of hospitalization with HF with dapagliflozin substitution is INR 1,320,040-1,435,543; INR 4,010,706 with empagliflozin and INR 5,548,000 with canagliflozin. To prevent a three-point major adverse cardiac event (3P-MACE), INR 2,062,562 would be needed with dapagliflozin substitution, and INR 3,146,861 and INR 3,859,478 with empagliflozin and canagliflozin, respectively. Incremental costs for various outcomes were higher with the addition of SGLT-2 inhibitors and significantly more if substitution with sitagliptin/linagliptin was also done. The numbers needed to treat were calculated too and ranged from 35 to 1,831 for various outcomes and drugs. Conclusion While the recommendations for use of SGLT-2 and DPP-IV inhibitors are adequately backed by evidence from CVOTs and real-world data, the incremental costs per event reduction are quite high for most outcomes in the Indian context. Dapagliflozin, being available as cheaper generic versions, appears to be most effective for most outcomes.

These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China.RESULTSThe median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;.

OBJECTIVE To report the first clinical experience with the HydroFill coil, focusing on safety and effectiveness, with immediate and long term follow-up on cases performed at a single institution by a single operator. METHODS Retrospective angiographic and clinical analysis was performed on a non-randomized single arm registry of the first consecutive 11 patients with 14 intracranial saccular aneurysms treated during a 9 month period. RESULTS The immediate angiographic occlusion rate according to the Raymond scale was 100%. Overall packing density of all coils used was 13-135% (mean 64%). The immediate complication rate was 9% (1/11 patients), secondary to a parent vessel occlusion which resolved after intravenous administration of eptifibatide (Integrilin) without neurological sequelae. The angiographic/MR angiography follow-up period for this series was 13-30 months, with an overall complete occlusion rate of 86% (12/14 aneurysms). 2/14 aneurysms (14%) converted from complete occlusion to filling of small neck remnants.

The transition rates between the different compartments are defined by certain parameters that are specific for the respective virus. Often, these parameters are known from the literature or can be determined using statistics. However, the contact rate or the related effective reproduction number are in general not constant in time and thus cannot easily be determined. Here, a new machine learning approach based on physics-informed neural networks is presented that can learn the contact rate from given data for the dynamical systems given by the SIR and SEIR models. The new method generalizes an already known approach for the identification of constant parameters to the variable or time-dependent case. After introducing the new method, it is tested for synthetic data generated by the numerical solution of SIR and SEIR models. The case of exact and perturbed data is considered. In all cases, the contact rate can be learned very satisfactorily. Finally, the SEIR model in combination with physics-informed neural networks is used to learn the contact rate for COVID-19 data given by the course of the epidemic in Germany. The simulation of the number of infected individuals over the course of the epidemic, using the learned contact rate, shows a very promising accordance with the data.","output":"Estimating the Time-dependent Contact Rate of Sir and Seir Models in Mathematical Epidemiology Using Physics-informed Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Both intrauterine and intrapartum mother-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported. However, there is still disagreement as to the likelihood and frequency of such vertical transmission. OBJECTIVE: Summarize and analyze the published evidence on forms of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission (either intrauterine or intrapartum). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We carried out a review of literature published in English and Spanish from January 1, 2020 through October 30, 2020. Search engines included PubMed/MEDLINE, SciELO, LILACS, Cochrane, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and medRxiv. There were no restrictions concerning type of study. The review included 48 original research articles, 11 review articles, a meta-analysis, 2 pre-published articles, 15 systematic reviews, and 10 editorials or comments. DEVELOPMENT: Medical thinking on congenital or intrapartum maternal-fetal/neonatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has evolved from preliminary evidence that was divided as to whether these forms of vertical transmission were even possible to current evidence support ing both forms of transmission and hypothesizing as to the mechanisms that guide them. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in maternal, placental, fetal or neonatal tissues has been demonstrated by RT-PCR, specific immunoglobulin detection tests, immunostaining and in-situ hybridization. It is estimated that infections acquired either congenitally or intrapartum occur in 1.8%-8.0% of newborns born to women who test positive for COVID-19 at the end of their pregnancies. This review found 53 neonates who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first 48 hours of life by either RT-PCR or specific IgM tests. According to criteria outlined in this review, the timing of infection corresponded to congenital or intrapartum transmission in 39.6% (21/53) of COVID-19-positive newborns, to postpartum transmission in 15.1% (8/53) and remains unspecified in 45.3% (24/53). CONCLUSIONS: Congenital and intrapartum SARS-CoV-2 infection in the fetus/newborn is possible, but rare. International collaborative studies using common epidemiological surveillance instruments would allow for a more precise specification of the frequency of congenital and intrapartum SARS-CoV-2 infection at the population level.","output":"Congenital and Intrapartum SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Neonates: Hypotheses, Evidence and Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the WHO. The structures of social contact critically determine the spread of the infection and, in the absence of vaccines, the control of these structures through large-scale social distancing measures appears to be the most effective means of mitigation. Here we use an age-structured SIR model with social contact matrices obtained from surveys and Bayesian imputation to study the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic in India. The basic reproductive ratio R0 and its time-dependent generalization are computed based on case data, age distribution and social contact structure. The impact of social distancing measures - workplace non-attendance, school closure, lockdown - and their efficacy with durations are then investigated. A three-week lockdown is found insufficient to prevent a resurgence and, instead, protocols of sustained lockdown with periodic relaxation are suggested. Forecasts are provided for the reduction in age-structured morbidity and mortality as a result of these measures.

METHODS: Clinical researchers have an obligation to help, and we can. Recommendations for clinical researchers working with older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. RESULTS: Implement technology now: Minimize face-to-face contact with participants by utilizing digital tools, such as shifting to electronic informed consent and digital HIPAA-compliant tools such as e-mailed surveys or telehealth assessments. Assess the psychological and social impact of COVID-19: How are participants coping? What health or social behaviors have changed? How are they keeping up with current events? What are they doing to stay connected to their families, friends, and communities? Are their healthcare needs being met? Current studies should be adapted immediately to these ends. Mobilize research platforms for patient needs: Leverage our relationships with participants and rapidly deploy novel clinical engagement techniques such as digital tools to intervene remotely and reduce the negative effects of social isolation on our participants. Equip research staff with tangible resources, and provide timely population-specific health information to support patients and healthcare providers.

Although vaccines effectively prevent infection in most cases, some cases of post-vaccination infections have been reported, raising concerns about vaccine efficacy. This study investigated the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing and reducing the severity of post-vaccination infections (PVI) among HCWs.Methods: This observational study examined 28342 vaccinated HCWs with SARS-CoV-2 (symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infections during the initial five months of vaccination (January 16-June 15, 2021). They worked at 43 Apollo Group hospitals in 24 Indian cities. PVI was investigated after recombinant ChAdOx nCOV-19 (Recombinant) or the whole virion inactivated Vero cell vaccines were administered. Various parameters were evaluated such as age, sex, time to infection, type of vaccine, infections after a single and two doses, monthly and regional case distribution, clinical severity of infection, hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) requirement, and death.Findings: Symptomatic PVIs occurred in a low percentage of vaccinated cohorts (5?07%, p<0?001), and these were predominantly mild and did not result in hospitalization, ICU admissions (p<0?0001), or death. Both vaccines provided similar protection, with PVI incidences of 5?11% and 4?58%, following ChAdOx nCOV-19 (Recombinant) and the whole virion inactivated Vero cell vaccines, respectively (p<0?001). Nursing and Clinical staff and cohorts>50 years significantly contracted more infections(p<0?001 and p=0?001, respectively). Two-dose vaccination has significantly lower odds of developing PVI (0.83, 95%CI C 0.72 to 0.97).

DESIGN A systematic review of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials. METHODS We searched the following data sources: CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL up to February 2016. A search of reference lists of included studies and Google Scholar (first 200 citations published online between 2000 and February 2016) was also undertaken. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool (EPHPP). 2 study authors independently screened and extracted data with disagreements resolved via consensus. RESULTS Of the 5167 studies identified, 3 were eligible and included in the review. Trial designs of included studies were 2 randomised controlled trials and 1 non-randomised controlled trial. 2 studies received a weak methodological rating and 1 received a moderate methodological rating. The trials examine the impact of the following interventions: (1) nurse delivered cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) via telephone and accompanied by a workbook, combined with pharmacotherapy; (2) nurse and physician brief advice to quit and information booklets combined with pharmacotherapy; and (3) surgeon delivered enhanced advice to quit smoking augmented by booster sessions. Only the trial of the nurse delivered CBT and pharmacotherapy reported significant increases in smoking cessation rates. 1 study measured quit attempts and the other assessed consumption of cigarettes per day and readiness to change. There was no significant improvement in quit attempts or cigarettes smoked per day among patients in the intervention groups, relative to control.

This paper suggests a fuzzy rule-based approach to model and to forecast interval-valued time series. The model is a collection of functional fuzzy rules with affine consequents capable to express the nonlinear relationships encountered in interval-valued data. An application concerning one-step-ahead forecast of interval-valued EUR/USD exchange rate using actual data is also addressed. The forecast performance of the fuzzy rule-based model is compared to that of traditional econometric time series methods and alternative interval models employing statistical criteria for both, low and high exchange rate prices.

Healthcare services such as renal transplantation had to rapidly adjust and meet the needs to (1) protect patients and staff, (2) ramp up, conserve or redeploy resources while (3) ensuring that critical services remained operational. This paper aims to describe the experience of the renal transplant programme at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) in responding to the risks and constraints posed by the pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a review and summary of the SGH renal transplant programme's policy and protocols that were either modified or developed in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. RESULTS: A multi-pronged approach was adopted to respond to the challenges of COVID-19. These included ensuring business continuity by splitting the transplant team into different locations, adopting video and tele-consults to minimise potential patient exposure to COVID-19, streamlining work processes using electronic forms, ensuring safe paths for patients who needed to come to hospital, ring-fencing and testing new inpatients at risk for COVID-19, enhancing precautionary measures for transplant surgery, ensuring a stable supply chain of immunosuppression, and sustaining patient and staff education programmes via video conferencing. CONCLUSIONS: Though the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced access to kidney transplantation, opportunities arose to adopt telemedicine into mainstream transplant practice as well as use electronic platforms to streamline work processes.

OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary microvascular injury and thrombosis are increasingly reported as constitutive features of COVID-19 respiratory failure. Our aim was to study pulmonary mechanics and gas exchanges in COVID-2019 ARDS patients studied early after initiating protective invasive mechanical ventilation, seeking after corresponding pathophysiological and biological characteristics. METHODS: Between March 22 and March 30, 2020 respiratory mechanics, gas exchanges, circulating endothelial cells (CEC) as markers of endothelial damage, and D-dimers were studied in 22 moderate-to-severe COVID-19 ARDS patients, 1 [1C4] day after intubation (median [IQR]). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen moderate and 9 severe COVID-19 ARDS patients were studied after initiation of high PEEP protective mechanical ventilation. We observed moderately decreased respiratory system compliance: 39.5 [33.1C44.7] mL/cmH(2)O and end-expiratory lung volume: 2100 [1721C2434] mL. Gas exchanges were characterized by hypercapnia 55 [44C62] mmHg, high physiological dead-space (V(D)/V(T)): 75 [69C85.5] % and ventilatory ratio (VR): 2.9 [2.2C3.4].

CECs and D-dimers were elevated as compared to normal values: 24 [12C46] cells per mL and 1483 [999C2217] ng/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We observed early in the course of COVID-19 ARDS high V(D)/V(T) in association with biological markers of endothelial damage and thrombosis. High V(D)/V(T) can be explained by high PEEP settings and added instrumental dead space, with a possible associated role of COVID-19-triggered pulmonary microvascular endothelial damage and microthrombotic process.","output":"Respiratory mechanics and gas exchanges in the early course of COVID-19 ARDS: a hypothesis-generating study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 causes severe respiratory and multiorgan failure, including liver damage and elevated transaminase levels.

The evidence outside the UK and a real-world comparison of variants spread and mortality is sparse. This study aims at investigating the association between COVID-19 mortality and SARS-COV-2 variants spread during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. METHODS: For 38 European countries, publicly available data were collected on numbers of COVID-19 deaths, SARS-COV-2 variants spread through time using Nextstrain classification and countries demographic and health characteristics. The cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths and the height of COVID-19 daily deaths peak during the second wave of the pandemic were considered as outcomes. Pearson correlations and multivariate generalized linear models with selection algorithms were used. FINDINGS: The average proportion of 20I/501Y.V1 variant (B.1.1.7) was found to be a significant predictor of cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths within two months before the deaths peak and between 1 January - 25 February 2021, as well as of the deaths peak height when calculating the proportion during the second wave and the pre-peak period. The average proportion of 20A.EU2 variant (S:477N) was a significant predictor of cumulative COVID-19 deaths in the pre-peak period. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that the spread of a new variant of concern 20I/501Y.V1 had a significant impact on the mortality during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and that proportions of 20A.EU2 and 20I/501Y.V1 variants were associated with increased mortality in the initial phase of that wave.

No data exist regarding its impact on PM2.5 pollution. We aimed to assess PM2.5 levels before, during, and after lockdown (7 March 2020-16 May 2020) in Volos, one of Greece's most polluted industrialized cities, and compare PM2.5 levels with those obtained during the same period last year. Meteorological conditions were examined as confounders. METHODS: The study period was discriminated into three phases (pre-lockdown: 7 March-9 March, lockdown: 10 March-4 May, and post-lockdown period: 5 May-16 May). A wireless sensors network was used to collect PM2.5, temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind speed data every 2 s. RESULTS: The lockdown resulted in a significant drop of PM2.5 by 37.4% in 2020, compared to 2019 levels. The mean daily concentrations of PM2.5 exceeded the WHO's guideline value for 24-h mean levels of PM2.5 35% of the study period. During the strictest lockdown (23 March to 4 May), the mean daily PM2.5 levels exceeded the standard 41% of the time. The transition from the pre-lockdown period into lockdown or post-lockdown periods was associated with lower PM2.5 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in the mean daily PM2.5 concentration was found compared to 2019.

Conventionally, antigens are conjugated to scaffolds through genetic fusion or chemical conjugation, which may result in impaired assembly or heterogeneous binding and orientation of the antigens. By combining two emerging technologiesi.e., self-assembling multimeric protein scaffold particles (MPSPs) and bacterial supergluethese shortcomings can be overcome and antigens can be bound on particles in their native conformation. In the present work, we assessed whether this technology could improve the immunogenicity of a candidate subunit vaccine against the zoonotic Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). For this, the head domain of glycoprotein Gn, a known target of neutralizing antibodies, was coupled on various MPSPs to further assess immunogenicity and efficacy in vivo. The results showed that the Gn head domain, when bound to the lumazine synthase-based MPSP, reduced mortality in a lethal mouse model and protected lambs, the most susceptible RVFV target animals, from viremia and clinical signs after immunization. Furthermore, the same subunit coupled to two other MPSPs (Geobacillus stearothermophilus E2 or a modified KDPG Aldolase) provided full protection in lambs as well.","output":"Vaccine Efficacy of Self-Assembled Multimeric Protein Scaffold Particles Displaying the Glycoprotein Gn Head Domain of Rift Valley Fever Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic Germany missed to set up efficient containment measures. Consequently, the number of cases increased exponentially until a lockdown was implemented to suppress the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Fortunately, Germany has a high capability for coronavirus lab testing and more than 30,000 ICU beds. These capabilities and the lockdown turned out to be an advantage to combat the pandemic and to prevent a health-system overload. AIM: The aim was to predict the plateau day of SARS-CoV-2 infections or deaths. RESULTS: The effect on the viral spread of the German measures taken and the impact on the peak of new infection cases is shown. By normalizing daily case numbers, the plateau day of the current outbreak in Germany could be calculated to be reached at April 12, 2020 (day 103 of 2020). CONCLUSION: Normalized case number curves are helpful to predict the time point at which no further new infections will occur if the epidemic situation remains stable. Upon reaching the plateau day during a lockdown phase, a residual time-period of about 2-3 weeks can be utilized to prepare a safe unlocking period. As can be learned from Asian countries such as South Korea and Taiwan there must be strict rules to keep the risk of infection low. Those include social distancing, face mask wearing in combination with digital contact tracing and serosurveillance studies. Following those rules, a safe dance around the infection curve allows to keep the population at a reduced infection rate.","output":"How we should respond to the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 outbreak: A German perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Suture ligation with subsequent cutting of blood vessels to maintain hemostasis during surgery is time consuming and skill intensive. Energy-based electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices are often used to replace sutures and mechanical clips to provide rapid hemostasis and decrease surgery time. Some of these devices may create undesirably large collateral zones of thermal damage and tissue necrosis, or require separate mechanical blades for cutting. Infrared lasers are currently being explored as alternative energy sources for vessel sealing applications. In a previous study, a 1470-nm laser was used to seal vessels 1 to 6 mm in diameter in 5 s, yielding burst pressures of 500 mmHg. The purpose of this study was to provide vessel sealing times comparable with current energy-based devices, incorporate transection of sealed vessels, and demonstrate high vessel burst pressures to provide a safety margin for future clinical use. A 110-W, 1470-nm laser beam was transmitted through a fiber and beam shaping optics, producing a 90-W linear beam 3.0 by 9.5 mm for sealing (400 W/cm2), and 1.1 by 9.6 mm for cutting (1080 W/cm2). A two-step process sealed and then transected ex vivo porcine renal vessels (1.5 to 8.5 mm diameter) in a bench top setup. Seal and cut times were 1.0 s each. A burst pressure system measured seal strength, and histologic measurements of lateral thermal spread were also recorded. All blood vessels tested (n=55 seal samples) were sealed and cut, with total irradiation times of 2.0 s and mean burst pressures of 1305783 mmHg. Additional unburst vessels were processed for histological analysis, showing a lateral thermal spread of 0.940.48 mm (n=14 seal samples). This study demonstrated that an optical-based system is capable of precisely sealing and cutting a wide range of porcine renal vessel sizes and, with further development, may provide an alternative to radiofrequency- and ultrasonic-based vessel sealing devices.","output":"Rapid sealing and cutting of porcine blood vessels, ex vivo, using a high-power, 1470-nm diode laser."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is currently regarded as the next major advance in the progress of minimally invasive techniques in colorectal surgery.

Cancer-associated immunosuppression may hinder in the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Data regarding baseline characteristics (age, cancer type, cancer activity, cancer treatment), COVID-19 infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were collected from p with solid tumors who tested positive for COVID-19 (PCR+) between 10th March and 9th December 2020 at Catalan Institute of Oncology. We prospectively assessed anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence at different timepoints (<2, 2-6, >6 months [m] since first PCR+) and explored factors associated with long-term IgG positivity. Results: Out of 79 registered p, 19 died without IgG testing (all of them <3 months after a PCR+), and 8 refused to participate, leaving 52 tested for IgG. Tested and not-tested p were similar according to baseline characteristics, cancer treatment and COVID-19. At the 1st timepoint, 19/23p were IgG+;at the 2nd, 29/33p were IgG+ and 1 inconclusive;at the 3rd timepoint, 18/22 were IgG+ (median time from PCR + to 3rd timepoint determination was 9.4 m (Interquartile range [IQR]: 8.5-9.7).

Methods: An anonymous, online survey of frontline healthcare workers examined work environment, psychological wellbeing, and contained four open-ended qualitative items. Using a mixed method approach, quantitative data were analysed descriptively and qualitative data were analysed using content analysis. Results: This paper reports findings from 95 paramedics who provided complete quantitative data and 85 paramedics who provided free-text responses to at least one qualitative item. Objectively measured mental health symptoms were common among paramedics, and almost two thirds of paramedics self-reported experiencing burnout. Qualitative analysis highlighted key issues of safety and risk in the workplace, uncertainty and upheaval at work and at home, and lack of crisis preparedness. Qualitative analysis revealed four themes; the pervasiveness of COVID-19 disruptions across all life domains; the challenges of widespread disruption at work; risk, uncertainty and feeling unsafe at work, and the challenges of pandemic (un)preparedness across the health system.

The aim of this study was to measure the immediate impact of COVID-19 on surgical oncology practice volume. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients treated at an NCI-Comprehensive Cancer Center was performed. \\"Pre-COVID\\" era was defined as January-February 2020 and \\"COVID\\" as March-April 2020. Primary outcomes were clinic visits and operative volume by surgical oncology subspecialty. RESULTS: Abouyt 907 new patient visits, 3897 follow-up visits, and 644 operations occurred during the study period. All subspecialties experienced significant decreases in new patient visits during COVID, though soft tissue oncology (Mel/Sarc), gynecologic oncology (Gyn/Onc), and endocrine were disproportionately affected. Telehealth visits increased to 11.4% of all visits by April. Mel/Sarc, Gyn/Onc, and Breast experienced significant operative volume decreases during COVID (25.8%, p = 0.012, 43.6% p < 0.001, and 41.9%, p < 0.001, respectively), while endocrine had no change and gastrointestinal oncology had a slight increase (p = 0.823) in the number of cases performed.

This work focuses on assessing the content of tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) in acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC) and their polymer blends (i.e. PC/ABS). A total of 36 plastic housing samples originating from microwave ovens, electric irons, vacuum cleaners and DVD/CD players were subjected to microwave-assisted-extraction (MAE) and/or ultrasound-assisted-extraction (UAE). Maximum mean concentration values of TBBPA measured in DVD/CD players and vacuum cleaners ranged between 754-1146 g/kg, and varied per polymer type, as follows: 510-2515 g/kg in ABS and 55-3109 g/kg in PP. The results indicated that MAE was more sufficient than UAE in the extraction of TBBPA from ABS. To optimize the UAE procedure, various solvents were tested. Higher amounts of TBBPA were obtained from ABS and PP using a binary mixture of a polar-non-polar solvent, isopropanol:n-hexane (1:1), whereas the sole use of isopropanol exhibited incomplete extraction.","output":"Assessment of tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) content in plastic waste recovered from WEEE."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10 2196/25848 ]","output":"Correction: Adequacy of Web-Based Activities as a Substitute for In-Person Activities for Older Persons During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between attachment style, social support, and psychological distress (i.e., depression and anxiety) during the COVID-19 lockdown of the third wave in Israel. Specifically, we examined whether social support mediates the well-documented relationship between attachment style and psychological distress. Methods: An online survey was administered from 3 January to 6 February, 2021, while a strict lockdown was in place. The sample included 288 Israelis ranging between the ages of 18C78, recruited by snowball sampling. Psychological distress was evaluated by Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7);attachment style by the Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR-36), and social support by the Multi-dimensional Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). A mediation model was applied with social support mediating the association between attachment style and depression and anxiety. Results: Significant correlations were found between attachment style and psychological distress, and between social support and psychological distress. Social support partially mediated the associations between attachment style and psychological distress (Depression: p < 0.001, confidence interval [CI] = 0.4018, 1.7468;Anxiety: p < 0.001, confidence interval [CI] = 0.0493, 0.9822). These results remained the same while controlling for age. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the secure attachment style serves as a protective factor against psychological distress and vice versa;insecure attachment style serves as a risk factor for developing psychological distress during a peak period of COVID-19. Nevertheless, social support played a central role in the association between attachment style and psychological distress, thus, individuals with an insecure attachment may thus be helped by offering them social support during a crisis, which in turn may increase their well-being.","output":"Social Support Mediates the Association between Attachment Style and Psychological Distress during COVID-19 in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telehealth has been shown to have comparable health outcomes in terms of patient-physician communication, and patient satisfaction and engagement Nevertheless, the digital divide has exacerbated the social and economic factors that create barriers to health and well-being It, therefore, maybe a social determinant of health (SDOH) Such issues as decreased internet connectivity and a lack of Wi-Fi and video chat/webcam in both urban and rural areas can hinder the effectiveness of telehealth to its full capability, especially among communities of color, the poor, and medically underserved The social aspects of the provision of health care by physicians and health care workers are utilized to combat mistrust and strengthen the physician-patient therapeutic relationship Addressing policy changes to address the digital divide as a SDOH may strengthen existing health care and public health systems to allow for patient and community-centered approaches to expressing lived narratives, including in a digital format","output":"Telehealth and the digital divide as a social determinant of health during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Medical education research often focuses on measuring negative mental states like burnout, rather than focusing on positive states like well-being. Flourishing C a state that includes domains of happiness and mental health - is a way of thinking about well-being that may be relevant to education and research. The purpose of this prospective, observational study was to compare the relationship among flourishing, other well-being measures, and burnout in medical students via a survey administered at two time points. Methods: : We surveyed medical students at one U.S. institution about their flourishing, satisfaction with work-life balance, quality of life, empathic concern, and burnout (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization) before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Flourishing was measured using two scores, the Flourish Index (FI) and Secure Flourish Index (SFI), with higher scores indicating greater flourishing. Pre- and post-scores for both measures were compared. Results: : 107/585 (18%) medical students responded to the survey and 78/107 (73%) participated in the post survey.

DESIGN: Multicenter cohort study. SETTING: Intensive care units at 68 geographically diverse hospitals across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Critically ill adults (age 18 years) with laboratory confirmed covid-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital cardiac arrest within 14 days of admission to an intensive care unit and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 5019 critically ill patients with covid-19, 14.0% (701/5019) had in-hospital cardiac arrest, 57.1% (400/701) of whom received cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Patients who had in-hospital cardiac arrest were older (mean age 63 (standard deviation 14) v 60 (15) years), had more comorbidities, and were more likely to be admitted to a hospital with a smaller number of intensive care unit beds compared with those who did not have in-hospital cardiac arrest. Patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation were younger than those who did not (mean age 61 (standard deviation 14) v 67 (14) years). The most common rhythms at the time of cardiopulmonary resuscitation were pulseless electrical activity (49.8%, 199/400) and asystole (23.8%, 95/400). 48 of the 400 patients (12.0%) who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation survived to hospital discharge, and only 7.0% (28/400) survived to hospital discharge with normal or mildly impaired neurological status. Survival to hospital discharge differed by age, with 21.2% (11/52) of patients younger than 45 years surviving compared with 2.9% (1/34) of those aged 80 or older.

However, there is little evidence about its use in the prehospital environment. This study explores clinician awareness and experiences of this in a large ambulance service in south east England. Methods: An online survey was distributed to 3377 operational ambulance clinicians working for the South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust to assess their awareness of using the prone position for patients with suspected COVID-19 and their experiences of its use in their practice. Results: A total of 278 respondents completed the survey, of whom 229 were aware of the use of the prone position for awake patients with COVID-19 and 18 had attempted to use it in their practice. Ten reported improvements in clinical observations and patient comfort, and six patients showed clinical improvement only. There were no reports of deterioration. The most common reason for not attempting prone positioning was the absence of formal training or guidance. Conclusion: Ambulance clinicians are aware of the use of the prone position for patients with COVID-19 and a small number have used it. The majority of clinicians who were aware of the procedure did not use it because of the lack of guidance or concerns over patient safety. When attempted, prone positioning in prehospital practice may be an example of practice borne of 'clinical courage'.

METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched through April 04, 2020, for published English language studies. Studies were eligible if they included immunocompetent patients with up to 14 days of viral pneumonia. Subjects had a respiratory tract sample test positive for COVID-19, adenovirus, influenza A, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, or respiratory syncytial virus. We only included observational studies and case series with more than ten patients. The pooled prevalence of each chest CT pattern or finding was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: From 2263 studies identified, 33 were eligible for inclusion, with a total of 1911 patients (COVID-19, n = 934; non-COVID, n = 977). Frequent CT features for both COVID-19 and non-COVID viral pneumonia were a mixed pattern of ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation (COVID-19, 0.37; 0.17C0.56; non-COVID, 0.46; 0.35C0.58) or predominantly GGO pattern (COVID-19, 0.42; 0.28C0.55; non-COVID 0.25; 0.17C0.32), bilateral distribution (COVID-19, 0.81; 0.77C0.85; non-COVID, 0.69; 0.54C0.84), and involvement of lower lobes (COVID-19, 0.88; 0.80C0.95; non-COVID, 0.61; 0.50C0.82).

The structural device-device and device-artery interactions arising during aortic arch parallel endografting, also known as chimney thoracic endovascular aortic repair (ch-TEVAR), is not well understood. Through the use of a radial force testing system we sought to characterise both the loading and deformation behaviour of parallel endografts in representative ch-TEVAR configurations. Four commercially available devices (Bentley BeGraft, Gore TAG, Gore Viabahn, and Medtronic Valiant) were subjected to uniform radial load individually, and in six combinations, to quantify loading profiles. Image data collected during testing were analysed to evaluate mechanical deformations in terms of gutters, chimney and main endograft compression, as well as graft infolding. Parallel endografting was found to increase radial loads when compared to standard TEVAR. Chronic outward force during ch-TEVAR was dependent on main endograft manufacturer, with TAG combinations leading to consistently higher loads than Valiant, but independent of chimney graft type. Endograft deformations were dependent on chimney graft type, with Viabahn combinations presenting with lower gutter areas and increased lumen compression than BeGraft. Chimney graft deformations were also influenced by deployment arrangement in the case of double ch-TEVAR. This study emphasizes the significant variability in both radial loads and mechanical deformations between clinically relevant ch-TEVAR configurations.","output":"Thoracic aortic parallel stent-graft behaviour when subjected to radial loading."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 25-year-old pregnant woman (gestational age: 24 weeks) presented with severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection.

However, there is a lack of research that explores occupation-centred education from the perspectives of students. Therefore, this study aimed to identify Australian entry-level occupational therapy students' experiences of learning about occupation, and its place in practice. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design was adopted. Overall, 20 students participated in four focus groups lasting between 45 and 75 min. Data were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed in two phases, using reflexive thematic analysis. FINDINGS: There were three themes that encapsulated what helped students to better understand occupation and its place in practice: (1) making occupation real; (2) relating occupation to me; and (3) theory as a focussing lens. There was also a range of pedagogical strategies that helped students to better understand occupation: using active and interactive teaching and learning strategies. One additional theme indicated a challenge to helping the students understand occupation and its place practice: when practice education settings were not centred on occupation. CONCLUSION: Learning about occupation and occupation-centred practice may be facilitated by using practice examples, encouraging students to think about occupation in their own lives, teaching and applying occupation-centred theory, and employing interactive learning and teaching strategies. Student learning in practice settings where occupational therapy is centred on occupation is imperative.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted patterns of movement, livelihoods and health seeking, and the effects on internal, temporary migrants are unclear. Using longitudinal data spanning 2018 to 2020, this paper employs descriptive statistics and regression analyses to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on a cohort of 2971 persons aged 18C40 at baseline, both residents and migrants, from a rural district in South Africa's northeast. In contrast with 2018C2019, in 2020 the share of rural residents initiating a migration decreased by 11 percentage points (p<0.001), while the share of temporary migrants returning to origin households increased by 5 percentage points (p<0.001). Study participants who were continuing migrants reported fewer job losses in comparison with rural-stayers, while 76% of return migrants who were employed in 2019 were no longer employed in 2020. Further, among those who did not experience food shortages in 2019, rural-stayers had 1.42 times the odds of continuing migrants of suffering shortages in 2020. In 2020 health service use in the cohort decreased overall, with return migrants having still lower odds of utilising health services. The results highlight the differential geographic and socioeconomic manifestations of the pandemic, with worsening socioeconomic circumstances observed for rural-staying (disproportionately female) and returning populations, while continuing migrants fared relatively better. It is vital that a COVID-19 response considers the potentially heterogeneous impact of the pandemic on mobile and stable populations. Policy responses may include targeting migrants at their destinations in health promotion of COVID-19 messaging, and strengthening health care and social support in origin communities in recognition that these areas receive return migrants into their catchment population.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on a cohort of origin residents and internal migrants from South Africa's rural northeast"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To summarize key contributions to current research in the field of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) and to select best papers published in 2020. Method: A bibliographic search using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors and free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus meeting between two section editors and the editorial team was organized to finally conclude on the selected four best papers. Results: Among the 877 papers published in 2020 and returned by the search, there were four best papers selected. The first best paper describes a method for mining temporal sequences from clinical documents to infer disease trajectories and enhancing high-throughput phenotyping. The authors of the second best paper demonstrate that the generation of synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) data through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) could be substantially improved by more appropriate training and evaluation criteria. The third best paper offers an efficient advance on methods to detect adverse drug events by computer-assisting expert reviewers with annotated candidate mentions in clinical documents. The large-scale data quality assessment study reported by the fourth best paper has clinical research informatics implications, in terms of the trustworthiness of inferences made from analysing electronic health records.

More broadly, sex differences in infectious and inflammatory processes are well known, with women tending to mount stronger immune responses than men. Although there is evidence that sex hormone signaling is immunomodulatory, including downregulation of immune/inflammatory responses by androgens, the existence of numerous other physiologic differences between the sexes leads to great uncertainty in attributing worse infectious disease outcomes in men to androgen signaling. No definitive genetic data exist to support androgen-mediated immune suppression for viral susceptibility, nor for adrenal androgens. Here we show an association between inheritance of the common adrenal-permissive missense-encoding variant HSD3B1(1245C), that enables androgen synthesis from adrenal precursors10, and susceptibility to COVID. The adrenal-permissive HSD3B1(1245C) has previously been linked to suppression of inflammation in severe asthma. In analysis of COVID test results from the UK Biobank, we show that in older ([a?] 70 years of age) subjects, the adrenal-permissive variant is associated with a greater chance of being COVID-positive. The effect increases with the number of HSD3B1(1245C) alleles inherited and is greater in females such that increasing androgen synthesis confers risk approaching males. Our study suggests that a common androgen synthesis variant regulates immune susceptibility to COVID infection as well as potentially other immune and inflammatory processes.","output":"A common androgen synthesis variant is associated with COVID susceptibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-Performing assets have become a significant issue for the banking and financial sector in Nepal.

However, GGOs are also seen in other acute lung diseases, thus making challenging the differential diagnosis. To this aim, we investigated the performance of a radiomics-based machine learning method to discriminate GGOs due to COVID-19 from those due to other acute lung diseases. Two sets of patients were included: a first set of 28 patients (COVID) diagnosed with COVID-19 infection confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between March and April 2020 having (a) baseline HRCT at hospital admission and (b) predominant GGOs pattern on HRCT; a second set of 30 patients (nCOVID) showing (a) predominant GGOs pattern on HRCT performed between August 2019 and April 2020 and (b) availability of final diagnosis. Two readers independently segmented GGOs on HRCTs using a semi-automated approach, and radiomics features were extracted using a standard open source software (PyRadiomics). Partial least square (PLS) regression was used as the multivariate machine-learning algorithm. A leave-one-out nested cross-validation was implemented. PLS -weights of radiomics features, including the 5% features with the largest -weights in magnitude (top 5%), were obtained. The diagnostic performance of the radiomics model was assessed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The Youdens test assessed sensitivity and specificity of the classification.

Our experiments show that autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) can reliably model the increase in the number of confirmed cases and can predict future cases. Secondly, a number of classifiers are used to predict whether a COVID-19 patient needs to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) or semi-ICU. For this, classification algorithms are applied to a dataset having 5644 samples. Using this dataset, the most significant attributes are selected using features selection by ExtraTrees classifier, and Proteina C reativa (mg/dL) is found to be the highest-ranked feature.

For those genetically predisposed to engage in low PA, a behavioral intervention may target a malleable factor that mediates genetic predisposition to low PA (i.e., intermediate phenotype) to mitigate the genetic influences. In a non-randomized exercise promotion pilot study, we test the feasibility of examining affective response to PA (how one feels during PA) as an intermediate phenotype between genetic variation and PA adherence. We hypothesized that three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs8044769 and rs3751812 in FTO; rs6265 in BDNF), identified from a prior systematic review, would be predictive of affective response to PA, and that affective response to PA would mediate the SNP-PA link. Forty five healthy, low-active adults received a 12-week print-based PA promotion program. Baseline affective response to PA was assessed using the Feeling Scale, a single-item measure of affective valence. Moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was assessed using accelerometers pre- and post-intervention. We examined the three SNPs in a weighted genetic score. Age, sex, body mass index, race, and neighborhood walkability were potential covariates. Affective response to PA and MVPA at follow-up (minutes/day over 4-7 days) were regressed on variation in SNPs, controlling for covariates. One unit increase in genetic score was associated with a 0.14 higher mean Feeling Scale, though was not statistically significant (p = 0.13). Among individual SNPs, having an additional FTO rs8044769 C allele was associated with a mean Feeling Scale score of 0.53 units higher (p = 0.015), which was statistically significant after applying the corrected p-value of 0.016. The genetic score or individual SNPs were not predictive of MVPA 12 weeks later, thereby mediation analyses were not performed.

Materials and methods: This retrospective study analyzed the relationship between initial chest X-rays and initial laboratory tests in symptomatic adults with nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results positive for SARS-CoV-2 seen at our center between February 29 and March 23, 2020. Among other radiologic findings, we analyzed ground-glass opacities, consolidations, linear opacities, and pleural effusion. We also used a scale of radiologic severity to assess the distribution and extent of these findings. Among initial laboratory findings, we analyzed leukocytes, lymphocytes, platelets, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and C-reactive protein. Results: Of 761 symptomatic patients, 639 (84%) required hospitalization and 122 were discharged to their homes. The need for admission increased with increasing scores on the scale of radiologic severity. The extent of initial lung involvement was significantly associated with the laboratory parameters analyzed (p<0.05 for platelets, p<0.01 for lymphocytes, and p<0.001 for the remaining parameters), as well as with the time from the onset of symptoms (p<0.001). Conclusion: It can be useful to use a scale of radiologic severity to classify chest X-ray findings in diagnosing patients with COVID-19, because the greater the radiologic severity, the greater the need for hospitalization and the greater the alteration in laboratory parameters.","output":"Neumona COVID-19: relacin entre la radiografa de trax inicial y los datos analticos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Orientation: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought to the forefront the need for industrial-organisational psychologists (IOPs) and organisations to place an emphasis on employees mental and physical health at all times Research purpose: The purpose of the research was to determine how prepared IOPs are to counsel employees during the pandemic and how responsive they are to provide counselling Motivation for the study: It is not clear to what extent such counselling is being practised by IOPs in the workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic Research approach/design and method: A qualitative approach was used to gain an understanding of registered South African IOPs experiences of workplace counselling, particularly during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic Main findings: Regarding preparedness, we found that IOPs are ill-prepared to counsel in the workplace Preparedness was influenced by participants counselling education, skills and knowledge;experience;convictions about counselling;and psychological and organisational preparedness Whilst some IOPs did engage in more counselling during the COVID-19 pandemic, most reverted to mitigating actions such as referrals, wellness management, equipping managers and change initiatives Practical/managerial implications: The results of this study indicate that, under pandemic conditions, there is an increased need for counselling practices within the workplace and that IOPs should explore the ways in which they could play a more active role in such counselling Contribution/value-add: Although we found that IOPs generally responded to employees mental health needs in a positive manner, there was a lack of counselling preparedness and responsiveness during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Counselling preparedness and responsiveness of industrial psychologists in the face of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: New York City was the epicenter of the outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States.

Although pregnant women are considered at risk for respiratory infections by other viruses, such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), little is known about their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, this study aims to identify and present the main studies on the topic, including the postpartum period. METHODS: In this narrative review, articles were searched in various databases, organizations, and health entities using keywords compatible with medical subject headings (MeSH), such as: COVID-19, pregnancy, vertical transmission, coronavirus 2019, and SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The review of the scientific literature on the subject revealed that pregnant women with COVID-19 did not present clinical manifestations significantly different from those of non-pregnant women; however, there are contraindicated therapies. Regarding fetuses, studies were identified that reported that infection by SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women can cause fetal distress, breathing difficulties and premature birth, but there is no substantial evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSION: Due to the lack of adequate information and the limitations of the analyzed studies, it is necessary to provide detailed clinical data on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 and on the maternal-fetal repercussions caused by this infection.

Two patients underwent total arch replacement for aneurysm. The blood flow of the optic nerve head was monitored with LSFG and the mean blur rate value was measured during the surgery. The LSFG could detect the blood flow quantitatively in the optic nerve head during both retrograde and antegrade cerebral perfusion; and the value was correlated with rSO2 value.","output":"Evaluation of cerebral circulation during retrograde perfusion by laser speckle flowgraphy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been shown previously in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that two point mutations, N15A and V25F, in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the envelope (E) protein abolished channel activity and led to in vivo attenuation. Pathogenicity was recovered in mutants that also regained E protein channel activity. In particular, V25F was rapidly compensated by changes at multiple V25F-facing TMD residues located on a neighboring monomer, consistent with a recovery of oligomerization. Here, we show using infected cells that the same mutations, T16A and A26F, in the gamma-CoV infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) lead to, in principle, similar results. However, IBV E A26F did not abolish oligomer formation and was compensated by mutations at N- and C-terminal extramembrane domains (EMDs). The C-terminal EMD mutations clustered along an insertion sequence specific to gamma-CoVs. Nuclear magnetic resonance data are consistent with the presence of only one TMD in IBV E, suggesting that recovery of channel activity and fitness in these IBV E revertant mutants is through an allosteric interaction between EMDs and TMD. The present results are important for the development of IBV live attenuated vaccines when channel-inactivating mutations are introduced in the E protein.IMPORTANCE The ion channel activity of SARS-CoV E protein is a determinant of virulence, and abolishment of channel activity leads to viral attenuation. E deletion may be a strategy for generating live attenuated vaccines but can trigger undesirable compensatory mechanisms through modifications of other viral proteins to regain virulence. Therefore, a more suitable approach may be to introduce small but critical attenuating mutations. For this, the stability of attenuating mutations should be examined to understand the mechanisms of reversion. Here, we show that channel-inactivating mutations of the avian infectious bronchitis virus E protein introduced in a recombinant virus system are deficient in viral release and fitness and that revertant mutations also restored channel activity. Unexpectedly, most of the revertant mutations appeared at extramembrane domains, particularly along an insertion specific for gammacoronaviruses. Our structural data propose a single transmembrane domain in IBV E, suggesting an allosteric interaction between extramembrane and transmembrane domains.","output":"Channel-Inactivating Mutations and Their Revertant Mutants in the Envelope Protein of Infectious Bronchitis Virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human temperature measurement system has been widely applying in hospitals and public areas during the widespread Covid-19 pandemic However, the current systems in the quarantine checkpoint are only capable of measuring the human temperature;however, it can not combine with the identification of facial recognition, human temperature information, and wearing mask detection In addition, in the hospitals as well as the public areas such as schools, libraries, train stations, airports, etc facial recognition of employees combined with temperature measurement and masking will save the time check and update employee status immediately This study proposes a method that combines body temperature measurement, facial recognition, and masking based on deep learning Furthermore, the proposed method adds the ability to prevent spoofing between a real face and face-in-image recognition A depth camera is used in the proposed system to measure and calculate the length between the human's face and camera to approach the best accuracy of facial recognition and anti-spoofing Moreover, a low-cost thermal camera measures the human body temperature The methodology and algorithm for the human face and body temperature recognition are validated through the experimental results ? 2020 ACM","output":"Human face recognition and temperature measurement based on deep learning for covid-19 quarantine checkpoint"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 continues to spread worldwide, severe disease and mortality have been observed in obese patients.

STUDY DESIGN: Data were drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, which starting in 1990 mailed questionnaires to 14,735 mothers in the UK, over 7 years from pregnancy onwards. Marginal structural models and multiple imputation were used to address time-varying confounding of the primary variables, testing for interaction between concurrent emotional/physical IPV and financial adversity, and adjusted for baseline age, ethnicity, education, partners alcohol use, parity, depression, and social class. RESULTS: Emotional IPV (HR 1.44 (1.13,1.84)), physical IPV (HR 2.05 (1.21,3.49)), and financial adversity (HR 1.59 (1.44,1.77)) each predicted a multiplicative increase in the discrete-time hazard of incident homelessness. We identified joint effects for concurrent emotional IPV and financial adversity (HR 2.09 (1.35,3.22)) and concurrent physical IPV and financial adversity (HR 2.79 (1.21,6.44)). We further identified a temporary decline in self-reported physical IPV among mothers during pregnancy and up to 8 months post-partum. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional and physical IPV and financial adversity independently and jointly increase the risk of incident homelessness. The effects of emotional and physical IPV are comparable to or greater than the risk of financial adversity. Homelessness prevention policies should consider IPV victims as high-risk, regardless of financial status. Furthermore, self-reported physical IPV declines temporarily during pregnancy and up to 8 months post-partum.

Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing-based risk alert systems to spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer the state of the COVID-19 propagation. CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas by inferring future propagation patterns. The CovidSens concept is motivated by three observations: (1) people have been actively sharing their state of health and experience of the COVID-19 via online social media, (2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting their observations and experiences about COVID-19 on social media, and (3) online users are frequently equipped with substantially capable mobile devices that are able to perform non-trivial on-device computation for data processing and analytics. We envision an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts generated by the ordinary people to build a real-time sensing and analytic system for gathering and circulating vital information of the COVID-19 propagation. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to distill reliable information about the COVID-19 with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the social media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the spread timely and effectively, and alert them to remain prepared? How to leverage the computational power on the edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, UAVs) to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms for rapid detection of the COVID-19 spread? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges in developing reliable social sensing-based risk alert systems. We envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines (e.g., AI, estimation theory, machine learning, constrained optimization) can be effective in addressing the challenges.

However, not all of these approaches could address COVID-19 rumor detection. COVID-19 rumors are more severe and profoundly influenced, and there are stricter time constraints on COVID-19 rumor detection.

However, few studies and reviews appear to have examined the provision and effects of anti-racist education and training on post-licensure healthcare workers. The purpose of this systematic literature review was to explore what research methods are being used to ascertain the training healthcare workers are receiving post-licensure and to identify the goals and outcomes of this training. METHODS: Using PubMed, CINAHL, and Google Scholar databases, peer-reviewed articles meeting inclusion criteria were identified and reviewed by the authors from March through October of 2020 in alignment with the renewed national focus on anti-racism and racial justice. Studies or initiatives involving students were excluded as were commentaries on studies and studies not specific to racism or anti-racism. RESULTS: Eleven articles were identified as meeting stipulated inclusion criteria. Few were outcome studies (n = 3), and many articles did not clearly delineate training methods, content, or outcomes assessed. Identified methods included group discussion, case studies, and online modules. Reported outcomes included increased self-awareness of implicit biases and racism. Only two studies focused specifically on nurses, with the majority of studies centering on physicians (n = 5). CONCLUSIONS: A considerable knowledge gap exists regarding effective methods, tools, and outcomes to use for undoing racism and mitigating bias in healthcare professionals.

We tested whether the extent to which demographic, socio-economic position, personality traits, pro-social motivations, and the living environment predict compliance changed across the pandemic. Low compliance was strongly related to younger age and also to risk attitudes, empathic concern, and high income, among other factors. But the size of some of these associations was larger in later months when less stringent lockdown and household mixing measures were in place, suggesting context-specific effects.

Less attention has been directed to other aspects of their menstrual experience, including confidence for menstrual management. This study aimed to understand the factors affecting university students confidence to manage menstruation at university. METHODS: An online survey was completed by 410 participants (age range: 16C46 years, mean = 20.1 years) who menstruate and study at an Australian university. Participants reported demographic characteristics, confidence to manage menstruation at university, and personal, physical and environmental factors. A MannCWhitney U-test analysed differences in confidence between groups of students. Pearsons correlation coefficient and bivariate linear regressions determined associations between factors and confidence. Statistically significant associations were inputted into a multiple linear regression model. P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: A minority of students (16.2%) felt completely confident to manage their menstruation at university. Menstrual knowledge, positive perceptions of menstruation and comfort to discuss menstruation with others positively predicted confidence. Physical menstrual symptoms, negative perceptions of menstruation, perceived stigma and using a menstrual cup or period underwear predicted lower confidence. In multiple regression, private and clean and sanitary university bathroom facilities, changing menstrual products at university, perceived stigma and negative perceptions of menstruation remained significant predictors. CONCLUSION: Most students did not have complete confidence to manage their menstruation at university.

Capitalizing on a 29-year longitudinal study with four previous assessments, two groups of Israeli veterans - ex-Prisoners-of-War (ex-POWs) of the 1973 Yom Kippur War and comparable combat veterans of the same war - were reassessed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Currently, we collected data on their PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic and their appraisal of similarities of past trauma with the current pandemic. Previously traumatized ex-POWs were found to be more vulnerable and had significantly higher rates of PTSD and more intense PTSD during the current pandemic than comparable combat veterans. Moreover, veterans in both groups who perceived the current adversity (captivity, combat) as hindering their current coping were more likely to suffer from PTSD than veterans who perceived it as a facilitating or irrelevant experience. In addition, chronic and delayed trajectories of PTSD among ex-POWs increased the risk for PTSD during the pandemic, and lifetime PTSD mediated the effects of war captivity on PTSD during the current pandemic. These findings support the stress resolution perspective indicating that the response to previous trauma - PTSD and its trajectories - increased the risk of PTSD following subsequent exposure to stress.","output":"Prior trauma, PTSD long-term trajectories, and risk for PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic: A 29-year longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, health systems postponed non-essential medical procedures to accommodate surge of critically-ill patients. The long-term consequences of delaying procedures in response to COVID-19 remains unknown. We developed a high-throughput approach to understand the impact of delaying procedures on patient health outcomes using electronic health record (EHR) data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used EHR data from Vanderbilt University Medical Centers (VUMC) Research and Synthetic Derivatives. Elective procedures and non-urgent visits were suspended at VUMC between March 18, 2020 and April 24, 2020. Surgical procedure data from this period were compared to a similar timeframe in 2019. Potential adverse impact of delay in cardiovascular and cancer-related procedures was evaluated using EHR data collected from January 1, 1993 to March 17, 2020. For surgical procedure delay, outcomes included length of hospitalization (days), mortality during hospitalization, and readmission within six months. For screening procedure delay, outcomes included 5-year survival and cancer stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: We identified 416 surgical procedures that were negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same timeframe in 2019. Using retrospective data, we found 27 significant associations between procedure delay and adverse patient outcomes. Clinician review indicated that 88.9% of the significant associations were plausible and potentially clinically significant. Analytic pipelines for this study are available online.

The model can simulate the traditional Chinese medicine treatment of common disease syndromes in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Diagnosis and Treatment Program(the sixth edition for trial). Specific steps were as follows. ABALB/c mouse model of cold and dampness syndrome was established, based on which, HCoV-229 E virus was infected; then the experiment was divided into normal control group, infection control group, cold-dampness control group, cold-dampness infection group(the model group), high-dose Chaiyin Particles group(8.8 gkg~(-1)d~(-1)), and low-dose Chaiyin Particles group(4.4 gkg~(-1)d~(-1)). On the day of infection, Chaiyin Particles was given for three consecutive days. Lung tissues were collected the day after the last dose, and the lung index and inhibition rate were calculated. The nucleic acid of lung tissue was extracted, and the HCoV-229 E virus load was detected by Real-time fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR. Blood leukocytes were separated, and the percentage of T and B lymphocytes was detected by flow cytometry. Lung tissue protein was extracted, and IL-6, IL-10, TNF- and IFN- contents were detected by ELISA. High and low-dose Chaiyin Particles significantly reduced the lung index(P<0.01) of mice of human coronavirus pneumonia with pestilence attacking the lung syndrome, and the inhibition rates were 61.02% and 55.45%, respectively. Compared with the model control group, high and low-dose Chaiyin Particles significantly increased cross blood CD4~+ T lymphocytes, CD8~+T lymphocytes and total B lymphocyte percentage(P<0.05, P<0.01), and reduced IL-10, TNF- and IFN- levels in lungs(P<0.01). In vitro results showed that TC_(50), TC_0, IC_(50) and TI of Chaiyin Particles were 4.46 mgmL~(-1), 3.13 mgmL~(-1), 1.12 mgmL~(-1) and 4. The control group of in vitro culture cells had no HCoV-229 E virus nucleic acid expression. The expression of HCoV-229 E virus nucleic acid in the virus control group was 1.4810~7 copies/mL, and Chaiyin Particles significantly reduced HCoV-229 E expression at doses of 3.13 and 1.56 mgmL~(-1), and the expression of HCoV-229 E nucleic acid was 9.4710~5 and 9.4710~6 copies/mL, respectively. Chaiyin Particles has a better effect on the mouse model with human coronavirus pneumonia with pestilence attacking the lung syndrome, and could play a role by enhancing immunity, and reducing inflammatory factor expression.","output":"[Study on therapeutic effect of Chaiyin Particles on combining disease with syndrome of human coronavirus pneumonia with pestilence attacking lung syndrome based on regulation of immune function]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The neutralizing antibody is a potential therapeutic for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As an antiviral agent, numerous mAbs recognize the epitopes that overlap with ACE2-binding sites in the SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Some studies have shown that residual changes on the spike protein can significantly decrease the efficiency of neutralizing antibodies. To address this issue, a therapeutic cocktail could be an effective countermeasure. In the present study, we isolated a fully human neutralizing antibody, JS026, from a convalescent patient. The comparative analysis revealed that JS026 binding to SARS-CoV-2-RBD mainly located between epitopes for class 2 and class 3 mAbs as opposed to that of class 1 (etesevimab) antibodies. A cocktail of etesevimab and JS026 increased neutralizing efficacy against both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the recent emergence of Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants. JS026 and the cocktail reduced virus titers in the infected lungs of hACE2 transgenic mice and relieved pathological changes.

With lockdown measures now easing in some areas, many laboratories are preparing to reopen. This is particularly challenging for clinical research laboratories due to the dual risk of patient samples carrying the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and the risk to patients being exposed to research staff during clinical sampling. To date, no confirmed transmission of the virus has been confirmed within a laboratory setting; however, operating processes and procedures should be adapted to ensure safe working of samples of positive, negative, or unknown COVID-19 status. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we propose a framework for reopening a clinical research laboratory and resuming operations with the aim to maximize research capacity while minimizing the risk to research participants and staff. METHODS: This framework was developed by consensus among experienced laboratory staff who have prepared to reopen a clinical research laboratory. RESULTS: Multiple aspects need to be considered to reopen a clinical laboratory. We describe our process to stratify projects by risk, including assessment of donor risk and COVID-19 clinical status, the COVID-19 status of the specific sample type, and how to safely process each sample type. We describe methods to prepare the laboratory for safe working including maintaining social distancing through signage, one-way systems and access arrangements for staff and patients, limiting staff numbers on site and encouraging home working for all nonlaboratory tasks including data analysis and writing. Shared equipment usage was made safe by adapting booking systems to allow for the deployment of cleaning protocols. All risk assessments and standard operating procedures were rewritten and approved by local committees, and staff training was initiated to ensure compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Laboratories can adopt and adapt this framework to expedite reopening a clinical laboratory during the current COVID-19 pandemic while mitigating the risk to research participants and staff.","output":"Mitigating Health Risks to Reopen a Clinical Research Laboratory During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The significant increase in the number of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms observed in recent years is a public health problem worldwide.

The proportions of patients who had conjunctivitis, systemic symptoms/signs (s/s), Kawasaki disease (KD), and exposure history to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases were obtained. Moreover, positive rates of the nasopharyngeal real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serum antibody for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were recorded. Overall, 32 studies with 1458 patients were included in the pooled analysis. Around half of the patients had conjunctivitis. The five most common systemic manifestations were fever (96.4%), gastrointestinal s/s (76.7%), shock (61.5%), rash (57.1%), and neurological s/s (36.8%). Almost one-third presented complete KD and about half had exposure history to COVID-19 cases. The positivity of the serology (82.2%) was higher than that of the nasopharyngeal RT-PCR (37.0%).

While the credibility of quantitative simulations through mathematical modeling may seem to be universal, how they are perceived and embedded in policy processes may vary by society. Investigating the ecology of quantitative prediction tools, this article articulates the cultural specificity of Japanese society through the concept of Jasanoffs civic epistemology. Taking COVID-19 and nuclear disasters as examples, this article examines how predictive simulations are mobilized, contested, and abandoned. In both cases, current empirical observation eventually replaces predictive future simulations, and mechanical application of preset criteria substitutes political judgment. These analyses suggest that the preferred register of objectivity in Japanone of the constitutive dimensions of civic epistemologyconsists not in producing numerical results, but in precluding human judgment. Such public calls to eliminate human agency both in knowledge and in policy-making can be a distinct character of Japanese civic epistemology, which may explain why Japan repeatedly withdraws from predictive simulations. It implies the possibility that Western societies faith in human judgment should not be taken for granted, but explained.

The purpose of this study is to reveal clinicians' opinions on the level of patient adherence and the change in adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A questionnaire containing multiple-choice questions about treatment adherence in patients with obstructive lung diseases was voluntarily applied to doctors working in a tertiary hospital for chest diseases. RESULTS: Eighty-one doctors (mean age, 37.2 years [standard deviation, 9.7 years]; 57 (70.4%) women) answered the questionnaires. Almost all clinicians participating in the study reported that they always or frequently asked patients if they adhered to treatment. Most clinicians think that in 20-50% of patients with asthma and less than 20% of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a decrease in medication adherence appears in the first year of treatment. Most clinicians think the main reason for patients with obstructive lung diseases not adhering is patients' reluctance to be treated regularly. Regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients' drug adherence, 43.2% of clinicians observed that adherence increased after the start of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to medication is not at the desired levels in patients with obstructive lung diseases. However, when faced with a serious health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, patients realize the severity of their illness and begin using their treatments more regularly.","output":"Clinician's perspective regarding medication adherence in patients with obstructive lung diseases and the impact of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had a general and deep impact on the clinical management of chronic diseases, including respiratory and allergic disorders.

We describe our technique for THA via the HAA in hips with Crowe type-IV developmental dysplasia and report the mid-term outcomes of cases that were performed over 5 consecutive years. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated a continuous series of 8 hips (6 patients) with Crowe type-IV dysplasia; the patient ages ranged from 44  20 years (range, 17 to 65 years) at the index THA. All of the patients received uncemented implants via the HAA on a traction table to restore the hip center of rotation to the true acetabulum. Femoral head autografts (FHAs) were used to increase acetabular coverage in 6 hips, and subtrochanteric shortening osteotomies (SSOs) were performed in 5 hips. Patients were assessed clinically and radiographically at a minimum follow-up of 2 years. RESULTS There were no revisions, deaths, dislocations, or infections. Two hips (25%) had intraoperative complications, and 1 hip (13%) had a postoperative complication that required reoperation without implant removal. All of the hips were assessed clinically and radiographically at 4  1 years (range, 2 to 6 years). The modified Harris hip score (mHHS) improved from 33  7 to 90  7, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) improved from 53  14 to 89  6; the postoperative leg-length discrepancy was 3.2 mm (range, -10 to 20 mm). None of the hips had osteolysis or radiolucent lines of >2 mm. CONCLUSIONS THA via the HAA on a traction table for hips with Crowe type-IV dysplasia yielded satisfactory mid-term outcomes.

Since the 5-O-unmasked analogue (i.e., 6-chloropurine-2-deoxyriboside) was not sufficiently potent (EC(50) = 47.2 M), masking of the 5-hydroxyl group seems to be an effective method for the development of anti-HCV agents.

Recently, through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, PFD based clinical trial has also been launched for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To what extent this drug can perturb membrane ion currents remains largely unknown. Herein, the exposure to PFD was observed to depress the amplitude of hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) in combination with a considerable slowing in the activation time of the current in pituitary GH3 cells. In the continued presence of ivabradine or zatebradine, subsequent application of PFD decreased Ih amplitude further. The presence of PFD resulted in a leftward shift in Ih activation curve without changes in the gating charge. The addition of this compound also led to a reduction in area of voltage-dependent hysteresis evoked by long-lasting inverted triangular (downsloping and upsloping) ramp pulse. Neither the amplitude of M-type nor erg-mediated K+ current was altered by its presence. In whole-cell potential recordings, addition of PFD reduced the firing frequency, and this effect was accompanied by the depression in the amplitude of sag voltage elicited by hyperpolarizing current stimulus. Overall, this study highlights evidence that PFD is capable of perturbing specific ionic currents, revealing a potential additional impact on functional activities of different excitable cells.","output":"Effective block by pirfenidone, an antifibrotic pyridone compound (5-methyl-1-phenylpyridin-2[H-1]-one), on hyperpolarization-activated cation current: An additional but distinctive target"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents one of the possible approaches to pandemic spread modelling.

Realizing the challenges as a result of this pandemic affecting the daily practice of the HCT centers and the recognition of the variability in practice worldwide, the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (WBMT) and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research's (CIBMTR) Health Services and International Studies Committee have jointly produced an expert opinion statement as a general guide to deal with certain aspects of HCT, including diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 in HCT recipient, pre- and post-HCT management, donor issues, medical tourism, and facilities management. During these crucial times, which may last for months or years, the HCT community must reorganize to proceed with transplantation activity in those patients who urgently require it, albeit with extreme caution.

Often, these costs are transferred to patients and their families, who also experience stress associated with traveling for care. We sought to examine the rural patient experience by (1) estimating and categorizing the various out of pocket costs associated with traveling for healthcare and (2) describing and measuring patient stress and other experiences associated with traveling to seek care, specifically in relation to household income. METHODS: We have designed and administered an online, retrospective, cross-sectional survey seeking to estimate the out-of-pocket (OOP) costs and personal experiences of rural patients associated with traveling to access health care in British Columbia. Respondents were surveyed across five categories: Distance Traveled and Transportation Costs, Accommodation Costs, Co-Traveler Costs, Lost Wages, and Patient Stress. Bivariate relationships between respondent household income and other numerical findings were investigated using one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: On average, costs for respondents were $856 and $674 for transport and accommodation, respectively. Strong relationships were found to exist between the distance traveled and total transport costs, as well as between a patients stress and their household income. Patient perspectives obtained from this survey expressed several related issues, including the physical and psychosocial impacts of travel as well as delayed or diminished care seeking. CONCLUSIONS: These key findings highlight the existing inequities between rural and urban patient access to health care and how these inequities are exacerbated by a patients overall travel-distance and financial status. This study can directly inform policy related efforts towards mitigating the rural-urban gap in access to health care.","output":"The rural tax: comprehensive out-of-pocket costs associated with patient travel in British Columbia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: STI rates have been reported as reduced during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study evaluates the number of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infections recorded relative to the number of tests performed in 2017-2021, thus accurately depicting trends over time and evaluate the effect of COVID-19 restrictions since these were implemented in March 2020. METHODS: Data was extracted from an electronic database of pathology and clinical records used at Gold Coast Sexual Health Service (GCSHS) in Queensland, Australia from January 2017 to October 2021. Poisson regression-based interrupted time series analyses were performed for number of tests performed and test positivity over the study period. The COVID-19 period was defined as starting from March 2020 when public health directives were implemented. RESULTS: CT and NG testing dropped significantly in the month after COVID-19 restrictions were brought in, by 30% and 23% respectively. Over the 5year study period, the proportion of positive CT tests has consistently decreased by approximately 0.33% points per year (P0.001). The instigation of COVID-19 restrictions had no effect on this trend. The proportion of NG positive tests remained steady prior to COVID-19 (P=0.96) at approximately 3.5%, decreased immediately at the onset of COVID-19 restrictions to approximately 2.5% (P<0.001) and has remained at this level post-COVID restrictions (P=0.54). Testing at GCSHS continued to target gay and bisexual men, accounting for 50% of all tests performed. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that there has been a sustained reduction in test positivity of NG infections in the 18months since COVID-19 restrictions were implemented, and that this is not an artifact of reduced testing. It highlights the importance of maintaining health messaging including screening for sexually transmissible infections and maintaining access to services, which may include alternative models of care such as Telehealth, self-testing and collaboration between all sexual health service providers.","output":"18 months on: an interrupted time series analysis investigating the effect of COVID-19 on chlamydia and gonorrhoea testing and test positivity at the Gold Coast, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV2 is the coronavirus strain that causes acute respiratory syndromes or COVID19. It has been infecting around 33,000,000 people and causing 1.000,000 deaths around the world. SARS-CoV2 main protease plays a proteolytic role in producing viral polyproteins essential for virus replication. It is considered as an attractive therapeutic strategy. Drug repurposing approach by identifying and testing current available drugs that may bind and inhibit SARS-CoV2 main protease has been widely applied. Here, we computationally screened 2111 FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved drugs to investigate its potential interaction to the 3D crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease recently solved and deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB). After virtual screening was performed to obtain the docking score and appropriate binding pose, the physic-based method using Molecular Mechanics combined with Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) was further employed to estimate relative free binding energy of protease/drugs interaction (in kcal/mol). We report a list of six FDA-approved drugs that have similar and/or greater binding free energy than a peptidomimetic inhibitor of SARS-CoV2 main protease crystal structure used as a positive control. We observe the similarity of hydrogen bonding interactions with amino acids such as Glu166, Gly143, His164 that appear to stabilize the drug binding with protease providing valuable insights to be explored for further structure-activity relationship study and in vitro as well as in vivo validation. ? 2021 Author(s).","output":"Exploration of FDA-approved drug interactions with SARS-CoV2 main protease using structure-based virtual screening and MM-GBSA binding free energy methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the demand for goods and services worldwide. The combination of a public health emergency, economic distress, and misinformation-driven panic have pushed customers and vendors towards the shadow economy.

We use a calibrated multi-agent model to describe these dynamics. We assert here that this phenomenon can be understood as the result of local protective bubbles formed in the city's sub-environments at the same time that there was an exhaustion of contagion networks. Both reduce the velocity of the virus's spread, causing temporary reductions in the epidemic curve, albeit in an unstable equilibrium. These local bubbles can burst anytime and anywhere due to the reintroduction of a few infected people at the same time that there is a reduction in non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as social-distancing practices. It is important to stress that this hypothesis aligns with the dynamics of the virus's spread observed so far, without needing ad hoc suppositions about natural collective immunity thresholds or heterogeneity in the population's transmission rate, which come with the risk of making mistaken predictions that may could lead to the loss of many lives. The safe way to move ahead is to continue doing all we can to avoid new infections until a vaccine is found that properly and safely creates herd immunity.","output":"Local protection bubbles: an interpretation of the decrease in the velocity of coronavirus's spread in the city of Sao Paulo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Field experiments were carried out in the reclaimed land east of Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road, Village of Wardan, Giza Governorate, Egypt, to evaluate the impact of using nano-gels pheromone for the first time on the attraction of the RPW adults by pheromone traps compared to the control which is normal pheromone during two successive seasons in 2018 and 2019.

Symptoms including chronic, persistent cough and productive phlegm are a significant burden for people with bronchiectasis, and the main aim of treatment is to reduce exacerbation frequency and improve quality of life. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy aims to break this infection cycle and is recommended by clinical guidelines for adults with three or more exacerbations a year, based on limited evidence. It is important to weigh the evidence for bacterial suppression against the prevention of antibiotic resistance and further evidence is required on the safety and efficacy of different regimens of intermittently administered antibiotic treatments for people with bronchiectasis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intermittent prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis. SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted searches on 6 September 2021, with no restriction on language of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least three months' duration comparing an intermittent regime of prophylactic antibiotics with placebo, usual care or an alternate intermittent regimen. Intermittent prophylactic administration was defined as repeated courses of antibiotics with on-treatment and off-treatment intervals of at least 14 days' duration. We included adults and children with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis confirmed by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), plain film chest radiograph, or bronchography and a documented history of recurrent chest infections. We excluded studies where participants received high dose antibiotics immediately prior to enrolment or those with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), primary ciliary dyskinesia, hypogammaglobulinaemia, sarcoidosis, or a primary diagnosis of COPD. Our primary outcomes were exacerbation frequency and serious adverse events. We did not exclude studies on the basis of review outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or relative risk (RRs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We conducted GRADE assessments for the following primary outcomes: exacerbation frequency; serious adverse events and secondary outcomes: antibiotic resistance; hospital admissions; health-related quality of life. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight RCTs, with interventions ranging from 16 to 48 weeks, involving 2180 adults. All evaluated one of three types of antibiotics over two to six cycles of 28 days on/off treatment: aminoglycosides, ?-lactams or fluoroquinolones. Two studies also included 12 cycles of 14 days on/off treatment with fluoroquinolones. Participants had a mean age of 63.6 years, 65% were women and approximately 85% Caucasian. Baseline FEV1 ranged from 55.5% to 62.6% predicted. None of the studies included children. Generally, there was a low risk of bias in the included studies. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 14 days on/off. Ciprofloxacin reduced the frequency of exacerbations compared to placebo (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; I2 = 65%; 2 studies, 469 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with eight people (95% CI 6 to 28) needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome. The intervention increased the risk of antibiotic resistance more than twofold (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.35; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 624 participants; high-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events, lung function (FEV1), health-related quality of life, and adverse effects did not differ between groups. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 28 days on/off. Antibiotics did not reduce overall exacerbation frequency (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.02; I2 = 0%; 8 studies, 1695 participants; high-certainty evidence) but there were fewer severe exacerbations (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.93; I2 = 54%; 3 studies, 624 participants), though this should be interpreted with caution due to low event rates. The risk of antibiotic resistance was more than twofold higher based on a pooled analysis (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.42; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 685 participants; high-certainty evidence) and consistent with unpooled data from four further studies. Serious adverse events, time to first exacerbation, duration of exacerbation, respiratory-related hospital admissions, lung function, health-related quality of life and adverse effects did not differ between study groups. Antibiotic versus usual care. We did not find any studies that compared intermittent antibiotic regimens with usual care. Cycle of 14 days on/off versus cycle of 28 days on/off. Exacerbation frequency did not differ between the two treatment regimens (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.24; I2 = 71%; 2 studies, 625 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) However, inconsistencies in the results from the two trials in this comparison indicate that the apparent aggregated similarities may not be reliable. There was no evidence of a difference in antibiotic resistance between groups (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.48; I2 = 60%; 2 studies, 624 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events, adverse effects, lung function and health-related quality of life did not differ between the two antibiotic regimens. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in adults who have frequent chest infections, long-term antibiotics given at 14-day on/off intervals slightly reduces the frequency of those infections and increases antibiotic resistance. Intermittent antibiotic regimens result in little to no difference in serious adverse events. The impact of intermittent antibiotic therapy on children with bronchiectasis is unknown due to an absence of evidence, and further research is needed to establish the potential risks and benefits.","output":"Intermittent prophylactic antibiotics for bronchiectasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The long-term impact of COVID-19 on transplant recipients remains unknown.

To evaluate association of state-level sociodemographics with incident cases and deaths we performed an ecological study. Methods: Publicly available data sources were used. Absolute number of covid-19 cases and deaths were obtained and cases and deaths/million in each state calculated from February to July 2020. To assess association of state level disease burden with sociodemographic variables (urbanization, human development, healthcare availability, healthcare access and quality etc.) we determined Pearson correlation and logarithmic trends. Results: Covid-19 in India has led to more than 2,000,000 cases and 45,000 deaths by end July 2020. There is large variation in state-level cases/million ranging from 7247 (Delhi), 3728 (Goa) and 3427 (Maharashtra) to less than 300/million in a few. Deaths/million range from 212 (Delhi), 122 (Maharashtra) and 51 (Tamilnadu) to 2 in north-eastern states. Most of the high burden states (except Delhi) are reporting increasing burden and deaths with the largest increase in July 2020. There is a significant positive correlation of urbanization with covid-19 cases (r= 0.65, R squared= 0.35) and deaths (r= 0.60, R squared= 0.28) and weaker correlation with other sociodemographic variables.

The cellular mechanisms underlying these so-called cytokine storms are regulated through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway and by ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species). Both light (Photobiomodulation) and magnetic fields (e.g., Pulsed Electro Magnetic Field) stimulation are noninvasive therapies known to confer anti-inflammatory effects and regulate ROS signaling pathways. Here we show that daily exposure to two 10-minute intervals of moderate intensity infra-red light significantly lowered the inflammatory response induced via the TLR4 receptor signaling pathway in human cell cultures. Anti-inflammatory effects were likewise achieved by electromagnetic field exposure of cells to daily 10-minute intervals of either Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (PEMF), or to Low-Level static magnetic fields. Because current illumination and electromagnetic field therapies have no known side effects, and are already approved for some medical uses, we have here developed protocols for verification in clinical trials of COVID-19 infection.

CASE PRESENTATION We report the case of a 62-year-old HCL patient who presented with recurrent fever episodes, pancytopenia, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A treatment decision against purine analogs and for rituximab mono was made as lymph node tissue revealed disseminated Mycobacterium kansasii infection. Together with specific antimycobacterial treatment, rituximab mono led to complete hematologic remission after 6 months without aggravating the accompanying infection.

Our estimates suggest that advancing the date of NPI adoption by one day lowers the COVID-19 death rate by 2.4 percent. This finding proves robust to alternative measures of NPI adoption speed, model specifications that control for testing and mobility, and across various samples: national, restricted to the Northeast region, excluding New York, and excluding the Northeast region. We also find that the adoption speed of NPIs is associated with lower infections, as well as lower non-COVID mortality, suggesting that these measures slowed contagion and the pace at which the healthcare system might have been overburdened by the pandemic. Finally, NPI adoption speed appears to have been less relevant in Republican counties, suggesting that political ideology might have compromised their efficiency.","output":"Is the Cure Worse than the Disease?

Using closing price data for the selected firms, we analyse herding behaviour across the two groups, in addition to various firm and market characteristics such as size, profitability, analyst recommendations about future performance and up and down market days. Our results suggest herding in both Shariah and non-Shariah-compliant energy firms, and on down market days in particular. Cross-sectional tests indicate higher herding in larger and more-profitable Shariah firms, and those with positive analyst forecasts for the future, which is consistent with pressure-driven behaviour to maintain performance.

In response, we developed SalivaDirect, which received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Methods: We simplified our saliva-based diagnostic test by (1) not requiring collection tubes with preservatives, (2) replacing nucleic acid extraction with a simple enzymatic and heating step, and (3) testing specimens with a dualplex qRT-PCR assay. Moreover, we validated SalivaDirect with reagents and instruments from multiple vendors to minimize supply chain issues. Findings: From our hospital cohort, we show a high positive agreement (94%) between saliva tested with SalivaDirect and nasopharyngeal swabs tested with a commercial qRT-PCR kit. In partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), we tested 3,779 saliva specimens from healthy individuals and detected low rates of invalid (0.3%) and false-positive (<0.05%) results. Conclusions: We demonstrate that saliva is a valid alternative to swabs for SARS-CoV-2 screening and that SalivaDirect can make large-scale testing more accessible and affordable.

This study revealed the amount of pomegranate fruit lost on the farm and the causes of loss and estimated the impacts of losses. The direct measurement method, which involved sorting and counting of individual fruit, was used since physical identification of the causes of fruit losses on individual fruit was necessary for data collection. Furthermore, qualitative data were collected by physical observation during harvesting and interaction with farm workers. At the case study farm in Wellington, Western Cape Province of South Africa, a range of 15.3C20.1% of the harvested crop was considered lost, as the quality fell below marketable standards for retail sales. This amounted to an average of 117.76 tonnes of pomegranate fruit harvested per harvest season in the case study farm, which is removed from the value chain and sold mainly at a low value for juicing and other purposes and translates to an estimated R10.5 million ($618,715.34) economic loss to the farmer. Environmental factors are the main causes of on-farm fruit losses. In the three pomegranate cultivars studied, sunburn and crack were identified as the leading cause of fruit loss, accounting for about 43.9% of all on-farm fruit losses. The lost fiber, carbohydrate, protein, iron and ascorbic acid contents associated with lost fruit were estimated to meet the daily recommended nutrition intake of 2, 9, 4, 2 and 24 people, respectively. Strategies to control and reduce pomegranate fruit losses and waste at the farm level should focus on environmental factors and mechanical damage since they account for the highest sources of fruit losses. This will ensure improved revenue to farmers, sustainable use of natural resources, reduction of the environmental impacts of the fruit industry, and more availability of quality fruit for nutritional security.","output":"Quantification of On-Farm Pomegranate Fruit Postharvest Losses and Waste, and Implications on Sustainability Indicators: South African Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

We used cross-sectional data from 42 patients 6 months to 2 years old in Saint-Marc, Haiti. We assessed their developmental status using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire. Parents were surveyed on depression symptoms and self-efficacy using validated surveys developed for low-resource settings. Demographic and socio-economic data were included. Prevalence of early childhood development delays and high parental depression risk were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to test whether parental depression risk and low self-efficacy were associated with a higher risk for childhood developmental delays. Results. Among participants, 45.2% (SD = 7.7%) of children with a recorded ASQ met age-specific cutoffs for developmental delay in one or more domains. 64.3% (SD = 7.4%) of parents were at high risk for depression. 47.6% (SD = 7.7%) of parents reported relatively low self-efficacy. Multivariable analysis showed that low parental self-efficacy was strongly associated with developmental delays (OR 17.5, CI 1.1-270.0) after adjusting for socioeconomic factors.

Considering the repercussion of these unique social experiences in infant's health, this study aims to assess the early impact of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic in hospital admissions for acute bronchiolitis. METHODS: Data from hospitalizations of acute bronchiolitis in infants under one year were obtained from the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Public Health database (DATASUS) for the period between 2016 and 2020. These data were also analyzed by macro-regions of Brazil (North, Northeast, Southeast, South and Midwest). To evaluate the effect of social distancing strategy on the incidence of acute bronchiolitis, the absolute and relative reduction was calculated by analyzing the yearly subsets of 2016vs2020, 2017vs2020, 2018vs2020, and 2019vs2020. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in all comparisons, ranging from -78% [IRR 0.22 (0.20 to 0.24)] in 2016vs2020 at -85% [IRR 0.15 (0.13 to 0.16)] in 2019vs2020, for the data from Brazil.

Among such alterations, omphalitis is included. This term is used to define inflammation and infection of the external structures of the umbilicus. According to the affected structures, it can be subclassified into omphalophlebitis, omphaloarteritis, omphalourachitis and panvasculitis. These inflammations are usually associated with bacterial infections. There are predisposing conditions that include inadequate handling such as poor hygiene and neglect of primary care. Omphalitis can affect the animal in a multisystemic way, compromising its well-being and bringing economic losses. In treatment, the use of antimicrobials does not always solve the problem. Thus, surgical treatment can be used, which has good results and should be the choice in the disease. The objective of this work is to report 30 cases of omphalitis in calves, submitted to surgical or conservative treatment. Thirty cases of omphalitis in calves treated in the routine of the Veterinary Hospital of the Paranaense University was analyzed. On physical examination, the animals presented fever, apathy, hyporexia or anorexia and increase of umbilical volume, usually with purulent secretion. Some animals had sepsis and arthritis. In animals with sepsis, hyperemia of the episcleral vessels, dehydration and severe apathy were observed. In calves with arthritis, increased joint volume, pain on palpation and lameness were observed. In animals where the owners did not authorize the surgery, treatment was instituted with sulfadoxine and flunixim meglumine. In dehydrated calves, fluid therapy was used. Animals that were surgically treated received the same clinical treatment protocol as non-operated animals. The surgical procedure was performed under general anesthesia and consisted of resection of the affected umbilical structures. Omphalophlebitis was the most common illness. The most frequent complication was sepsis. Calves treated surgically had a higher survival rate (86.66%) than those treated clinically (46.67%). The clinical signs presented by all animals converged with the literature, allowing for clinical diagnosis. Clinical examination is essential for diagnosis in omphalitis cases. Complementary methods include ultrasound, thermography and laparoscopy, which are important to identify changes in intra-abdominal umbilical structures. Accurate diagnosis of the involved structures was only possible in animals surgically, as well as alterations in organs such as the liver and bladder. There is great variability related to the umbilical structures involved, according to initial care, breeds, seasonality or even the method of conception. Unlike what is observed in the literature, in the present study, there was a higher prevalence of omphalophlebitis, demonstrating variability in relation to the umbilical structures involved. Sepsis, observed in 16.7% of cases, results from bacterial ascension of the umbilical structures. Lameness due to polyarthritis was found in 10% of animals. Meningoencephalitis was observed in 3.3%. Hepatic and retroperitoneal abscedation were observed in 6.7% and 3.3% of cases, respectively. Conservative treatment with antibiotics and local antiseptics has a limited effect on this type of condition, which was proven in the present study, since the survival rate was statistically higher in animals surgically treated.(AU)","output":"Abordagem cirrgica em bezerros com onfalite/ Surgical approach in calves with omphalitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 8 December 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for AstraZeneca's Evusheld (tixagevimab copackaged with cilgavimab, administered as concomitant injections) for the prevention of COVID-19 in those who are moderately to severely compromised, are aged 12 years or older, and weigh more than 40 kg.

Results: Interviewees were aware of models during COVID-19, with some depending upon multiple models. Models were used to compare trends in disease spread across localities, allocate scarce resources, and track disease spread within small geographic areas. Decision-makers desired models to project disease spread within subpopulations and estimate where local outbreaks could occur as well as estimate the outcomes of social distancing policies, including consequences beyond typical health-related outcomes. Challenges to the use of modeling included doubts that models could reflect nuances of human behavior, concerns about the quality of data used in models, and the limited amount of modeling at the local level.

Reports from Norway and Germany subsequently described patients with venous thrombosis and thrombocytopenia within 5 to 16 days of vaccination. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk for outcomes related to thrombosis and thrombocytopenia after AZD1222 or BNT162b2 (PfizerCBioNTech) COVID-19 vaccination. DESIGN: Nationwide exploratory retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Danish linkable registers on vaccinations, hospitalizations, occupation, and other covariates. PARTICIPANTS: 355 209 Danish frontline personnel designated for priority COVID-19 vaccination followed from 27 December 2020 (the day of the first COVID-19 vaccination in Denmark) to 13 April 2021. MEASUREMENTS: Study outcomes were cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and death. Cumulative incidences of study outcomes within 28 days of vaccination and unvaccinated risk time were compared using adjusted survival curves resulting in risk differences (RDs) at day 28 after vaccination. Adjustment for birth cohort, sex, calendar period, occupation, comorbid conditions, and prescription drug use was included. RESULTS: Vaccination with AZD1222 versus no vaccination was associated with a significant RD at day 28 for deep venous thrombosis (RD, 8.35 [95% CI, 0.21 to 16.49] per 100 000 vaccinations). The RDs for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (RD, 1.68 [CI, ?0.64 to 4.00] per 100 000 vaccinations) and thrombocytopenia (RD, 2.39 [CI, ?1.09 to 5.87] per 100 000 vaccinations) were not significant. No adverse associations were seen for BNT162b2 vaccination. LIMITATION: No medical record review; surveillance bias. CONCLUSION: In this exploratory retrospective cohort study among frontline personnel in Denmark, receipt of the AZD1222 vaccine was associated with a small excess risk for deep venous thrombosis. Although the corresponding risks for the more rare and severe thrombotic outcomes (such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) were not statistically significantly increased, statistical precision was low, and clinically relevant risks could not be excluded with certainty. There was no statistically significant association of BNT162b2 vaccination with thrombotic or thrombocytopenic events.

An important strategy is remote patient monitoring (RPM), allowing patients to remain at home, while they transmit health data and receive follow-up services. Materials and Methods: We conducted an overview of the latest systematic reviews that had included randomized controlled trials with adult patients with chronic diseases. We summarized results and displayed these in forest plots, and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to assess our certainty of the evidence. Results: We included 4 systematic reviews that together reported on 11 trials that met our definition of RPM, each including patients with diabetes and/or hypertension. RPM probably makes little to no difference on HbA1c levels. RPM probably leads to a slight reduction in systolic blood pressure, with questionable clinical meaningfulness. RPM probably has a small negative effect on the physical component of health-related quality of life, but the clinical significance of this reduction is uncertain. We have low confidence in the finding that RPM makes no difference to the remaining five primary outcomes.

An accurate diagnosis of this disease in the clinic is very important. This study aims to improve the differential ability of computed tomography (CT) to diagnose COVID-19 and other community-acquired pneumonias (CAPs) and evaluate the short-term prognosis of these patients. Methods: The clinical and imaging data of 165 COVID-19 and 118 CAP patients diagnosed in seven hospitals in Anhui Province, China from January 21 to February 28, 2020 were retrospectively analysed. The CT manifestations of the two groups were recorded and compared. A correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between COVID-19 and age, size of lung lesions, number of involved lobes, and CT findings of patients. The factors that were helpful in diagnosing the two groups of patients were identified based on specificity and sensitivity. Results : The typical CT findings of COVID-19 are simple ground-glass opacities (GGO), GGO with consolidation or grid-like changes. The sensitivity and specificity of the combination of age, white blood cell count, and ground-glass opacity in the diagnosis of COVID-19 were 92.7% and 66.1%, respectively. Pulmonary consolidation, fibrous cords, and bronchial wall thickening were used as indicators to exclude COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of the combination of these findings were 78.0% and 63.6%, respectively. The follow-up results showed that 67.8% (112/165) of COVID-19 patients had abnormal changes in their lung parameters, and the severity of the pulmonary sequelae of patients over 60 years of age worsened with age. Conclusions : Age, white blood cell count and ground-glass opacity have high accuracy in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 and the differential diagnosis from CAP. Patients aged over 60 years with COVID-19 have a poor prognosis.

Consequently, these unprecedented restrictions resulted in reductions in traffic volumes and industrial activities in most urban areas across the world. Thus, it was hypothesised that these reductions in traffic congestion and industrial activities in cities would reduce both air pollutants and thermal radiation.

Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) trend analysis were used to characterise trends in CO, SO2, SO4, long-wave radiation (LWR), and land surface temperature (LST) at periods corresponding to various lockdown restrictions. The results showed a significant decline in atmospheric pollutants at Level-5 lockdown restrictions, followed by an abrupt increase as the regulations were eased to Level-4 lockdown. Similarly, LST and surface urban heat island (SUHI) reduced when compared to the previous year.

However, the extent to which such immune responses protect against emerging variants is of increasing importance. Such variants of concern (VOC) include isolates of lineage B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK, and B.1.351, first identified in South Africa. Our data confirm that VOC, particularly those with substitutions at residues 484 and 417, escape neutralization by antibodies directed to the ACE2-binding Class 1 and the adjacent Class 2 epitopes but are susceptible to neutralization by the generally less potent antibodies directed to Class 3 and 4 epitopes on the flanks of the receptor-binding domain. To address the potential threat posed by VOC, we sampled a SARS-CoV-2 uninfected UK cohort recently vaccinated with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech, two doses delivered 18-28 days apart), alongside a cohort sampled in the early convalescent stages after natural infection in the first wave of the pandemic in Spring 2020. We tested antibody and T cell responses against a reference isolate of the original circulating lineage, B, and the impact of sequence variation in the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 VOC. Neutralization of the VOC compared to B isolate was reduced, and this was most evident for the B.1.351 isolate. This reduction in antibody neutralization was less marked in post-boost vaccine-induced responses compared to naturally induced immune responses and could be largely explained by the potency of the homotypic antibody response. After a single vaccination, which induced only modestly neutralizing homotypic antibody titres, neutralization against the VOC was completely abrogated in the majority of vaccinees. Importantly, high magnitude T cell responses were generated after two vaccine doses, with the majority of the T cell response directed against epitopes that are conserved between the prototype isolate B and the VOC. These data indicate that VOC may evade protective neutralizing responses induced by prior infection, and to a lesser extent by immunization, particularly after a single vaccine dose, but the impact of the VOC on T cell responses appears less marked. The results emphasize the need to generate high potency immune responses through vaccination in order to provide protection against these and other emergent variants.","output":"Two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination induce more robust immune responses to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern than does natural infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 and its variants have persisted in this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Importantly, our data showed that ABS-VIR-001 treatment prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection and death when provided as an intranasal prophylaxis in a humanized ACE-2 mouse model. In addition, ABS-VIR-001 post-exposure treatment was shown to greatly reduce viral loads by as much as 50-fold. A detailed panel of metabolic and cellular parameters demonstrated that ABS-VIR-001 treatment was overall comparable to the PBS treatment, indicating a favorable safety profile. Notably, our inhibition studies show that ABS-VIR-001 continued to demonstrate unwavering efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 mutants, associated with key variants including Delta and Omicron, owing to its multiple epitope design. Lastly, we rigorously tested and confirmed the excellent thermostability of ABS-VIR-001 when heated to 45 C for up to 4 weeks.

In the United States, strict social distancing during the first wave of virus spread has resulted in different types of infection dynamics. In some states, such as New York, extensive infection spread was followed by a pronounced decline of infection levels. In other states, such as California, less infection spread occurred before strict social distancing, and a different pattern was observed. Instead of a pronounced infection decline, a long-lasting plateau is evident, characterized by similar daily new infection levels. Here we show that network models, in which individuals and their social contacts are explicitly tracked, can reproduce the plateau if network connections are cut due to social distancing measures. The reason is that in networks characterized by a 2D spatial structure, infection tends to spread quadratically with time, but as edges are randomly removed, the infection spreads along nearly one-dimensional infection corridors, resulting in plateau dynamics. Further, we show that plateau dynamics are observed only if interventions start sufficiently early; late intervention leads to a peak and decay pattern. Interestingly, the plateau dynamics are predicted to eventually transition into an infection decline phase without any further increase in social distancing measures. Additionally, the models suggest that a second wave becomes significantly less pronounced if social distancing is only relaxed once the dynamics have transitioned to the decline phase. The network models analyzed here allow us to interpret and reconcile different infection dynamics during social distancing observed in various US states.","output":"Network models and the interpretation of prolonged infection plateaus in the COVID19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has thrown a wrench in the works, forcing people, organizations, and governments to rethink their policies, objectives, and actions.

However, the efficacy of PECS has been largely studied in Western societies and little research is available regarding its role in the development of children with ASD in a non-Western cultural context. The purpose of this study was to compare the parent and the practitioner perceptions of the use of PECS for children with ASD in the United Arab Emirates. METHOD: A new scale made up of three subscales was used to collect the data from the parents and the practitioners who were either related to or working with a cohort of children with ASD. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and subjected to the computation of means, t-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), binary logistical regression, and two-way factorial ANOVA. RESULTS: The results showed uncertainty or neutrality among the parents and the practitioners toward the use of PECS. Variables such as age, years of experience using PECS, and gender were noted to influence perceptions of PECS.

Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic drug used widely for the treatment of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. Apart from its anti-parasitic effect it also exhibits antiviral activity against a number of viruses both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the currently available data on the therapeutic potential of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 as add on therapy. A total of 629 patients were included in the 4 studies and all were COVID-19 RT-PCR positive. Among them, 397 patients received ivermectin along with usual therapy. The random effect model showed the overall pooled OR to be 0.53 (95%CI: 0.29 to0.96) for the primary outcome (all-cause mortality) which was statistically significant (P=0.04). Similarly, the random effect model revealed that adding ivermectin led to significant clinical improvement compared to usual therapy (OR=1.98, 95% CI: 1.11 to 3.53, P=0.02). However, this should be inferred cautiously as the quality of evidence is very low.

We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a peer-led oral HIV self-testing (HIVST) intervention in Kasensero, a hyperendemic fishing community (HIV prevalence: 37-41%) in Rakai, Uganda. METHODS This study was conducted among young people (15-24 years) and adult men (25+ years) between May and August 2019. The study entailed distribution of HIVST kits by trained \\"peer-leaders,\\" who were selected from existing social networks and trained in HIVST distribution processes. Peer-leaders received up to 10 kits to distribute to eligible social network members (i.e. aged 15-24 years if young people or 25+ years if adult man, not tested in the past 3 months, and HIV-negative or of unknown HIV status at enrolment). The intervention was evaluated against the feasibility benchmark of 70% of peer-leaders distributing up to 70% of the kits that they received; and the acceptability benchmark of >80% of the respondents self-testing for HIV. RESULTS Of 298 enrolled into the study at baseline, 56.4% (n = 168) were young people (15-24 years) and 43.6% (n = 130) were adult males (25+ years). Peer-leaders received 298 kits and distributed 296 (99.3%) kits to their social network members. Of the 282 interviewed at follow-up, 98.2% (n = 277) reported that they used the HIVST kits. HIV prevalence was 7.4% (n = 21).

OBJECTIVE: This international, randomized 2 : 1, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in patients 4 C < 8 years old with DMD due to any dystrophin mutation examined the effect of edasalonexent (100 mg/kg/day) compared to placebo over 52 weeks. METHODS: Endpoints were changes in the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA; primary) and timed function tests (TFTs; secondary). Assessment of health-related function used the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection tool (PODCI). RESULTS: One hundred thirty one patients received edasalonexent (n = 88) and placebo (n = 43). At week 52, differences between edasalonexent and placebo for NSAA total score and TFTs were not statistically significant, although there were consistently less functional declines in the edasalonexent group. A pre-specified analysis by age demonstrated that younger patients (6.0 years) showed more robust and statistically significant differences between edasalonexent and placebo for some assessments. Treatment was well-tolerated and the majority of adverse events were mild, and most commonly involved the gastrointestinal system (primarily diarrhea). CONCLUSIONS: Edasalonexent was generally well-tolerated with a manageable safety profile at the dose of 100 mg/kg/day.

Hydroxychloroquineazithromycin have been widely used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) despite a paucity of evidence regarding efficacy. The incidence of torsade de pointes remains unknown. Widespread use of these medications forced overwhelmed health care systems to search for ways to effectively monitor these patients while simultaneously trying to minimize health care provider exposure and use of personal protective equipment. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 positive who received hydroxychloroquineazithromycin across 13 hospitals between March 1 and April 15 were included in this study. A comprehensive search of the electronic medical records was performed using a proprietary python script to identify any mention of QT prolongation, ventricular tachy-arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. RESULTS: The primary outcome of torsade de pointes was observed in 1 (0.015%) out of 6476 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquineazithromycin. Sixty-seven (1.03%) had hydroxychloroquineazithromycin held or discontinued due to an average QT prolongation of 60.540.5 ms from a baseline QTc of 473.735.9 ms to a peak QTc of 532.631.6 ms. Of these patients, hydroxychloroquineazithromycin were discontinued in 58 patients (86.6%), while one or more doses of therapy were held in the remaining nine (13.4%). A simplified approach to monitoring for QT prolongation and arrythmia was implemented on April 5. There were no deaths related to the medications with the simplified monitoring approach and health care provider exposure was reduced.

In order to do that, several forecasting models (seasonal model autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR), Holt-Winters, ETS (error, trend, seasonal), and NNAR (neural network autoregression)) have been applied, and their forecast performances have been evaluated on both the in-sample data covering the period January 2000-December 2017 used for the model identification and estimation and the out-of-sample data covering the last three years, 2018-2020. The forecast of unemployment rate relies on the next two years, 2021-2022. Based on the in-sample forecast assessment of different methods, the forecast measures root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) suggested that the multiplicative Holt-Winters model outperforms the other models. For the out-of-sample forecasting performance of models, RMSE and MAE values revealed that the NNAR model has better forecasting performance, while according to MAPE, the SARIMA model registers higher forecast accuracy. The empirical results of the Diebold-Mariano test at one forecast horizon for out-of-sample methods revealed differences in the forecasting performance between SARIMA and NNAR, of which the best model of modeling and forecasting unemployment rate was considered to be the NNAR model.","output":"Comparative Analysis of Different Univariate Forecasting Methods in Modelling and Predicting the Romanian Unemployment Rate for the Period 2021-2022"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody testing in community settings may help us better understand the immune response to this virus and, therefore, help guide public health efforts. AIM: To conduct a seroprevalence study of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in Irish GP clinics. DESIGN & SETTING: Participants were 172 staff and 799 patients from 15 general practices in the Midwest region of Ireland. METHOD: This seroprevalence study utilised two manufacturers' point-of-care (POC) SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM)-IgG combined antibody tests, which were offered to patients and staff in general practice from 15 June to 10 July 2020. RESULTS: IgG seroprevalence was 12.6% in patients attending general practice and 11.1% in staff working in general practice, with administrative staff having the lowest seroprevalence at 2.5% and nursing staff having the highest at 17.6%. Previous symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and history of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test were associated with higher seroprevalence. IgG antibodies were detected in approximately 80% of participants who had a previous PCR-confirmed infection. Average length of time between participants' positive PCR test and positive IgG antibody test was 83 days. CONCLUSION: Patients and healthcare staff in general practice in Ireland had relatively high rates of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 compared with the national average between 15 June and 10 July 2020 (1.7%). Four-fifths of participants with a history of confirmed COVID-19 disease still had detectable antibodies an average of 12 weeks post-infection. While not proof of immunity, SARS-CoV-2 POC testing can be used to estimate IgG seroprevalence in general practice settings.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in general practice in Ireland: a seroprevalence study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the opportunities and challenges of parallel chat in work-related video meetings, drawing on a study of Microsoft employees' remote meeting experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, previous methods for detecting recombination and reassortment events cannot handle the computational requirements of analyzing tens of thousands of genomes, a scenario that has now emerged in the effort to track the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, the low divergence of near-identical genomes sequenced in short periods of time presents a statistical challenge not addressed by available methods. In this work we present Bolotie, an efficient method designed to detect recombination and reassortment events between clades of viral genomes. We applied our method to a large collection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and discovered hundreds of isolates that are likely of a recombinant origin. In cases where raw sequencing data was available, we were able to rule out the possibility that these samples represented co-infections by analyzing the underlying sequence reads.

Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet fully understood, thrombosis is clearly a highly important in the prognosis and outcome of COVID-19. As such, there is a need for diagnostic analysis and quantification of the coagulation potential in these patients, both at diagnosis and follow-up. Global coagulation assays like thrombin generation (TG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) might be suitable in estimating COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and thrombosis risk. Therefore, we aimed at validating both assays for samples with high levels of fibrinogen and in the presence of anticoagulant heparins, such as commonly observed for COVID-19 ICU patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Calibrated Automated Thrombography (CAT) was optimized to assess plasma thrombin generation in the presence of heparins. The final conditions with either 10 g/mL Ellagic acid (EA) or PPP Reagent HIGH (high tissue factor; HPPH) were validated according to the EP5 protocol for within-run and between-run variability. Overall variability was well below 10%. To estimate the influences of heparins and high fibrinogen levels, CAT was performed on spiked plasma aliquots from 13 healthy volunteers. Comparable to the CAT method, tPA-ROTEM was used to validate the effect of high fibrinogen and heparins on clotting time, clot firmness and clot lysis parameters. RESULTS: Our adjusted COVID-19 assay showed a heparin dose dependent decrease in peak height and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) for both EA and HPPH triggered variants. High fibrinogen did not alter the inhibitory effect of either LMWH or UFH, nor did it influence the peak height or ETP in any of the conditions. The tPA-ROTEM showed a significant prolongation in clotting time with the additions of heparin, which normalized with the addition of high fibrinogen. MCF was markedly increased in all hyperfibrinogenemic conditions. A trend towards increased lysis time and, thus, decreased fibrinolysis was observed. CONCLUSION: Thrombin generation and tPA-ROTEM protocols for measurements in the COVID-19 populations were adjusted and validated. The adjusted thrombin generation assay shows good sensitivity for measurements in heparin spiked plasma. High levels of fibrinogen did not alter the assay or the effectiveness of heparins as measured in this assay. t-PA ROTEM was effective in measurement of both high fibrinogen and heparins spiked samples and was sensitive to the expected relevant coagulant changes by these conditions. No clear fibrinolytic effect was observed in different conditions.","output":"Suggestions for global coagulation assays for the assessment of COVID-19 associated hypercoagulability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A questionnaire on COVID-19-related thrombosis in patients hospitalized before Aug 31, 2020, was sent to 399 hospitals throughout Japan.

METHODS: The LysMCre-Socs3(fl/fl)Cx3cr1(gfp/gfp) double knockout (DKO), LysMCre-Socs3(fl/fl), Cx3cr1(gfp/gfp) and Socs3(fl/fl) mice were maintained up to 12 months. Eyes were collected and processed for immunohistochemistry of IBA-1, cone arrestin, secretagogin, PKC and GABA. Brain microglia from DKO and WT mice were stimulated with LPS + IFN- or IL-4. The expression of TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, iNOS, IL-12p40, IL-23p19, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL2, IL-10, CD206 and Arg1 were examined by qRT-PCR and protein production was measured by Luminex assay. Retinal explants from C57BL/6 J mice were co-cultured with microglia from DKO or WT mice for 24 h, after which the number of cone arrestin(+) cells in retinal flatmount were quantified. RESULTS: In 3C5 month old mice, the number of microglia in retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) were comparable in all strains of mice. The DKO mice had a significantly higher number of microglia in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) but significantly lower numbers of cone arrestin(+), secretagogin(+) and GABA(+) cells compared to Socs3(fl/fl) and single KO mice. During aging, 57% of the DKO mice died before 12 months old. The 10C12 months old DKO mice had significantly higher numbers of microglia in GCL/IPL and OPL than age-matched Socs3(fl/fl) and single KO mice. The aged DKO mice developed retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) dysmorphology accompanied by subretinal microglial accumulation. The number of photoreceptors, bipolar cells (Secretagogin(+) or PKC(+)) and GABA(+) amacrine cells was significantly lower in aged DKO mice compared to age-matched Socs3(fl/fl) and single KO mice. Microglia from DKO mice showed significantly higher levels of phagocytic activity and produced higher levels of TNF-, IL-6, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL2 and CXCL10 compared to microglia from Socs3(fl/fl) mice. Co-culture of retinal explants with LPS + IFN- or IL-4 pre-treated DKO microglia significantly reduced cone photoreceptor survival.

The availability of COVID-19 vaccines has raised hopes for a decline in the pandemic. We built upon a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in France. We examined the potential impact of different vaccination strategies, defined according to the age, medical conditions, and expected vaccination acceptance of the target non-immunized adult population, on disease cumulative incidence, mortality, and number of hospital admissions. Specifically, we examined whether these vaccination strategies would allow to lift all non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs), based on a sufficiently low cumulative mortality and number of hospital admissions. While vaccinating the full adult non-immunized population, if performed immediately, would be highly effective in reducing incidence, mortality and hospital-bed occupancy, and would allow discontinuing all NPIs, this strategy would require a large number of vaccine doses. Vaccinating only adults at higher risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, i.e. those aged over 65 years or with medical conditions, would be insufficient to lift NPIs. Immediately vaccinating only adults aged over 45 years, or only adults aged over 55 years with mandatory vaccination of those aged over 65 years, would enable lifting all NPIs with a substantially lower number of vaccine doses, particularly with the latter vaccination strategy. Benefits of these strategies would be markedly reduced if the vaccination was delayed, was less effective than expected on virus transmission or in preventing COVID-19 among older adults, or was not widely accepted.","output":"Optimizing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies in France: Results from a stochastic agent-based model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new disease COVID-19 pandemic has completely modified our lifestyle, changing our personal habits and daily activities and strongly our professional activity.

The growing volume of social media posts has led to an increased usage of modern machine learning methods in natural language processing. While the rapid dynamics of social media can capture underlying trends quickly, it also poses a technical problem: algorithms trained on annotated data in the past may underperform when applied to contemporary data. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, can be particularly problematic when rapid shifts occur either in the topic of interest itself, or in the way the topic is discussed. Here, we explore the effect of machine learning concept drift by focussing on vaccine sentiments expressed on Twitter, a topic of central importance especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that while vaccine sentiment has declined considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, algorithms trained on pre-pandemic data would have largely missed this decline due to concept drift. Our results suggest that social media analysis systems must address concept drift in a continuous fashion in order to avoid the risk of systematic misclassification of data, which is particularly likely during a crisis when the underlying data can change suddenly and rapidly.","output":"Addressing machine learning concept drift reveals declining vaccine sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 has caused significant morbidity and mortality in nursing homes. Vaccination against SARS-COV-2 holds promise for reduction in COVID-19. This operational analysis describes the proportion of SARS-COV-2 positive tests before, during, and after vaccination. DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis from October 1, 2020 until February 14, 2021. SETTING: A total of 130 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living Centers (CLC), analogous to nursing homes. INTERVENTION: Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. MEASUREMENTS: The primary measure is the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among CLC residents. In a pooled analysis of weekly testing and vaccine data, the proportion of positive tests was compared for the unvaccinated, first dose, and second dose. For each CLC, we identified the week in which 50% of CLC residents were vaccinated (index week). The analysis aligned the index week for CLCs and examined the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests at the CLC level before and after. As a reference, we plotted the proportion of positive tests in nursing homes in the same county as the CLC using publicly reported data. RESULTS: Within the pooled VA CLCs, the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was delivered to 50% of CLC residents within 1 week of availability and second dose within 5 weeks. Relative to the index week, the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in the vaccinated relative to unvaccinated was significantly lower in Week 4 (relative risk 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.68). Throughout the study period, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in community nursing homes was higher compared to VA CLC and also declined after vaccine availability. CONCLUSION: The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests significantly declined in VA CLCs 4 weeks after vaccine delivery and continued to decline in vaccinated and unvaccinated residents.

We demonstrate that the sudden policy-induced loss of wild meat from food systems could have negative consequences for people and nature.

We estimate the magnitude of these consequences for 83 countries, and qualitatively explore how prohibitions might play out in 10 case study places. Results indicate that risks are greatest for food-insecure developing nations, where feasible, sustainable, and socially desirable wild meat alternatives are limited. Some developed nations would also face shocks, and while high-capacity food systems could more easily adapt, certain places and people would be disproportionately impacted.

Little is known, however, in tropical countries like Cameroon about the cause and seasonality of respiratory infections, especially in hospitalized settings. Objectives: Our study investigates the viral etiology and seasonality of SARI in hospitalized children in Yaounde, Cameroon. METHODS: Prospective clinic surveillance was conducted to identify hospitalized children aged 15 years presenting with respiratory symptoms 5\\\\day duration. Demographic and clinical data, and respiratory specimens were collected. Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for 17 respiratory viruses using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The viral distribution and demographic data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: From September 2011 through September 2013, 347 children aged 15 years were enrolled. At least one virus was identified in each of 654% children, of which 295% were coinfections; 273% were positive for human adenovirus (hAdV), 132% for human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), 115% for rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV), 106% for human bocavirus (hBoV), 98% for influenza virus (Inf), 66% for human parainfluenza virus (hPIV), 57% for human coronavirus (hCoV), and 23% for human metapneumovirus (hMPV).

In moyamoya patients treated with a superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass, treatment of a new or an enlarging aneurysm can be complicated by the presence of the bypass and by limitations on the use of standard frontotemporal craniotomies to gain access to the aneurysm. Furthermore, endovascular access can be limited by the presence of fragile moyamoya vessels and precluded by atresia of large vessels.

The current Sars\\\\CoV\\\\2 coronavirus pandemic has led to massive restrictions in health care and social life worldwide. People with PWS represent a particularly vulnerable population group to these restrictions, with unknown impact on their mental health. METHODS: We conducted an online questionnaire to assess the impact of the restrictions associated with the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on the mental health of people with PWS. RESULTS: One hundred and eight caregivers completed the survey about individuals with PWS. Individuals with PWS > 6 years (n = 89) were included for evaluation with regard to psychopathological change. Respondents frequently reported an increase in psychopathological symptoms associated with PWS during the lockdown, with 51.7% reporting increased temper outbursts, 43.8% showing signs of sadness, 38.2% being anxious, 55.0% more irritable, and 39.3% showing more food seeking behaviour. Adjusted for the type of accommodation food seeking behaviour and irritability is increased to a significantly lesser extent in people with PWS accommodated in specialised care facilities compared with those living in their family home. No significant difference could be found between the sexes. CONCLUSION: The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the mental health of individuals with PWS, evidenced by an increase in behaviours associated with PWS, including temper outbursts, food\\\\seeking, and irritability, which again underlines their need for specialised care.

Methods: Daily cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases between December 8, 2019 (the date of symptom onset based on patients' recall), and March 1, 2020, from official sources and published studies were analyzed. The second derivative model was used for information extraction. Data analysis was conducted separately for the three strata. Results: A total of 80 026 diagnosed COVID-19 cases were reported during the first 85 days of the epidemic, with 49 315 cases from Wuhan, 17 788 from Hubei excluding Wuhan, and 12 923 from China excluding Hubei. Analytical results indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic consists of an Acceleration, a Deceleration, and a Stabilization Phase in all three geographic strata, plus a Silent Attack Phase for Wuhan only. Given the reported incubation period of 14 days, effects of the massive anti-epidemic actions were revealed by both the Acceleration and Deceleration Phases. The Acceleration Phase signaled the effect of the intervention to detect the infected; the Deceleration Phase signaled the declines in new infections after the infected were detected, treated and quarantined.

The antibody is unique to humans, apes, and Old World monkeys, and it binds specifically to a mammalian carbohydrate antigen called the -gal epitope that is synthesized in nonprimate mammals, lemurs (prosimians) and New World monkeys by the glycosylation enzyme 1,3GT. The 1,3GT gene (GGTA1) appeared in mammals >100 million years ago, prior to the split between marsupial and placental mammals. This gene has been conserved in its active form, in all mammals, except for Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. Inactivation of the 1,3GT gene in ancestral Old World primates occurred 20C30 million years ago and could have been associated with epidemics of enveloped viruses in the Eurasia-Africa continent. It is suggested that prior to such epidemics, few ancestral Old World primates acquired deletion point mutations that inactivated the 1,3GT gene and eliminated -gal epitopes. This resulted in loss of immune tolerance to the -gal epitope and thus, in production of the anti-Gal antibody against antigens on bacteria colonizing the GI tract. This accidental inactivation of the 1,3GT gene in very small populations is analogous to the highly rare blood type Bombay individuals who do not synthesize blood group H (O antigen) because of inactivation of the 1,2-fucosyltransferase gene. The loss of immune tolerance to blood group H antigen has resulted in production of natural anti-blood group H antibodies in the blood group Bombay individuals. It is suggested that anti-Gal protected against infections by enveloped viruses presenting -gal epitopes, which were lethal to the parental primate populations that conserved active 1,3GT and thus, synthesized -gal epitopes. Alternative causes for the elimination of Old World primates synthesizing -gal epitopes could be bacteria or protozoa parasites presenting -gal or -gal-like epitopes, and bacterial toxins, or detrimental viruses that used -gal epitopes in these primates as docking receptors. Ultimately, any of these proposed selective processes could result in extinction of Old World primates synthesizing -gal epitopes on their cells. These ancestral primates were replaced by offspring populations lacking -gal epitopes and producing the anti-Gal antibody, which continues to be produced by Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. New World monkeys and lemurs were protected from pathogens of the Old World by oceanic barriers, thus they continue to synthesize -gal epitopes and lack the ability to produce the anti-Gal antibody. This scenario of few individuals in a large population having a mutation(s) that inactivates a glycosyltransferase gene thus, resulting in production of evolutionary advantageous natural antibodies against the eliminated carbohydrate antigen, may reflect one of the mechanisms inducing changes in the carbohydrate profile of various mammalian populations.","output":"Why Do We Produce Anti-Gal: Evolutionary Appearance of Anti-Gal in Old World Primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic Economics applies economic theory to the Covid-19 era, exploring the micro and macro dimensions of the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic phases.

However, screening can help detect and prevent CRC. Multiple guidelines recommend CRC screening using stool-based screening and direct visualization via colonoscopy. Anatomically, women have a longer total colonic length, especially in the transverse colon, which makes it redundant; thus it is more difficult to perform complete endoscopy in women. Women also have a higher risk of developing right-sided colon cancer of the flat and depressed type, which is harder to detect than the other types. Moreover, women are less likely to undergo colonoscopy due to embarrassment, especially when the procedure is performed by male gastroenterologists, and the lack of available female gastroenterologists further complicates the problem. The current COVID-19 pandemic also decreases patients' willingness to undergo screening due to the fear of contracting the COVID-19. Delay in diagnosis leads to more advanced tumors upon detection and ultimately decreases the survival rate, especially in women, as they have lower 1-year survival rate when CRC is detected in its later stages than in men. Innovative options for CRC screening have recently emerged, including colon capsule endoscopy, which can be performed in a clinic and may reduce the need for colonoscopy.

In Experiment 1, we compared pictograph arrays to more traditional bar and pie charts. We tested participants' ability to generate high-level insights following Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives via 6 free-response questions.

We found that some participants preferred the way that pictographs allowed them to envision the topic more easily, while others preferred traditional bar and pie charts because they seem less cluttered and faster to read. These results suggest that, at least in simple visualizations depicting part-to-whole relationships, the choice of using pictographs has little influence on sensemaking and insight extraction.

This paper demonstrates the benefits, challenges and lessons learned of the recent paradigm shift in Jurassic tight gas wells' completion strategy from cemented liner to multi-stage completion. Successful expansion of Multi-Stage Completion (MSC) technology is achieved at the field level led by the integrated team efforts in 2020/21, despite challenging constraints of COVID-19. MSC's help to enhance overall well production potential, overcome reservoir and intervention operation challenges, and allow early production delivery, which is a key factor to achieve a strategic asset production target of 70-80% by 2024/25. Many technical and logistic challenges were experienced during first installations of which the relevant learnings will be shared in this paper. The Jurassic gas asset produces mainly from deep high pressure and temperature, conventional and unconventional tight carbonate reservoirs. The recovery from such complex heterogeneous reservoirs is extremely challenging if conventional development strategies are applied. Therefore, a dedicated full development plan applying integrated upstream and downstream technologies is important to achieve the strategic production target. Due to the excessive Jurassic carbonate reservoir tightness, permeability contrast and dual permeability effect (matrix and natural fractures), well productivity potential significantly depends on the effectiveness of subsequent stimulation treatments of such complex heterogeneous reservoirs to improve well productivity and potentially connect with natural fractures. Selecting proper well completion design is critical to overcome such reservoir challenges and ensure effective acid stimulation treatments for the mix of conventional and unconventional formations that need convenient diversion mechanism during stimulation to enhance the productivity of each individual reservoir flow unit and enable selective future flexibility of re-stimulation and reservoir management. The asset team has recently applied a step change in completion strategy to open hole multi-stage ball drop completions using state of the art MSC technologies including closeable frac sleeves, full 3.5-in monobore ID post frac sleeves milling and debris sub enclosure to protect the MSC string during casing tie-back operations. This is to overcome reservoir complexity, eliminate wellbore cleaning and decrease the challenges and risks that accompany multiple perforation intervention operations. As well as, eliminate cement quality risks and uncertainties, improve overall cost, and fast track well delivery to production to meet asset production targets by significantly reducing operation time from approximately one month for plug and perf techniques to less than one week when using continuous and less subsurface intervention operations. Recently, a total of 13 new MSC installations and subsequent multi-stage stimulations were achieved in seven months, fromQ3-2020 to Q1-2021, with positive overall production results, significant improvement of intervention operation efficiency and faster well delivery to production.

While this lockdown restricted the spread of COVID-19, in the absence of effective support, it can generate severe food and nutrition insecurity for daily wage-based workers. Of the 61 million employed labor force in Bangladesh, nearly 35% of them are paid on a daily basis. This study examines the food security and welfare impacts of the COVID-19 induced lockdown on daily wage workers both in the farm and nonfarm sectors in Bangladesh. Using information from more than 50,000 respondents complied with the 2016C17 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) in Bangladesh, this study estimates daily wage rates as Bangladesh Taka (BDT) 272.2 in the farm sector and BDT 361.5 in the nonfarm sector. Using the estimated daily wage earnings, this study estimates that a one-day complete lockdown generates a US$64.2 million equivalent economic loss only considering the wage loss of the daily wage workers. After estimating the daily per capita food expenditure separately for farm and nonfarm households, this study estimates a minimum compensation package for the daily wage-based farm and nonfarm households around the US $ 1 per day per household to ensure minimum food security for the daily wage-based worker households.","output":"COVID-19 induced economic loss and ensuring food security for vulnerable groups: Policy implications from Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Applying a ML approach to the temporal variability of the Spike protein sequence enables us to identify, classify and track emerging virus variants. Our analysis is unbiased, in the sense that it does not require any prior knowledge of the variant characteristics, and our results are validated by other informed methods that define variants based on the complete genome. Furthermore, correlating persistent variants of our approach to epidemiological data, we discover that each new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is driven and dominated by a new emerging variant. Our results are therefore indispensable for further studies on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the prediction of evolutionary patterns that determine current and future mutations of the Spike proteins, as well as their diversification and persistence during the viral spread. Moreover, our ML algorithm works as an efficient early warning system for the emergence of new persistent variants that may pose a threat of triggering a new wave of COVID-19. Capable of a timely identification of potential new epidemiological threats when the variant only represents 1% of the new sequences, our ML strategy is a crucial tool for decision makers to define short and long term strategies to curb future outbreaks.

In common with other centres, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (London) offered modified telephone consultations to new and follow\\\\up patients in the low vision clinic. Here we assess the success of this telephone service. METHODS: Data were collected for 500 consecutive telephone low vision appointments. Successful completion of the assessment and clinical outcomes (low vision aids prescribed, onward referral) were recorded. RESULTS: Telephone assessments were completed for 364 people (72.8%). The most common reasons for non\\\\completion were either no answer to the telephone call (75 people, 15%), or the patient declining assessment (20 people, 4%). There was no association between age and the likelihood of an assessment being completed. 131 new low vision aids were dispensed, 77 internal referrals were made and 15 people were referred to outside services. More than 80% of the low vision aids prescribed were useful. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone low vision assessments were completed in about three\\\\quarters of cases.

However, it also has some disadvantages such as limitation of movement and clashing of the hand instruments, which increase the complexity and technical challenges of the operation. In this study, we describe a pilot trial of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy through a paramedian access site. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 25 patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with this method. Acute cases with empyema and patients with history of previous abdominal surgery were excluded. Single-incision is established on the right upper quadrant, right latero-superior of the umbilicus, so that trocar sites and projection of the gallbladder on the abdominal wall are on the same vertical line. Standard laparoscopic instruments were placed into the abdominal cavity providing triangulation. Once the laparoscope, grasper, and dissector are in place, the overall procedures are similar to the standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy. RESULTS Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy through an extraumbilical access site was successfully completed in all 25 patients without conversion to open surgery. Additional skin incisions and trocar access were required only in two patients. The mean operative time was 39.3 min (range: 20-75 min). The mean body mass index was 27.2. Postoperative course was uneventful in all patients. The mean postoperative hospital stay was shorter than 24 h, and all patients were discharged at first day postoperatively. No postoperative complications including seroma, wound infection, and trocar-site hernia were observed at 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSION We described a new access site for single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy using standard laparoscopic instruments. We believe that this type of access site overcomes the technical difficulties of performing single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and it is a promising alternative method for the treatment of patients with symptomatic gallstone disease as a minimal invasive abdominal surgery.","output":"Extraumbilical single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with standard laparoscopic instruments."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the beginning of 2020, it looked like serious climate action was finally going to take place after decades of procrastination, but we are now inevitably leaving the transformation path Abruptly (and remarkably), the coronavirus outbreak silenced ongoing efforts to protect climate, while also partly bringing carbon emissions to a halt A global tragedy is still unfolding with vast social impacts and we are reaching a roundabout with several distinct exits While embracing the uncertainty of current times, we try to envision likely transition pathways using the multi-level perspective Climate activists, social innovators, dreamers, and networkers are expected to gain momentum and play critical roles in a sequence of co-evolutionary waves leading to a just, conscious, and regenerative recovery [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Local Environment is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Climate action: is coronavirus what we have been waiting for?

To improve our understanding of poor oral health care outcomes, we conducted a test of network adequacy among Medicaid pediatric dental providers in Arizona through a secret shopper phone survey. METHODS: This study tested multiple components of children's access to oral health care, including reliability of provider directory information, appointment availability at the practice level for children covered under Medicaid versus commercial insurance, and compliance with regulatory standards. We contacted individual providers, following a standardized script to schedule a routine appointment on behalf of a 5-year-old patient enrolled in either a Medicaid or commercial plan. We documented the time until the next available appointment, if the practice was reached, and if the practice accepted the specified insurance plan. RESULTS: We identified, catalogued, and attempted to call a total of 185 unique practices across Arizona. In four counties, we were unable to identify a single pediatric oral health provider through health plan directories. We observed minimal differences in appointment wait times between callers with commercial insurance and those insured through Medicaid.

In this article, by employing full atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory dispersion corrected (DFT-D3) calculations, the effects of 6-mercaptonicotinic acid (MNA) and L-cysteine (CYS) on the stability of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and their sensitivity against Cd2+ were investigated. The obtained results indicate that pure AuNPs are not stable in water, while functionalized AuNPs with CYS and MNA groups have considerable stability without aggregation. In other words, the functional groups on the surface of AuNPs elevate their resistance against aggregation by an increase in the repulsive interactions between the gold nanoparticles. Moreover, functionalized AuNPs have considerable ability for selective detection of Cd2+ in the presence of different metal ions. Based on the MD simulation results, MNA-CYS-AuNPs (functionalized AuNPs with both functional groups) have the maximum sensitivity against Cd2+ in comparison with MNA-AuNPs and CYS-AuNPs due to the strong electrostatic interactions. DFT-D3 calculations reveal that the most probable interactions between the metal ions and functional groups are electrostatic, and Cd2+ can aggregate functionalized AuNPs due to strong electrostatic interactions with MNA and CYS groups. Moreover, charge transfer and donor-acceptor analyses show that molecular orbital interactions between the functional groups and Cd2+ can be considered as the driving force for AuNPs aggregation. A good agreement between the theoretical results and experimental data confirms the importance of the molecular modeling methods as a fast scientific protocol for designing new functionalized nanoparticles for application in different fields.","output":"A theoretical approach on the ability of functionalized gold nanoparticles for detection of Cd2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly increasing the number of patients who are critically ill with this disease, with the related rate of mortality expected to peak in 2020 (Alhazzani et al., 2020). As severe acute respiratory syndrome is the major cause of mortality after COVID-19 infection, patients with COVID-19 who are prone to severe acute respiratory problems may require mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; Alhazzani et al., 2020). Ongoing advances in intensive care medicine are continuing to improve survival in critically ill patients (Kaukonen, Bailey, Suzuki, Pilcher, & Bellomo, 2014). However, intensive care unit (ICU) survivors may experience complications and problems related to their disease and treatment such as critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, and post intensive care syndrome (PICS; Alhazzani et al., 2020). Harvey (2012) reported that 85%-95% of ICU patients have ICU-acquired weakness after ICU discharge and 74% of ICU patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome have cognitive impairment after ICU discharge. Physical disabilities, cognitive impairment, and mental or psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder) after ICU discharge may be symptoms of PICS, and may continue to affect surviving patients for several years after ICU discharge (Elliott et al., 2014; Held & Moss, 2019; Jackson et al., 2014; Jubran et al., 2010). Efforts to prevent and treat COVID-19 in Taiwan have proven more effective compared to most other places in the world. In addition to the low number of diagnosed cases, the mortality rate (seven of 440 confirmed cases) in Taiwan has been significantly lower than in most other countries (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, ROC, 2020, May 14). However, post-discharge care for ICU survivors, especially those hospitalized after a sudden onset of severe disease symptoms and then discharged after a long ICU stay or after receiving mechanical ventilation, require specialized care to minimize PICS. Nurses are responsible not only for treating patients with the disease but also for preventing the further spread of disease. Therefore, providing continued care to patients discharged from the ICU is essential.

Based on the enrichment levels of 11 immune signatures (eight immune-inciting and three immune-inhibiting signatures) in leukocytes of 100 COVID-19 patients, we identified three COVID-19 subtypes: Im-C1, Im-C2, and Im-C3, by clustering analysis. Im-C1 had the lowest immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C2 had medium immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 had the highest immune-inciting signatures while the lowest immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 and Im-C1 displayed the best and worst clinical outcomes, respectively, suggesting that antiviral immune responses alleviated the severity of COVID-19 patients. We further demonstrated that the adaptive immune response had a stronger impact on COVID-19 outcomes than the innate immune response. The patients in Im-C3 were younger than those in Im-C1, indicating that younger persons have stronger antiviral immune responses than older persons. Nevertheless, we did not observe a significant association between sex and immune responses in COVID-19 patients.

Among them, the most studied are -Fe(2)O(3) and Fe(3)O(4), as they possess extraordinary properties at the nanoscale (such as super paramagnetism, high specific surface area, biocompatible etc.), because at this size scale, the quantum effects affect matter behavior and optical, electrical and magnetic properties. Therefore, in the nanoscale, these materials become ideal for surface functionalization and modification in various applications such as separation techniques, magnetic sorting (cells and other biomolecules etc.), drug delivery, cancer hyperthermia, sensing etc., and also for increased surface area-to-volume ratio, which allows for excellent dispersibility in the solution form. The current methods used are partially and passively mixed reactants, and, thus, every reaction has a different proportion of all factors which causes further difficulties in reproducibility. Direct active and complete mixing and automated approaches could be solutions to this size- and shape-controlled synthesis, playing a key role in its exploitation for scientific or technological purposes. An ideal synthesis method should be able to allow reliable adjustment of parameters and control over the following: fluctuation in temperature; pH, stirring rate; particle distribution; size control; concentration; and control over nanoparticle shape and composition i.e., crystallinity, purity, and rapid screening. Iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP)-based available clinical applications are RNA/DNA extraction and detection of infectious bacteria and viruses. Such technologies are important at POC (point of care) diagnosis. IONPs can play a key role in these perspectives. Although there are various methods for synthesis of IONPs, one of the most crucial goals is to control size and properties with high reproducibility to accomplish successful applications. Using multiple characterization techniques to identify and confirm the oxide phase of iron can provide better characterization capability. It is very important to understand the in-depth IONP formation mechanism, enabling better control over parameters and overall reaction and, by extension, properties of IONPs. This work provides an in-depth overview of different properties, synthesis methods, and mechanisms of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) formation, and the diverse range of their applications.

Among telemedicine visits conducted by high-video-use providers (n = 33), ever video patients were younger (P<.001) and included 78% of Black patients versus 86% of White patients (P<.001), 74% of Hispanic patients versus 86% of non-Hispanic patients (P<.001), and 79% of public insurance patients versus 91% of private insurance patients (P<.001). High-video-use provider patients had 9.4 (95% confidence interval, 8.4-10.4) times the odds of having video visit compared to low-video-use provider patients. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that provider-focused solutions alone, including promoting provider adoption of video visits, may not adequately reduce disparities in telemedicine engagement. Even in the presence of successful clinical infrastructure for telemedicine, individuals of Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, older age, and with public insurance continue to have decreased engagement. To achieve equity in telemedicine, patient-focused design is needed.","output":"Disparities in patient engagement with video telemedicine among high video use providers during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this article is two pronged; first, to identify and report public health implications of the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and second, to report challenges uniquely faced by the citizens of India from a population health perspective.

The article was marked as recommended. Most health professions' educators (HPEs) are used to responding to change, whether these are longer term organisational changes or short term crises, e.g. staff or student sickness or technical systems' failures. Most of these changes, whilst they can be frustrating, typically have fairly straightforward and routine solutions. Other wider, environmental changes are also starting to affect educators, learners and the complex education and healthcare systems in which they operate, and these will have great impact in the relatively near future. However, it is the current crisis stemming from the global transmission of the coronavirus COVID-19 which has most recently impacted on HPE on a global scale. Whilst many of us are very used to working virtually and using social media and other activities to work collaboratively, we still tend to rely on regular meetings with friends and colleagues (old and new) around the world at conferences and meetings. Similarly, most universities rely primarily on face to face teaching to provide their programmes, particularly in the early years. The COVID-19 pandemic has put all that into sharp relief, and many of us are having to make quick and sometimes reactive adaptations to our best-laid plans. In this article, we discuss some of our experiences from the recent Ottawa2020 conference held in Kuala Lumpur from 1-5 March 2020, identifying some of the lessons learned that educators around the world will need to keep in mind as we move into what is currently unchartered territory. The learning lessons from our experience are that safety is paramount, communication and transparency is key;flexibility is needed from all stakeholders;technologies can help, but be realistic;acknowledge the need for psychological adaptation to change and crisis and tap into the wisdom and collegiality of the community. This paper specifically refers to Covid-19 but the learning lessons are applicable to other major challenges and the ideas described transferable to other situations.","output":"Health Professions' Educators' Adaptation to Rapidly Changing Circumstances: The Ottawa 2020 Conference Experience (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clinical decision-making of invasive high-intensity care for critically ill stage IV cancer patients in the emergency department (ED) is challenging. A reliable and clinically available prognostic score for advanced cancer patients with septic shock presented at ED is essential to improve the quality of intensive care unit care. This study aimed to develop a new prognostic score for advanced solid cancer patients with septic shock available early in the ED and to compare the performance to the previous severity scores. METHODS: This multi-center, prospective cohort study included consecutive adult septic shock patients with stage IV solid cancer. A new scoring system for 28-day mortality was developed and validated using the data of development (January 2016 to December 2017; n = 469) and validation sets (January 2018 to June 2019; n = 428). The developed scores performance was compared to that of the previous severity scores. RESULTS: New scoring system for 28-day mortality was based on six variables (score range, 0C8): vital signs at ED presentation (respiratory rate, body temperature, and altered mentation), lung cancer type, and two laboratory values (lactate and albumin) in septic shock (VitaL CLASS). The C-statistic of the VitaL CLASS score was 0.808 in the development set and 0.736 in the validation set, that is superior to that of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (0.656, p = 0.01) and similar to that of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (0.682, p = 0.08). This score could identify 41% of patients with a low-risk group (observed 28-day mortality, 10.3%) and 7% of patients with a high-risk group (observed 28-day mortality, 73.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The VitaL CLASS score could be used for both risk stratification and as part of a shared clinical decision-making strategy for stage IV solid cancer patients with septic shock admitting at ED within several hours.

This study assessed reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy using the I-Change Model (ICM) by considering the role of informational and psychosocial factors. A cross-sectional online survey using a convenience sample was conducted among Dutch adults (n = 240). The questionnaire assessed information factors, predisposing factors, awareness factors, motivational factors, preparatory actions, and vaccination intention. Vaccine hesitant participants (n = 58, 24%) had lower levels of education, more often paid work, and tended to have a religion other than Catholicism. They used written media less often and tended to visit websites of public health organizations less often, but used messaging services like WhatsApp more frequently. All participants had neutral intentions towards checking information credibility. Vaccine hesitant respondents had less knowledge about vaccination, lower perceived severity of getting sick and dying of COVID-19, and reported fewer exposures to cues about the advantages of COVID-19 vaccination. They were less convinced of the emotional and rational advantages of COVID-19 vaccination and expressed more negative feelings about it. They also reported more negative social norms concerning COVID-19 vaccination, and lower self-efficacy to get vaccinated and to cope with potential side-effects. The regression model explained 58% of the variance in vaccination intention. The results suggest that strategies are needed to: 1. Reduce fake news and stimulate information checking to foster well-informed decision-making; 2. Target both rational and emotional consequences of COVID-19, in addition to strategies for optimizing levels of knowledge. Campaigns should acknowledge the perceptions of the emotional disadvantages and increase perceptions of emotional advantages of COVID-19 vaccinations, such as reducing feelings of regret, and increasing feelings of freedom and reassurance.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: The Role of Information Sources and Beliefs in Dutch Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) is emerging as an advance terminology for monitoring and controlling the underwater aquatic life.

A crucial step in such procedures is needle insertion into the trachea. To simplify this procedure and increase its safety, we developed a new device, the translaryngeal Tracheostomy Needle Introducer (tTNI), for use with Fantoni's method. This cadaver study was designed to assess the performance of the tTNI on human anatomy. METHODS We tested the tTNI in a cadaver laboratory; the operators included two experts trained in PDT and three without specific training in the procedure. We performed 58 needle insertion attempts on 13 cadavers. We compared the tTNI technique with the standard needle insertion approach using external landmarks. We recorded the number of attempts needed to optimise needle insertion, time required in seconds, final position of the needle and complications related to needle insertion. RESULTS tTNI use resulted in fewer puncture attempts (1.91  1.34 vs. 1.19  0.5, p < 0.001), less time (36.8  51.6 s vs. 13.14  15.57 s, p < 0,001) and increased precision on the first puncture (18.87  25.38 vs. 7.5  12.95, p < 0,005). We did not observe any complication with tTNI use, whereas complications found using the standard method were in line with the literature. CONCLUSIONS The tTNI is a device that simplifies needle insertion by enhancing the accuracy of insertion with fewer attempts and higher precision, even when used by less experienced operators. Clinical testing is required to evaluate the device performance in patients.","output":"Translaryngeal Tracheostomy Needle Introducer: a simple device to improve safety and reduce complications during Fantoni's translaryngeal tracheostomy procedure: trial on human cadavers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beta-thalassemia major patients are the leading consumers of blood transfusions in Pakistan and, therefore, have a greater risk of acquiring transfusion-transmitted infections, most notably hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV).

Articles identified were introduced into the Endnote version X9 software and then screened for relevance and duplication. The results were stated as the pooled prevalence for the overall study and also for region-wise subgroups. A total of 33 studies conducted from 1995 to 2019 were included in the review. All 33 articles yielded information on HCV prevalence, while 19 of them provided information on HBV prevalence. The overall sample size was 8,554 that tested the prevalence of HCV in thalassemia patients. The sample size from the 19 studies that tested the prevalence of HBV was 6,184. The overall pooled prevalence of HBV was computed to be 4.13%, while the pooled prevalence of HCV was 29.79%.

We sought to describe the rapid expansion of the Delta lineage in Ontario, Canada (population 15 million) using mutation profile information and confirmatory whole genome sequencing. Methods: All laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases reported to Public Health Ontario between April 1st and June 12th 2021, with cycle threshold values <=35, were eligible for screening for the N501Y and the E484K mutations. We classified cases via mutation screening as: (1) N501Y-/E484K- (wild-type/Delta), (2) Alpha (N501Y+/E484K-), (3) Beta/Gamma (N501Y+/E484K+), or (4) N501Y-/E484K+ (predominantly B.1.525, and B.1.1.318). Results: The N501Y-/E484K- mutation profile went from having a 29% transmission deficit relative to Alpha (relative Re = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.64, 0.77) on April 1st to having a 50% transmission advantage on June 12th (relative Re = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.31, 1.71). Whole genome sequencing of N501Y-/E484K- cases (N=583) confirmed that the pattern of increasing relative reproduction number coincided with the replacement of wild-type with Delta variant (from 2.2% in early April, to 83% in late May). Discussion: Delta is rapidly overtaking other SARS-CoV-2 variants in Ontario, and has a substantial transmission advantage. An inflection in the proportion of cases missing the N501Y mutation from rapidly decreasing to rapidly increasing, may be an early warning signal for Delta lineage expansion.","output":"Inflection in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections missing the N501Y mutation as a marker of rapid Delta (B.1.617.2) lineage expansion in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Palabras clave: estudiante universitario, primer semestre, confinamiento, Covid This paper gives an account of how firsttime university students have experienced the beginning of their professional training in front of the computer screen due to the confinement caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The secondary aims are to model recovery strategies; review the deficit of hip and knee arthroplasty from National Joint Registry (NJR) data; and assess the cost of returning to pre-COVID-19 waiting list numbers. METHODS: A model of referral, waiting list, and eventual surgery was created and calibrated using historical data from NHS England (April 2017 to March 2020) and was used to investigate the possible consequences of unmet demand resulting from fewer patients entering the treatment pathway and recovery strategies. NJR data were used to estimate the deficit of hip and knee arthroplasty by August 2020 and NHS tariff costs were used to calculate the financial burden. RESULTS: By November 2020, the elective waiting list in England is predicted to be between 885,286 and 1,028,733. If reduced hospital capacity is factored into the model, returning to full capacity by November, the waiting list could be as large as 1.4 million. With a 30% increase in productivity, it would take 20 months if there was no hidden burden of unreferred patients, and 48 months if there was a hidden burden, to return to pre-COVID-19 waiting list numbers.

To examine the effect of sounds on decision-making, we developed a supermarket task where people watched a film shown from the shopper's perspective and were asked to make decisions between different products. The task was divided into three sections and participants completed each section in a different auditory environment: (1) no sounds, (2) non-social sounds (e.g. fridges humming) and (3) social sounds (e.g. people talking). Thirty-eight autistic and 37 neurotypical adults took part. We measured decision-making by examining how long it took to make a decision and how consistent people were with their decisions. We also measured heart rate variability because this biological response provides a measure of anxiety. After the supermarket shopping task, participants told us in their own words about their experiences. Autistic participants said that they found the non-social and social sound conditions more difficult than the no sound condition, and autistic participants found the social sound condition more negative than neurotypical participants. However, decision-making and heart rate variability were similar for autistic and neurotypical participants across the sound conditions, suggesting that these measures may not have been sensitive enough to reflect the experiences the autistic participants reported. Further research should consider alternative measures to explore the experiences reported by autistic people to help us understand which specific aspects of the environment autistic people are sensitive to. This, in turn, may enable more specific and evidence-based autism-friendly changes to be made.","output":"The effect of ambient sounds on decision-making and heart rate variability in autism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review critically assesses the body of research about Measles-Mumps-and-Rubella (MMR) vaccine attitudes and uptake in the United Kingdom (UK) over the past 10 years.

Comparison of the protein conservation within different taxonomic groups (multifunctional, or highly specific) allows to clarify their specificity and the direction of evolution. Two multifunctional enzymes, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase, that are partners in some mitotic and meiotic processes were investigated in the present work. Two research methods, bioinformatics and immunocytochemical, were combined to examine the conservation levels of the two enzymes. It has been established that CDK2 is a highly conserved protein in different taxonomic lineages of the eukaryotic tree. Immunocytochemically, a conserved CDK2 pattern was revealed in the meiotic autosomes of five rodent species and partially in domestic turkey and clawed frog. Nevertheless, variable CDK2 distribution was detected at the unsynapsed segments of the rodent X chromosomes. BRCA1 was shown to be highly conserved only within certain mammalian taxa. It was also noted that in those rodent nuclei, where BRCA1 specifically binds to antigens, asynaptic regions of sex chromosomes were positive. BRCA1 staining was not always accompanied by specific binding, and a high nonspecificity in the nucleoplasm was observed. Thus, the studies revealed different conservation of the two enzymes at the level of protein structure as well as at the level of chromosome behavior. This suggests variable rates of evolution due to both size and configuration of the protein molecules and their multifunctionality.","output":"Heterogeneity in conservation of multifunctional partner enzymes with meiotic importance, CDK2 kinase and BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The aim of this study was to describe a new type of medical device that allows for internet-enabled patient self-screening, without the aid of an ophthalmic professional, through biomicroscopy self-imaging and self-measurement of the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). METHODS In this prospective nonrandomized comparative study, 56 patients were instructed to screen their own eyes using a custom-built e-Device containing miniaturized slitlamp optics and a visual acuity Snellen chart virtually projected at 20 ft. BCVA measurements were recorded, and biomicroscopic videos were scored for image quality of the anterior segment status on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 = poor and 5 = excellent) by a blinded observer. RESULTS After a short instruction, all patients were able to self-image their eyes and perform a self-BCVA measurement using the e-Device. Patient self-image quality with the e-Device scored on average 3.3 (0.8) for videos (n = 76) and 3.6 (0.6) for photographs (n = 49). Self-BCVA measurement was within 1 Snellen line from routine BCVA levels in 66 of 72 eyes (92%). When compared with conventional biomicroscopy, patient self-biomicroscopy allowed for recognition of the relevant pathology (or absence thereof) in 26 of 35 eyes (74%); 9 cases showed insufficient image quality attributed to device operating error (n = 6) and mild corneal edema and/or scarring (n = 3).

In NTCD strain T7, the colonisation factor, CD0873, and a domain of TcdB were overexpressed. Following oral immunisation of hamsters with spores of recombinant strain, T7-0873 or T7-TcdB, intestinal and systemic responses were investigated. Vaccination with T7-0873 successfully induced intestinal antibodies that significantly reduced adhesion of toxigenic C. difficile to Caco-2 cells, and these responses were mirrored in sera. Additional engineering of NTCD is now warranted to further develop this vaccine.","output":"Towards Development of a Non-Toxigenic Clostridioides difficile Oral Spore Vaccine against Toxigenic C. difficile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is used to reduce the risk of peri-operative allogeneic blood transfusion. Although crystalloid and/or colloid solutions have been used for volume replacement during ANH, no studies have examined the differences among solutions on the volume status, electrolytes, acid-base balance, and hemodynamic status during surgery with ANH. METHODS: We retrospectively compared the effect of Ringers lactate with 3% dextran-40 (Saviosol?, DEX group) and 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride (Voluven?, HES group) on blood hemoglobin serum electrolytes and estimated blood volume before induction of anesthesia (baseline), after ANH and after blood transfusion following surgery in patients undergoing open gynecological surgery (n = 111 and 67, respectively). The primary outcomes were the changes in hemoglobin and electrolytes after ANH. RESULTS: There were no differences in hemoglobin or electrolytes between the two groups at baseline. Postoperative hemoglobin was significantly higher (11.0  1.5 g/dL vs 9.9  1.3 g/dL) (mean  SD) in the DEX group than in the HES group (p = 0.03). Postoperative potassium was significantly decreased from the baseline both in the DEX group (137.9  2.5 mmol/L vs 136.3  2.7 mmol/L) and in the HES group (138.3  2.0 mmol/L vs 137.8  2.5 mmol/L) (p < 0.001 for both); however, it was significantly higher than in the DEX group after surgery (p < 0.001).

However, implementing RNA-Seq analysis pipelines in a reproducible, flexible manner is challenging as data gets bigger and more complex. Thus, there is a pressing requirement for frameworks that allows for fast, efficient, easy-to-manage, and reproducibile analysis. Simple scripting has many challenges and drawbacks. We have developed a python package, python RNA-Seq Pipeliner (pyrpipe) that enables straightforward development of flexible, reproducible and easy-to-debug computational pipelines purely in python, in an object-oriented manner. pyrpipe provides access to popular RNA-Seq tools, within python, via easy-to-use high level APIs. Pipelines can be customized by integrating new python code, third-party programs, or python libraries. Users can create checkpoints in the pipeline or integrate pyrpipe into a workflow management system, thus allowing execution on multiple computing environments. pyrpipe produces detailed analysis, and benchmark reports which can be shared or included in publications. pyrpipe is implemented in python and is compatible with python versions 3.6 and higher. To illustrate the rich functionality of pyrpipe, we provide case studies using RNA-Seq data from GTEx, SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells, and Zea mays. All source code is freely available at https://github.com/urmi-21/pyrpipe; the package can be installed from the source or from PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/pyrpipe).

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) has been shown to affect respiratory function in a sex-dependent manner; however, the effect of IUGR on diaphragm function is unknown. AIM: This study used a maternal hypoxia-induced mouse model of IUGR to investigate the impact of IUGR on diaphragm function and structure in male and female adult offspring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pregnant BALB/c mice were housed under hypoxic conditions (10.5% O2 ) from gestational days 11 to 17.5 and then returned to normoxic conditions. Control mice were housed under normoxic conditions throughout pregnancy. At 8 weeks of age, offspring were euthanized and diaphragms isolated for functional assessment in organ bath experiments and for histological analysis. RESULTS: IUGR offspring were lighter at birth and remained lighter at 8 weeks of age compared to Controls. While diaphragm force (maximal or twitch) was not affected by treatment or sex, the IUGR group exhibited a longer half-relaxation time after twitch contractions compared to Control. Female offspring had a lower maximum rate of force development and higher fatigue resistance compared to males, independent of IUGR. There was no difference in the diaphragm myofibre cross-sectional area between groups or sexes. CONCLUSION: Sex and IUGR independently affect diaphragm contraction in adult mice without changes in structure. This study demonstrates that IUGR affects diaphragm contractile function in later life and could impair respiratory function if exacerbated under conditions of increased respiratory load.","output":"Intrauterine growth restriction affects diaphragm function in adult female and male mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and study aims; There is a consensus among gastroenterology organizations that elective endoscopic procedures should be deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the decision to perform urgent procedures and to defer entirely elective procedures is mostly evident, there is a wide middle ground of time-sensitive but not technically urgent or emergent endoscopic interventions. We aimed to survey gastroenterologists worldwide using Twitter to help elucidate these definitions using commonly encountered clinical scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods; A 16-question survey was designed by the authors to include common clinical scenarios that do not have clear guidelines regarding the timing or urgency of endoscopic evaluation. This survey was posted on Twitter. The survey remained open to polling for 48 hours. During this time, multiple gastroenterologists and fellows with prominent social media presence were tagged to disseminate the survey. Results; The initial tweet had 38,795 impressions with a total of 2855 engagements. There was significant variation in responses from gastroenterologists regarding timing of endoscopy in these semi-urgent scenarios. There were only three of 16 scenarios for which more than 70% of gastroenterologists agreed on procedure-timing. For example, significant variation was noted in regard to timing of upper endoscopy in patients with melena, with 44.5% of respondents believing that everyone with melena should undergo endoscopic evaluation at this time. Similarly, about 35% of respondents thought that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should only be performed in patients with choledocholithiasis with abdominal pain or jaundice. Conclusion; Our analysis shows that there is currently lack of consensus among gastroenterologists in regards to timing of semi-urgent or non-life-threatening procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results support the need for the ongoing development of societal guidance for these semi-urgent scenarios to help gastroenterologists in making difficult triage decisions.","output":"What constitutes urgent endoscopy?

Curcumin exhibits photosensitivity and is widely used as a food additive for its natural color. This study aimed to determine the effect of curcumin-mediated photodynamic technology (Cur-PDT) on Bacillus subtilis and to elucidate the anti-bacterial mechanism involved. First, the effects of curcumin concentration, duration of light irradiation, light intensity, and incubation time on the inactivation of B. subtilis were analyzed. It was found that Cur-PDT inactivated 100% planktonic cells with 50 mol/L curcumin in 15 min (120 W). Then, the cell morphology, oxidation state and the expression of membrane structure- and DNA damage-related genes of B. subtilis vegetative cells were investigated under different treatment conditions. The membrane permeability of cells was enhanced and the cell membrane structure was damaged upon treatment with Cur-PDT, which were exacerbated with increases of treatment time and curcumin concentration. Meanwhile, the production of reactive oxygen species increased and the activities of the antioxidant enzymes SOD, GPX, and CAT decreased inside the cells. Furthermore, the Cur-PDT treatment significantly downregulated the mRNA of the membrane protein TasA and upregulated the DNA damage recognition protein UvrA and repair protein RecA of B. subtilis. These results suggested that curcumin-mediated PDT could effectively inactivate B. subtilis by inducing cell redox state imbalance, damaging DNA, and disrupting membrane structures.","output":"Inactivation of Bacillus subtilis by Curcumin-Mediated Photodynamic Technology through Inducing Oxidative Stress Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes to daily life and many health\\\\related behaviors.

Freshly isolated AM from Wistar rats were treated with extracted PM(2.5) at concentrations of 33, 100, or 300 g/mL for 4 h; thereafter, the cytotoxic effects were evaluated. The results demonstrated that PM(2.5) induced cytotoxicity by decreasing cell viability and increasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in AMs. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular calcium cations (Ca(2+)) markedly increased in higher PM(2.5) concentration groups. Additionally, the apoptotic ratio increased, and the apoptosis-related proteins BCL2-associated X (Bax), caspase-3, and caspase-9 were upregulated, whereas B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein levels were downregulated following PM(2.5) exposure.

Eligible studies were based in primary care and described practice-level changes in the provision of routine care in response to COVID-19. Relevant data addressing changes to routine primary care delivery, impact on primary care functions and challenges experienced in adjusting to new approaches to providing care, were obtained from included studies. A narrative summary was guided by Burns et al.s framework for primary care provision in disasters. RESULTS: Seventeen of 1,699 identified papers were included. Studies reported on telehealth use and public health measures to maintain safe access to routine primary care, including providing COVID-19 screening, and establishing dedicated care pathways for non-COVID and COVID-related issues. Acute and urgent care were prioritized, causing disruptions to chronic disease management and preventive care. Challenges included telehealth use including disparities in access and practical difficulties in assessing patients, personal protective equipment shortages, and financial solvency of medical practices.

To assess the association between the implementation of local guidelines and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with various adverse health outcomes including osteoporosis, fractures and myalgia. Most recently, vitamin D deficiency has been hypothesised as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection. Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include incarceration, ethnicity, diet and a diagnosis of psychiatric disorder. Vitamin D deficiency is known to be prevalent among individuals within forensic mental health institutions. Local Trust guidelines advise that vitamin D levels should be checked within one-month of hospital admission, followed by checks at three-monthly intervals. Recommendations for prescribing depend on patients vitamin D levels; deficient (<25nmol/L), insufficient (25 < 50nmol/L) or adequate (50-150nmol/L). We assessed concordance with these guidelines at Broadmoor Hospital, UK. METHOD: Medical records, laboratory results and drug charts were assessed for a total of 75 patients across 15 wards. Data were collected using a standardised audit tool, including; date of admission, admission vitamin D level, most recent vitamin D level and the dose and frequency of vitamin D prescribed. RESULT: 76.4% of patients had their vitamin D levels checked within one month of admission. 66.7% of patients had their vitamin D checked within the last 3 months. For patients with an admission vitamin D level recorded, 43.6% had deficient vitamin D levels, 43.6% had insufficient levels and 12.7% had adequate levels. For patients with a more recent serum vitamin D level, 14.5% had deficient levels, 38.7% had insufficient levels and 46.8% had adequate levels. For patients with a documented serum vitamin D level, 21.4% were prescribed the correct dose, 22.9% were under-dosed, 14.3% were over-dosed and 41.4% received no dose where guidelines suggested they should. CONCLUSION: Comparison of admission and most recent vitamin D levels suggests a general improvement in prevalence of vitamin D deficiency associated with the implementation of local guidelines. However, we identify significant areas for improvement. A substantial proportion of patients lacked admission or regular monitoring of vitamin D levels and a substantial proportion of patients were under-dosed or received no dose where guidelines suggested they should have. We propose that better concordance with guidelines may improve clinical outcomes further. This may prove especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic, given a potential association between vitamin D deficiency and severity of respiratory infection.","output":"Vitamin D deficiency in a high secure forensic psychiatry hospital: A clinical audit and service evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious illness caused by novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus The World Health Organization recently designated SARS-CoV-2 associated COVID-19 to be a global pandemic The fear or spread of COVID-19 has touched every continent The importance of understanding the drivers of COVID-19 on community health is amplified by the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to rapidly change genetic structure, our restricted knowledge about the disease, and limited or non-existent vaccines and treatment options An understanding of basic COVID-19 epidemiology is a prerequisite for curtailing transmission, preventing morbidity and mortality, developing efficacious vaccines, implementing effective infection control protocols, and applying treatment algorithms","output":"What Nurses Should Know About COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) experienced severe burden from the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is a major issue for their residents.

The difference is statistically significant at P < 0.05. Postmenopausal women were more likely to expire due to COVID-19 infection compared to premenopausal women. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate in postmenopausal age group was greater than mortality in premenopausal females emphasizing the protection provided by estrogens hormone in them. Postmenopausal women are also at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection than premenopausal women. Mortality is greater in males compared to females, further strengthening the role of estrogens.","output":"COVID-19 Outcomes in Postmenopausal and Perimenopausal Females: Is Estrogen Hormone Attributing to Gender Differences?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors affecting the ability and willingness of dentists to work during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of this situation on occupational burnout. A 51-question survey, including demographic and pandemic questions and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), was used as a data collection method and administered to dentists in Turkey via the internet in two stages. A link to the survey (onlineanketler.com) was sent to the participants by e-mail or social media (WhatsApp?). A total of 442 dentists in the first stage and 264 dentists in the second stage answered the questionnaire. The second stage of the survey only applied to dentists who are assigned within the scope of COVID-19 measures in Turkey. Standard descriptive statistics, the chi-square test, independent samples t test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used for statistical analysis. Most of the participants showed higher stress levels. Occupational burnout levels of participants according to filiation service (serve/FP, did not serve/FN) were 34.4% and 17.6%, respectively. The FP group showed significantly higher stress levels than the FN group.

As we strive to regenerate our full capacity elective services in order to contest the increasing demand for lower limb arthroplasty, this pandemic has allowed us a rare opportunity to revise and develop novel elective arthroplasty pathways intended to improve patient care and advance healthcare efficiency. We present an extensive evidence-based review of the approaches used to achieve day-case unicompartmental arthroplasty (UKA) as well as the development of a day-case UKA care pathway in a UK NHS institution based on the evidence provided in the literature. METHODS: An extensive search of the literature was performed for articles that reported on readmission or complication rates &#8805;30 days postoperatively following day-case UKA. FINDINGS: Fifteen manuscripts reporting the results of day-case UKA, defined as discharged on the same calendar day of surgery, were included in our review. Mean reported complication rates for day-case and inpatient UKA within the follow-up periods were 4.05% and 6.52%, respectively. Mean readmission rates were 2.71% and 4.36% for day-case and inpatient UKA, respectively. The mean rate of successful same-day discharge was 92.45%.

In this study, we found that Axin2, a bona fide downstream target of canonical Wnt, activates the Hippo pathway in APC-mutated CRC, limiting the therapeutic potential of niclosamide on advanced CRC through the inactivation of the Hippo pathway. To overcome the limitation, we combined niclosamide with AMPK activator metformin to activate Hippo and found that this combination synergistically suppressed canonical Wnt and activated Hippo in APC-mutated CRC. Using patient-derived cancer organoid and an APC-MIN mice model, we found the combinatory approach to be effective for APC-mutated CRC. Our results provide not only the reciprocal link between Wnt and Hippo in APC-mutated CRC, but they also provide an effective therapeutic approach with clinically available drugs for FAP and CRC patients. ABSTRACT: The Wnt and Hippo pathways are tightly coordinated and understanding their reciprocal regulation may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer. Anti-helminthic niclosamide is an effective inhibitor of Wnt and is now in a phase II trial for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. We found that Axin2, an authentic target gene of canonical Wnt, acts as aYAP phosphorylation activator in APC-mutated CRC. While niclosamide effectively suppresses Wnt, it also inhibits Hippo, limiting its therapeutic potential for CRC. To overcome this limitation, we utilized metformin, a clinically available AMPK activator. This combinatory approach not only suppresses canonical Wnt activity, but also inhibits YAP activity in CRC cancer cells and in patient-derived cancer organoid through the suppression of cancer stemness. Further, combinatory oral administration suppressed in vivo tumorigenesis and the cancer progression of APC-MIN mice models. Our observations provide not only a reciprocal link between Wnt and Hippo, but also clinically available novel therapeutics that are able to target Wnt and YAP in APC-mutated CRC.","output":"Metformin and Niclosamide Synergistically Suppress Wnt and YAP in APC-Mutated Colorectal Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Physical-distancing interventions are being used in Canada to slow the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, but it is not clear how effective they will be. We evaluated how different nonpharmaceutical interventions could be used to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and reduce the burden on the health care system. METHODS We used an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada. We compared a base case with limited testing, isolation and quarantine to scenarios with the following: enhanced case finding, restrictive physical-distancing measures, or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive physical distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected occupancy of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We present medians and credible intervals from 100 replicates per scenario using a 2-year time horizon. RESULTS We estimated that 56% (95% credible interval 42%-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107 000 (95% credible interval 60 760-149 000) cases in hospital (non-ICU) and 55 500 (95% credible interval 32 700-75 200) cases in ICU. For fixed-duration scenarios, all interventions were projected to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to the base case, with restrictive physical distancing estimated to have the greatest effect. Longer duration interventions were more effective. Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce the proportion of the population infected at the end of the 2-year period and could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontario's ICU capacity. INTERPRETATION Without substantial physical distancing or a combination of moderate physical distancing with enhanced case finding, we project that ICU resources would be overwhelmed. Dynamic physical distancing could maintain health-system capacity and also allow periodic psychological andeconomic respite for populations.","output":"Mathematical modelling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus outbreak was a dramatic foreign policy game\\\\changer in the first half of 2020 While alarm bells started to ring in January, the World Health Organisation (WHO) officially declared COVID\\\\19 as a global pandemic on 11 March The animal pathogen introduced into the human world created an abrupt series of international security shockwaves that tested community resilience and compounded situations of uncertainty and division in a more multi\\\\polar world order Australia was not immune to this turbulence The Morrison government's first year since the election was dominated by this extraordinary high\\\\impact global event that placed great stress on political systems and fuelled worrying scenarios of military tension and geopolitical friction against the backdrop of declining US influence and intensified Chinese assertiveness It also threatened widespread social and economic dislocation while boosting nationalist, populist and extremist impulses, both at home and abroad Further, heightened disinformation and propaganda campaigns emerged as a profound national security threat As Thomas Rid cautioned, it is impossible to excel at both misinformation and democracy at the same time In the wake of a horror bushfire season that had caused colossal devastation across a number of affected regions (and calls for a major change in policy settings to address the existential nature of the threat to people and ecosystems), the attention\\\\span of the government found itself quickly consumed by a rapidly evolving public health emergency This emergency that swept across the globe had a decisive and immediate impact on vulnerable populations and global geo\\\\political and socio\\\\economic realities A June 2020 Lowy Institute poll also found that pressures to whole\\\\of\\\\government responses as well as the fragilities within international co\\\\operation networks had been heightened by the pandemic as many Australians were feeling unsafe, anxious and pessimistic about navigating a more uncertain future This included the status of the economy and the scope of ties with China During the period under review, this article will therefore predominantely focus on the impact and implications of the pandemic on the international system and Australia's response as a small but not insignificant actor in dealing with a knotty series of events The dramatic deterioration of Australia\\\\China relations will be a major theme in this analysis This phase of heightened strategic competition directly cuts into multiple questions and concerns about new types of interdependencies, hastened regional instability and a volatile recipe of overlapping security, economic, diplomatic and cyber concerns In short, Australia's relations with China worsened dramatically during this period But perhaps most strikingly, and what will also be underscored in more detail below, is that the pandemic did not create an entirely new set of foreign policy problems Rather, it acted to fast\\\\track and augment a number of pre\\\\existing dilemmas and fragmentary pressures that had been previously testing Australian interests and values Notably, the coronavirus has only hastened what was already underway This distillation of worrisome global trends and amplified problem spots included: the acceleration of great\\\\power competition and wider geo\\\\political instability;the increased complexity of cyber\\\\management;the extension of disinformation and grey zone campaigns;

The ability to communicate hazard forecasts and risk information to vulnerable communities and stakeholders successfully is crucial for effective disaster preparedness and response, to reduce impact, and to prevent loss of life. Successful risk communication, however, is challenged constantly. Even the most sophisticated forecasting models and advanced early warning systems can be rendered ineffective if the information is not communicated clearly, on time, and in a way that allows the end-user to consider options and act appropriately. These challenges not only apply to fast onset hazards such as cyclones and tsunamis, but also to slower onset hazards such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Around the world, governments' responses to the current pandemic provide examples of how complex and difficult successful risk communication is.

To achieve a better understanding of the pathogenicity and evolution of SS2 at the whole-genome level, comparative genomic analysis of 18 SS2 strains, selected on the basis of virulence and geographic origin, was performed using NimbleGen tiling arrays. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that SS2 isolates have highly divergent genomes. The 89K pathogenicity island (PAI), which has been previously recognized as unique to the Chinese epidemic strains causing STSS, was partially included in some other virulent and avirulent strains. The ABC-type transport systems, encoded by 89K, were hypothesized to greatly contribute to the catastrophic features of STSS. Moreover, we identified many polymorphisms in genes encoding candidate or known virulence factors, such as PlcR, lipase, sortases, the pilus-associated proteins, and the response regulator RevS and CtsR. On the basis of analysis of regions of differences (RDs) across the entire genome for the 18 selected SS2 strains, a model of microevolution for these strains is proposed, which provides clues into Streptococcus pathogenicity and evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Our deep comparative genomic analysis of the 89K PAI present in the genome of SS2 strains revealed details into how some virulent strains acquired genes that may contribute to STSS, which may lead to better environmental monitoring of epidemic SS2 strains.","output":"Probing genomic diversity and evolution of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 by NimbleGen tiling arrays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The newly identified 2019-nCoV, which appears to have originated in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in central China, is spreading rapidly nationwide. A number of cases of neonates born to mothers with 2019-nCoV pneumonia have been recorded. However, the clinical features of these cases have not been reported, and there is no sufficient evidence for the proper prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infections in neonates. Methods The clinical features and outcomes of 10 neonates (including 2 twins) born to 9 mothers with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in 5 hospitals from January 20 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Results Among these 9 pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, onset of clinical symptoms occurred before delivery in 4 cases, on the day of delivery in 2 cases, and after delivery in 3 cases. In most cases, fever and a cough were the first symptoms experienced, and 1 patient also had diarrhea. Of the newborns born to these mothers, 8 were male and 2 were female; 4 were full-term infants and 6 were born premature; 2 were small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants and 1 was a large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infant; there were 8 singletons and 2 twins. Of the neonates, 6 had a Pediatric Critical Illness Score (PCIS) score of less than 90. Clinically, the first symptom in the neonates was shortness of breath (n=6), but other initial symptoms such as fever (n=2), thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function (n=2), rapid heart rate (n=1), vomiting (n=1), and pneumothorax (n=1) were observed. Up to now, 5 neonates have been cured and discharged, 1 has died, and 4 neonates remain in hospital in a stable condition. Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from 9 of the 10 neonates 1 to 9 days after birth for nucleic acid amplification tests for 2019-nCoV, all of which showed negative results. Conclusions Perinatal 2019-nCoV infection may have adverse effects on newborns, causing problems such as fetal distress, premature labor, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function, and even death.

Methods: A low-cost ($50 CAD) gyroscope and accelerometer integrated sensor was assembled and affixed to an ultrasound probe. Seventeen participants, nine novices and eight experts, were recruited to perform three abdominal and four cardiac scans on a standardized patient. Participant demographics, time per scan, average acceleration, average angular velocity, decay in acceleration and angular velocity over time, and frequency of probe movements were analyzed. Video capture with blinded video review was scored. Results: On video review, experts had higher image optimization and acquisition scores for both abdominal and cardiac scans. Experts had shorter scan times for abdominal (7 s vs. 26 s, p = 0.003) and cardiac (11 s vs. 26 s, p < 0.001) scans. There was no difference in average acceleration (g) between novices and experts performing abdominal (1.02 vs. 1.01, p = 0.50) and cardiac (1.01 vs. 1.01, p = 0.45) scans.

RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and ELISA IgG detection was 55/63 ( 87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and GICA IgG detection was 75/91 ( 82.4%), Both methods are negative for healthy controls, specificity of 100% .There is no significant difference between the sensitivity of between ELISA and GICA (IgM+ IgG). CONCLUSIONS: ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies are conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used for clinical reference, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved.","output":"Evaluation of Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay and Colloidal Gold- Immunochromatographic Assay Kit for Detection of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) Causing an Outbreak of Pneumonia (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"East Asia is as a principal hotspot for emerging zoonotic infections. Understanding the likely pathways for their emergence and spread requires knowledge on human-human and human-animal contacts, but such studies are rare. We used self-completed and interviewer-completed contact diaries to quantify patterns of these contacts for 965 individuals in 2017/2018 in a high-income densely-populated area of China, Shanghai City. Interviewer-completed diaries recorded more social contacts (19.3 vs. 18.0) and longer social contact duration (35.0 vs. 29.1 hours) than self-reporting. Strong age-assortativity was observed in all age groups especially among young participants (aged 7C20) and middle aged participants (25C55 years). 17.7% of participants reported touching animals (15.3% (pets), 0.0% (poultry) and 0.1% (livestock)). Human-human contact was very frequent but contact with animals (especially poultry) was rare although associated with frequent human-human contact. Hence, this densely populated area is more likely to act as an accelerator for human-human spread but less likely to be at the source of a zoonosis outbreak. We also propose that telephone interview at the end of reporting day is a potential improvement of the design of future contact surveys.","output":"Patterns of human social contact and contact with animals in Shanghai, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purpose- Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after acute ischemic stroke may cause severe neurological deterioration and affects functional outcome. Identifying patients most likely to suffer from this complication could potentially be used for future treatment selection. Reperfusion after endovascular therapy could be associated with different risk factors for HT than intravenous thrombolytics as these treatments largely differ. In this study, we aimed to identify clinical and imaging markers that are associated with HT subtypes in the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) population. Methods- In this post hoc analysis, all patients with follow-up imaging were included. HT was classified according to ECASS II (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study). Variables with an association of P<0.1 were included in the multivariable logistic regression to identify clinical and radiological variables associated with petechial hemorrhagic infarction, parenchymal hematoma (PH), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Results- Of the 478 out of 500 included patients in this subanalysis, 46% had HT (n=222). Of these, 66% had hemorrhagic infarction (n=147) and 34% PH (n=75). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was observed in 7.3% (n=35) of all patients. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (odds ratio [OR], 1.05,95% CI, 1.01-1.09 per point) and absent/poor collaterals (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.05-3.42) were significantly associated with hemorrhagic infarction. Increased systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.31 per 10 mm Hg) and atrial fibrillation (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.08-3.48) were associated with PH. Increased systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.12-1.48) and antiplatelet use (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.08-6.3) were associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Conclusions- Clinical and imaging stroke severity parameters were associated with HT, both in hemorrhagic infarction and PH, whereas baseline patients characteristics like systolic blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and antiplatelet use were only associated with PH or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

In this study an evaluation of the awareness of rare diseases, alongside related information and educational resources available for patients, their families and healthcare professionals, was conducted in 2018C2019 using an online survey and semi-structured interviews with rare disease collaborative groups (charities, voluntary and community groups) active across Northern Ireland (NI). METHODS: This study had 2 stages. Stage 1 was an online survey and stage 2 involved semi-structured interviews both with rare disease collaborative groups in Northern Ireland. The surveys and interviews were used to locate existing resources as well as identify gaps where the development of further resources would be appropriate. RESULTS: Ninety-nine rare disease collaborative groups engaged with the survey with 31 providing detailed answers. Resources such as information, communication, registries, online services, training and improvements to support services were queried. Excellent communication is an important factor in delivering good rare disease support. Training for health professionals was also highlighted as an essential element of improving support for those with a rare disease to ensure they approach people with these unique and challenging diseases in an appropriate way. Carers were mentioned several times throughout the study; it is often felt they are overlooked in rare disease research and more support should be in place for them. Current care/support for those with a rare disease was highlighted as inadequate. Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with rare disease collaborative groups. Reoccurring themes included a need for more effective information and communication, training for health professionals, online presence, support for carers, and involvement in research. CONCLUSIONS: All rare disease collaborative groups agreed that current services for people living and working with a rare disease are not adequate. An important finding to consider in future research within the rare disease field is the inclusion of carers perceptions and experiences in studies. This research provides insight into the support available for rare diseases across Northern Ireland, highlights unmet needs, and suggests approaches to improve rare disease support.","output":"Improvements needed to support people living and working with a rare disease in Northern Ireland: current rare disease support perceived as inadequate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virtual technology has brought new development opportunities to the tourism market and is expected to help the tourism industry cope with the challenges issuing from the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this context, in this study, we propose and test a model based on the SOR architecture, which includes tourists' experience of virtual tourism, technical readiness (TR), technical acceptance (TA), and tourists' virtual tourism intentions and the variables of flow experience, technical optimism, technical discomfort, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, adoption intention, and consumption intention. To this end, data were collected through a questionnaire survey of Chinese tourists (n = 542). Then, we used a structural equation model (SEM) to test the hypothetical relationships between potential variables. The results showed that the flow experience delivered by the virtual tourism experience affects tourists' tendencies to use and intentions to consume virtual tourism. Second, flow experiences can make tourists more optimistic about virtual tourism technology, reduce tourists' technical discomfort, and enhance tourists' perceptions of usefulness and ease of use. We also found that tourists' intentions to use virtual tourism technology affect their intentions to travel on the spot. These findings provide useful insights for tourism practitioners, suggest new ideas for marketing and sustainable development in the virtual tourism industry, and verify the application of the integrated SOR and TAM framework in the field of tourism consumption.","output":"Flow Experiences and Virtual Tourism: The Role of Technological Acceptance and Technological Readiness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To analyze acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) management during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results: A total of 89 patients with ABP were identified, 58 in period 1 and 31 in period 2, which equates to a 46.6% reduction. The mean age of the patients was 62.75{+/-}16.59 years, and 51 (57.3%) of the patients were female. qSOFA and WSES scores are significantly higher in the patients in period 2 (p=0.031, p=0.032). There were no significant differences regarding hematological parameters except lactate. Lactate levels were significantly higher in period 2 (p=0.012). Twenty-two patients (37.9%) in period 1 and six (19.3%) patients in period 2 underwent cholecystectomy (p=0.072). Cholecystectomy was performed laparoscopically in 18 (81.8%) patients in period 1 and in five (83.3%) patients in period 2 (p=0.932). There were no significant differences regarding surgical intervention between the two periods. Three patients were diagnosed COVID-19 in period 2. All of these patients died. The severity of ABP was significantly worse in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, with over 100% of patients in this group developing severe pancreatitis. Six patients (10.3%) in period 1, 10 (32.2%) patients in period 2 were admitted in ICU (p=0.010). The median length of stay was 5 (1-40) days in period 1 and 4 (2-75) days in period 2 (p= 0.641). The hospital mortality rate was 3.4% and 19.3% in period l and period 2, respectively. Mortality was significantly higher in period 2 (p=0.012). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 outbreak, a significant decrease in the number of patients with ABP and increased severity was observed. Additionally, it can be said that SARS-CoV-2 infection has a mortal course in patients with ABP.

Coelomocytes are the freely circulating cells in the body fluid contained in echinoderm coelom and mediate the cellular defence responses to immune challenges by phagocytosis, encapsulation, cytotoxicity and the production of antimicrobial agents. Coelomocytes have the ability to recognize self from non-self. Considering that sialic acids play important roles in immunity, we determined the presence of sialic acid types in coelomocytes of Paracentrotus lividus. Homogenized coelomocytes were kept in 2 M aqueous acetic acid at 80 C for 3 h to liberate sialic acids. Sialic acids were determined by derivatization with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenediaoxy-benzene dihydrochloride (DMB) followed by capillary liquid-chromatography-electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry (CapLC-ESI-MS/MS).

It includes causal influences of environmental exposures and lifestyle choices, in the context of genetics and medical factors. The representation of cumulative risk as a network of interrelated nodes and arrows helps define and organize the problem and available information, determine the scope and scale, and creates a platform for analysis. It provides an interface for discussing how different entities (e.g., environmental versus health-driven organizations) can work together on different parts of the problem, and facilitates relative risk ranking and management triage. Color coding is used to distinguish categories of stressors and possible oversight responsibility.

Various theories underlie the development of metabolic syndrome, but are fully not understood. METHODS: Revising PubMed and Scopus literature data on metabolic syndrome pathogenesis and management. RESULTS: The most accepted hypothesis is that a cluster of risk factors combined to obtain a truly metabolic syndrome. The pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome depends on the underlying path of development, due to insulin resistance or chronic inflammation, and is usually combined with neurohormonal disturbance. While these defects can be inherited via loss of function of certain genes that lead to either severe obesity, early diabetes, or severe insulin resistance (with or without lipodystrophy). Chronic inflammation is also a driver of metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle is still the therapy of choice in the management of metabolic syndrome, but unfortunately during the lockdown, most people could not reserve a healthy regime; therefore, it can also be referred to as a pandemic with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This powerful illustration shows how defects in specific encoded proteins located predominantly in the brain, pancreatic beta cell, muscle, or fat give rise to these distinct components of the metabolic syndrome. Primarily, obesity and its sequela are the initiators of metabolic syndrome. The presence of metabolic syndrome increases the risk and severity of other pathologies' emergence even in non-related metabolic syndrome diseases such as COVID-19.

We administered trial treatment per day for a maximum of 7 days until either death or hospital discharge. We measured zinc concentration at baseline and during treatment and observed patients for any significant side effects. For eligible patients, we randomized and administered treatment to 33 adult participants to either HDIVZn (n = 15) or placebo (n = 18). We observed no serious adverse events throughout the study for a total of 94 HDIVZn administrations. However, three participants in the HDIVZn group reported infusion site irritation. Mean serum zinc on Day 1 in the placebo, and the HDIVZn group was 6.9  1.1 and 7.7  1.6 mol/l, respectively, consistent with zinc deficiency. HDIVZn, but not placebo, increased serum zinc levels above the deficiency cutoff of 10.7 mol/l (p < .001) on Day 6.

Our aims were to determine whether TLR elevation could be detected in infected periprosthetic tissues and to assess the utility of these biomarkers as tests for detecting a periprosthetic joint infection. METHODS Fifty-nine patients undergoing revision total joint arthroplasty (twenty-seven hips and thirty-two knees) were prospectively evaluated for periprosthetic joint infection according to currently recommended diagnostic criteria. Nine patients were excluded because of insufficient work-up, leaving fifty available for study. Of these, twenty-one were categorized as infected and twenty-nine as noninfected. Periprosthetic tissues were collected intraoperatively, and total RNA was extracted by standard techniques. Expression of TLR messenger RNAs was assessed by first-strand complementary DNA synthesis from 1 g of total RNA followed by real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Results were normalized relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Expression of TLRs 1, 6, and 10 in the infected and noninfected groups was compared with use of the Student t test. The receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) were calculated to determine the accuracy of each TLR for predicting periprosthetic joint infection at its optimal diagnostic threshold. RESULTS Mean TLR1 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in infected compared with noninfected samples (0.600 compared with 0.005, p = 0.0003); the same was true of TLR6 (0.208 compared with 0.0165, p = 0.0059) but not of TLR10 (0.00019 compared with 0.00014, p = 0.6238). The AUC was 0.995 for TLR1, 0.883 for TLR6, and 0.546 for TLR10. The optimal threshold for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection was 0.0924 for TLR1 (sensitivity = 95.2%, specificity = 100%, LR+ = 13.80, LR- = 0.91) and 0.0215 for TLR6 (sensitivity = 85.7%, specificity = 82.8%, LR+ = 4.98, LR- = 0.83). CONCLUSIONS In our pilot study, TLR1 expression in periprosthetic tissues most accurately predicted periprosthetic joint infection. This measure of the host response may be particularly helpful in detecting culture-negative infections and avoiding false positives resulting from contamination.

The impact on global economies has been significant. For example, the Office for National Statistics reported that the UKs unemployment level increased to 5% and the headline GDP declined by 9.9%, which is more than twice the fall in 2009 due to the financial crisis. It is therefore paramount for governments and policymakers to understand the spread of the disease, patient mortality rates and the impact of their interventions on these two factors. A number of researchers have subsequently applied various state-of-the-art forecasting models, such as long short-term memory models (LSTMs), to the problem of forecasting future numbers of Covid-19 cases (confirmed, deaths) with varying levels of success. In this paper, we present a model from the simple recurrent network class, The Multi-recurrent network (MRN), for predicting the future trend of Covid-19 confirmed and deaths cases in the United States. The MRN is a simple yet powerful alternative to LSTMs, which utilises a unique sluggish state-based memory mechanism. To test this mechanism, we first applied the MRN to predicting monthly Covid-19 cases between Feb 2020 to July 2020, which includes the first peak of the pandemic. The MRN is then applied to predicting cases on a weekly basis from late Feb 2020 to late Dec 2020 which includes two peaks. Our results show that the MRN is able to provide superior predictions to the LSTM with significantly fewer adjustable parameters. We attribute this performance to its robust sluggish state memory, lower model complexity and open up the case for simpler alternative models to the LSTM. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Sluggish State-Based Neural Networks Provide State-of-the-art Forecasts of Covid-19 Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scaling up SARS-CoV-2 testing and tracing continues to be plagued with the limitation of the sample collection method, which requires trained healthcare workers to perform and causes discomfort to the patients.

This altered anatomy may increase susceptibility to contracting and transmitting SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. AIMS: To report on (1) the frequency and characteristics of PTL who tested positive for COVID\\\\19, (2) the receipt of advice regarding shielding and patient self\\\\reports of shielding, (3) hospital admissions and length of stay, and (4) mortality rates in this group during the first UK national lockdown. METHODS & PROCEDURES: This is a cross\\\\sectional survey and case note review. National Health Service (NHS) centres providing care to PTL were invited to participate via the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT) Head & Neck Clinical Excellence Networks and through social media. PTL were reviewed by their speech and language therapist either in person or via telehealth between 30 March and 30 September 2020. Data were collected within the time frame covered by the Control of Patient Information (COPI) notice issued for COVID\\\\19 and included information on COVID\\\\19 testing, shielding, hospital admissions, length of stay and deaths. Information was submitted to the lead NHS site using a custom designed data\\\\capture worksheet. Analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, including proportions and frequency counts. Pearson's Chi squared tests were used to compare categorical data using a 5% significance level. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Data were obtained from 1216 PTL from 26 centres across the UK. A total of 81% were male; mean age was 70 years (28C97 years). Of the total group, 12% received a COVID\\\\19 test. A total of 24 (2% of total sample) tested positive for COVID\\\\19. Almost one\\\\third of PTL (32%) received a government letter or were advised to shield by a healthcare professional. During the data collection time frame, 12% had a hospital admission (n = 151) with a median length of stay of 1 day (1C133 days), interquartile range (IQR) = 17 days. A total of 20 of these admissions (13%) had tested positive for COVID\\\\19 with a median length of stay of 26 days, IQR = 49 days. The overall mortality was 4% (41 patients), with eight deaths occurring within 28 days of testing positive for COVID\\\\19. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: This study highlighted the lack of routine national data for neck\\\\breathers with which to compare the current findings. Greater testing in the community is necessary to understand the prevalence of COVID\\\\19 in PTL and if this group is indeed more susceptible. The potential for nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspirates to show differing results when testing for COVID\\\\19 in neck\\\\breathers requires further investigation. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? People with total laryngectomy (PTL) have an altered anatomy for breathing and speaking. The presence of a neck stoma poses an additional virus entry point aside from the nose, mouth and conjunctiva. This could increase the susceptibility to COVID\\\\19 for PTL. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS? This is the first national audit to provide data on shielding, hospital admissions and mortality for patients with total laryngectomy in the UK over the pandemic. The overall mortality in PTL over the first lockdown did not appear to be higher than the best case estimates from previous years. However, one in three PTL who acquired COVID\\\\19 and were admitted to hospital, died within 28 days of testing positive. These findings are relevant to the current care and management of PTL over the pandemic but also highlights important knowledge gaps. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WORK? This study highlights gaps in the collection of baseline information on hospital admissions, length of stay and mortality for people with laryngectomy in the UK, restricting comparisons between the current data and historical data. The need for further research on whether neck\\\\breathers should be tested via both nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspirates is important not just currently, but also in case of any future respiratory epidemics.","output":"Shielding, hospital admission and mortality among 1216 people with total laryngectomy in the UK during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic: A cross\\\\sectional survey from the first national lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After more than a year of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as, lock-downs and masks, questions remain on how effective these interventions were and could have been. The vast differences in the enforcement of and adherence to policies adds complexity to a problem already surrounded with significant uncertainty.

In order to measure and predict the spread of disease under various intervention scenarios, we propose a Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) in which spatial units each follow their own Markov process for the state of disease but are also connected through an underlying mobility matrix. Cuebiq, an offline intelligence and measurement company, provides aggregated, anonymized cell-phone mobility data which reveal how population behaviors have evolved over the course of the pandemic. These data are leveraged to infer mobility patterns across regions and contact patterns within those regions. The data enables the estimation of a baseline for how the pandemic spread under the true ground conditions, so that we can analyze how different shifts in mobility affect the spread of the disease.

Baseline patient characteristics were similar in the NLS (n = 64) and anaesthesiologist-led sedation (ALS) (n = 64) groups except higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (48.4% vs. 31.3%, P = 0.035) and peripheral vascular disease (20.3% vs. 7.8%, P = 0.036) in the ALS group. There was a trend for the larger prostheses used in the ALS group (P = 0.058). The procedural results did not differ, and coronary care team backup was rarely needed in the NLS group (6% of patients). The in-hospital outcomes were identical from both clinical and echocardiography perspectives, and 30-day mortality was low in both groups (1.5%). For the NLS group, preparation in the catheterization laboratory was quicker by 6.4 min (P = 0.01), and intensive care unit stay was shorter (2.03 vs. 3.48 days, P = 0.001).

Methods: In this retrospective study, we included patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from 20th January 2020 to 15th March 2020. The associations of clinical characteristics and treatment regimens on time to viral RNA clearance were analyzed. Results: We examined 284 consecutive COVID-19 cases, accounting for 82% of confirmed cases in Guangzhou during this period. At the time of reporting (20th March 2020), 276 (97.2%) had recovered and were discharged from hospital with a median hospital stay of 18 days (interquartile range [IQR]:13-24). Overall, 280 patients achieved viral RNA clearance with a median length of 12 days (IQR: 8-16) after onset of illness. Amongst them, 66.1% had viral RNA cleared within 14 days, and 89.3% within 21 days. Older age, severity of disease, time lag from illness onset to hospital admission, high body temperature, and corticosteroid use were associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA. None of the antiviral regimens (chloroquine, oseltamivir, arbidol, and lopinavir/ritonavir) improved viral RNA clearance. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA even after adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: In patients with COVID-19, isolation for a minimum of 21 days after onset of illness may be warranted, while the use of antiviral drugs does not enhance viral RNA clearance.","output":"Associations of clinical characteristics and antiviral drugs with viral RNA clearance in patients with COVID-19 in Guangzhou, China: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Shortages in the availability of personal protective face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic required many to fabricate masks and filter inserts from available materials.

Methods Trevo2 participants with internal carotid, M1 and M2 middle cerebral artery occlusions with prospectively collected baseline stroke severity (NIHSS), degree of hypodensity (CT ASPECTS), and three-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were included. Multivariable regression was used to confirm association between PRE score variables (age, NIHSS, and ASPECTS), medical comorbidities, randomization arm, and reperfusion status (mTICI2B/3) with good outcome (three-month modified Rankin Scale 0-2). Predictive power (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) for good outcome of pre-treatment prognostic scores (PRE, THRIVE, HIAT2) was compared. Rates of good outcome were compared between successfully reperfused (mTICI2B/3) and non-reperfused (mTICI0-2A) patients across previously identified PRE score risk groups. Results Age, NIHSS, ASPECTS, reperfusion status, and randomization arm were independent predictors of good outcome. PRE score had moderate predictive power (AUC = 0.75) for good outcome and was comparable to other pre-treatment scores. Reperfusion resulted in maximal treatment benefit in patients with PRE score 0-24 (60% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.002) but not in those with PRE 50 (11.8% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.49).

Reactivation of HBG (HBG1, HBG2) gene expression and induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is an important therapeutic strategy for ameliorating the clinical symptoms and severity of SCD. Hydroxyurea is the only US FDA-approved drug with proven efficacy to induce HbF in SCD patients, yet serious complications have been associated with its use. Over the last three decades, numerous additional pharmacological agents that reactivate HBG transcription in vitro have been investigated, but few have proceeded to FDA approval, with the exception of arginine butyrate and decitabine; however, neither drug met the requirements for routine clinical use due to difficulties with oral delivery and inability to achieve therapeutic levels. Thus, novel approaches that produce sufficient efficacy, specificity, and sustainable HbF induction with low adverse effects are desirable. More recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have gained attention for their diagnostic and therapeutic potential to treat various diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimers disease via targeting oncogenes and their gene products. Thus, it is plausible that miRNAs that target HBG regulatory genes may be useful for inducing HbF as a treatment for SCD. Our laboratory and others have documented the association of miRNAs with HBG activation or suppression via silencing transcriptional repressors and activators, respectively, of HBG expression. Herein, we review progress made in understanding molecular mechanisms of miRNA-mediated HBG regulation and discuss the extent to which molecular targets of HBG might be suitable prospects for development of SCD clinical therapy.

Patients were categorized in five groups based on the clinical presentation, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio and the requirement of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Three cytokines, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10, were markedly higher in severe forms (n = 44) than in non-severe forms (n = 19) (p < 0.005). A score combining levels of these three cytokines (IL-6*IL-8*IL-10) had the highest performance to predict severity: sensitivity of 86.4% (95% CI, 72.4-94.8) and specificity of 94.7% (95% CI, 74.0-99.9) for a cutoff value of 2068 pg/mL.

Virulence factors contributing to infection and immune evasion are of particular interest. A potential virulence factor of the neuropathogenic EHV-1 strain Ab4 is ORF2. This study on 24 Icelandic horses, 2 to 4 years of age, describes the infection with EHV-1 Ab4, or its deletion mutant devoid of ORF2 (Ab4ORF2) compared to non-infected controls (each group n = 8). The horses' clinical presentation, virus shedding, viremia, antibody and cellular immune responses were monitored over 260 days after experimental infection. RESULTS Infection with Ab4ORF2 reduced fever and minimized nasal virus shedding after infection compared to the parent virus strain Ab4, while Ab4ORF2 established viremia similar to Ab4. Concurrently with virus shedding, intranasal cytokine and interferon  (IFN-) production increased in the Ab4 group, while horses infected with Ab4ORF2 expressed less IFN-. The antibody response to EHV-1 was evaluated by a bead-based multiplex assay and was similar in both infected groups, Ab4 and Ab4ORF2. EHV-1 specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 was induced 8 days after infection (d8 pi) with a peak on d10-12 pi. EHV-1 specific IgG4/7 increased starting on d10 pi, and remained elevated in serum until the end of the study. The intranasal antibody response to EHV-1 was dominated by the same IgG isotypes and remained elevated in both infected groups until d130 pi. In contrast to the distinct antibody response, no induction of EHV-1 specific T-cells was detectable by flow cytometry after ex vivo re-stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with EHV-1 in any group. The cellular immune response was characterized by increased secretion of IFN- and interleukin10 in response to ex vivo re-stimulation of PBMC with EHV-1. This response was present during the time of viremia (d5-10 pi) and was similar in both infected groups, Ab4 and Ab4ORF2.

These measures resulted in school closures, social isolation, and job loss, which all contributed to increased psychosocial stress, particularly among families with pre-existing vulnerability factors. Given the relationship between increased psychosocial stress and intimate partner violence (IPV), this rapid review investigated change in the prevalence and correlates of IPV victimization during the first six months of the pandemic.

There were 19 studies that examined changes in the rate of IPV from before the COVID-19 pandemic to during the pandemic. Of the studies examining changes in the rate of IPV, 11 found a significant increase. Key vulnerability factors contributing to the increase include low socioeconomic status, unemployment, a personal or familial COVID-19 diagnosis, family mental illness, or overcrowding. Six studies examined whether the presence of children in the home was associated with IPV, but the direction of this relationship was inconsistent.

METHODS A narrative report based on the evolution of key published guidelines, systematic reviews and medical policies since the 1940s. RESULTS Case reports of the value of exercise in cardiac disease can be dated back to 1772. Formative groundwork for exercise-based CR was published between 1940 and 1970. However, it was not until the late 1980s that a large enough data set of controlled trials was available to show significant reductions in premature all-cause and cardiac mortality. Since the mid 1990s, cardiac mortality has been greatly reduced due to enhanced public health, emergency care and more sensitive diagnostic techniques and aggressive treatments. As a result, there appears to be an associated reduced potency of CR to affect mortality. New rationales for why, how and where CR is delivered have emerged including: adapting to a longer surviving ageing multi-morbid population, where healthcare cost savings and quality of life have become increasingly important. CONCLUSIONS In light of these results, an emerging focus for CR, and in some cases \\"pre-habilitation\\", is that of a chronic disability management programme increasingly delivered in community and home settings. Within this delivery model, the use of remote personalised technologies is now emerging, especially with new needs accelerated by the pandemic of COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONWith continued advances in medical science and better long term survival, the nature of cardiac rehabilitation has evolved over the past eight decades. It was originally an exercise-focused intervention on short term recovery and reducing cardiac and all-cause mortality, to now being one part of a multi-factor lifestyle, behavioural, and medical chronic disease management programme.Throughout history, the important influence of psycho-social well-being and human behaviour has, however, always been of key importance to patients.The location of rehabilitation can now be suited to patient need, both medically and socially, where the same components can be delivered in either a traditional outpatient clinic, community settings, at home and more recently all of these being supported or augmented with the advent of mobile technology.","output":"The changing landscape of cardiac rehabilitation; from early mobilisation and reduced mortality to chronic multi-morbidity management."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Knowledge revision is the process of updating incorrect prior knowledge in light of new, correct information.

However, this sudden shift in favor of RVC has left small healthcare businesses, such as clinics, physician offices, and pharmacies, struggling to align resources and operations to the new RVC realities. Insights into the current perceptions of small healthcare businesses towards remote care, particularly concerning their perceptions of whether RVC adoption will synergistically improve their business's sustainability, will provide insight to policymakers regarding the pros and cons of rapidly adopting RVC technology. OBJECTIVE: The study's objective is to gauge small healthcare business owners' perception of RVC's impact on their business's sustainability in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it measures their perceptions of their current level of adoption of and satisfaction with RVC models, how well this aligns with their perceptions of the current business scenario (SCBS), and whether these perceptions influence their view about their own business's mid-term sustainability (SUST). Three groups of small healthcare businesses (i.e., Clinics, Physician Offices, and Pharmacies) are randomly sampled across Colorado. METHODS: We randomly sampled small clinics, physician offices, and pharmacies across Colorado and collected survey data via the assistance of a consulting firm in July 2020. An ordinary least square regression, controlling for demographical characteristics of the business owners, was used for analysis. The focal estimated effects of the study were compared across the three groups of small businesses to draw several insights. RESULTS: The total sample size was 270 respondents, consisting of 82 Clinic, 99 Small Physician Office, and 89 Pharmacy owners across the state of Colorado. The estimation results suggest that the direct effects of SRVC and SCBS on SUST are significant and positive. The goal of the paper, however, is measured via the interaction effect between SRVC and SCBC, which measures whether the adoption of RVC aligns with their perceptions of the current business scenario and whether this interaction impacts their perception of their business's sustainability. We find differing effects across the three groups. The interaction term SRVC  SCBS is significant and positive for the clinics sample (p = 0.02), significant and negative for the physician offices sample (p = 0.05), and not significant for the pharmacy owners' sample. These variations explain that while RVC alignment with the current business scenario is perceived positively by clinics, the opposite is true for small physician offices. CONCLUSIONS: As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to grow worldwide, and the adoption of remote and virtual care is progressing at a rapid speed, it is critical to understand its impact on small healthcare businesses and their perceptions of long-term survival. This study finds that small physician practices are not able to take advantage of rapid remote and virtual care developments and, in contrast to clinics, feel it to be incompatible with business survival during (and following) the current pandemic. If small healthcare firms are unable to compete with RVC (or synergistically integrate RVC platforms into their current business practices) and eventually go out of business, the damage thus inflicted to traditional healthcare services may be severe, particularly in the area of critical care delivery and other important services that RVC cannot effectively replace. This paper hence has implications for public policy decisions such as incentive-aligned models, policy-initiated incentives, and payer-based strategies for improved alignment between RVC and existing models.","output":"Impact of remote and virtual care models on the sustainability of small healthcare firms: A perceptual analysis of small clinics, physician offices, and pharmacies in Colorado"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Those in positions of leadership are accustomed to having to deal with complex and uncertain situations.

The use of antivirals targeted at host proteins is less developed but it has the potential advantage of not being affected by mutations in the genome of the virus and therefore being active against all its variants.

We emphasize the differences in reported structures and that analysis of structureCfunction relationships is sensitive to the structure used. We show that the average residue solvent exposure in nearly complete structures is a good descriptor of open vs closed conformation states. Because of structural heterogeneity of functionally important surface-exposed residues, we recommend using averages of a group of high-quality protein structures rather than a single structure before reaching conclusions on specific structureCfunction relationships. To illustrate these points, we analyze some significant chemical tendencies of prominent S-protein mutations in the context of the available structures. In the discussion of new variants, we emphasize the selectivity of binding to ACE2 vs prominent antibodies rather than simply the antibody escape or ACE2 affinity separately. We note that larger chemical changes, in particular increased electrostatic charge or side-chain volume of exposed surface residues, are recurring in mutations of concern, plausibly related to adaptation to the negative surface potential of human ACE2. We also find indications that the fixated mutations of the S-protein in the main variants are less destabilizing than would be expected on average, possibly pointing toward a selection pressure on the S-protein.

Methods A cross-sectional survey was designed to assess the social and occupational effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in MS patients in these three countries, using a 25-item anonymous online questionnaire, structured into three sections. Quantitative data are expressed as mean (standard deviation), and quantitative data as absolute frequency and percentage. Results A total of 361 participants responded to the questionnaire: 194 from China, 104 from Spain, and 63 from Cuba. We found no cases of COVID-19 among Chinese patients with MS, and few cases in Spain and Cuba. Respondents reported different levels of impact on relationships with friends, family, and colleagues, and patients in all three countries described increased use of digital or social media platforms. Spanish patients reported a significantly less negative impact than those in Cuba and China. Mental and cognitive effects were similar in all three countries, although China seemed to have a better situation. We also found that the time spent exercising decreased at specific points during the pandemic, but with few changes in dietary habits. Patients reported little or no change in their means of transport in all three countries. Most patients in all three countries reported little or no physical deterioration, especially in Chinese patients (82.47%), compared to the Spanish (70.20%) and Cuban respondents (73.02%). In general, patients from all three countries demonstrated confidence in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic, although to a lesser extent among Spanish respondents. Conclusions During the pandemic, family support was more effective in China than in Cuba and Spain. Neither COVID-19 infections nor the number of MS relapses increased significantly during lockdown in any of the three countries. Regarding their economic situation, Spanish MS patients reported a significantly less severe negative impact than those in Cuba and China. Patients from all three countries used digital or social media platforms more frequently, probably to maintain personal relationships.

This endogenous virus and its exogenous forms may induce lymphomas and immunodeficiency associated with opportunistic infections, including chlamydia infections. To generate a vaccine, we produced the recombinant surface and transmembrane envelope proteins of the KoRV and immunized goats, rats and mice. In all cases, we obtained antibodies which were able to neutralize the KoRV and recognize defined epitopes in the envelope proteins. However, we and others observed that koalas carrying the endogenous KoRV are tolerant, e.g., are unable to induce an immune response to the virus. Nevertheless, we propose that KoRV-negative animals will produce an antiviral immune response and will be protected when immunized with such a vaccine. This immunization will also reduce the number and severity of opportunistic infections because there is no KoRV-induced immunosuppression. ABSTRACT: The koala retrovirus (KoRV) is spreading in the koala population from the north to the south of Australia and is also in the process of endogenization into the koala genome. Virus infection is associated with tumorigenesis and immunodeficiency and is contributing to the decline of the animal population. Antibody production is an excellent marker of retrovirus infection; however, animals carrying endogenous KoRV are tolerant. Therefore, the therapeutic immunization of animals carrying endogenous KoRV seems to be ineffective. Using the recombinant transmembrane (TM) envelope protein of the KoRV, we immunized goats, rats and mice, obtaining in all cases neutralizing antibodies which recognize epitopes in the fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR), and in the membrane-proximal external region (MPER). Immunizing several animal species with the corresponding TM envelope protein of the closely related porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), as well as the feline leukemia virus (FeLV), we also induced neutralizing antibodies with similar epitopes. Immunizing with the TM envelope protein in addition to the surface envelope proteins of all three viruses resulted in higher titers of neutralizing antibodies. Immunizing KoRV-negative koalas with our vaccine (which is composed of both envelope proteins) may protect these animals from infection, and these may be the starting points of a virus-free population.","output":"Vaccination against the Koala Retrovirus (KoRV): Problems and Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus termed SARS-CoV-2, has spread quickly worldwide. Convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from patients following recovery from COVID-19 infection and development of antibodies against the virus is an attractive option for either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment, since antibodies may have direct or indirect antiviral activities and immunotherapy has proven effective in principle and in many clinical reports. OBJECTIVE: We seek to characterize the latest advances and evidence in the use of CP for COVID-19 through a systematic review and quantitative analysis, identify knowledge gaps in this setting, and offer recommendations and directives for future research. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were continuously searched for studies assessing the use of CP for COVID-19, including clinical studies, commentaries, reviews, guidelines or protocols, and in vitro testing of CP antibodies. The screening process and data extraction were performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Quality appraisal of all clinical studies was conducted using a universal tool independent of study designs. A meta-analysis of case-control and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Substantial literature has been published covering various aspects of CP therapy for COVID-19. Of the references included in this review, a total of 243 eligible studies including 64 clinical studies, 79 commentary articles, 46 reviews, 19 guidance and protocols, and 35 in vitro testing of CP antibodies matched the criteria. Positive results have been mostly observed so far when using CP for the treatment of COVID-19. There were remarkable heterogeneities in the CP therapy with respect to patient demographics, donor antibody titers, and time and dose of CP administration. The studies assessing the safety of CP treatment reported low incidence of adverse events. Most clinical studies, in particular case reports and case series, had poor quality. Only 1 RCT was of high quality. Randomized and nonrandomized data were found in 2 and 11 studies, respectively, and were included for meta-analysis, suggesting that CP could reduce mortality and increase viral clearance. Despite promising pilot studies, the benefits of CP treatment can only be clearly established through carefully designed RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: There is developing support for CP therapy, particularly for patients who are critically ill or mechanically ventilated and resistant to antivirals and supportive care. These studies provide important lessons that should inform the planning of well-designed RCTs to generate more robust knowledge for the efficacy of CP in patients with COVID-19. Future research is necessary to fill the knowledge gap regarding prevention and treatment for patients with COVID-19 with CP while other therapeutics are being developed.","output":"Convalescent Plasma for the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Quantitative Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious respiratory disease, which has caused a pandemic that has become the world's leading public health emergency, threatening people of all ages worldwide, especially the elderly. Complications of COVID-19 are closely related to an upregulation of the inflammatory response revealed by the pro-inflammatory profile of plasma cytokines (to the point of causing a cytokine storm), which is also a contributing cause of the associated coagulation disorders with venous and arterial thromboembolisms, causing multiple organ dysfunction and failure. In severe fulminant cases of COVID-19, there is an activation of coagulation and consumption of clotting factors leading to a deadly disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). It is well established that human immune response changes with age, and also that the pro-inflammatory profile of plasma cytokines is upregulated in both healthy and diseased elderly people. In fact, normal aging is known to be associated with a subclinical, sterile, low-grade, systemic pro-inflammatory state linked to the chronic activation of the innate immune system, a phenomenon known as \\"inflammaging\\". Inflammaging may play a role as a condition contributing to the co-occurrence of the severe hyper-inflammatory state (cytokine storm) during COVID-19, and also in other severe infections (sepsis) in older people. Moreover, we must consider the impact of inflammation on coagulation due to the crosstalk between inflammation and coagulation. The systemic inflammatory state and coagulation disorders are closely related, a phenomenon that here we call \\"coagul-aging\\" (Giunta S.). In this review, we discuss the various degrees of inflammation in older adults after being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the adverse effects of aging on the inflammatory response and coagulation system. It is important to note that although there is no gender difference in susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, however, due to differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, innate immunity, and comorbidities, older men exhibit more severe disease and higher mortality than older women. There are currently no FDA-approved specific antiviral drugs that can be used against the virus.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Prospective cohort studies with any follow-up period. Studies had to develop or validate multifactorial prognostic models for falls in community-dwelling older adults (60+ years). Models had to be applicable for screening in a general population setting. INFORMATION SOURCE MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and Web of Science for studies published in English, Danish, Norwegian or Swedish until January 2020. Sources also included trial registries, clinical guidelines, reference lists of included papers, along with contacting clinical experts to locate published studies. DATA EXTRACTION AND RISK OF BIAS Two authors performed all review stages independently. Data extraction followed the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies checklist. Risk of bias assessments on participants, predictors, outcomes and analysis methods followed Prediction study Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool. RESULTS After screening 11 789 studies, 30 were eligible for inclusion (n=86 369 participants). Median age of participants ranged from 67.5 to 83.0 years. Falls incidences varied from 5.9% to 59%. Included studies reported 69 developed and three validated prediction models. Most frequent falls predictors were prior falls, age, sex, measures of gait, balance and strength, along with vision and disability. The area under the curve was available for 40 (55.6%) models, ranging from 0.49 to 0.87. Validated models' The area under the curve ranged from 0.62 to 0.69. All models had a high risk of bias, mostly due to limitations in statistical methods, outcome assessments and restrictive eligibility criteria. CONCLUSIONS An abundance of prognostic models on falls risk have been developed, but with a wide range in discriminatory performance. All models exhibited a high risk of bias rendering them unreliable for prediction in clinical practice. Future prognostic prediction models should comply with recent recommendations such as Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis.

The difference between the patients with URTI and healthy subjects in their response to airway vibration may be explained on the basis of hyperreactivity of airway sensory receptors. We propose that the model of cough induced by airway vibration may be useful for studies on the pathophysiology and pharmacology of airway hyperreactivity in acute cough.

IL-6 is an important therapeutic target as a main mediator of cytokine storm. The aim of our study was to evaluate the tocilizumab (TCZ) efficacy and factors affecting the therapy outcome. METHODS: This retrospective study included 27 patients treated with TCZ for COVID-19-MAS. All patients in this study were treated with TCZ (intravenously, at a dose of 8 mg kg1 ) in addition to standard therapy. Clinical improvement (survival and decreased oxygen demand) on the 10-14th days and secondary infection rate were assessed. RESULTS: In our 27 treated patients, 14 (51.8%) received TCZ in the intensive care unit (ICU) and seven (25.9%) were need to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Fifteen (55.6%) of these patients revealed a good clinical response (four patients discharge from the ICU and 11 patients who followed-up in nonICU beds showed a decrease in oxygen demand). TCZ was significantly less effective in patients having high Murray lung injury score, low PO2/FiO2 ratio, IMV, and ICU admission (P < .05). Severity of hypoxemia was found as a single independent risk factor in the multivariable analysis (P < .05). Secondary bacterial infections rate was significantly higher in intubated patients (P < .01) or treated in the ICU (P ? .01). CONCLUSION: TCZ was showed limited efficacy for COVID-19-related MAS. The most important predictive indicator for therapy outcome was found as the severity of hypoxemia. In addition, IMV and/or ICU was associated with the poor outcome and high side effect.

METHODS one hundred nineteen intracranial aneurysms (38 ruptured, 81 unruptured) were analyzed from 3-dimensional angiographic images and computational fluid dynamics. Six morphological and 7 hemodynamic parameters were evaluated for significance with respect to rupture. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified area under the curve (AUC) and optimal thresholds separating ruptured from unruptured aneurysms for each parameter. Significant parameters were examined by multivariate logistic regression analysis in 3 predictive models-morphology only, hemodynamics only, and combined-to identify independent discriminants, and the AUC receiver operating characteristic of the predicted probability of rupture status was compared among these models. RESULTS morphological parameters (size ratio, undulation index, ellipticity index, and nonsphericity index) and hemodynamic parameters (average wall shear stress [WSS], maximum intra-aneurysmal WSS, low WSS area, average oscillatory shear index, number of vortices, and relative resident time) achieved statistical significance (P<0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated size ratio to be the only independently significant factor in the morphology model (AUC, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.91), whereas WSS and oscillatory shear index were the only independently significant variables in the hemodynamics model (AUC, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.93).

Assessing welfare, beyond physical indicators of health, is challenging and often relies on qualitative techniques. Behaviour is a key component of welfare to consider and Qualitative Behaviour Assessment (QBA) aims to achieve this by systematically scoring behaviour across specific terms. In recent years, numerous studies have conducted QBA by using video footage, however, the method was not originally developed using video and video QBA (V-QBA) requires validation. Forty live QBAs were conducted, by two assessors, on housed beef cattle to help fill this validation gap. Video was recorded over the assessment period and a second video assessment was conducted. Live and video scores for each term were compared for both correlation and significant difference. Principle component analysis (PCA) was then conducted and correlations and differences between QBA and V-QBA for the first two components were calculated. Of the 20 terms, three were removed due to an overwhelming majority of scores of zero. Of the remaining 17 terms, 12 correlated significantly, and a significant pairwise difference was found for one (Bored). QBA and V-QBA results correlated across both PC1 (defined as arousal) and PC2 (defined as mood). Whilst there was no significant difference between the techniques for PC1, there was for PC2, with V-QBA generally yielding lower scores than QBA. Furthermore, based on PC1 and PC2, corresponding QBA and V-QBA scores were significantly closer than would be expected at random. Results found broad agreement between QBA and V-QBA at both univariate and multivariate levels. However, the lack of absolute agreement and muted V-QBA results for PC2 mean that caution should be taken when implementing V-QBA and that it should ideally be treated independently from live QBA until further evidence is published.

Among the booming literatures about COVID-19, there is yet a paucity of study addressing the association between COVID-19 and cancer, which is a rare comorbidity of COVID-19, as well as consensus for treatment of cancer in this pandemic. Methods: In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, information of all inpatient cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had treatment outcome were collected from the designated departments in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China on March 10, 2020. Demographic data, clinical information, and treatment outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records. Severe events were defined as admission to intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Result: A total of 716 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were identified. Among them, a total of 12 cases (1.7%, 95% CI: 0.7%-2.6%) had history of cancer with 4 cases (33%) experienced severe events. Compared with cases without cancer, patients with cancer have higher risks of severe events (33% vs 7.7%, p=0.012) and deaths (25% vs 3.6%, p=0.009). Multivariable logistic regression model showed that cancer was independently associated with increased odds of severe events after adjusting for other risk factors (OR 6.51, 95% CI 1.72-24.64; p=0.006). Among COVID-19 patients with cancer, we found that patients older than 60 years (75%), with other comorbidities (50%), or experiencing anticancer treatment in past month (42.9%) had a numerically higher incidence of severe events. Conclusion: Cancer is a rare comorbidity of patients with COVID-19; however, it cannot be overemphasized due to its poorer outcomes.

This study assessed body condition score (BCS) of show dogs of six selected popular breeds at a major Swedish dog show event and examined the association between BCS and performance in competition. RESULTS: At one of Swedens largest dog shows, BCS of 120 dogs of six different breeds was assessed by trained animal healthcare personnel, using a 9-point BCS scale with conditional cut-off for overweight set to BCS  6. Prevalence of overweight in the cohort was 32% but all overweight dogs except one displayed only slight overweight (BCS 6) and no dog was assessed as obese (BCS 8C9). Prevalence of overweight differed significantly between breeds (P < 0.0001) with Labrador retrievers, Golden retrievers and French bulldogs showing the highest mean BCS (5.6C5.7) and highest prevalence of overweight (50C67%). Lean and overweight dogs received awards and higher show awards (certificates) to the same extent, and no significant association between slight overweight and performance in competition was found. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of overweight in Swedish show dogs was relatively high and in the same range as in the Swedish dog population as a whole. Dog owners, breeders and judges should be made aware of canine obesity problems and trained in BCS assessment, to better prevent canine overweight and associated health risks. This is particularly important for retriever and brachycephalic breeds, which showed high prevalence of slight overweight and have breed-specific health problems exacerbated by overweight.

A descriptive analysis was adopted for the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases,including time,spatial and population distribution,severity of symptoms, and exposure history. @*Results @#Totally 1 284 cases were reported,of which 1 176 were confirmed cases (91.59%) and 108 were asymptomatic cases (8.41%). The first confirmed case was reported on January 21. The curve of the disease onset peaked from January 22 to 29, with 87 cases as the biggest number a day. The curve of the disease reported peaked from January 28 to 30, with 130 cases as the biggest number a day. Then the number of the cases showed a declining trend. By February 4, totally 79 counties (cities, districts) had confirmed cases, covering 87.78% of Zhejiang Province, and it has not increase since then. A male to female ratio of 1.021 was reported among 1 284 cases,1 021 were 30-69 years old (79.52%) and 339 (26.40%) were business service providers. There were 11 health workers reported to be infected,but not by occupational exposure. Among the confirmed cases, 1 010 (85.88%) were clinically mild cases. One case died. Before January 23, the cases were mainly imported from Hubei Province, local cases were predominant by the end of January. @*Conclusions @#The COVID-19 epidemic has spread widely in Zhejiang Province and people are generally susceptible. Most cases were clinically mild, and were aged 30-69 years. No health workers infected were due to occupational exposure. The incidence of COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province has turned into a lower level,suggesting that the early prevention and control measures have achieved initial results. With people returning from holiday, precise prevention and control should be put into effect.","output":"Epidemiological characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in Zhejiang Province/ Ԥҽѧ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article assesses the role of recipient genetics to COVID-19 vaccine responses. Vaccines represent preventative interventions suitable to an immunogenetic perspective to predict how human variability will influence their safety and efficacy. The genetic polymorphism among individuals within any population can make possible that the immunity elicited by a vaccine is variable in length and strength. The same immune challenge (either virus or vaccine) could provoke partial, complete or even failed protection for some individuals treated under the same conditions. We review genetic variants and mechanistic relationships among chemokines, chemokine receptors, interleukins, interferons, interferon receptors, toll-like receptors, histocompatibility antigens, various immunoglobulins and major histocompatibility complex antigens. These are the targets for variation among macrophages, dendritic cells, Natural Killer cells, T- and B- lymphocytes, and complement. The acute nature of vaccine reactogenicity is reminiscent of the time course of adverse drug reaction mediated by the immune system. The variety of technology platforms (mRNA, viral vectors) utilized currently to produce vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infections may each also trigger genetically distinct immune reactogenic profiles. With biobanking of recipient genomic DNA and serum immunoprofiling, global COVID-19 vaccinations could launch a new era of research and clinical translation in personalized health.","output":"Personalized Health and the Coronavirus Vaccines --Do Individual Genetics Matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability of 14 days of self-quarantine and the positivity rate of pre-operative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening for patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: The self-quarantine programme and pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening were initiated for patients who were scheduled for admission later than 7 May 2020 for elective orthopaedic surgery on admission. On the day of admission, the patients declared compliance with self-quarantine regulations. The admission was refused in cases of non-compliance. After admission, the patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening. If PCR results were negative, isolation was terminated. If PCR results were positive, the surgery was postponed. If the patients had symptoms suspicious of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) after surgery, the PCR test was repeated. RESULTS: Overall, 308 patients (age: 63.2  18.8 years, 197 female and 111 male) were scheduled for elective orthopaedic surgery. Two patients did not agree with the requirements of self-quarantine, and two other procedures were cancelled. No non-compliance was reported; thus, the completion rate of the self-quarantine programme was 304/308 (98.7%). Finally, 304 patients underwent PCR testing, and there were no positive PCR results. After cancellations of four operations due to reasons other than COVID-19, 300 surgical procedures were performed. No patients developed COVID-19 during hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Although this system is based on trusting the good behaviour of patients, accompanied by PCR screening, we believe that the results showed the efficacy of the system in safely performing orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Self-quarantine programme and pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening for orthopaedic elective surgery: experience from Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The biodynamics of ultrasmall and small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO and SPIO, respectively) particles that were injected intraperitoneally into 36 C57BL/6 mice were investigated chronologically. Their distribution was studied histologically at six time points by measuring iron-positive areas (m(2)) in organ sections stained with Prussian blue. The uptake of the differently sized particles was also compared by cultured murine macrophages (J774.1). Iron-positive areas in the liver were significantly larger in the mice injected with USPIO than those injected with SPIO at the first three time points (P < 0.05). The amount of USPIO in the lung parenchyma around the airway was larger than that of SPIO at four time points (P < 0.05); distribution to the lymph nodes was not significantly different. The amount of iron was significantly larger in SPIO- than USPIO-treated cultured cells (P < 0.05).

DESCRIPTION Two independent concepts were combined into one design aiming to overcome the limitation of passing the straight anvil of an endoscopic stapler through a tunnel typically created by a curved dissection instrument within the complex cluster of tubular structures that comprise the pulmonary hilum. EVALUATION A library of 45 unedited advanced thoracoscopic lung resection videos containing a balance of all major anatomic resections (36 lobectomy and 9 pneumonectomy) spanning 2004 to 2011 were reviewed, and 220 hilar structure division times were measured along with the adjunctive techniques like catheter leaders or silicone slings. Prolonged passage times occurred throughout the series despite improved experience; however, early experience with 51 passes using the new design showed significant time savings (median 61 s versus 115 s, p = 0.005).

This difference may result from behavioural changes in the population (social distancing, masks, etc). Finally, we introduce a double logistic model to describe the dynamic proportion of COVID-19 deaths occurring in each setting. This analysis reveals that the proportion of COVID-19 deaths occurring in Care Homes increases from the start of the pandemic and past the peak in total number of COVID-19 deaths in the first wave.

Obesity is linked to an increased risk of comorbidities and premature mortality. Several studies have shown that obesity negatively impacts male fertility through various mechanisms. This review aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms through which obesity impairs male reproduction, including obesity-associated hypogonadism and its effects on spermatogenesis, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Obesity negatively impacts both conventional and biofunctional sperm parameters, and it also induces epigenetic changes that can be transferred to offspring. Moreover, obesity-related diseases are linked to a dysregulation of adipocyte function and micro-environmental inflammatory processes. The dysregulated adipokines significantly influence insulin signaling, and they may also have a detrimental effect on testicular function. Sirtuins can also play an important role in inflammatory and metabolic responses in obese patients.

We examined the impact of dose reduction techniques using ECG-triggering, kVp/mAs reduction and high-pitch modes on radiation exposure in a large Australian tertiary CCTA service. METHODS Data on acquisition modes and dose exposure were prospectively collected on all CCTA scans from November 2009 to March 2014 at an Australian tertiary care centre. A dose reduction algorithm was developed using published techniques and implemented with education of medical staff, radiographers and referrers. Associations of CCTA acquisition to radiation over time were analysed with multivariate regression. Specificity in positive CCTA was assessed by correlation with invasive coronary angiography. RESULTS 3333 CCTAs were analysed. Mean radiation dose decreased from 8.4 mSv to 5.3, 4.4, 3.7, 2.9 and 2.8 mSv (P < 0.001) per year. Patient characteristics were unchanged. Dose reduction strategies using ECG-triggering, kVp/mAs reduction accounted for 91% of the decrease. High-pitch scanning reduced dose by an additional 9%. Lower dose was independently related to lower kVp, heart rate, tube current modulation, BMI, prospective triggering and high-pitch mode (P < 0.01). CCTA specificity remained unchanged despite dose reduction. CONCLUSION Implementation of evidence-based CCTA dose reduction algorithm and staff education programme resulted in a 67% reduction in radiation exposure, while maintaining diagnostic specificity.

While techniques have been developed to facilitate the communication of uncertainty, many have not been empirically tested, compared for communicating different types of uncertainty, or their effects on different cognitive, trust, and behavioral outcomes have not been evaluated. The present study examined how a point estimate, imprecise estimate, conflicting estimates, or a statement about the lack of evidence about treatment effects, influenced participant's responses to communications about medical evidence. For each type of uncertainty, we adapted three display formats to communicate the information: tables, bar graphs, and icon arrays. We compared participant's best estimates of treatment effects, as well as effects on recall, subjective evaluations (understandability and usefuleness), certainty perceptions, perceptions of trustworthiness of the information, and behavioral intentions. We did not find any detrimental effects from communicating imprecision or conflicting estimates relative to a point estimate across any outcome. Furthermore, there were more favorable responses to communicating imprecision or conflicting estimates relative to lack of evidence, where participants estimated the treatment would improve outcomes by 30-50% relative to a placebo. There were no differences across display formats, suggesting that, if well-designed, it may not matter which format is used.

STUDY DESIGN: This study is a cross-sectional explorative survey using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised of 40 questions that were subdivided into 4 subjects; workload, specialist training aspects in obstetrics and gynaecology, health and safety of the trainee and women's health and maternal health issues. Inclusion criteria consisted of being a trainee in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (ObGyn) at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe or trainees who had recently finished their training during the time of the outbreak. Taking part in the survey was voluntary. The questionnaire was shared on the website of the European Network for Trainees in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (ENTOG), ENTOG social media, in the ENTOG-newsletter and through the national representatives of ENTOG. RESULTS: 110 ObGyn trainees from 25 different countries responded to the questionnaire. Almost all trainees (95 %, N = 105) reported an effect on their training due to COVID-19 pandemic. Training was interrupted in 21 % of cases (n = 23). Trainees observed a decrease in educational activities or lectures and a decrease in number of patients. The possibility of training surgical skills decreased, because 67 % (N = 74) trainees reported that surgeries were cancelled. Trainees expressed concerns about reaching the goals of their ObGyn specialist training in 60 % (n = 66) of cases. A decrease in workload was experienced during the first COVID-19 wave in Europe by 60 % (n = 66) of trainees. On average these trainees worked 33 % less hours compared to a normal workweek. Although 22 % (n = 24) were expected to be available continuously for 24 h a day and 7 days a week for unscheduled duties, 15 % (n = 16) were deployed to work on special COVID-units. Concerning preparation, 45 % of the trainees (n = 50) had not received any training for treating COVID-positive patients. Trainees claimed to have enough personal protective equipment (PPE), although problems were reported. Any form of psychosocial support was arranged for 65 % of trainees (n = 71) by the hospital or department. The results of the survey suggest that obstetric care was not affected much (92 % (n = 102) of the respondents said at least necessary care continued) while patients in need for reproductive medicine were affected the most; out of the 110 departments 58 % (n = 60) were closed and 35 % (n = 36) reduced their activities. Access to family planning and benign gynaecology were also significantly reduced; 77 % and 87 % respectively of the departments were less accessible or only open to emergency cases.

METHODS: A total of 616 Chinese residents from 28 provinces were recruited to participate in this investigation. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic characteristics, cognition of COVID-19, and disease-related stress sources. Coping styles were assessed via the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). RESULTS: The survey showed that the main source of information on COVID-19 was different in relation to gender, age, educational level, and occupation (p < 0.001). People's knowledge of the disease, preventive measures, and stress factors were different in relation to demographic characteristics (p < 0.001). Compared with the baseline values, the scores of positive coping and negative coping based on SCSQ in relation to gender, age, educational level, and occupation were statistically significant (p < 0.001, except for participants older than 60 years). Different educational levels corresponded to statistical significant differences in positive coping (p = 0.004) but not in negative coping.

This study aimed to use anonymised veterinary clinical data from the VetCompass? Programme to report the frequency of common disorders of dogs under primary veterinary care in the UK during 2016 and to explore effects associated with age, sex and neuter status. RESULTS From an available population of 905,543 dogs under veterinary care at 886 veterinary clinics during 2016, the current study included a random sample of 22,333 (2.47 %) dogs from 784 clinics. Prevalence for each disorder was calculated at the most refined level of diagnostic certainty (precise-level precision) and after grouping to a more general level of diagnostic precision (grouped-level precision). The most prevalent precise-level precision disorders recorded were periodontal disease (prevalence 12.52 %, 95 % CI: 12.09-12.97), otitis externa (7.30 %, 95 % CI: 6.97-7.65) and obesity (7.07 %, 95 % CI: 6.74-7.42). The most prevalent grouped-level disorders were dental disorder (14.10 %, 95 % CI: 13.64-14.56), skin disorder (12.58 %, 95 % CI: 12.15-13.02) and enteropathy (10.43 %, 95 % CI: 10.04-10.84). Associations were identified for many common disorders with age, sex and neuter. CONCLUSIONS The overall findings can assist veterinarians and owners to prioritise preventive care and to understand demographic risk factors in order to facilitate earlier diagnosis of common disorders in dogs. The information on associations with age, sex and neuter status provides additional contextual background to the complexity of disorder occurrence and supports targeted health controls for demographic subsets of dogs.","output":"Prevalence of commonly diagnosed disorders in UK dogs under primary veterinary care: results and applications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The tourism sector in Indonesia has currently been designated as a leading sector for development and is being boosted as a source of foreign exchange.

To improve patient safety and oncological care quality, the routes of administration for use of medical cannabis, patients reasons, and prescribed indications must be better understood. METHODS: Based on the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, a scoping review was conducted to map the current evidence regarding the use of medical cannabis in oncological settings based on the experiences of patients diagnosed with cancer and their healthcare providers. A search strategy was developed with a scientific librarian which included five databases (CINAHL, Web of Science, Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO) and two grey literature sources (Google Scholar and ProQuest). The inclusion criteria were: 1) population: adults aged 18 and over diagnosed with cancer; 2) phenomena of interest: reasons for cannabis use and/or the prescribed indications for medical cannabis; 3) context: oncological setting. French- or English-language primary empirical studies, knowledge syntheses, and grey literature published between 2000 and 2021 were included. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers and subjected to a thematic analysis. A narrative description approach was used to synthesize and present the findings. RESULTS: We identified 5,283 publications, of which 163 met the eligibility criteria. Two main reasons for medical cannabis use emerged from the thematic analysis: limiting the impacts of cancer and its side effects; and staying connected to others. Our results also indicated that medical cannabis is mostly used for three approved indications: to manage refractory nausea and vomiting, to complement pain management, and to improve appetite and food intake. We highlighted 11 routes of administration for medical cannabis, with oils and oral solutions the most frequently reported. CONCLUSION: Future studies should consider the multiple routes of administration for medical cannabis, such as inhalation and edibles. Our review highlights that learning opportunities would support the development of healthcare providers knowledge and skills in assessing the needs and preferences of patients diagnosed with cancer who use medical cannabis.

This may have a major impact on athlete's performance. Nutrition education interventions carried out during a pandemic must also change. Education that is usually done using the offline method must now also be modified into nutrition education using the online method. Nutrition education has been proven to increase knowledge and body mass index in athletes, but no one has compared body mass index from online and offline nutrition education. The aim of this study was to compare the body mass index of Rugby athletes in offline and online nutrition education. The author conducted offline nutrition educations in March 2019, and online nutrition educations in December 2020. After the end of the nutrition educations, the body mass index of Rugby athletes were measured. From 30 Rugby athletes, there were 23 athletes who took part in both nutrition education activities, so the data of these 23 athletes were used in this study. The data were analyzed using General Linear Model Repeated Measures. The result showed significant differences between body mass index of Rugby athletes after offline nutrition educations 24.78 2.78, to body mass index after online nutrition educations 25.732.24. This study showed that offline nutrition educations were significantly better than online nutrition educations (F=5.147, p<0.05). Our findings indicate that nutrition education methods are important to affect body mass index in athletes. It implies that the sport nutrition team should consider to prioritize the athletes with nutrition educations using the offline methods. Hence, further research needs to be carried out to examine athletes' level of knowledge, training patterns and nutrition intake of athletes before and during the pandemic. ?

Comparison of a wild-type ST258 strain (KP35) and a atf3 isogenic mutant generated by CRISPR-Cas9 targeting reveals greater NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase transcription and ATP generation, fueled by increased glycolysis. The acquisition of atf3 induces changes in the bacterial acetylome, promoting lysine acetylation of multiple proteins involved in central metabolism, specifically Zwf (glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase). The atf3-mediated metabolic boost leads to greater consumption of glucose in the host airway and increased bacterial burden in the lung, independent of cytokine levels and immune cell recruitment.

Staff may feel that they, or other people, have acted wrongly and be distressed by this. This represents moral injury, which has been linked with significant mental ill health. Methods This survey asked essential workers in County Durham and Darlington about their experiences during the first wave of the pandemic and anything they felt would help. Well-being and moral injury were rated using sliders. Results There were 566 responses. A majority of respondents reported feeling troubled by other people's actions they felt were wrong (60% scored over 40, where 0 is 'not at all troubled' and 100 'very troubled', median score=52.5). Respondents were generally less troubled by their own actions (median score=3). Well-being and moral injury scores varied by employment sector (eg, National Health Service (NHS) staff were more troubled by the actions of others than non-NHS staff). Staff suggestions included regular supervisor check-ins, ensuring kindness from everyone, fair rules and enforcement and improving communication and processes. Respondents offered simple, practical actions that could be taken by leaders at team, organisation, societal and governmental levels to tackle moral injury and the underlying causes of moral injurious environments. Conclusion Using these findings to develop a strategy to address moral injury is important, not only for staff well-being, but staff retention and continued delivery of vital services in these challenging times.

MATERIAL/METHODS: A total of 108 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 17, 2020 to March 12, 2020 were enrolled. Data of demographic parameters, clinical characteristics, laboratory indicators, clinical manifestation, and outcome of disease were collected. The patients were divided into a severe group and a non-severe group according to diagnosis and classification, which followed the guidelines and management of the Chinese National Health Council COVID-19. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and comparison of ROC curves were used for the laboratory findings for assessment of COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: Of the 108 patients, 42 patients (38.9%) were male and 24 patients (22.2%) were considered severe cases, with the mean age of 51.0 years old. Males and patients with comorbidities were more likely to become severe cases. CRP increased and LYM decreased in the severe group.The results for the areas under the curve (AUC) of CRP/LYM and CRP used to assess severe COVID-19 were 0.787 (95% CI 0.698C0.860, P<0.0001) and 0.781 (95% CI 0.693C0.856, P<0.0001), respectively; both results were better than that of LYM. The associated criterion value of CRP/LYM was calculated, with an excellent sensitivity of 95.83%.

We study how five epidemiological models forecast and assess the course of the pandemic in India: a baseline curve-fitting model, an extended SIR (eSIR) model, two extended SEIR (SAPHIRE and SEIR-fansy) models, and a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model (ICM). METHODS: Using COVID-19 case-recovery-death count data reported in India from March 15 to October 15 to train the models, we generate predictions from each of the five models from October 16 to December 31. To compare prediction accuracy with respect to reported cumulative and active case counts and reported cumulative death counts, we compute the symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) for each of the five models. For reported cumulative cases and deaths, we compute Pearson's and Lin's correlation coefficients to investigate how well the projected and observed reported counts agree. We also present underreporting factors when available, and comment on uncertainty of projections from each model. RESULTS: For active case counts, SMAPE values are 35.14% (SEIR-fansy) and 37.96% (eSIR). For cumulative case counts, SMAPE values are 6.89% (baseline), 6.59% (eSIR), 2.25% (SAPHIRE) and 2.29% (SEIR-fansy). For cumulative death counts, the SMAPE values are 4.74% (SEIR-fansy), 8.94% (eSIR) and 0.77% (ICM). Three models (SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM) return total (sum of reported and unreported) cumulative case counts as well. We compute underreporting factors as of October 31 and note that for cumulative cases, the SEIR-fansy model yields an underreporting factor of 7.25 and ICM model yields 4.54 for the same quantity. For total (sum of reported and unreported) cumulative deaths the SEIR-fansy model reports an underreporting factor of 2.97. On October 31, we observe 8.18 million cumulative reported cases, while the projections (in millions) from the baseline model are 8.71 (95% credible interval: 8.63-8.80), while eSIR yields 8.35 (7.19-9.60), SAPHIRE returns 8.17 (7.90-8.52) and SEIR-fansy projects 8.51 (8.18-8.85) million cases. Cumulative case projections from the eSIR model have the highest uncertainty in terms of width of 95% credible intervals, followed by those from SAPHIRE, the baseline model and finally SEIR-fansy. CONCLUSIONS: In this comparative paper, we describe five different models used to study the transmission dynamics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus in India. While simulation studies are the only gold standard way to compare the accuracy of the models, here we were uniquely poised to compare the projected case-counts against observed data on a test period. The largest variability across models is observed in predicting the \\"total\\" number of infections including reported and unreported cases (on which we have no validation data). The degree of under-reporting has been a major concern in India and is characterized in this report. Overall, the SEIR-fansy model appeared to be a good choice with publicly available R-package and desired flexibility plus accuracy.","output":"A comparison of five epidemiological models for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: COVID-19 has drastically transformed healthcare delivery and forced many to utilize telehealth.

Currently, evidence of incidence, management, and prognosis of COVID-19 in this population are scarce. METHOD: Between May and December 2020, we followed two RRT populations that have the same tertiary hospital in Southern Brazil as its reference hospital for transplantation. Firstly, we monitored eight affiliated dialysis clinics keeping track of COVID-19 incidence and fatality rate in dialysis patients and those on the kidney transplant waiting list. In the same period, we also monitor COVID-19 incidence and mortality among our prevalent population of kidney transplant recipients. RESULTS: We evaluated 1049 patients in RRT in the dialysis centers. COVID-19 occurred in 89 of such patients (8.5%), and 31 died from such condition (35.8% death rate). Fifteen patients (5.45%), among 275 on the kidney transplant waiting list, contracted the virus, with one death (6.6%). Within our prevalent population of 1348 kidney transplant recipients, 113 were diagnosed with COVID19 (incidence: 8.4%), and 17 of them died (mortality rate: 15%). Finally, the number of kidney transplants decreased by 60.4% compared with the same period in the previous year. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 determined a substantial impact on RRT. A high frequency of chronic dialysis patients expired from the disease. The impact on the patients on the transplant waiting list seems to be less pronounced probably due to their better health conditions. The fatality rate in kidney transplant recipients is elevated and probably mostly related to comorbidities.

Aeromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. belonging to Proteobacteria phylum of bacteria were isolated from zebrafish gut, and their potential capacities to trigger innate immunity were investigated. In gut microbiota absence, the expression levels of the innate immunity genes in the GF group were not significantly changed compared to the CV group. After exposure to Aeromonas sp. and Vibrio sp., the expression levels of myd88, TLRs-, and inflammation-related genes were increased in both GF and CV groups, except tlr2 and NLRs-related genes. However, the expression level of NF-B and JNK/AP-1 pathway genes were all decreased after exposure to Aeromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. in both GF and CV groups. Interestingly, inflammation-related genes (tnfa, tnfb, and il1) were activated in the CV group, and there were not significantly changed in the GF group, indicating that other bacteria were indispensable for Aeromonas sp. or Vibrio sp. to activate the inflammation response.

However, there is no evidence regarding the length of cognitive decline in these patients. This study aimed to assess whether COVID-19-related cognitive decline is a permanent deficit or if it improves over time. METHODS: Cognitive performance was evaluated by means of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in COVID-19 survivors and noninfected individuals. All study participants had four cognitive evaluations, two of them before the pandemic and the other two, 6 and 18 months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak infection in the village. Linear mixed effects models for longitudinal data were fitted to assess differences in cognitive performance across COVID-19 survivors and noninfected individuals. RESULTS: The study included 78 participants, 50 with history of mild COVID-19 and 28 without. There was a significant-likely age-related-decline in MoCA scores between the two prepandemic tests (? = -1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -2.14 to -0.92, p < 0.001), which did not differ across individuals who later developed COVID-19 when compared to noninfected individuals. Six months after infection, only COVID-19 survivors had a significant decline in MoCA scores (? = -1.37, 95% CI = -2.14 to -0.61, p < 0.001), which reversed after 1 additional year of follow-up (? = 0.66, 95% CI = -0.11 to 1.42, p = 0.092).

Although the capacity for recombination among betacoronaviruses is well documented, there is limited evidence of recombination between SARS-CoV-2 strains. By identifying the mutations that primarily determine SARS-CoV-2 clade structure, we developed a lightweight approach for detecting recombinant genomes. Among the over 537,000 genomes queried, we detect 1175 putative recombinants that contain multiple mutational markers from distinct clades. Additional phylogenetic analysis and the observed co-circulation of predicted parent clades in the geographic regions of exposure further support the feasibility of recombination in these detected cases. An analysis of these detected cases did not reveal any evidence for recombination hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Although most recombinant genotypes were detected a limited number of times, at least two recombinants are now widely transmitted. Recombinant genomes were also found to contain substitutions of concern for elevated transmissibility and lower vaccine efficacy, including D614G, N501Y, E484K, and L452R. Adjusting for an unequal probability of detecting recombinants derived from different parent clades, and for geographic variation in clade abundance, we estimate that at most 5% of circulating viruses in the USA and UK are recombinant.

After the renewed increase in air traffic, the problem of proper positioning of aircraft for take-off will reappear. The capacity problem at airports will return as air traffic increases. Capacity is a parameter that determines the traffic capacity of an airport, expressed as the theoretical maximum number of air operations that the airport is able to handle per unit of time. This parameter may also result from the seasonality of air traffic both throughout the year and changes over single days or even hours. Achieving a certain capacity may require the expansion of airport infrastructure or more efficient management of airport operations. An undesirable effect of increasing air traffic are delays related to airport capacity. The existing queue of aircraft waiting for take-off operations at the runway threshold, could be due to poor management and queuing of aircraft or insufficient airport infrastructure. It is possible to eliminate the queue phenomenon, at the runway threshold, through better sequencing of aircraft push-outs. This makes it possible to determine the order of the take-off of aircraft, already at the stage of push-out.

Elderly-onset RA can be assumed as a benign form of RA. Until recently, face-to-face therapeutic sessions between health professionals and patients are usually the method of its treatment. However, during pandemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), teletherapeutic sessions can extensively increase the patient safety especially in elderly patients who are more vulnerable to these infections. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate a novel teletherapy approach for management of elderly patients suffering from RA by utilizing laser acupuncture. METHODS A teletherapy system was used for management of elderly patients suffering from RA. Sixty participants were allocated randomly into two groups and the ratio was 1:1. Patients in the first group were treated with laser acupuncture and telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Patients in the second group received telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Evaluation of patients was done by using the Health Assessment questionnaire (HAQ), the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life (RAQoL) questionnaire, and the analysis of interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA). RESULTS A statistically significant difference was found in CRP, RAQoL, IL-6 and MDA between the pre- and post-treatments in the first group (p < 0.05) favouring the post-treatment group, while the HAQ showed a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-treatments (p < 0.05) in both groups. Statistically significant post-treatment differences were also observed between the two groups (p < 0.05) in RAQoL, CRP, ATP and MDA, favouring the first group. DISCUSSION Laser acupuncture teletherapy could be suggested as a reliable treatment method for elderly patients suffering from RA, as it can provide a safe and effective therapeutic approach.

The following data were recorded: demographic variables, comorbidities (ischemic heart disease, arterial hypertension, heart failure, stroke, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity), type and dose of OA (acenocoumarol, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban), complications due to the use of OA. (3) Results: AF patients were older and had considerably more cardiovascular comorbidities than DVT patients. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) were more likely to be administered in patients with AF, as they had indication for indefinite anticoagulation. VKA were more frequently prescribed in patients with ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and diabetes compared with DVT patients. Moreover, complications related to OA use were more frequent in the VKA group.

The perception that there is paucity of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of public health programmes is seen as a barrier to policy change. The aim of this scoping review is to conduct a census of economic evaluations in primary prevention in order to identify and map the existing evidence. METHODS: This review is an update of a prior census and will include full economic evaluations of primary prevention programmes conducted in a community-based setting that were published between 2014 and 2019. The search of electronic databases (MEDLINE and Embase, and NHS-EED for 2014) will be supplemented by a search for grey literature in OpenGrey and a search of the reference lists of reviews of economic evaluations identified in our searches. Retrieved citations will be imported into Covidence? and independently screened in a two-stage process by two reviewers (abstracts and full papers). Any disagreements on the eligibility of a citation will be resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. Included studies will then be categorised by one independent reviewer according to a four-part typology covering the type of health promotion intervention, the risk factor being tackled, the setting in which the intervention took place and the population most affected by the intervention. New to this version of the census, we will also document whether or not the intervention sets out specifically to address inequalities in health. DISCUSSION: This review will produce an annotated bibliography of all economic evaluations plus a report summarising the current scope and content of the economic evidence (highlighting where it is plentiful and where it is lacking) and describing any changes in the type of economic evidence available for the various categories of disease prevention programmes since the last census. This will allow us to identify where future evaluative efforts should be focused to enhance the economic evidence base regarding primary prevention interventions.

Indian patients with HNSCC are mostly associated with tobacco usage and may have different genetic alterations compared with Western patients who are mostly associated with human papillomavirus infection. Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes are correlated to individuals' susceptibility and progression of cancer. XRCC1 is a DNA repair enzyme. Materials and Methods In the present prospective study, Indian population of HNSCC patients (n = 45) were screened for Arg399Gln variant of XRCC1 using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique, prospective evaluation of the patients was done after treatment, and the single-nucleotide polymorphism results were correlated to survival functions. Results Out of 45 patients, 28 patients were Arg/Arg, 12 patients were Arg/Gln, and 5 patients were Gln/Gln. Overall survival for the entire cohort and Arg/Arg, Arg/Gln, and Gln/Gln cohort was 36.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 33-39.5), 38.6 (95% CI: 35.3-41.9), 35.8 (95% CI: 28.6-42.9), and 26.4 (95% CI: 13.7-39.1) months (P = 0.097), respectively.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed utilizing a database of patients evaluated by Kaiser Permanente Southern California sleep medicine between 2015C2020 (includes sleep study, daily PAP, and electronic health record data.) Adult patients were analyzed if: on March 1, 2020 patient was alive, had 1 month health-plan enrollment, and had sleep diagnostic or PAP data. PAP adherence was calculated between March 1, 2020 to COVID-19 confirmation, death, disenrollment or study end date (July 31, 2020), whichever came earlier. COVID-19 outcomes were evaluated based on OSA status and PAP adherence: patients with PAP <2 hours/night were considered untreated; 2 hours/night were treated; 2C3.9 hours/night were moderately-treated; 4 hours/night were well-treated. Apnea hypopnea index (AHI) defined OSA severity. Multiple logistic regression evaluated the association of various demographic/clinical factors. RESULTS: Of 81,932 patients (39.8% female, age 54.014.9 years) analyzed, 1493 (1.8%) had COVID-19 with 224 (0.3%) hospitalizations and 61 (0.07%) resulting in intensive care or death. Increased severity of Untreated OSA was associated with higher COVID-19 rate and lower when treated [No OSA 1.7%; Mild 2%; Moderate 2%; Severe 2.4%; OSA unknown severity 2%; Treated 1.4%; p<0.0001]. Better PAP adherence was associated with reduced infection rate [untreated 2.1%; moderately-treated 1.7%, well-treated 1.3%, No OSA 1.7%; p=<0.0001]. Multivariable analysis confirmed increased infection rate with OSA versus no OSA [OR 0.82(0.70,0.96)] and the benefit of good PAP adherence versus untreated [moderately-treated OR 0.82 (0.65, 1.03); well-treated OR (0.69 (0.59, 0.80)]. Increased infection rate was also associated with obesity, higher Charlson Comorbidity score, Black and Hispanic ethnicities, and Medicaid enrollment; increasing age was associated with reduced infection rate. Separate multivariable analysis showed dose-response association of OSA severity on infection rate [Mild OR 1.21 (1.01,1.44 95%CI); Moderate-Severe OR 1.27 (1.07,1.51) versus no OSA]. Neither OSA presence nor PAP adherence significantly impacted rate of hospitalization nor intensive care or death. CONCLUSION: Significant associations emerged with OSA increasing and PAP therapy reducing COVID-19 infection rate. Findings support continued PAP use during the pandemic.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the incidence of incisional hernia formation following primary abdominal solid organ transplantation and identify clinical risk factors for hernia formation. METHODS We performed a single-institution retrospective review of a prospectively collected database to evaluate all patients who underwent primary liver, kidney, or pancreas transplantation between 2000 and 2011. The primary outcome was hernia formation at the transplant incision. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify risk factors for incisional hernia formation. RESULTS A total of 3,460 transplants were performed during the study period: 2,247 kidney only, 718 liver only, and 495 pancreas or simultaneous pancreas and kidney (pancreas group). The overall incisional hernia rate was 7.5 %. The Kaplan-Meier rates of hernia formation at 1, 5, and 10 years were 2.5, 4.9, and 7.0 % for kidney; 4.5, 13.6, and 19.0 % for liver; and 2.5, 12.7, and 21.8 % for the pancreas groups. On univariate analysis, surgical site infection (SSI), body mass index (BMI) >25, delayed graft function, and withholding a calcineurin inhibitor or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were associated with hernia formation in the kidney group. SSI and BMI >25 were associated with hernia formation in the liver group. In the pancreas group, SSI, cyclosporine, and withholding MMF were all associated with hernia formation. On multivariate analysis, SSI was strongly associated with hernia formation in all groups. Hazard ratio: kidney = 24.71 (13.00-46.97); liver = 12.0 (6.40-22.52); pancreas = 12.95 (2.78-60.29). CONCLUSION Incisional hernias are common following abdominal organ transplant with nearly one in five patients developing an incisional hernia 5 years after liver or pancreas transplantation. Strategies focusing on prevention and early treatment of SSI may help to decrease the risk of incisional hernia formation following abdominal organ transplantation.","output":"Incidence and risk factors of incisional hernia formation following abdominal organ transplantation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes asymptomatic infections to severe conditions, which has been revealed as a systemic disease.

Participants were divided over four age cohorts. We compared longitudinal kinetics within each cohort and between the different cohorts. Changes in the B-cell compartment were correlated to numbers of vaccine-specific B- and plasma cells and serum Ig levels. Expansion and maturation of plasma cells 7 days postvaccination was the most prominent cellular change in all age groups and was most pronounced for more mature IgG1+ plasma cells. Plasma cell responses were stronger in individuals primed with whole-cell vaccine than in individuals primed with acellular vaccine. Moreover, IgG1+ and IgA1+ plasma cell expansion correlated with FHA-, Prn-, or PT- specific serum IgG or IgA levels.

These two IBV types have been identified in Italy previously. The other three variant isolates formed novel genotype detected recently in many countries of Western Europe. For one of these variant viruses, Italy-02, which afterwards became the prototype strain, the entire S1 gene was sequenced to confirm its originality. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of more conserved partial N gene sequences, comprising 1C300 nucleotides, revealed different clustering. Thus, three variant IBVs of novel Italy-02 genotype, which had 96.7C99.2% S1 gene nucleotide identity with each other, belonged to three separate subgroups based on N gene sequences. 624/I-type isolate Italy-06 together with Italy-03, which was undetectable using S1 gene primers, shared 97.7% and 99.3% identity, respectively, in N gene region with vaccine strain H120. Only one of the 793/B-type isolates, Italy-10, clustered with the 793/B strain sharing 99.3% partial N gene identity, whereas the other four isolates were genetically distant from them (only 87.7C89.7% identity) and formed separate homogenous subgroup.

Understanding the dynamics of the epidemic is as important as detecting and treatment of infected individuals. Mathematical models play a crucial role in exploring the dynamics of the outbreak by deducing strategies paramount for curtailing the disease. The research extensively studies the SEQIAHR compartmental model of COVID-19 to provide insight into the dynamics of the disease by underlying tailored strategies designed to minimize the pandemic. We first studied the noncontrol model's dynamic behaviour by calculating the reproduction number and examining the two nonnegative equilibria' existence. The model utilizes the Castillo-Chavez method and Lyapunov function to investigate the global stability of the disease at the disease-free and endemic equilibrium. Sensitivity analysis was carried on to determine the impact of some parameters on R(0). We further examined the COVID model to determine the type of bifurcation that it exhibits. To help contain the spread of the disease, we formulated a new SEQIAHR compartmental optimal control model with time-dependent controls: personal protection and vaccination of the susceptible individuals. We solved it by utilizing Pontryagin's maximum principle after studying the dynamical behaviour of the noncontrol model.

These rearrangements result in genome fragments shifting position and/or orientation in the genome without necessarily affecting the underlying nucleotide sequence. To date, scalable techniques have not been applied to genome structure (GS) identification, so it remains unclear how extensive this variation is and the extent of its impact upon gene expression. However, the emergence of multiplexed, long-read sequencing overcomes the scale problem, as reads of several thousand bases are routinely produced that can span long repeat sequences to identify the flanking chromosomal DNA, allowing GS identification. Genome rearrangements were generated in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi through long-term culture at ambient temperature. Colonies with rearrangements were identified via long-range PCR and subjected to long-read nanopore sequencing to confirm genome variation. Four rearrangements were investigated for differential gene expression using transcriptomics. All isolates with changes in genome arrangement relative to the parent strain were accompanied by changes in gene expression. Rearrangements with similar fragment movements demonstrated similar changes in gene expression. The most extreme rearrangement caused a large imbalance between the origin and terminus of replication and was associated with differential gene expression as a factor of distance moved towards or away from the origin of replication. Genome structure variation may provide a mechanism through which bacteria can quickly adapt to new environments and warrants routine assessment alongside traditional nucleotide level measures of variation.","output":"Impact of Salmonella genome rearrangement on gene expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thought experiments involving gases and pistons, such as Maxwell's demon and Gibbs' mixing, are central to our understanding of thermodynamics.

We took a biological approach to test whether food-related behaviors, together capturing food involvement, have genetic components and are partly due to inherited variation. We collected data via an internet survey from a genetically informative sample of 419 adult twins (114 monozygotic twin pairs, 31 dizygotic twin pairs, and 129 singletons).

Since these respondents had previously participated in research in person, we measured their level of engagement to evaluate the quality of their online responses. Additive genetics explained 16-44% of the variation in some measures of food involvement, most prominently various aspects of cooking, suggesting some features of the human food experience may be inborn. Other features reflected shared (early) environment, captured by respondents twin status.

The agent responsible for scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi ) has been removed from the genus Rickettsia and a bewildering array of new rickettsial pathogens have been described. An update of recent research findings is therefore particularly timely for the nonspecialist physician. RECENT FINDINGS An estimated one billion people are at risk for scrub typhus and an estimated one million cases occur annually. The disease appears to be re-emerging in Japan, with seasonal transmission. O. tsutsugamushi has evolved a variety of mechanisms to remain viable in its intracellular habitat. Slowing the release of intracellular calcium inhibits apoptosis of macrophages. Subsets of chemokine genes are induced in infected cells, some in response to transcription factor activator protein 1. Cardiac involvement is uncommon and clinical complications are predominantly pulmonary. Serious pneumonitis occurred in 22% of Chinese patients. Dual infections with leptospirosis have been reported. Standardized diagnostic tests are being developed and attempts to improve treatment of women and children are being made. Of the numerous tick-borne rickettsioses identified in recent years, African tick-bite fever appears to be of particular importance to travellers. The newly described flea-borne spotted fever caused by Rickettsia felis may be global in distribution. SUMMARY Rash and fever in a returning traveler could be rickettsial and presumptive doxycycline treatment can be curative.

There have been new developments since the initial publication. To integrate recent developments and further improve the consensus, a panel of experts from the CSH recently updated the consensus recommendations, which are summarized as follows: (1) there is a new algorithm for selecting appropriate donors for allo-HSCT candidates. Haploidentical donors (HIDs) are the preferred donor choice over matched sibling donors (MSDs) for patients with high-risk leukemia or elderly patients with young offspring donors in experienced centers. This replaces the previous algorithm for donor selection, which favored MSDs over HIDs.

Its purported mode of action is as an immune modulator. Vitamin D, however, also affects the metabolism of phosphate and Mg, which may well play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 may induce a cytokine storm that drains ATP whose regeneration requires phosphate and Mg. These minerals, however, are often deficient in conditions that predispose people to severe COVID-19, including older age (especially males), diabetes, obesity, and usage of diuretics. Symptoms observed in severe COVID-19 also fit well with those seen in classical hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, such as thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, dysfunction of liver and kidneys, neurologic disturbances, immunodeficiency, failure of heart and lungs, delayed weaning from a respirator, cardiac arrhythmia, seizures, and, finally, multiorgan failure. Deficiencies of phosphate and Mg can be amplified by kidney problems commonly observed in patients with COVID-19 resulting in their wastage into urine. Available data show that phosphate and Mg are deficient in COVID-19, with phosphate showing a remarkable correlation with its severity. In one experiment, patients with COVID-19 were supplemented with a cocktail of vitamin D(3), Mg, and vitamin B(12), with very encouraging results. We, thus, argue that patients with COVID-19 should be monitored and treated for phosphate and Mg deficiencies, ideally already in the early phases of infection. Supplementation of phosphate and Mg combined with vitamin D could also be implemented as a preventative strategy in populations at risk.","output":"SARS-CoV-2: influence of phosphate and magnesium, moderated by vitamin D, on energy (ATP) metabolism and on severity of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 global pandemic turned the educational community upside-down. As all in person coursework quickly transitioned to online delivery, faculty had to formulate new ways to not only disseminate course content but also assess student learning and engage students in the virtual classroom. As the pandemic state continues to affect higher education, the use of online collaborative tools has become essential to many college classrooms. This poster reviews the implementation of a selection of Google tools (e.g. Docs, Forms, Jamboard) in remote, hybrid, and in-person courses. Initially, these online tools were added to engage students when strict COVID-19 guidelines were in place in the hybrid and remote classroom setting as a way to promote student collaboration and group learning. In class activities, homework, and other group assignments were modified such that both in-person and remote students could collaborate in real time during the synchronous class session and outside of scheduled class time. Student feedback on course evaluations indicate that the learning environment was positive, collaborative, and engaging. Student comments specifically pointed to the success of these activities. Students ranked the course greater than 4.0 (out of 5.0) across all evaluative questions. In the spring 2020 hybrid version of the course, summative assessments were modified to include open-book take-home case studies in addition to the timed objective exam. Required biweekly virtual small group sessions allowed students to collaborate on these challenging case-based critical thinking problems. The case study exams were designed in Google Docs and a template file (copy function) was created for student use. Overall student perception of the case study exams was very high as indicated by the students' ranking of this activity on a survey and written feedback. Additionally, student performance improved on the case study exams (p < 0.001) as their critical thinking, analytical, and scientific writing skills improved, while their performance on the timed objective exams remained relatively consistent (p = 0.157). Examples of how these online tools can be set-up for use as formative and summative assessments as well as interactive, collaborative activities will be presented and shared using QR codes at the poster session. As coursework has returned to in-person learning, many of these tools are still used due to ease of use, positive feedback, and benefits to student learning.","output":"Using Google Tools to Increase Student Learning, Engagement, and Collaboration in Remote, Hybrid, and In-person Courses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dutch standard diabetes care is generally protocol-driven. However, considering that general practices wish to tailor diabetes care to individual patients and encourage self-management, particularly in light of current COVID-19 related constraints, protocols and other barriers may hinder implementation. The impact of dispensing with protocol and implementation of self-management interventions on patient monitoring and experiences are not known. This study aims to evaluate tailoring of care by understanding experiences of well-organised practices 1) when dispensing with protocol; 2) determining the key conditions for successful implementation of self-management interventions; and furthermore exploring patients experiences regarding dispensing with protocol and self-management interventions. METHODS: in this mixed-methods prospective study, practices (n = 49) were invited to participate if they met protocol-related quality targets, and their adult patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes were invited if they had received protocol-based diabetes care for a minimum of 1 year. For practices, study participation consisted of the opportunity to deliver protocol-free diabetes care, with selection and implementation of self-management interventions. For patients, study participation provided exposure to protocol-free diabetes care and self-management interventions. Qualitative outcomes (practices: 5 focus groups, 2 individual interviews) included experiences of dispensing with protocol and the implementation process of self-management interventions, operationalised as implementation fidelity. Quantitative outcomes (patients: routine registry data, surveys) consisted of diabetes monitoring completeness, satisfaction, wellbeing and health status at baseline and follow-up (24 months). RESULTS: In participating practices (n = 4), dispensing with protocol encouraged reflection on tailored care and selection of various self-management interventions. A focus on patient preferences, team collaboration and intervention feasibility was associated with high implementation fidelity. In patients (n = 126), likelihood of complete monitoring decreased significantly after two years (OR 0.2 (95% CI 0.1C0.5), p < 0.001). Satisfaction decreased slightly (? 1.6 (95% CI -2.6;-0.6), p = 0.001). Non-significant declines were found in wellbeing (? 1.3 (95% CI -5.4; 2.9), p = 0.55) and health status (? 3.0 (95% CI -7.1; 1.2), p = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS: To tailor diabetes care to individual patients within well-organised practices, we recommend dispensing with protocol while maintaining one structural annual monitoring consultation, combined with the well-supported implementation of feasible self-management interventions. Interventions should be selected and delivered with the involvement of patients and should involve population preferences and solid team collaborations.

There were no synthesized scientific evidences which could show the impact of COVID-19 epidemics/pandemic on essential health services in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impacts of COVID-19 epidemics/pandemic on essential health services provision in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. METHODS: A pre-post study design was used to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on essential health services delivery in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia in the second quarter of 2020 (Post COVID-19) compared to similar quarter in 2019 (Pre COVID-19). The study focuses on five categories; namely; maternal, neonatal and child health care; communicable diseases with a focus on HIV and TB-HIV co-infection; prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV; basic emergency, outpatient, inpatient and blood bank services, non-communicable diseases and road traffic accidents (RTAs). Analysis was done using Stata version 14.0 software package. The effects of COVID-19 epidemics/pandemic were calculated taking the differences between post COVID -19 and pre COVID-19 periods and the levels of service disruptions presented using proportions. Wilcoxon sign rank test was done and a significance level of 0.05 was considered as having significant difference among the two quarters. RESULTS: There were significant increase in institutional delivery, delivery by Caesarian Section (CS), still birth, postnatal care within 7 days of delivery, the number of children who received all vaccine doses before 1(st) birthday, the number of under 5 children screened and had moderate acute malnutrition, the number of under 5 children screened and had severe acute malnutrition and children with SAM admitted for management. However, there were significant decrease in HIV testing and detection along with enrolment to antiretroviral therapy (ART) care, number of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk  30% received treatment, RTAs, total units of blood received from national blood transfusion service (NBTS) and regional blood banks, total number of units of blood transfused and emergency referral. There were no significant changes in outpatient visits and admissions. CONCLUSION: Despite commendable achievements in maintaining several of the essential health services, COVID-19 has led to an increase in under nutrition in under five children, decline in HIV detection and care, CVD, cervical cancer screening and blood bank services. Therefore, governments, local and international agencies need to introduce innovative ways to rapidly expand and deliver services in the context of COVID-19.

RESULTS: Twenty-one studies reported on the urgent need for interventions to prevent or reduce mental health problems caused by COVID-19 among health professionals in ICU. Eleven studies demonstrated possibilities for interventions involving organizational adjustments in the ICU, particularly linked to emotional conflicts in the fight against COVID-19.

However, studies continue to demonstrate considerable gaps between the real and ideal performance and patient-related outcomes. The objective of this study was to explore GPs perception of the factors affecting the implementation of a CME digital platform in a primary health care setting in Portugal. METHODS: Our work is framed in a larger effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 1 study, where a Digital Behaviour Change Intervention (DBCI), called ePrimaPrescribe, was developed and implemented with the aim of changing benzodiazepines (BZD) prescribing patterns. Our design used mixed methodologies to obtain an enriched knowledge on GPs perspectives on the facilitators and barriers to implementing a Digital Behaviour Change Intervention (DBCI) applied to CME. To do so, we used data coming from an onsite questionnaire, an adapted version of the Barriers and Facilitators Assessment Instrument (BaFAI) and in-depth interviews. RESULTS: From the 47 GPs successfully included in the intervention arm of our cluster-randomized effectiveness study, we collected 37 onsite questionnaires, 24 BaFAIs, and performed 12 in-depth interviews. GPs reported as the main barriers to CME a lack of time, a perception of work overload, a lack of digital competence, a lack of digital infrastructure, and motivational and emotional factors. They reported as facilitators to CME delivered through a DBCI the convenience of the delivery method, the practical and pragmatic characteristics of the content, and the possibility for CME to be mandatory. CONCLUSIONS: The perceptions of the barriers and facilitators reported by GPs represent an important contribution to improving knowledge regarding the factors influencing the implementation of CME in primary health care settings. We consider that our study might bring useful insights to other countries where primary health care plays a central role in the provision of care.

Exposing the intracellular domain to a denaturing agent increases the energy required to open the channel indicating that cold drives channel gating by stabilizing the folded state of the CTD.

Intervention(s): None Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Primary: Suspending recruitment in clinical research; Secondary: impact of specific factors on research conduct (5-point scales from no effect to very large effect). We assessed the association between research continuity and month, presence of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and population (pediatric vs. adult ICU) using mixed-effects logistic regression. Results: 126 centers (56% pediatric) from 23 countries participated. 95 (75%) of centers suspended recruitment in at least some studies and 37 (29%) suspended recruitment in all studies on at least one month. The proportion of centers reporting recruitment in all studies increased over time (OR per month 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5, p = 0.007), controlling for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and type of ICU (pediatric vs. other). The five factors most frequently identified as having a large or very large effect on clinical research were: local prioritization of COVID-19 specific research (68, 54%), infection control policies limiting access to patients with COVID-19 (61, 49%), infection control policies limiting access to the ICU (52, 41.6%), increased workload of clinical staff (38, 30%), and safety concerns of research staff (36, 29%). Conclusions and Relevance: Decisions to pause or pursue clinical research varied across centers. Research activity increased over time, despite the presence of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Guiding principles to safely sustain research during this and future pandemic waves are urgently needed.","output":"The effect of COVID-19 on critical care research: A prospective longitudinal multinational survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common form of dermatitis.

Immune-mediated pathology is a key player in this disease; hence, the role of the complement system needs assessment. The complement system and the coagulation cascade share an intricate network, where multiple mediators maintain a balance between both pathways. Coagulopathy in COVID-19, showing mixed features of complement-mediated and consumption coagulopathy, creates a dilemma in diagnosis and management. AREAS COVERED Pathophysiology of coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients, with a particular focus on D-dimer and its role in predicting the severity of COVID-19 has been discussed. A comprehensive search of the medical literature on PubMed was done till May 30th, 2020 with the keywords 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Coronavirus', 'Coagulopathy', and 'D-dimer'. Twenty-two studies were taken for weighted pooled analysis of D-dimer. EXPERT OPINION A tailored anticoagulant regimen, including intensification of standard prophylactic regimens with low-molecular-weight heparin is advisable for COVID-19 patients. Atypical manifestations and varying D-dimer levels seen in different populations bring forth the futility of uniform recommendations for anticoagulant therapy. Further, direct thrombin inhibitors and platelet inhibitors in a patient-specific manner should also be considered.","output":"Complement activation and coagulopathy - an ominous duo in COVID19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a mathematical model to investigate the current outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.

Early detection, treatment and prevention are key to reducing transmission. Post-exposure prophylaxis with single-dose rifampicin (SDR-PEP) reduces the risk of developing leprosy when administered to screened contacts of patients. This has been adopted in the WHO leprosy guidelines. The PEP4LEP study aims to determine the most effective and feasible method of screening people at risk of developing leprosy and administering chemoprophylaxis to contribute to interrupting transmission. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PEP4LEP is a cluster-randomised implementation trial comparing two interventions of integrated skin screening combined with SDR-PEP distribution to contacts of patients with leprosy in Ethiopia, Mozambique and Tanzania. One intervention is community-based, using skin camps to screen approximately 100 community contacts per leprosy patient, and to administer SDR-PEP when eligible. The other intervention is health centre-based, inviting household contacts of leprosy patients to be screened in a local health centre and subsequently receive SDR-PEP when eligible. The mobile health (mHealth) tool SkinApp will support health workers capacity in integrated skin screening. The effectiveness of both interventions will be compared by assessing the rate of patients with leprosy detected and case detection delay in months, as well as feasibility in terms of cost-effectiveness and acceptability. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the national ethical committees of Ethiopia (MoSHE), Mozambique (CNBS) and Tanzania (NIMR/MoHCDEC). Study results will be published open access in peer-reviewed journals, providing evidence for the implementation of innovative leprosy screening methods and chemoprophylaxis to policymakers.

We hypothesize that when patient satisfaction with standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy is assessed, most dissatisfaction will be linked to the umbilical incision and, given the option, patients would actually wish to eliminate this incision. METHODS Two hundred eighty-one female patients aged 18 to 40 years who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy over a 2-year period were identified, and data were collected on 125 patients. RESULTS Fewer than half of patients correctly remembered the number of incisions they had, with 57 patients (45.6%) recalling fewer incisions than were present. Of 58 patients reporting one site to be more painful, 38 (65.5%) cited the umbilical site as the most painful. Eighty-one patients (68.6%) would have preferred to eliminate an incision, with 51 of these (63.0%) choosing to eliminate the umbilical incision.

METHODS In this randomised cross-over trial, we recruited neonates of gestation >24 weeks. Consented infants were randomly assigned to either pulse oximeter sensor with opaque wrap or without opaque wrap. Nellcor and Masimo sensors were applied simultaneously to different feet for 10 min of recording. Infants were crossed over to the other intervention for a further 10 min, totalling 20 min recording per infant. Primary outcome was faster acquisition of data with shielding of pulse oximeter sensor as compared with not shielding. RESULTS A total of 96 babies were recruited. There was no difference in primary outcome of time taken to display valid data between the two groups (opaque wrap: 12.733.1 s vs no opaque wrap: 13.163.3 s, p=0.27). There was no difference in any of the secondary outcomes (percentage of valid data points, percentage of time saturation below target, and so on) between the two groups in both pulse oximeters.

Individual and work factors were evaluated in relation to two dichotomized outcomes: i.e., can work and want to work beyond 65 years of age, respectively. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models were used to specify bivariate and multivariate cross-sectional logistic regression models that accounted for repeated measurements. The results showed that, both in 2018 and 2019, about 83% of the school principals stated that they could work and about 50% stated that they wanted to work until 65 years of age and beyond. School principals' exhaustion symptoms and experiences of an excessive burden were statistically significantly associated with whether they both could not and did not want to work beyond 65 years of age. Additionally, the school principals' experiences of support from the executive management in the performance of their managerial duties was of primary importance for whether the school principals wanted to work until 65 years of age and beyond.

MATERIALS AND PATIENTS: All adult patients with major trauma admitted to our institution in 2019 and 2020 were assessed using the Injury Severity Score (ISS), by body region involved, type of injury, age, admission to an intensive care unit and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: In 2020, 454 patients with major trauma were admitted to our institution, 17% fewer than in the previous year. The drop in the number of major trauma patients proceeded with and overlapped both the first and second peaks in incidence of the pandemic and the associated restrictions. The median ISS was higher in 2020 (25, interquartile range [IQR] 17-26.5) than in 2019 (22, IQR 16-26, p = 0.04). There were no significant differences in body region involved, type of injury or age (p >0.05). In 2020, a higher percentage of patients were admitted to an intensive care unit (86.5% vs 77.7%, p <0.001) and died within 30 days (8.8% vs 5.0%, p = 0.015).

Will physicians be willing to make hard, resource-allocation decisions if they cannot first husband or improvise alternatives?With our healthcare facilities and governments unprepared for this inevitable disaster, front-line doctors, advanced providers, nurses, EMS, and support personnel struggle with acute shortages of equipment-both to treat patients and protect themselves. With their personal and possibly their family's lives and health at risk, they must weigh the option of continuing to work or retreat to safety. This decision, made daily, is based on professional and personal values, how they perceive existing risks-including available protective measures, and their perception of the level and transparency of information they receive. Often, while clinicians get this information, support personnel do not, leading to absenteeism and deteriorating healthcare services. Leadership can use good risk communication (complete, widely transmitted, and transparent) to align healthcare workers' risk perceptions with reality. They also can address the common problems healthcare workers must overcome to continue working (ie, risk mitigation techniques).

To mitigate this, we present an approach to systematically engineering DTs for injection molding that supports domain-specific customizations and automation of essential development activities based on a model-driven reference architecture. In this approach, reactive CPPS behavior is defined in terms of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for specifying events that occur in the physical system. The reference architecture connects to the CPPS through a novel DSL for representing OPC-UA bindings. We have evaluated this approach with a DT of an injection molding machine that controls the machine to optimize the Design of Experiment (DoE) parameters between experiment cycles before the products are molded. Through this, our reference implementation of the DT facilitates the time-consuming setup of a DT and the subsequent injection molding activities.

We suggest a way to produce value-added chemicals (e.g., aromatic compounds) from the mask with high amounts through catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP). To this end, the effects of zeolite catalyst properties on the upgradation efficiency of pyrolytic products produced from pyrolysis of wasted mask were investigated. The compositions and yields of pyrolytic gases and oils were characterized as functions of pyrolysis temperature and the type of zeolite catalyst (HBeta, HY, and HZSM-5), including the mesoporous catalyst of Al-MCM-41. The mask was pyrolyzed in a fixed bed reactor, and the pyrolysis gases evolved in the reactor was routed to a secondary reactor inside which the zeolite catalyst was loaded. It was chosen 550 C as the CFP temperature to compare the catalyst performance for the production of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) because this temperature gave the highest oil yield (80.7 wt%) during the non-catalytic pyrolysis process. The large pore zeolite group of HBeta and HY led to 134% and 67% higher BTEX concentrations than HZSM-5, respectively, likely because they had larger pores, higher surface areas, and higher acid site density than the HZSM-5.

Targeted interventions have used area or dwelling type as proxies for infrastructural vulnerability, potentially missing vulnerable households. We use infrastructural determinants of COVID-19 (crowding, water source, toilet facilities, and indoor pollution) to create an Infrastructural Vulnerability Index using cross-sectional household data (2018C2019) from Mamelodi, a low-income urban settlement in South Africa. Households were stratified into vulnerability groups by index results; sociodemographic variables were assessed as predictors of index scores; and inequality analysis and decomposition were conducted. Thirty-three percent of households fell in the lowest risk group, 32% in the second, 21% in the third, and 14% in the highest. Dwelling type and geographical ward were associated with changes in index scores, with a shack (adjusted  (a) = 3.45, CI = 3.39C3.51) associated with highest increase compared to a house. Wards in more developed areas were not consistently associated with lower index scores in the final regression model. The infrastructural vulnerability of the top 10% of households was greater than the bottom 40%, and inequality was predominantly within (80%) rather than between (20%) wards, and more between (60%) than within (40%) dwelling types. Our results show a minority of households account for the majority of infrastructural vulnerability, with its distribution only partially explained by area and dwelling type.

Inability to fulfil a professional commitment to deliver care as needed can lead to distress among caregivers and patients. This distress is sometimes alleviated through mechanisms that hide the facts that care is rationed and not all medical needs are met. We have identified three mechanisms that jeopardise accountable and optimal allocation of resources: (1) hidden value judgements that allow rationing under the disguise of triage or prioritisation, (2) disguised conflict of interest between societal and individual patient's needs and (3) concealed biases in the application of medical tools. Under these three pitfalls decisions of resource allocation and who gets treated are handled as medical decisions: normative decisions are concealed and perceived as falling with the realm of medical judgement. Value judgements and moral agency are hidden to offer a 'false sense of medical judgement', while in fact there are several ethical judgements and biases at stake. The three pitfalls entail hidden normative deliberation and are inappropriate for sustainable healthcare delivery and resource allocation. We believe it is necessary to maintain transparency in decision making under conditions of insufficient resources to maintain trust in professional care givers and secure fair treatment allocation. Recognition of the pitfalls, by applying our recommendations, may help to ensure transparent and accountable distribution of care and contribute to public acceptance of the ethics behind rationing.","output":"Three pitfalls of accountable healthcare rationing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the relation between different models of ethics and their impact upon crises solution strategies.

However, a lack of proper knowledge about non-covalent interactions can act as a barrier towards gaining a complete understanding of the factors that control these associations. To find effective molecules for COVID-19 inhibition, we have quantitatively investigated 143 X-ray crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein of coronavirus with covalently or non-covalently bound small molecules (SMs). Our present study is able to explain ordinary and perceptive aspects relating to protein inhibition. The active site of the protein consists of 21 amino acid residues, but only nine are actively involved in the ligand binding process. The H41, M49, and C145 residues have highest priority with respect to interactions with small molecules through hydrogen bond, CH-&#960;, and van der Waals interactions. At the active site, this ranking of amino acids is clear, based on different spatial orientations of ligands, and consistent with the electronic properties. SMs with aromatic moieties that bind to the active site of the protein play a distinct role in the determination of the following order of interaction frequency with the amino acids: CH-&#960; > H-bonding > polar interactions. This present study revealed that the G143 and C145 residues play crucial roles in the recognition of the carbonyl functionality of SMs through hydrogen bonding. With this knowledge in mind, an effective inhibitor small-molecule for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was designed: docking studies showed that the designed molecule has strong binding affinity towards the protein. The non-covalent interactions in the protein-ligand complex are in good agreement with the results obtained from X-ray crystallography. Moreover, the present study focused on weak forces and their influence on protein inhibition, henceforth shedding much light on the essential requirements for moieties that should be present in a good inhibitor and their orientations at the ligand binding site.","output":"A crystallography-based investigation of weak interactions for drug design against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute cholecystitis is a severe disease that requires urgent operation in some cases. To select suitable patients for a conservative approach, there is a need for an affordable and reliable marker for determining complication risk. Evaluation of systemic inflammatory markers in combination with other parameters such as white blood cell and the C-reactive protein might help to decide the appropriate treatment option. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic value of the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and thrombocyte-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in determining the risk of complicated acute cholecystitis and to compare with intraoperative and pathological findings. METHODS: A total of 229 patients operated on for acute cholecystitis were included in this study. Intraoperative and pathologically complicated acute cholecystitis in 78 cases and controls group was 151 cases. The two groups were compared in terms of inflammation markers. Then, we used the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to determine the optimal value for NLR and PLR concerning the severity of cholecystitis. Then, the differences in clinical symptoms were investigated according to the cutoff value for NLR and PLR. RESULTS: The NLR and PLR levels were found to be significantly higher in the complicated group (4.184.53 vs. 15.2320.99, 145.3487.58, and 251.92245.93, respectively, p<0.01).

The aim was to determine the benefit of prone positioning in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes included changes in physiologic parameters. Fine-Gray competing risks models with stabilized inverse probability treatment weighting (sIPTW) were used to determine the effect of prone positioning on outcomes. In addition, linear mixed effects models (LMM) were used to assess changes in physiology with prone positioning.RESULTS: Out of 335 participants who were intubated and mechanically ventilated, 62 underwent prone positioning, 199 met prone positioning criteria and served as controls and 74 were excluded. The intervention and control groups were similar at baseline. In multivariate-adjusted competing risks models with sIPTW, prone positioning was significantly associated with reduced mortality (SHR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46-0.80, P < 0.005). Using LMM to evaluate the impact of positioning maneuvers on physiological parameters, the oxygenation-saturation index was significantly improved during days 1-3 ( P < 0.01) whereas oxygenation-saturation index (OSI), oxygenation-index (OI) and arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P (a) O (2) :FiO (2) ) were significantly improved during days 4-7 ( P < 0.05 for all).

COVID-19 patients displayed notably higher mHLA-DR expression levels compared with bacterial septic shock patients. None of the COVID-19 patients developed a secondary infection. In conclusion, despite a pronounced inflammatory response, mHLA-DR expression kinetics indicate no overt innate immune suppression in COVID-19 patients.

GapmeR is a cell-permeating antisense single-stranded DNA molecule that can be designed to specifically target intracellular severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Once internalized into host cells, such as lung alveolar cells, GapmeR molecules can bind to the viral RNA. This RNA/DNA hybrid will then be degraded by the RNase H enzyme abundantly present in the host cells. GapmeRs can be delivered to COVID-19 patients through inhalation or via nebulization. SARS-CoV-2-targeted GapmeR can also be given to frontline healthcare workers as a prophylactic protection. The recombinant ACE2 protein, the efficacy of which is being evaluated in clinical trials, will bind to the spike (S) glycoprotein of extracellular SARS-CoV-2 and potentially block viral infectivity. We propose that combining inhalable SARS-CoV-2-targeted GapmeRs with recombinant ACE2 could provide a viable and rapidly implementable more effective therapeutic approach for eradicating SARS-CoV-2 and save millions of lives.","output":"Combination Therapy Using Inhalable GapmeR and Recombinant ACE2 for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A substantial, immediate healthcare burden for screening of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is created when large-scale outbreaks occur There have been a series of measures to strengthen the screening process through robust public-private partnerships between Hanam City Public Health Center (PHC), the local medical association, and central/provincial government A partnership between PHC and the local physicians group in Hanam City established the Respiratory Clinic The PHC provided the infrastructure for the Respiratory Clinic including medical facilities, supplies (i e personal protective equipment), and administrative support A total of 11 registered physicians from the local physicians group agreed to participate in clinical service provided at the Respiratory Clinic Any citizens with COVID-19 suspected respiratory symptoms call the COVID-19 hotline and visit the Respiratory Clinic if required Responding to COVID-19 outbreaks will be a continual process, and the screening system is essential support to public health interventions, and crucial in the response to a surge in COVID-19 cases","output":"Brief report A public-Private partnership model to build a triage system in response to a COVID-19 outbreak in Hanam City, South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lymphocytes require of constant and dynamic changes in their transcriptome for timely activation and production of effector molecules to combat external pathogens.

Courts around the world have had to respond quickly to the challenges presented by the pandemic and the associated social distancing restrictions. This has created significant challenges for the justice system and such challenges are likely to be further compounded in the post-pandemic era as there is a 'tsunami' of COVID-19-related disputes predicted. Methods: This study will examine how global court responses have transitioned from being primarily traditional, face-to-face proceedings to online court processes (as supported by internet technology). By adopting a comparative approach, we will analyse how some countries have adapted to this shift to online mode while also maintaining a focus on access to justice. Results: We argue that online modes of dispute resolution, often referred to as Online Dispute Resolution (ODR), can promote resolution while facilitating social distancing in this new COVID-era. The rapid shift from traditional court processes to an online mode has further assisted the public, lawyers and experts to access the justice system in some jurisdictions, even during the crisis. In light of the scale of recent changes, there have been concerns about the capacity of courts to adopt newer technologies as well as issues relating to the impact of a new online model of justice, particularly in terms of the barriers for more vulnerable members of society. Further, the use of disruptive technologies in some courts have posed questions around whether outcomes generated by these innovations reflect the meaning of 'justice' in its traditional sense. Conclusions: This article argues that courts should embrace newer technologies that support court services while being mindful of possible tech-related issues that can impact on justice objectives. We argue that by placing further emphasis on alternative dispute resolution methods and ODR into the future, this might offset the likely tsunami of COVID-related litigation which would enable courts, hospitals, medical professionals and patients to settle disputes in a just, equitable and more efficient manner.","output":"Court innovations and access to justice in times of crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Chicago Classification v4.0 (CCv4.0) is the updated classification scheme for esophageal motility disorders using metrics from high-resolution manometry (HRM).

In our present study, we have identified a green, cheap clay based halloysite (Hal) nanoformulation with release capability of Dex at such interactive pH condition. 30%ZnFe(2)O(4)/Hal and 30%NiFe(2)O(4)/Hal were prepared by one-pot synthesis technique. Dex (5% wt/wt) was functionalized over both nanocomposites. Finally, polyethylene glycol (PEG) was coated over ZnFe(2)O(4)/Hal/Dex and NiFe(2)O(4)/Hal/Dex nanocomposite using lyophilization technique (0.08 l/mg of nanocarrier). The release ability of Dex was studied under pulmonary infection and normal pH conditions (pH = 5.6 and 7.4). The characterization study using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UVCvisible diffuse reflectance (DRS) spectra confirmed the presence of spinel ferrites over Hal. Nitrogen adsorption isotherm showed the surface area of ZnFe(2)O(4)/Hal (75 m(2)/g), pore volume (0.27 cm(3)/g) with average pore size (14.5 nm). Scanning electron microscope/Energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed a textural change in halloysite tubular type indicating drug adsorption and PEG adhesion. DRS spectra indicated an intergrowth of zinc ferrite nanoparticles on the halloysite nanotubes. Interestingly, ZnFe(2)O(4)/Hal/Dex/PEG exhibited a high Dex release ability (17.5%, 168 h) at pH = 5.6 relevant to SARS-CoV-2 fusion entry into the cell pH condition of 5.5. Comparatively, the nanocomposite showed a less Dex release (<5%) release for 168 h at neutral pH = 7.4. The drug release kinetics were studied and the obtained data were fitted for the release constant and release exponent, using the Korsmeyer-Peppas model. To test the compatibility of our nanocomposites, we performed the cell viability assay (MTT) using HEK293 cells. Our results showed that at 0.3 mg/ml, Dex-loaded nanocomposite had a statistically significant improvement in cell viability compared to Dex alone. These results suggest that our nanocomposite has prevented the toxic effect of Dex and has huge potential to act as pulmonary drug delivery system for targeted lung infection therapeutics.","output":"PEGylated green halloysite/spinel ferrite nanocomposites for pH sensitive delivery of dexamethasone: A potential pulmonary drug delivery treatment option for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Traditional methods of management of abnormal placentation are often associated with significant maternal morbidity.

We quantified the proportion of participants that would be eligible for the nine ongoing phase-III trials. We further quantified the eligibility among participants at high risk to develop severe COVID-19. Since many trials were not explicit in their exclusion criterion with respect to acute or unstable preexisting diseases, we performed two analyses. First, we included all participants irrespective of this criterion. Second, we excluded persons with acute or unstable preexisting diseases. Results: : 97% of 7162 participants was eligible for any trial with eligibility for separate trials ranging between 11%-97%. For high-risk individuals the corresponding numbers were 96% for any trial with separate trials ranging from 5%-96%. Importantly, considering persons ineligible due to acute or unstable pre-existing disease drastically dropped the eligibilities for all trials below 43% for the total population and below 36% for high-risk individuals. Conclusion: The generalisability of phase-III trials to the general population depends largely on the interpretation and application of the criterion acute or unstable pre-existing disease, which reduces the generalisability by half.

It has been previously shown that transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) preceding each gene regulate transcription. Base pairing between the leader TRS (TRS-L) and the complement of the body TRS (cTRS-B) in the nascent RNA is a determinant factor during CoV transcription. In fact, in transmissible gastroenteritis CoV, a good correlation has been observed between subgenomic mRNA (sg mRNA) levels and the free energy (DeltaG) of TRS-L and cTRS-B duplex formation. The only exception was sg mRNA N, the most abundant sg mRNA during viral infection in spite of its minimum DeltaG associated with duplex formation. We postulated that additional factors should regulate transcription of sg mRNA N. In this report, we have described a novel transcription regulation mechanism operating in CoV by which a 9-nucleotide (nt) sequence located 449 nt upstream of the N gene TRS core sequence (CS-N) interacts with a complementary sequence just upstream of CS-N, specifically increasing the accumulation of sg mRNA N. Alteration of this complementarity in mutant replicon genomes showed a correlation between the predicted stability of the base pairing between 9-nt sequences and the accumulation of sg mRNA N.

The effectiveness of thapsigargin (TG), a recently discovered broad-spectrum antiviral, against these variants was also examined. Of the 3 viruses, the D variant exhibited the highest replication rate and was most able to spread to in-contact cells; its replication rate at 24 h post-infection (hpi) based on progeny viral RNA production was over 4 times that of variant A and 9 times more than the B variant. In co-infections, the D variant boosted the replication of its co-infected partners at the expense of its own initial performance. Furthermore, co-infection with AD or AB combination conferred replication synergy where total progeny (RNA) output was greater than the sum of corresponding single-variant infections. All variants were highly sensitive to TG inhibition. A single pre-infection priming dose of TG effectively blocked all single-variant infections and every combination (AB, AD, BD variants) of co-infection at greater than 95% (relative to controls) at 72 hpi.

An ischemic brain injury caused by cardiac arrest (CA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) affects cerebral function and presumably also glucose metabolism. The majority of patients who survive CA suffer from cognitive deficits and physical disabilities. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) plays a crucial role in inflammatory response in ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Since deficiency of TLR2 was associated with increased survival after CA-CPR, in this study, glucose metabolism was measured using non-invasive [(18)F]F-FDG PET-CT imaging before and early after CA-CPR in a mouse model comparing wild-type (WT) and TLR2-deficient (TLR2(?/?)) mice. The investigation will evaluate whether FDG-PET could be useful as an additional methodology in assessing prognosis. PROCEDURES: Two PET-CT scans using 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]F-FDG) tracer were carried out to measure dynamic glucose metabolism before and early after CPR. To achieve this, anesthetized and ventilated adult female WT and TLR2(?/?) mice were scanned in PET-CT. After recovery from the baseline scan, the same animals underwent 10-min KCL-induced CA followed by CPR. Approximately 90 min after CA, measurements of [(18)F]F-FDG uptake for 60 min were started. The [(18)F]F-FDG standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated using PMOD-Software on fused FDG-PET-CT images with the included 3D Mirrione-Mouse-Brain-Atlas. RESULTS: The absolute SUV(mean) of glucose in the whole brain of WT mice was increased about 25.6% after CA-CPR. In contrast, the absolute glucose SUV in the whole brain of TLR2(?/?) mice was not significantly different between baseline and measurements post CA-CPR. In comparison, baseline measurements of both mouse strains show a highly significant difference with regard to the absolute glucose SUV in the whole brain. Values of TLR2(?/?) mice revealed a 34.6% higher glucose uptake. CONCLUSIONS: The altered mouse strains presented a different pattern in glucose uptake under normal and ischemic conditions, whereby the post-ischemic differences in glucose metabolism were associated with the function of key immune factor TLR2.

A major key to tackling this virus is to disrupt its RNA replication process as previously reported for Remdesivir (Rem-P(3)). In this study, we theorize, using computational simulations, novel mechanisms that may underlie the binding of Rem-P(3) to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-NSPs complex; a multimeric assembly that drives viral RNA replication in human hosts. Findings revealed that while ATP-binding stabilized the replicative tripartite, Rem-P(3) disintegrated the RdRp-NSP complex, starting with the detachment of the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer followed by minimal displacement of the second NSP8 subunit (NSP8(II)). More so, Rem-P(3) interacted with a relatively higher affinity (G(bind)) while inducing high perturbations across the RdRp-NSP domains. D452, T556, V557, S682, and D760 were identified for their crucial roles in stacking the cyano-adenosine and 3,4-dihydroxyoxolan rings of Rem-P(3) while its flexible P(3) tail extended towards the palm domain blocking D618 and K798; a residue-pair identified for essential roles in RNA replication. However, ATP folded away from D618 indicative of a more coordinated binding favorable for nucleotide polymerization. We believe findings from this study will significantly contribute to the structure-based design of novel disruptors of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA replicative machinery.","output":"Piece of the puzzle: Remdesivir disassembles the multimeric SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States (US), with 12 cancer causing strains. Vaccination rates in the southern US fall below the national average. Pharmacists provide an opportunity to improve vaccination rates. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to 1) identify barriers and facilitators to providing the HPV vaccine and Vaccines for Children (VFC) program participation in pharmacies and clinics, and 2) assess pharmacy staff, clinic staff, and parent perceptions of 3 collaboration models to improve HPV vaccination. METHODS: A developmental formative evaluation was conducted with pharmacy staff, primary care clinic staff, and parents of adolescent children. Interview guides were informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination and VFC participation were explored. Additionally, acceptability of 3 collaboration models were explored: 1) a shared-responsibility model in which a physician provides the first dose of HPV vaccine with the second provided in the pharmacy, 2) a pharmacy-based model in which a clinic refers patients to the pharmacy to receive both doses, and 3) an insourced model in which pharmacists schedule days to provide the vaccine in the collaborating clinic. RESULTS: Twenty-nine interviews were conducted between August 2019 and June 2020. Both pharmacy and clinic staff had positive views toward the HPV vaccine and vaccinations in general. Pharmacists and physicians reported parental awareness and education as a barrier to HPV vaccination. Counseling about HPV vaccine was reported as being more time-consuming because of the stigma associated with the vaccine. Parents were willing to have their children vaccinated for HPV in the pharmacy but desired their childs physician be involved in the immunization process. The shared-responsibility model was the most favored of the 3 collaboration models. CONCLUSION: Perceptions of the HPV vaccine and vaccination in pharmacies were positive. Collaboration between clinics and pharmacies to improve HPV vaccination rates is viewed positively by pharmacy staff, clinic staff, and parents. This study will guide implementation of pharmacist-physician collaborative models to improve vaccination through pharmacy participation in the VFC program and HPV vaccination.","output":"Perceptions of HPV vaccination and pharmacist-physician collaboration models to improve HPV vaccination rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virtual care (VC) continues to gain attention as we make changes to the way we deliver care amidst our current COVID-19 pandemic.

The intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic with a CNS tumor diagnosis may further impact the anxiety/depression experienced in this population. This study assessed key anxiety/depression symptoms in patients with CNS tumors prior to and during the COVID year. METHODS: Patient reported outcomes (PROs), including the PROMIS Anxiety and Depression Short Forms and EQ-5D-3L, were collected at the time of clinical or telehealth evaluation from the COVID year (March 2020-February 2021) and were compared to assessments through February 2020 (a NOB-normative sample), reflecting what we would typically see in our regular clinic evaluations. RESULTS: The COVID sample (N = 178) was primarily White (82%), male (55%), median age of 45 (range 18C79), and KPS 3 90 (50%). The majority had high grade (70%) brain (83%) tumors with 3 1 prior recurrence (60%) and 25% were on active treatment. Visits were primarily conducted via telehealth (64%) and 20% had progression at assessment. Compared to the NOB-normative sample, patients reported significantly higher depression scores (moderate-severe, 17% vs. 12%, p < 0.05), but not anxiety (18% vs. 16%). Eleven percent reported both moderate-severe anxiety and depressive symptoms (8% pre-COVID). Overall health assessed by the EQ-5D-3L was similar to the normative sample in all dimensions, apart from impact of moderate/extreme mood disturbance, which was more prevalent in the COVID year (53% vs. 43%, p < 0.05%). CONCLUSION: Patients with CNS tumors are at risk for significant symptoms of depression and anxiety; this risk was heightened during the COVID year. Further evaluation of clinical factors associated with risk are underway. These findings highlight the need for assessments and interventions that can be administered via telehealth to address the mental health needs of this vulnerable population.

During the ongoing pandemic, TB diagnosis might be missed or delayed due to similar clinical presentation. While TB-COVID 19 co-infection is uncommon and might be purely incidental; a higher mortality of 12.3% in cases of co-infections is alarming especially in patients with co-morbidities. With resources being diverted towards COVID and fear of handling sputum, TB control has spiralled to what it was a decade ago. Here we are reporting a case series of SARS-CoVC TB co-infection from Eastern India. Methods & Materials Nasal swab was collected for the diagnosis of COVID -19 and RT-PCR done for the suspected cases. Sputum/ pleural tissue samples were collected from hospitalised suspected patients who did not improve clinically or developed atypical radiological picture and were subjected to staining, Xpert MTB/Rif assay (CBNAAT). Samples that were positive for acid fast bacilli (AFB) and MTB DNA by CBNAAT were considered as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Results There were four cases of SARS-CoV 2CTB co-infection from our hospital. Two patients presented with COVID-19 before the diagnosis of TB, one with both infections occurring in same week, and one patient with TB followed by COVID-19. Conclusion We screened the admitted patients who didn't improve clinically and having atypical radiographic pictures. As both the diseases have respiratory symptoms predominantly, but TB takes longer time to develop we might have missed many patients with tuberculosis.

METHODS: Under inhalation anesthesia, C57BL6 mice were subjected to warm hepatic I/R (90min/240min). The animals were pretreated either with a function-blocking anti-mouse CX3CL1 antibody or IgG control administered systemically before ischemia. Sham-operated animals served as controls (n=7 each group). The inflammatory response and sinusoidal perfusion failure were evaluated by intravital microscopy.

However, when the number of cases is huge and there are individual differences in the virus itself, the probability of false-negative results increases. With the advancement in research on the new coronavirus, new detection technologies that use serum-specific antibodies as detection targets have been developed. These detection technologies have high efficiency and shorter turnaround time, which ultimately shortens the time required for diagnosis. This article summarizes the methods that have been reported to date for the detection of the new coronavirus and discusses their principles and technical characteristics. AIMS: Compare the advantages and disadvantages of various SARS-CoV-2 detection methods and analyze their principles. METHODS: Searched reports on SARS-CoV-2 detection methods published so far, extracted the data and analyzed them. Use the primer blast function of NCBI to analyze the primers used in qRT-PCR detection. RESULTS: The detection sensitivity was the highest when nucleocapsid protein gene was used as the target, reaching 96.6%. The detection efficiency of the remaining targets ranged from 66.7% to 96.0%. Various new detection methods, like Serum specific antibody detection, can speed up the test time. However, due to the complexity of the method and higher testing requirements, it seems that it cannot be used as a complete replacement for qRT-PRC testing.

For the asymptomatic phase, the infection mostly resides in the nose, where it elicits a minimal innate immune response. For the mildly symptomatic phase, the infection is mostly in the pseudostratified epithelium of the larger airways and is accompanied by a more vigorous innate immune response. In the conducting airways, the epithelium can recover from the infection, because the keratin 5 basal cells are spared and they are the progenitor cells for the bronchial epithelium. There may be more severe disease in the bronchioles, where the club cells are likely infected. The devastating third phase is in the gas exchange units of the lung, where ACE2-expressing alveolar type II cells and perhaps type I cells are infected. The loss of type II cells results in respiratory insufficiency due to the loss of pulmonary surfactant, alveolar flooding, and possible loss of normal repair, since type II cells are the progenitors of type I cells. The loss of type I and type II cells will also block normal active resorption of alveolar fluid. Subsequent endothelial damage leads to transudation of plasma proteins, formation of hyaline membranes, and an inflammatory exudate, characteristic of ARDS. Repair might be normal, but if the type II cells are severely damaged alternative pathways for epithelial repair may be activated, which would result in some residual lung disease.","output":"Thoughts on the alveolar phase of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thousands of scientific articles describing genes associated with human diseases are published every week.

Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the previous research on pediatric endocrinology reported during COVID-19, guide the direction for future research, and establish guidelines to care for pediatric patients with endocrine diseases in the post-pandemic era.","output":"Pediatric Endocrinology of Post-Pandemic Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Widely used in global households, fenugreek is well known for its culinary and medicinal uses. The various reported medicinal properties of fenugreek are by virtue of the different natural phytochemicals present in it. Regarded as a promising target, interleukin 2 receptor subunit alpha (IL2R) has been shown to influence immune responses. In the present research, using in silico techniques, we have demonstrated the potential IL2R binding properties of three polyphenol stilbenes (desoxyrhaponticin, rhaponticin, rhapontigenin) from fenugreek. As the first step, molecular docking was performed to assess the binding potential of the fenugreek phytochemicals with IL2R. All three phytochemicals demonstrated interactions with active site residues. To confirm the reliability of our molecular docking results, 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations studies were undertaken. As discerned by the RMSD and RMSF analyses, IL2R in complex with the desoxyrhaponticin, rhaponticin, and rhapontigenin indicated stability. The RMSD analysis of the phytochemicals alone also demonstrated no significant structural changes. Based on the stable molecular interactions and comparatively slightly better MM/PBSA binding free energy, rhaponticin seems promising. Additionally, ADMET analysis performed for the stilbenes indicated that all of them obey the ADMET rules. Our computational study thus supports further in vitro IL2R binding studies on these stilbenes, especially rhaponticin.","output":"Computational Simulations Highlight the IL2R Binding Potential of Polyphenol Stilbenes from Fenugreek"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined as a loss of ovarian function before the age of 40 years, with a prevalence rate estimated at approximately 1%. It causes infertility and is related to serious long-term health consequences, including reduced life expectancy, increased cardiovascular risk, decreased bone mineral density and neurological disorders. There is currently no effective therapy for POI that is widely available in clinical practice; therefore, the treatment of patients with POI is based on hormone replacement therapy. One of the recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of POI has been the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) and other noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the disease. Moreover, intensive research on human folliculogenesis and reproductive biology has led to the development of novel promising therapeutic strategies with the use of exosomal miRNAs derived from mesenchymal stem cells to restore ovarian function in POI patients. This narrative review focuses on the new studies concerning the role of ncRNAs in the pathogenesis of POI, together with their potential as biomarkers of the disease and targets for therapy.","output":"The Role of Noncoding RNA in the Pathophysiology and Treatment of Premature Ovarian Insufficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to human beings, society, and economic activities all over the world. Worldwide rigorous containment measures for limiting the spread of the virus have several beneficial environmental implications due to decreased anthropogenic emissions and air pollutants, which provide a unique opportunity to understand and quantify the human impact on atmospheric environment. In the present study, the associated changes in Land Surface Temperature (LST), aerosol, and atmospheric water vapor content were investigated over highly COVID-19 impacted areas, namely, Europe and North America. The key findings revealed a large-scale negative standardized LST anomaly during nighttime across Europe (C0.11 C to C2.6 C), USA (C0.70 C) and Canada (C0.27 C) in MarchCMay of the pandemic year 2020 compared to the mean of 2015C2019, which can be partly ascribed to the lockdown effect. The reduced LST was corroborated with the negative anomaly of air temperature measured at meteorological stations (i.e. C0.46 C to C0.96 C). A larger decrease in nighttime LST was also seen in urban areas (by 1C2 C) compared to rural landscapes, which suggests a weakness of the urban heat island effect during the lockdown period due to large decrease in absorbing aerosols and air pollutants. On the contrary, daytime LST increased over most parts of Europe due to less attenuation of solar radiation by atmospheric aerosols. Synoptic meteorological variability and several surface-related factors may mask these changes and significantly affect the variations in LST, aerosols and water vapor content. The changes in LST may be a temporary phenomenon during the lockdown but provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the effects of various forcing controlling factors in urban microclimate and a strong evidence base for potential environmental benefits through urban planning and policy implementation.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 induced lockdown on land surface temperature, aerosol, and urban heat in Europe and North America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Appendicitis is a common disease that occurs particularly often in childhood and adolescence.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA), an independent Government department working to protect public health and consumers' wider interests in food, sought to identify research priorities in the area of FHS. METHODS A Priority Setting Exercise was undertaken, using a methodology adapted from the James Lind Alliance - the first such exercise with respect to food hypersensitivity. A UK-wide public consultation was held to identify unanswered research questions. After excluding diagnostics, desensitisation treatment and other questions which were out of scope for FSA or where FSA was already commissioning research, 15 indicative questions were identified and prioritised by a range of stakeholders, representing food businesses, patient groups, healthcare and academia, local authorities and the FSA. RESULTS 295 responses were received during the public consultation, which were categorised into 70 sub-questions and used to define 15 key evidence uncertainties (\\"indicative questions\\") for prioritisation. Using the JLA prioritisation framework, this resulted in 10 priority uncertainties in evidence, from which 16 research questions were developed. These could be summarised under the following 5 themes: communication of allergens both within the food supply chain and then to the end-consumer (ensuring trust in allergen communication); the impact of socioeconomic factors on consumers with FHS; drivers of severe reactions; mechanism(s) underlying loss of tolerance in FHS; and the risks posed by novel allergens/processing. DISCUSSION In this first research prioritisation exercise for food allergy and FHS, key priorities identified to protect the food-allergic public were strategies to help allergic consumers to make confident food choices, prevention of FHS and increasing understanding of socioeconomic impacts. Diagnosis and treatment of FHS was not considered in this prioritisation.","output":"Identifying key priorities for research to protect the consumer with food hypersensitivity: a UK Food Standards Agency Priority Setting Exercise."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has posed a great challenge to teaching and learning activities in higher education, particularly for service-learning subjects that involve intensive human interaction.

However, information on the on data quality and reliability of established influenza surveillance systems in Africa are limited. Such information would enable countries to assess the performance of their surveillance systems, identify shortfalls for improvement and provide evidence of data reliability for policy making and public health interventions. METHODS: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to evaluate the performance of the influenza surveillance system (ISS) in Zambia during 2011C2017 using 9 attributes: (i) data quality and completeness, (ii) timeliness, (iii) representativeness, (iv) flexibility, (v) simplicity, (vi) acceptability, (vii) stability, (viii) utility, and (ix) sustainability. Each attribute was evaluated using pre-defined indicators. For each indicator we obtained the proportion (expressed as percentage) of the outcome of interest over the total. A scale from 1 to 3 was used to provide a score for each attribute as follows: < 60% (as obtained in the calculation above) scored 1 (weak performance); 60C79% scored 2 (moderate performance); 80% scored 3 (good performance). An overall score for each attribute and the ISS was obtained by averaging the scores of all evaluated attributes. RESULTS: The overall mean score for the ISS in Zambia was 2.6. Key strengths of the system were the quality of data generated (score: 2.9), its flexibility (score: 3.0) especially to monitor viral pathogens other than influenza viruses, its simplicity (score: 2.8), acceptability (score: 3.0) and stability (score: 2.6) over the review period and its relatively low cost ($310,000 per annum). Identified weaknesses related mainly to geographic representativeness (score: 2.0), timeliness (score: 2.5), especially in shipment of samples from remote sites, and sustainability (score: 1.0) in the absence of external funds. CONCLUSIONS: The system performed moderately well in our evaluation. Key improvements would include improvements in the timeliness of samples shipments and geographical coverage. However, these improvements would result in increased cost and logistical complexity. The ISSS in Zambia is largely reliant on external funds and the acceptability of maintaining the surveillance system through national funds would require evaluation.","output":"An evaluation of the Zambia influenza sentinel surveillance system, 2011C2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To explore the factors affecting the emergence of diplomacy in Iranian nurse managers.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective study at the University Hospital Centre Split, Croatia, that included 245 COVID-positive individuals that died from April 8, 2020, to January 25, 2021. From the hospital database, we extracted data on their blood groups, demographics, and pre-existing comorbidities. To compare findings with the general population, we used information from collected blood group donations (n = 101357) and statistical reports of non-COVID deaths from 2019 (n = 4968). Results: The proportion of males was significantly higher in analyzed subjects than in non-COVID deaths from 2019 (63.7% vs. 48.9%, P < 0.001), while the proportion of older individuals did not differ (P = 0.8). The most common pre-existing diseases were hypertension (59.6%), diabetes (37.1%), heart failure (28.8%), digestive disorder (26.5%), and solid tumor (21.6%). The ABO distribution in the deceased and donors' group showed statistically significant differences, with the higher prevalence of A/AB group and lower prevalence of 0, but with individual differences significant only for AB and non-AB groups. There was a significantly reduced proportion of females within the deceased with group 0 (P = 0.014) and a higher proportion of AB individuals with coronary heart disease (P = 0.024), while other differences were not significant. Conclusion: The study confirmed a higher risk of death in male individuals.

Positive samples were characterized by means of minor groove binder probe PCR assays. Forty samples were positive, of which 30 were identified as CPV-2a, 9 as CPV-2b, and 1 as CPV-2c. The results from this molecular investigation of CPV show the prevalence of type 2a and occurrence of type 2c for the first time in Bulgaria.","output":"Canine parvovirus epidemiology in Bulgaria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the success rate of salvage radiation therapy (SRT) for recurrence of prostate cancer (PCa) after radical prostatectomy with and without planning based on prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) Methods: This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, Phase 3 clinical imaging trial powered for clinical outcome at 5 years UCLA is the leading central site in which PSMA PET, clinical follow-up and data management are being done UCSF was a participating site in which PSMA PET imaging can be done SRT can be performed anywhere, patients are followed remotely by the UCLA investigators Patients scheduled for SRT for recurrence after primary prostatectomy and with PSA  0 1ng/ml at time of enrollment were eligible Patients were randomized to proceed with standard SRT allowing for any conventional imaging aside from PSMA PET/CT (control arm) or undergo a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan prior to SRT planning (investigational arm) The primary endpoint is the success rate of SRT at 5 years in patients who undergo SRT We report here the preliminary results of a secondary endpoint: the impact of PSMA PET on SRT planning by comparing the pre-randomization RT plans prospectively obtained on surveys before randomization to the actually delivered RT plans obtained after follow-up Results: Enrollment of the trial was complete 193 patients were enrolled from 09 06 2018 to 08 17 2020 7/90 patients (9%) in the control arm dropped-out the study because they underwent a PSMA PET at another institution, while 1/103 (1%) patients of the intervention arm dropped-out due to COVID-19 related complications After a median follow-up of 13 3 months (last follow-up date 09/01/2020), delivered RT plans were obtained in 60/83 (72%) and 70/102 (69%) of patients of the control and the PSMA arms, respectively Median PSA at enrollment was 0 32 ng/ml (IQR 0 17-1 35) and 0 22 ng/ml (IQR 0 14-0 50) in the control and PSMA arms, respectively There was a change between the intended pre-randomization RT plan and the actually delivered RT plan in 17/60 (28%) and 40/70 (57%) of the patients in the control and PSMA arms, respectively (p = 0 002) SRT was aborted in favor of systemic therapy and/or metastasis directed RT for extra-pelvic M1 disease in 2/60 (3%) and 12/70 (17%) of the control and PSMA arms, respectively (p = 0 17) Dose prescription and/or target volume delineation was changed in 2/60 (3%) and 1/70 (26%) in the control and PSMA arms, respectively (p = 0 001) Conclusions: In this prospective randomized phase 3 study, PSMA PET had an impact on the SRT plan in more than half of the patients Long-term follow-up will show if the impact of PSMA PET on SRT planning translates into improved outcome or not","output":"Impact of PSMA PET/CT on SRT planning: Preliminary results from the randomized phase III trial NCT03582774"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glioblastomas belong to the most aggressive human cancers with short survival times.

Preliminary histology including immunocytochemistry (glial fibrillary acidic protein, ezrin, proliferation and apoptosis) was also performed. Rats treated with doxorubicin bound to polysorbate-coated nanoparticles had significantly higher survival times compared with all other groups. Over 20% of the animals in this group showed a long-term remission. Preliminary histology confirmed lower tumor sizes and lower values for proliferation and apoptosis in this group. All groups of animals treated with polysorbate-containing formulations also had a slight inflammatory reaction to the tumor. There was no indication of neurotoxicity.

The efficiency of gene silencing by esiRNAs was not influenced by sequence variation. The transfection of esiRNA did not induce interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like STAT1 and ISG15, indicating the absence of off-target effects.

New challenges have been identified in order to maintain the safety of this procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. A novel approach, using a modified demistifier canopy, was developed during the first wave of the pandemic and implemented for 17 consecutive percutaneous tracheostomies in order to enhance procedural safety. METHODS: A protocol was developed after performing a literature review of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. A multidisciplinary tracheostomy team was established, including the departments of otolaryngology, critical care, and respiratory therapy. Simulation was performed prior to each PT, and postoperative debriefings were done. RESULTS: A protocol and technical description of PT using a modified demistifier canopy covering was written and video documented. Data were collected on 17 patients who underwent this procedure safely in our tertiary care hospital. There were no procedure-related complications, and no evidence of COVID-19 transmission to any member of the health care team during the study period. CONCLUSION: As patients continue to recover from COVID-19, their need for tracheostomy will increase.

The ssRNA template for viral transcription is a 5-UUUAU-3 next to stem-loop (SL) 1. We analyze the electrostatic potential distribution of the nsp8 subunit within the RTC around the template strand of the primer/template (P/T) RNA duplex in recently published cryo-EM structures to address the priming reaction using the viral poly(A) template. We carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a P/T RNA duplex, the viral poly(A) template, or a generic ssRNA template. We find evidence that the viral poly(A) template binds similarly to the template strand of the P/T RNA duplex within the RTC, mainly through electrostatic interactions, providing new insights into the priming reaction by the nsp8 subunit within the RTC, which differs significantly from the existing proposal of the nsp7/nsp8 oligomer formed outside the RTC.

METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted among 14 parents of children with cancer and 8 healthcare providers. The parents were recruited from two urban pediatric oncology centers in Malaysia. Healthcare providers were recruited from these centers, as well as from community-based palliative care providers. In-depth interviews were conducted based on semi-structured topic guides, audio-recorded, and transcribed for thematic analysis using elements of the grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Analysis revealed three themes of information needs, which were: interaction with the healthcare system, care for the child at home and psychosocial support for parents. Information needs on parents interaction with the healthcare system consisted of disease and treatment-related information, as well as health system navigation. Information needs on care for the child at home were represented by their caregiving for basic activities of daily living, medical caregiving, and psychosocial caregiving.

Overall, we observed that the association of the first negative RT-PCR with a second negative result was 96.7%. Median viral shedding was 25 (IQR: 21.5-28) days since symptoms' onset. In the univariate Cox model analysis, type 2 diabetes mellitus was associated with a prolonged viral RNA shedding (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.06-3.11, p = 0.04). In the multivariate Cox model analysis, type 2 diabetes was associated with a prolonged viral RNA shedding (HR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.11-0.89, p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: Intubated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus may have prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding. In critically ill COVID-19 patients, one negative LTA should be sufficient to assess and exclude infectivity.","output":"Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in lower respiratory tract samples of critically ill patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Although coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been associated with gastrointestinal manifestations, its effect on the pancreas remains unclear.

Necessary preventive precautions for the transmission of COVID-19 resulted in delays of in-person healthcare services, especially at the outset of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Among a US sample, we examined the rates of delays (defined as cancellations and postponements) to healthcare at the outset of the pandemic and characterized the reasons for delays. METHODS: As part of an internet-based survey distributed on social media in April 2020, we asked a US-based convenience sample of 2,570 participants about delays to their healthcare due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participant demographics and self-reported worries about general health and the COVID-19 pandemic were explored as potent determinants of healthcare delays. Along with all delays, we focused on three main types of delays as the primary outcomes in the study: 1) dental, 2) preventive, and 3) diagnostic care. For each outcome, we used bivariate statistical tests (t-tests and chi-square tests) and multiple logistic regression models to study which factors are associated with healthcare delays. RESULTS: The top reported barrier to receiving healthcare was fear of COVID-19 infection (34%). Almost half (n = 1,227, 48%) of participants reported experiencing healthcare delays. Among those who experienced healthcare delays and further clarified the type of delay they experienced, the top three reported types of care affected included: 1) dental (n = 351, 38%); 2) preventive (n = 269, 29%); and 3) diagnostic (n = 151, 16%) care. Logistic regression models show that age, gender, sexual identity, education, and self-reported worry about general health are significantly associated with experiencing healthcare delays overall. Self-reported worry about general health was negatively related to experiencing delays in dental care, while this predictor was positively associated with delays in diagnostic testing in the logistic regression model. Additionally, age was positively associated with delays in diagnostic testing. No factors remained significant in the multiple logistic regression for delays in preventive care, although race was marginally significant (p=.056), with people of color reporting experiencing less delays than their white counter parts. CONCLUSIONS: Lessons learned from the initial surge of COVID-19 cases can help inform systemic mitigation strategies for potential future disruptions. This research addresses the demand-side of healthcare delays by exploring the determinants of delays. More research on healthcare delays during the pandemic is needed, including the short- and long-term impacts on patient-level outcomes including mortality, morbidity, mental health, quality of life, and experience of pain.","output":"Characterizing Healthcare Delays and Interruptions in the US During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Data from an Internet-Based Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiological studies suggest that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine may have protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); and, there are now more than 15 ongoing clinical trials seeking to determine if BCG vaccination can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 (1). However, the mechanism by which BCG vaccination can induce a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific T cell response is unknown. Here, in silico, we identify 8 BCG derived peptides with significant sequence homology to either SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 or NSP13 derived peptides. Using an in vitro co-culture system, we show that human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells primed with a BCG derived peptide developed enhanced reactivity to its corresponding SARS-CoV-2 derived peptide. As expected, HLA differences between individuals meant that not all persons developed immunogenic responses to all 8 BCG derived peptides. Nevertheless, all of the 20 individuals that were primed with BCG derived peptides developed enhanced T cell reactivity to at least 7 of 8 SARS-CoV-2 derived peptides.

X-ray computed tomography (CT) plays a central role in the management of COVID-19. Traditional diagnosis with pulmonary CT images is time-consuming and error-prone, which could not meet the need for precise and rapid COVID-19 screening. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) has been successfully applied to CT image analysis, which assists radiologists in workflow scheduling and treatment planning for patients with COVID-19. Traditional methods use cross-entropy as the loss function with a Softmax classifier following a fully-connected layer. Most DL-based classification methods target intraclass relationships in a certain class (early, progressive, severe, or dissipative phases), ignoring the natural order of different phases of the disease progression,i.e.,from an early stage and progress to a late stage. To learn both intraclass and interclass relationships among different stages and improve the accuracy of classification, this paper proposes an ensemble learning method based on ordinal regression, which leverages the ordinal information on COVID-19 phases. The proposed method uses multi-binary, neuron stick-breaking (NSB), and soft labels (SL) techniques, and ensembles the ordinal outputs through a median selection.

Different gene therapy strategies are being pursued, including long-term gene correction of monogenetic diseases, eradication of tumor cells in cancer patients, or genetic vaccination for infectious diseases. Bispecific antibodies and gene therapy are connected in two ways. First, bispecific antibodies are tools of interest for the development of targeted gene transfer vectors. Different gene therapy strategies require different vectors, frequently replication-ablated viruses. Similar to the role of antibody engineering in antibody therapy, the engineering of gene transfer vectors has become key to the implementation of genetic therapies. Cytoablative cancer gene therapy and efficient genetic vaccination, for example, depend on vectors that are targeted to cancer cells and antigen-presenting cells, respectively, in order to avoid side effects and vector sequestration. To this end, bispecific antibodies have been engineered as adapters that link the vector to a specific molecule on the targeted cell and at the same time block the interaction with the native virus receptor. Different formats of bispecific antibodies and related molecules have been developed and succeeded in re-directing vectors to target cells in vitro and in vivo. These adapters also improved gene therapies in animal models. Second, gene transfer is a promising tool for delivery of bispecific antibodies to patients. Therefore, vectors can be injected directly into patients for antibody gene transfer, or cells isolated from patients can be genetically modified in vitro and then re-injected for in vivo antibody production. Genetic antibody delivery, compared with standard antibody injection, can be advantageous with respect to achieving persistent antibody titers or effective antibody biodistribution in patients. Initial studies have shown antibody production and therapeutic activity in animal models, setting the stage for more widespread investigations.

Several regimens are being employed for neoadjuvant treatment, largely because of their efficacy in metastatic setting. There is however a scarcity of evidence on the optimal cytotoxic regimen for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the efficacy of different protocols of neoadjuvant chemotherapy amongst patients who underwent radical cystectomy at our institution. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective, observational study including a cohort of 220 patients who underwent radical cystectomy between 2014 and 2020. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort included 79 patients and was compared to the cohort of historical controls including 141 patients operated prior to routine administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and those who opted for upfront surgery. RESULTS: Administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreased the risk of overall and cancer-specific mortality HR = 0.625 (95% CI 0.414C0.944), p = 0.025 and HR = 0.579 (95% CI 0.348C0.964), p = 0.036. Rates of downstaging, complete responses, lymph node metastasis, extravesical extension and positive surgical margins significantly favored neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Out of cytotoxic regimens, dose-dense MVAC and gemcitabine-cisplatin were similarly efficacious providing 46.9% and 50% of downstaging to <ypT2N0 respectively, including 30.6% and 25% of complete remissions. However, only dose-dense MVAC was associated with reduction of all-cause and cancer specific mortality risk HR = 0.385 (95% CI 0.214C0.691) p = 0.001 and HR = 0.336 (95% CI 0.160C0.703), p = 0.004 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study implies that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with subsequent radical cystectomy provides significant improvement over upfront surgery in locoregional control and long-term prognosis of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with neonatal pneumonia and its mortality in India. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted including both analytic study designs and descriptive study designs, which reported a quantitative analysis of factors associated with all the three types of pneumonia among neonates. The search was conducted from August to December, 2016 on the following databases; CINAHL, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, ProQuest, SCOPUS, Web of Science, WHO IMSEAR and IndMED. The search was restricted to Indian setting. PARTICIPANTS: The population of interest was neonates. OUTCOMES: The outcome measures included risk factors for incidences and mortality predictors of neonatal pneumonia. These could be related to neonate, maternal and pregnancy, caregiver, family, environment, healthcare system, iatrogenic and others. RESULTS: A total of three studies were included. For risk factors, two studies on ventilator-associated pneumonia were included with 194 neonates; whereas for mortality predictors, only one study with 150 neonates diagnosed with pneumonia was included. 11 risk factors were identified from two studies: duration of mechanical ventilation, postnatal age, birth weight, prematurity, sex of the neonate, length of stay in NICU, primary diagnosis, gestational age, number of re-intubation, birth asphyxia, and use of nasogastric tube. Metaanalysis with random-effects model was possible only for prematurity (<37 week) and very low birth weight (<1500 g) and very low birth weight was found to be significant (OR 5.61; 95% CI 1.76, 17.90). A single study was included on predictors of mortality.

The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated these issues. Widespread misinformation, lack of vaccine access, and attempts to avoid being infected have resulted in increases in Africans willingness to take multiple prescription and nonprescription medications and supplements. Issues with counterfeit pharmaceuticals and the relatively new recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty across the continent also create unique challenges for addressing this urgent public health need. Experts have called for more robust pharmaceutical regulation and healthcare/public health infrastructure investments across the continent. However, these changes take time, and more near-term strategies are needed to mitigate current health needs. In this commentary, we present a nonexhaustive set of immediately implementable recommendations that can serve as local strategies to address current polypharmacy-related health needs of Africans. Importantly, our recommendations take into consideration that not all healthcare providers are emergency medicine trained and that local trends related to polypharmacy will change over time and require ever-evolving public health initiatives. Still, by bolstering training to safeguard against provider availability biases, practicing evidence-based prescribing and shared decision making, and tracking and sharing local trends related to polypharmacy, African healthcare providers and public health practitioners can better position themselves to meet population needs. Furthermore, although these recommendations are tailored to Africans, they may also prove useful to providers and practitioners in other regions facing similar challenges.","output":"Polypharmacy Exposure, Aging Populations, and COVID-19: Considerations for Healthcare Providers and Public Health Practitioners in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infant emotion regulation has long-term implications for human development, highlighting the need for preventive interventions that support emotion regulation early in life. Such interventions may be especially important for infants higher in emotional reactivity who need to regulate their emotions more frequently and intensely than infants lower in emotional reactivity. The current randomized trial examined main and moderated effects of an attachment-based intervention on (a) infants' use of mother-oriented and self-soothing emotion regulation strategies and (b) infant emotion dysregulation in 186 low-income, predominantly Latino infants. We tested the brief (10-session) Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention in the context of home-based federal Early Head Start (EHS) services. Control participants received home-based EHS plus 10 weekly books. Intent-to-treat analyses with covariates revealed main effects of the intervention on infants' use of mother-oriented emotion regulation strategies during a brief (40-s) novel and potentially fear-inducing procedure (d = 0.31). Infant emotional reactivity moderated intervention impacts on mother-oriented emotion regulation strategies and on infant emotion dysregulation: We found stronger effects of the intervention for infants relatively higher in emotional reactivity.

RECENT FINDING Intestinal stem-cell-derived culture systems are self-organizing three-dimensional organotypic cultures that recapitulate many cellular, architectural and functional aspects of the human intestine. Progress has been made in the development of methods to incorporate additional cell lineages and physiological cues to better mimic the complexity of the intestine. Current model systems have facilitated both the study of gastrointestinal infections and interactions with normally nonpathogenic microbial residents of the gastrointestinal tract. These studies have illustrated how live microbes, or their metabolites, ligands and virulence factors influence epithelial cell differentiation, maintenance, repair, function and intestine development. SUMMARY Organotypic models are invaluable tools for studying host-microbe interactions that complement in-vivo experimental model systems. These models have evolved in terms of complexity and fidelity. The stem-cell-based models are already at forefront for studying host-microbe interactions and with continued development, the future looks even more promising.","output":"Stem-cell-derived models: tools for studying role of microbiota in intestinal homeostasis and disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On the eve of the reopening of the school year, as Associated Pediatricians of District 10 ASL3, Val Polcevera and Valle Scrivia, we created a shared outpatient clinic, called Ambulatorio Protetto, which allowed us, on the one hand, to resume our assistance activities directed to the symptomatic child not strongly suspected for SARS-CoV-2, contributing, according to WHO indications, to the 3 T strategy (Testing Tracing Treating) even in disadvantaged and poorly connected areas, on the other hand, to ensure the prevention and management of chronic patients and non-infectious patients with the best possible safety measures.

We evaluated differences and influential factors related to the interference phenomenon according to these two microcatheters group. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between June 2011 and September 2013, the jailing technique was applied to 94 internal cerebral artery (ICA) aneurysms. The jailing technique with the Neuroform EZ stent system was performed using Renegade (n = 22), Rebar (n = 35), and XT-27 microcatheters (n = 37). In the Renegade Hi-Flo microcatheter group, the jailing technique was successful in 19/22 patients (86.4%) and interference between the two microcatheters occurred in 6/21 patients (28.6%). In the Rebar and XT-27 microcatheter group, the jailing technique was successful in 71/72 patients (98.6%) and interference between the two microcatheters occurred in 1/72 patients (1.4%). RESULTS There was a significant difference in the interference between the two delivered microcatheters group (p-value < 0.000) and the carotid siphon angle (p-value: 0.004) in the univariate analysis.

However, the susceptibility of individuals to be impacted by the pandemic is variable suggesting potential influences of specific factors related to participants' demographics, attitudes, and practices. OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors associated with psychological symptoms related to the effects of the first wave of pandemic in a multi-country cohort of internet users. METHODS: This study anonymously screened 13,332 internet users worldwide for acute psychological symptoms related to COVID-19 pandemic from March 29th to April 14th, 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic amidst strict lockdown conditions. A total of n=12,817 responses were considered valid. n=1077 participants from Europe were screened a second time during May 15th to May 30th to ascertain the presence of psychological effects after the ease down of restrictions. RESULTS: Female gender, pre-existing psychiatric condition, and prior exposure to trauma were identified as notable factors associated with increased psychological symptoms during the first wave of COVID-19 (P <.001). The same factors, in addition to being related to someone who demised due to COVID-19 and using social media more than usual, were associated with persistence of psychological disturbances in the limited second assessment of European participants after the restrictions had relatively eased (P <.001). Optimism, ability to share concerns with family and friends like usual, positive prediction about COVID-19, and daily exercise were related to fewer psychological symptoms in both assessments (P <.001).

This inflammation is supposed to be the main driver in the pathogenesis of lung failure (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) in COVID-19. Objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single dose treatment with Tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19. We hypothesize that Tocilizumab slows down the progression of SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia and inflammation. We expect an improvement in pulmonary function compared to placebo-treated patients. Desirable outcomes would be that tocilizumab reduces the number of days that patients are dependent on mechanical ventilation and reduces the invasiveness of breathing assistance. Furthermore, this treatment might result in fewer admissions to intensive care units. Next to these efficacy parameters, safety of a therapy with Tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients has to be monitored closely, since immunosuppression could lead to an increased rate of bacterial infections, which could negatively influence the patients outcome.

The data collection of the primary follow up (28 days after randomisation) takes place during the hospital stay. Subsequently, a telephone interview on the quality of life is conducted after 6 and 12 months. Participants will be recruited from inpatients at ten medical centres in Germany. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention arm: Application of 8mg/kg body weight (BW) Tocilizumab i.v. once immediately after randomisation (12 mg/kg for patients with <30kg BW; total dose should not exceed 800 mg) AND conventional treatment. Control arm: Placebo (NaCl) i.v. once immediately after randomisation AND conventional treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary endpoint is the number of ventilator free days (d) (VFD) in the first 28 days after randomisation. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV), Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are defined as ventilator days. VFDs are counted as zero if the patient dies within the first 28 days. RANDOMISATION: The randomisation code will be generated by the CTU (Clinical Trials Unit, ZKS Freiburg) using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from patients and investigator staff. Randomisation will be stratified by centre and will be performed in blocks of variable length in a ratio of 1:1 within each centre. The block lengths will be documented separately and will not be disclosed to the investigators. The randomisation code will be produced by validated programs based on the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). BLINDING (MASKING): Participants, caregivers, and the study team assessing the outcomes are blinded to group assignment.

The present study developed the 3D structure of the envelope and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular docking analysis was done against various ligands. RESULTS: The highest log octanol/water partition coefficient, high number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, lowest non-bonded interaction energy between the receptor and the ligand, and high binding affinity were considered for the best ligand for the envelope (mycophenolic acid: log P = 3.00; DG = C10.2567 kcal/mol; pKi = 7.713 M) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (1-[(2,4-dichlorophenyl)methyl]pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid: log P = 2.901; DG = C12.2112 kcal/mol; pKi = 7.885 M) of SARS-CoV-2.

Now that dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses are all in circulation across tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, it is important to understand the environmental and biological conditions that make co-infections more likely to occur. To understand this, we developed a mathematical model of cocirculation of two arboviruses, with transmission parameters approximating dengue, Zika, and/or chikungunya viruses and co-infection possible in both humans and mosquitoes. We examined the influence of seasonal timing of arbovirus cocirculation on the extent of co-infection. By undertaking a sensitivity analysis of this model, we examined how biological factors interact with seasonality to determine arbovirus co-infection transmission and prevalence. We found that temporal synchrony of the co-infecting viruses and average temperature were the most influential drivers of co-infection incidence. For seasonal patterns typical of a tropical region, we observed non-negligible incidence irrespective of arrival time when two arboviruses arrived simultaneously. Under our default parameter settings, this corresponded to a maximum co-infection cumulative incidence of 83 per 1,000 individuals and a minimum cumulative incidence of 32 per 1,000 individuals in the year following arrival. For seasonal patterns typical of a more temperate region, co-infections only occurred if arrivals took place near the seasonal peak, and even then, did not reach 0.01 co-infections per 1,000 individuals. Our model highlights the synergistic effect of co-transmission from mosquitoes, which leads to more than double the number of co-infections than would be expected in a scenario without co-transmission.

Compared to venous blood results, Tasso-SST-collected (unstressed) and the summer- and winter-stressed blood samples demonstrated Deming regression slopes of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99C1.02), 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98C1.01), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97C1.01), respectively, with an overall accuracy of 98.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Capillary blood self-collection using the Tasso-SST device had a high success rate. Moreover, excellent concordance was found for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG results between Tasso-SST capillary and standard venous blood-derived sera. The Tasso-SST device should enable widespread collection of capillary blood for testing without medical supervision, facilitating epidemiologic studies.","output":"Self-collection of capillary blood using Tasso-SST devices for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prognostic evaluation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) using drug-eluting beads (DEBs) is essential for guiding the personalized treatment and follow-up strategy. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) has been reported as a biomarker in conventional TACE. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of ADCbaseline, ADC change, and ADCratio in predicting the early objective response for HCC after DEB-TACE. METHODS: This prospective single-center study included 32 consecutive patients undergoing dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging before and 1 month after DEB-TACE. After DEB-TACE, patients were grouped based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria into responders (complete response [CR], partial response [PR] ) and nonresponders (stable disease [SD], progressive disease [PD]). The Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to assess the statistical differences in ADCbaseline, ADC change, and ADCratio between responders and nonresponders. RESULTS: At post-DEB-TACE follow-up MRI, 62.5% (n = 20, 11 CRs, and 9 PRs) of patients showed objective response, and 37.5% (n = 12, 7 SDs, and 5 PDs) did not respond to chemoembolization. Nonresponders had a significantly higher ADCbaseline value than responders (p < 0.001). The ROC for identifying the response to chemoembolization demonstrated that the threshold ADCbaseline value of 0.920  10-3 mm2/s had 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity. The ADC change and ADCratio of responders were higher than that of nonresponders (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: ADCbaseline, ADC change, and ADCratio may be utilized as a noninvasive biomarker for predicting the early response of HCC to DEB-TACE.","output":"Apparent Diffusion Coefficient as a Noninvasive Biomarker for the Early Response in Hepatocellular Carcinoma after Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization using Drug-Eluting Beads"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acinetobacter baumannii causes high mortality in ventilator-associated pneumonia patients, and antibiotic treatment is compromised by multidrug-resistant strains resistant to -lactams, carbapenems, cephalosporins, polymyxins, and tetracyclines. Among COVID-19 patients receiving ventilator support, a multidrug-resistant A. baumannii secondary infection is associated with a 2-fold increase in mortality. Here, we investigated the use of the 8-hydroxyquinoline ionophore PBT2 to break the resistance of A. baumannii to tetracycline class antibiotics. In vitro, the combination of PBT2 and zinc with either tetracycline, doxycycline, or tigecycline was shown to be bactericidal against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, and any resistance that did arise imposed a fitness cost. PBT2 and zinc disrupted metal ion homeostasis in A. baumannii, increasing cellular zinc and copper while decreasing magnesium accumulation. Using a murine model of pulmonary infection, treatment with PBT2 in combination with tetracycline or tigecycline proved efficacious against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. These findings suggest that PBT2 may find utility as a resistance breaker to rescue the efficacy of tetracycline-class antibiotics commonly employed to treat multidrug-resistant A. baumannii infections.","output":"Rescuing Tetracycline Class Antibiotics for the Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Pulmonary Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has modified organisation and processes of primary care. In this paper, we aim to summarise experiences of international primary care systems.

During the early stage of the pandemic, primary care continued as the first point of contact to the health system but was poorly informed by policy makers on how to fulfil its role and ill equipped to provide care while protecting staff and patients against further spread of the infection. In many countries, the creativity and initiatives of local health professionals led to the introduction or extension of the use of telephone, e-mail and virtual consulting, and introduced triaging to separate 'suspected' COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 care.

This observation and subsequent mechanistic studies have demonstrated important interactions among allergens, microbes and the atopic host. The mechanisms responsible for microbe-induced asthma exacerbations are only incompletely understood. A focal point of current research is the inflammatory response of the host following an encounter with a pathogenic microbe, including variations in chemokine and cytokine production and resulting in changes in bronchial hyper-responsiveness and lung function. Direct bronchial infection, exposure of nerves with resulting neurogenic inflammation and a deviated host immune response are among the mechanisms underlying these functional disorders. Lately, suboptimal innate immune responses, expressed as defective interferon production, have gained attention as they might be amenable to intervention. This review describes the suggested mechanisms involved in the complex interactions between asthmagenic microbes, the immune system and atopy, based on in-vitro and in-vivo experimental models and epidemiological evidence. In addition, it provides a synopsis of potential therapeutic strategies either directly against the microorganisms or in respect to the associated inflammation.","output":"Antimicrobial strategies: An option to treat allergy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Esophageal and gastric cancers are a significant public health problem worldwide, with most patients presenting with advanced-stage disease and, consequently, poor prognosis. Systemic oncological treatments (SOT) have been widely used over more conservative approaches, such as supportive care. Nevertheless, its effectiveness in this scenario is not sufficiently clear. This paper provides an overview of systematic reviews that assessed the effectiveness of SOT compared with the best supportive care (BSC) or placebo in patients with advanced esophageal or gastric cancers in an end-of-life context. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos, and PROSPERO for eligible systematic reviews (SRs) published from 2008 onwards. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), functional status, and toxicity. Two authors assessed eligibility and extracted data independently. We evaluated the methodological quality of included SRs using the AMSTAR-2 tool and the overlap of primary studies (corrected covered area, CCA). Also, we performed a de novo meta-analysis with data reported for each primary study when it was possible. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. RESULTS We identified 16 SRs (19 included trials) for inclusion within this overview. Most reviews had a critically low methodological quality, and there was a very high overlap of primary studies. It is uncertain whether SOT improves OS and PFS over more conservative approaches due to the very low certainty of evidence. CONCLUSIONS The evidence is very uncertain about the effectiveness of SOT for advanced esophageal or gastric cancers. High-quality SRs and further randomized clinical trials that include a thorough assessment of patient-centered outcomes are needed.

Of 143 respondents, 121 were categorical fellows, representing over one-fourth of all categorical paediatric cardiology fellows in the United States of America. Nearly all (140/143, 97.9%) respondents utilised online learning during the pandemic, with 134 (93.7%) reporting an increase in use compared to pre-pandemic. The percentage of respondents reporting curriculum supplementation with outside lectures increased from 11.9 to 88.8% during the pandemic. Respondents considered online learning to be \\"equally or more effective\\" than in-person lectures in convenience (133/142, 93.7%), improving fellow attendance (132/142, 93.0%), improving non-fellow attendance (126/143, 88.1%), and meeting individual learning needs (101/143, 70.6%). The pandemic positively affected the lecture curriculum of 83 respondents (58.0%), with 35 (24.5%) reporting no change and 25 (17.5%) reporting a negative effect. A positive effect was most noted by those whose programmes utilised supplemental outside lectures (62.2 versus 25.0%, p = 0.004) and those whose lecture frequency did not decrease (65.1 versus 5.9%, p < 0.001).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS Five pigs underwent dorsal subcutaneous implantation of a polypropylene-based material coated with precision pore silicone granules (sphere-templated scaffold), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, human dermis, and porcine dermis. Sham and undissected sites were also used as controls. Specimens were harvested 7, 21, 90, and 180 days after surgery and evaluated histologically for inflammation, neovascularization, and collagen deposition. RESULTS All materials and sham sites induced a mild to moderate inflammation that decreased over time, except for human dermis, which elicited a moderate to severe inflammatory response. The responses were varied and measurable using subjective scoring methods. The sphere-templated scaffold demonstrated numerous foreign body giant cells adjacent to the silicone granules, which were not seen in any of the other specimens. CONCLUSION Subjective scoring of pathology slides and measurement of capsule thickness appeared to show differences between the materials, but these differences require a larger number of subjects and proper statistical analysis to assess.

All procedures were carried out by laparoscopy with retroperitoneal approach. Clinical data including patient demographics and perioperative, postoperative outcomes were evaluated. Recurrence of symptoms, and any adverse effects of surgery were evaluated after 7 to 30 days in outpatient clinic, and thereafter every 6 months.

Perspective deformation causes difficulty in direct, accurate geometric assessments of anatomical structures. In this work, to reduce perspective deformation in X-ray images acquired from regular cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) systems, we investigate on learning perspective deformation, i.e., converting perspective projections into orthogonal projections. Directly converting a single perspective projection image into an orthogonal projection image is extremely challenging due to the lack of depth information. Therefore, we propose to utilize one additional perspective projection, a complementary (180-degree) or orthogonal (90-degree) view, to provide a certain degree of depth information. Furthermore, learning perspective deformation in different spatial domains is investigated. Our proposed method is evaluated on numerical spherical bead phantoms as well as patients' chest and head X-ray data. The experiments on numerical bead phantom data demonstrate that learning perspective deformation in polar coordinates has significant advantages over learning in Cartesian coordinates, as root-mean-square error (RMSE) decreases from 5.31 to 1.40, while learning in log-polar coordinates has no further considerable improvement (RMSE = 1.85). In addition, using a complementary view (RMSE = 1.40) is better than an orthogonal view (RMSE = 3.87). The experiments on patients' chest and head data demonstrate that learning perspective deformation using dual complementary views is also applicable in anatomical X-ray data, allowing accurate cardiothoracic ratio measurements in chest X-ray images and cephalometric analysis in synthetic cephalograms from cone-beam X-ray projections.","output":"Learning Perspective Deformation in X-Ray Transmission Imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new acute respiratory disease severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious.

METHODS: Retrospective, observational study conducted between 5th March and 7th May 2020 of all hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Ceiling of care and CPR decisions were documented using the Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment (ReSPECT) process. Unadjusted and multivariable regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with ceiling of care decisions and death during hospitalisation. RESULTS: A total of 485 patients were included, of whom 409 (843%) had a documented ceiling of care; level one for 208 (509%), level two for 75 (183%) and level three for 126 (308%). CPR decisions were documented for 451 (930%) of whom 336 (745%) were 'not for resuscitation'. Advanced age, frailty, White-European ethnicity, a diagnosis of any co-morbidity and receipt of cardiovascular medications were associated with ceiling of care decisions. In a multivariable model only advanced age (odds 089, 086-093 p < 0001), frailty (odds 048, 038-060, p < 0001) and the cumulative number of co-morbidities (odds 072, 052-10, p = 0048) were independently associated.

The accessibility of online healthcare information relating to COVID-19 is unknown. We sought to evaluate the readability of online information relating to COVID-19 in four English speaking regions: Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States, and compare readability of website source provenance and regional origin. METHODS: The Google? search engine was used to collate the first 20 webpage URLs for three individual searches for COVID, COVID-19, and coronavirus from Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. The Gunning Fog Index (GFI), Flesch-Kincaid Grade (FKG) Score, Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) score were calculated to assess the readability. RESULTS: There were poor levels of readability webpages reviewed, with only 17.2% of webpages at a universally readable level. There was a significant difference in readability between the different webpages based on their information source (p < 0.01).

Clinical & Scientific Integrative cases (CSI) is an innovative, flagship module, which uses pioneering methodology to provide early-years learning that [1] is patient-centred, [2] integrates clinical and scientific curriculum content, [3] develops advanced team-work skills and [4] provides engaging, student-driven learning. These aims are designed to produce medical graduates equipped to excel in a modern healthcare environment. METHODS: CSI has adopted a novel educational approach which utilises contemporary digital resources to deliver a collaborative case-based learning (CBL) component, paired with a team-based learning (TBL) component that incorporates both learning and programmatic assessment. This paper serves to explore how first-year students experienced CSI in relation to its key aims, drawing upon quantitative and qualitative data from feedback surveys from CSIs inaugural year. It provides a description and analysis of the modules design, delivery, successes and challenges. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that CSI has been extremely well-received and that the majority of students agree that it met its aims. Survey outputs indicate success in integrating multiple elements of the curriculum, developing an early holistic approach towards patients, expediting the development of important team-working skills, and delivering authentic and challenging clinical problems, which our students found highly relevant. Challenges have included supporting students to adapt to a student-driven, deep learning approach. CONCLUSIONS: First-year students appear to have adopted a patient-centred outlook, the ability to integrate knowledge from across the curriculum, an appreciation for other team members and the self-efficacy to collaboratively tackle challenging, authentic clinical problems. Ultimately, CSIs innovative design is attractive and pertinent to the needs of modern medical students and ultimately, future doctors.

Physicians had to face the challenge of treating a large number of critically ill patients with a new disease and also maintain the essential healthcare services functioning properly. To prevent disease dissemination, authorities instructed people to stay at home and seek medical care only if they experienced respiratory distress. However, there are concerns those patients did not seek necessary health care because of these orientations. This study aims to see how the pandemic has influenced the severity of the disease, complication, and mortality of patients undergoing emergency cholecystectomy and appendectomy. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of patients admitted to the emergency department and undergoing to cholecystectomy and appendicectomy in the periods from March to May 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: We observed that COVID-19 did not change the severity of presentation or the outcome of patients with gallbladder disease, but caused a 24.2% increase in the prevalence of complicated appendicitis (p<0.05). However, disagreeing with what was expected, we did not identify a greater number of perioperative complications in patients undergoing an appendectomy.

This is of concern in Guatemala where physicians seldom consider guidance from other professionals during antimicrobial prescribing activities. METHODS: We carried out a cross sectional questionnaire and open ended interviews with physicians from five hospitals in Guatemala to describe perceptions of communication between health care providers, and acceptance of antimicrobial guidance during prescribing. RESULTS: From January to April 2021 an electronic questionnaire was sent to enrolled physicians of which 74% completed participation (n=107/145). Fifty-five percent participated in open ended interviews (n=79/145). Respondents perceived high levels of communication between physicians and ID specialists (94% of respondents); 52%, and 54% perceived high levels of physician-pharmacist, and physician-nurse communication respectively. Significant differences in the perception of physician-pharmacist communication were detected when comparing responses between hospitals, and between respondent sex (chi(2), p< 0.05). Barriers to communication between professionals included lack of local guidelines or protocols, patient overload, COVID-19 pandemic, lack of mentorship, and little room to discuss antimicrobial therapy with higher-ranking physicians. Eighty percent and 45% of physicians were open to receiving antibiotic optimization recommendations from other physicians, and pharmacists respectively. Notable barriers to accepting recommendations from pharmacists included lack of regular communication, lack of clinical experience, and concern about evidence based recommendations. CONCLUSION: Effective communication is perceived between physicians during antimicrobial prescribing activities. Marginal levels of communication and acceptance of prescribing recommendations have been detected between physicians and pharmacists.In this milieu, there is an opportunity to strengthen multidisciplinary teams to optimize antimicrobial use.

Indirect hands contact with surfaces contaminated by infectious droplets subsequently touching the mouth, nose or eyes seems to be another route of an indirect contact transmission. Persistence of the virus on different surfaces and other materials has been reported in recent studies: SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard. Viable virus was detected up to 72 h after application to different surfaces, although infectivity decay was also observed. This evidence suggests the likelihood that waste generated from patients affected by COVID-19 or subjects in quarantine treated in private houses or in areas different from hospitals and medical centres could be contaminated by SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, waste streams may represent a route for viral spreading being a potential risk also for the operators directly involved in the different phases of waste management. To address this concern, a specific multidisciplinary working group was settled by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) during the COVID-19 emergency, in order to establish guidelines related to solid waste collection, delivering, withdrawal, transport, treatment and disposal. Temporary stop of waste sorting, instructions for the population on how to package waste, instructions for Companies and operators for the adoption of adequate personal protection equipment (PPE), the use and sanitation of proper vehicles were among the main recommendations provided to the community by publications of freely downloadable reports and infographics in layman language.

While replication-incompetent recombinant HIV-1/SIV antigen-expressing human adenoviral vectors can elicit high-frequency antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses, their use is hampered by widespread pre-existing immunity to human serotypes. Non-human adenovirus serotypes associated with lower prevalence may offer an alternative strategy. We evaluated the immunogenicity of AdC7-GRN (A), a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus type 7 vector expressing clade B Gag, RT and Nef, and F4/AS01 (P), when delivered intramuscularly in homologous (PP or AA) and heterologous (AAPP or PPAA) prime-boost regimens, in macaques and mice. Vaccine-induced HIV-1-antigen-specific T cells in peripheral blood (macaques), liver, spleen, and intestinal and genital mucosa (mice) were characterized by intracellular cytokine staining. Vaccine-specific IgG antibodies (macaques) were detected using ELISA. In macaques, only the heterologous prime-boost regimens induced polyfunctional, persistent and balanced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses specific to each HIV-1 vaccine antigen. AdC7-GRN priming increased the polyfunctionality of F4/AS01-induced CD4(+) T cells. Approximately 50% of AdC7-GRN-induced memory CD8(+) T cells exhibited an effector-memory phenotype.

The economic and sanitary impact has been enormous. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. How to effectively prevent and control SARS-CoV-2 transmission while providing care to surgical patients during the pandemic is a crucial topic. In order to minimize the risk of cross-infection between patients and physicians, many hospitals have taken measures to limit outpatient services, elective hospitalizations, and the number of operations. Based on the prevention and control measures stipulated by major medical institutions in China, this overview provides recommendations for surgeons from three aspects: outpatient treatment, ward management and perioperative protection. Telemedicine should be encouraged as a means of social distancing. Outpatient examination should be selected. Reasonable spatial arrangement and effective environmental disinfection are important for ward management. Patient selection for surgery and timing of operations should be carefully discussed within multi-disciplinary teams. Appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn adapted to the situational risk. On December 31, 2019, China reported to the WHO Country Office a pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan [2,4]. Subsequently, the disease later named COVID-19 affected a substantial proportion of the population in Wuhan and spread to other areas of China. Relying on a nationwide shutdown and mandatory quarantine, China has effectively curtailed the domestic outbreak. However, due to the high transmissibility of SARS-Cov-2 and the mobility of people, COVID-19 spread to the rest of the world. Many hospitals worldwide were faced with confirmed and suspected SARS-Cov-2 infections, putting a huge strain on the safety of patients and employees. Consequently, surgical patients who seek medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic present significant challenges.

However, 3% of patients received a RED rating as they required urgent input. CONCLUSION Through these virtual clinics, the pediatric team was able to reach 208 patients and provided advice and reassurance. The need for face-to-face appointment was eliminated for 11% of patients who were discharged to their local dental practitioners, thereby reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19.","output":"Utilizing Teledentistry to Manage Cleft Lip and Palate Patients in an Outpatient Setting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) is a rapidly emerging disease classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To support the WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID\\\\19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high disease transmission. SEARCH METHODS: An information specialist searched the Cochrane COVID\\\\19 Study Register, and updated the search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 23 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Cohort studies, case\\\\control studies, time series, interrupted time series, case series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID\\\\19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened abstracts and titles in duplicate. Two review authors then independently screened all potentially relevant full\\\\text publications. One review author extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment. We used three different tools to assess risk of bias, depending on the study design: ROBINS\\\\I for non\\\\randomised studies of interventions, a tool provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non\\\\randomised, non\\\\controlled studies, and recommendations from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) for modelling studies. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and costs. MAIN RESULTS: We included 51 studies; 4 observational studies and 28 modelling studies on COVID\\\\19, one observational and one modelling study on MERS, three observational and 11 modelling studies on SARS, and three modelling studies on SARS and other infectious diseases. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta\\\\analysis and undertook a narrative synthesis. We judged risk of bias to be moderate for 2/3 non\\\\randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) and serious for 1/3 NRSI. We rated risk of bias moderate for 4/5 non\\\\controlled cohort studies, and serious for 1/5. We rated modelling studies as having no concerns for 13 studies, moderate concerns for 17 studies and major concerns for 13 studies. Quarantine for individuals who were in contact with a confirmed/suspected COVID\\\\19 case in comparison to no quarantine Modelling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases may have averted 44% to 96% of incident cases and 31% to 76% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 6 modelling studies on COVID\\\\19, 1 on SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID\\\\19, 1 on SARS, low\\\\certainty evidence). Studies also indicated that there may be a reduction in the basic reproduction number ranging from 37% to 88% due to the implementation of quarantine (5 modelling studies on COVID\\\\19, low\\\\certainty evidence). Very low\\\\certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings may be (2 modelling studies on SARS). Quarantine in combination with other measures to contain COVID\\\\19 in comparison to other measures without quarantine or no measures When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, such as school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated that there may be a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than measures without quarantine or no interventions (incident cases: 9 modelling studies on COVID\\\\19; onward transmission: 5 modelling studies on COVID\\\\19; mortality: 5 modelling studies on COVID\\\\19, low\\\\certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID\\\\19. Quarantine for individuals travelling from a country with a declared COVID\\\\19 outbreak compared to no quarantine Very low\\\\certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths may be small for SARS, but might be larger for COVID\\\\19 (2 observational studies on COVID\\\\19 and 2 observational studies on SARS). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence is limited because most studies on COVID\\\\19 are mathematical modelling studies that make different assumptions on important model parameters. Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, although there is uncertainty over the magnitude of the effect. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak and the impact of the measures implemented. This review was originally commissioned by the WHO and supported by Danube\\\\University\\\\Krems.

The effect of directionality of the program was also explored. METHODS A systematic search was conducted using multiple databases. Inclusion criteria were systematic review of text message programs for adults with T2DM, evaluated A1C, and English language. Quality assessment was completed using AMSTAR-2 guidelines. Data were extracted by multiple coders, and results were synthesized. RESULTS The final sample included 9 systematic reviews published between 2011 and 2019, with 72 unique international studies. Text message programs focused on diabetes self-management and reducing health risks through educational and motivational content with some providing personalized feedback. A meta-analysis of program effect on A1C was conducted in 5 reviews with a pooled difference in A1C from -0.38% to -0.8%. Adults with T2DM of shorter duration and lower A1C had better treatment effects. Evidence on unidirectional versus bidirectional programs is conflicting; however, both improve outcomes. Evidence of text message programs targeting medication engagement was inconclusive. Some programs improved blood pressure, lipids, self-management, self-efficacy, and health behaviors. High satisfaction and an average of 9.6% to 18.7% attrition was reported. CONCLUSIONS Text messaging programs can improve T2DM outcomes, are a highly accessible mode of communication, are relatively inexpensive, and are an underutilized adjunct to clinical care.","output":"An Umbrella Review of Text Message Programs for Adults With Type 2 Diabetes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research, we have constructed and optimized the colloidal gold labeled lateral flow strip (LFS) for rapid detection of antigen of SARS-CoV-2 and rapid screening of COVID-19.

METHODS: Eighty cases of COVID-19 diagnosed from January 24 to February 17, 2020 in Beijing YouAn Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University were retrospectively analyzed. All 80 patients received symptomatic and supportive treatment. Among them, 44 patients took Jinhua Qinggan granules (treatment group) within 24 h of admission, and the remaining 36 patients either did not take Jinhua Qinggan granules or took the granules for less than 2 d (control group). In this study, we compared the duration of viral nucleic acid detection and of pneumonia absorption improvement between the two groups. RESULTS: Among the 80 cases, 37 were male (46%) and 43 were female (54%) with age ranging from 15 to 86 years, with an average age of 51.19 years. The average duration of viral nucleic acid detection was (7  4) d in the Jinhua Qinggan administration group and (10  4) d for the control group (P = 0.010), following which, nucleic acid tests were negative. Of the two groups, 56.82% in the Jinhua Qinggan treatment group and 27.78% in the control group demonstrated negative nucleic acid tests within 7 d or less. The 7-day viral clearance rate was significantly higher in the Jinhua Qinggan group compared with the control group (P = 0.009). Furthermore, the pneumonia recovery time indicated by chest CT was (8  4) d in the Jinhua Qinggan group, which was significantly shorter than the control group, at (10  5) d (P = 0.021).

We used anonymized smartphone mobility measures to quantify the mobility level needed to control SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., mobility threshold), and the difference relative to the observed mobility level (i.e., mobility gap). METHODS: We conducted a time-series study of the weekly incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada from Mar. 15, 2020, to Mar. 6, 2021. The outcome was weekly growth rate, defined as the ratio of cases in a given week versus the previous week. We evaluated the effects of average time spent outside the home in the previous 3 weeks using a log-normal regression model, accounting for province, week and mean temperature. We calculated the SARS-CoV-2 mobility threshold and gap. RESULTS: Across the 51-week study period, a total of 888 751 people were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Each 10% increase in the mobility gap was associated with a 25% increase in the SARS-CoV-2 weekly case growth rate (ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.20-1.29). Compared to the prepandemic baseline mobility of 100%, the mobility threshold was highest in the summer (69%; interquartile range [IQR] 67%-70%), and dropped to 54% in winter 2021 (IQR 52%-55%); a mobility gap was present in Canada from July 2020 until the last week of December 2020.

Drug repurposing has been employed to rapidly find a cure; but despite great efforts, no drug or vaccine is presently available for treating or prevention of COVID-19. Apart from antivirals, immunotherapeutic strategies are suggested considering the role of the immune response as the host defense against the virus, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 suppresses interferon induction as an immune evasion strategy. Active immunization through vaccines, interferon administration, passive immunotherapy by convalescent plasma or synthesized monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, as well as immunomodulatory drugs, are different immunotherapeutic approaches that will be mentioned in this review. The focus would be on passive immunotherapeutic interventions. Interferons might be helpful in some stages. Vaccine development has been followed with unprecedented speed. Some of these vaccines have been advanced to human clinical trials. Convalescent plasma therapy is already practiced in many countries to help save the lives of severely ill patients. Different antibodies that target various steps of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or the associated immune responses are also proposed. For treating the cytokine storm induced at a late stage of the disease in some patients, immune modulation through JAK inhibitors, corticosteroids, and some other cognate classes are evaluated. Given the changing pattern of cytokine induction and immune responses throughout the COVID-19 disease course, different adapted approaches are needed to help patients.

Data collected by observation, document studies, and interviews were themed, coded, and organized during the research. Findings The move from in-person to online pitches did not seem to affect levels of trustworthiness or arrogance as angels assessed more message content during Q&A sessions. Body movement, gestures and \\"eye gaze\\" (i.e. the look on a presenter's face) played a central role in passion assessment during in-person meetings. Body language was highly limited during online sessions and tone of voice became the main source of passion assessment.

METHODS: We performed a prospective, single-center, point of care validation of two Ag-RDT in comparison to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Between October 9th and 23rd, 2020, 1064 participants were enrolled. The PanbioTM Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test device (Abbott) was validated in 535 participants, with 106 positive Ag-RDT results out of 124 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 85.5% (95% CI: 78.0-91.2). Specificity was 100.0% (95% CI: 99.1-100) in 411 RT-PCR negative individuals. The Standard Q Ag-RDT (SD Biosensor, Roche) was validated in 529 participants, with 170 positive Ag-RDT results out of 191 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 89.0% (95%CI: 83.7-93.1). One false positive result was obtained in 338 RT-PCR negative individuals, yielding a specificity of 99.7% (95%CI: 98.4-100).

Previous surveys have been conducted regarding these questions and guidelines from national organizations have been issued, but practices remain varied among institutions. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the literature related to the timing of CLP rotations and generated consensus recommendations based on our experience as program directors, rotation leaders, and residents. RESULTS: Explicit goals of CLP training in residency include identifying and treating psychiatric manifestation of medical illness and communicating effectively with primary teams. Implicit goals of training may include conflict management, limit setting and thinking dirty. DISCUSSION: Though CLP rotations earlier in residency often create a better fit within the overarching curriculum and allow for generating early interest in the field, significant amounts of supervision are required and consultees may look to attendings as the primary consultant. Conversely, while later rotations are sometimes challenging to structure with other outpatient responsibilities, they allow for greater autonomy and may map better onto the informal curriculum. A hybrid model, with training spread across multiple years, is another approach that may mitigate some of the disadvantages of confining CL training to a single year. CONCLUSIONS: Compelling arguments can be made for placing the core CLP rotation in PGY-2 or -3 or using a hybrid model. Regardless of placement, program directors and rotation leaders should be mindful of tailoring the rotation to the trainees developmental stage.","output":"Optimizing Fit: Targeting a Residency Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison Rotation to Various Levels of Training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the history of one of the most significant crises that occurred shortly before the current global crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which lasted from February 2014 to December 2015, killed more than 11,000 people and sowed panic around the world. What started as a local phenomenon quickly became a major challenge to national health in West African countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, etc., as well as to global health institutions such as WHO and international humanitarian organizations. The most severe consequences of Ebola were felt in Sierra Leone - a country rich in natural resources, but with a poor state administration system and a dilapidated health care system. A complex set of factors-environmental, economic, political, social and cultural - was responsible for the spread of the Ebola virus among the people of West Africa. All of them are now more or less well understood, although a holistic picture of the events of the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa remains unclear. The aim of this article is to reconstruct the general history of the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, as well as to characterize its causes and consequences.","output":"Ebola Epidemic in Sierra Leone: on the Crisis Story of the Pre-COVID Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) have been implemented in several countries to prevent and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of the emergence of vaccines that mitigate illness and death, no effective measures exist to control the contagion. Testing, tracing, and isolation (TTI) in conjunction with disciplined social distancing were expected to achieve negligible-contagion levels and avoid, for example, superspreading events 1. However, the logic sustaining these strategieshas proven insufficient and a commitment to implementing them leads to controversial ethical challenges. This paper focuses on the effectiveness of contagion control policies that are independent of the ethical challenges that the chosen strategies pose, and of the complex realities of different countries, that are applicable both country-wide and at the local level. Even more relevant is that our performance measure indicators are given by variables that provide an early warning as to when the epidemic might expand, despite some temporal case decrements. We show that if case reduction is not sustained for more than 7-14 days, the risk growth is considerable, warranting immediate attention and action. To draw these conclusions, our research does not only follow the contagion change but its velocity, and applies these indicators to a sample of prototypical countries, finding strong evidence for our conclusions. The latter are independent of different applied NPI and country differences, suggesting that they can be used as \\"universal\\" indicators for epidemic control policies. Our main conclusion is that if the spread reduction is lost during one, or at most two weeks, immediate measures have to be implemented to avoid undesirable scenarios.","output":"Efficient strategy evaluation to control the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we advocate a highly favourable opportunity for the treatment of COVID-19 disease by repurposing a long-serving medical agent with an excellent history of clinical use, namely heparin. Heparin is best known as an anticoagulant, but it also exhibits direct antiviral activity against many enveloped viruses and has anti-inflammatory activity. The high incidence of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients suggests that coagulopathy plays an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. This already makes heparin a unique, potentially curative agent that can be used immediately to help resolve the ongoing crisis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. We demonstrate here in vitro that heparin does indeed inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. The three concurrent modes of activity of heparin (antiviral, anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory) against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 form a unique therapeutic combination. Thus, repurposing of heparin to fight SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 appears to be a powerful, readily available measure to address the current pandemic.","output":"Inhaled and systemic heparin as a repurposed direct antiviral drug for prevention and treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In an effort to protect health care workers at the beginning and end of oral and maxillofacial surgeries, we describe a negative-pressure intubation hood (NPIH) designed to reduce the risk aerosol exposure from fiberoptic intubation (FOI) and extubation. This design is especially important during the Coronavirus disease 2019 era, as it provides greater protection from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 during FOI and extubation, which are some of the most high-risk, aerosol generating procedures of oral and maxillofacial surgery cases.

Here we show RAD27/FEN1, which encodes flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), a structure-specific nuclease with roles in DNA replication and repair, and has the greatest number of synthetic lethal interactions with Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome instability genes, is a druggable target for an inhibitor-based approach to kill cancers with defects in homologous recombination (HR). The vulnerability of cancers with HR defects to FEN1 loss was validated by studies showing that small-molecule FEN1 inhibitors and FEN1 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) selectively killed BRCA1- and BRCA2-defective human cell lines. Furthermore, the differential sensitivity to FEN1 inhibition was recapitulated in mice, where a small-molecule FEN1 inhibitor reduced the growth of tumors established from drug-sensitive but not drug-resistant cancer cell lines. FEN1 inhibition induced a DNA damage response in both sensitive and resistant cell lines; however, sensitive cell lines were unable to recover and replicate DNA even when the inhibitor was removed. Although FEN1 inhibition activated caspase to higher levels in sensitive cells, this apoptotic response occurred in p53-defective cells and cell killing was not blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor. These results suggest that FEN1 inhibitors have the potential for therapeutically targeting HR-defective cancers such as those resulting from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, and other genetic defects.","output":"FEN1 endonuclease as a therapeutic target for human cancers with defects in homologous recombination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) are found in several isolated niches of the adult mammalian brain where they have unique potential to assist in tissue repair. Modern transcriptomics offer high-throughput methods for identifying disease or injury associated gene expression signatures in endogenous adult NSCs, but they require adaptation to accommodate the rarity of NSCs. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of NSCs requires pooling several mice, which impedes application to labor-intensive injury models. Alternatively, single cell RNAseq can profile hundreds to thousands of cells from a single mouse and is increasingly used to study NSCs. The consequences of the low RNA input from a single NSC on downstream identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) remains insufficiently explored. Here, to clarify the role that low RNA input plays in NSC DEG identification, we directly compared DEGs in an oxidative stress model of cultured NSCs by bulk and single cell sequencing. While both methods yielded DEGs that were replicable, single cell sequencing using the 10X Chromium platform yielded DEGs derived from genes with higher relative transcript counts compared to non-DEGs and exhibited smaller fold changes than DEGs identified by bulk RNAseq. The loss of high fold-change DEGs in the single cell platform presents an important limitation for identifying disease-relevant genes. To facilitate identification of such genes, we determined an RNA-input threshold that enables transcriptional profiling of NSCs comparable to standard bulk sequencing and used it to establish a workflow for in vivo profiling of endogenous NSCs. We then applied this workflow to identify DEGs after lateral fluid percussion injury, a labor-intensive animal model of traumatic brain injury. Our work joins an emerging body of evidence suggesting that single cell RNA sequencing may underestimate the diversity of pathologic DEGs. However, our data also suggest that population level transcriptomic analysis can be adapted to capture more of these DEGs with similar efficacy and diversity as standard bulk sequencing. Together, our data and workflow will be useful for investigators interested in understanding and manipulating adult hippocampal NSC responses to various stimuli.","output":"Robust Transcriptional Profiling and Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes With Low Input RNA Sequencing of Adult Hippocampal Neural Stem and Progenitor Populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the trade of goods and services in Spain.

METHODS This was a prospective cohort study and included 262 men aged between 20 and 65 years. The study comprised 3 groups including patients with COVID-19 (n = 89), cases with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection (n = 30), and age-matched controls (n = 143). All cases were evaluated using TT, LH, FSH, and prolactin. Correlations between TT and clinical parameters of patient groups were investigated using Pearson's correlation test. OUTCOMES The primary outcome of the study was detection of the difference of TT, FSH, LH, and prolactin levels between the groups. Secondary outcome was to correlate TT and hospitalization time and oxygen saturation on hospital admission (SpO2) of patients. RESULTS The mean age of study groups was 49.9  12.5 years, 52.7  9.6 years, and 50  7.8 years, respectively (P = .06). Serum TT levels was median 185.52 ng/dL in patients with COVID-19, median 288.67 ng/dL in patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection and median 332 ng/dL in control cases, (P < .0001). The proportion of patients with testosterone deficiency in group 1, group 2, and group 3 was 74.2%, 53.3%, and 37.8%, respectively (P < .0001). Serum LH levels (P = 0.0003) and serum prolactin levels (P = .0007) were higher in patients with COVID-19 and patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection than control cases. Correlation analysis revealed significant negative correlation between serum TT levels and hospitalization time of patients with COVID-19 (r = -0.45, P < .0001). In addition, a significant positive correlation was observed between SpO2 and serum TT levels in patients with COVID-19 ( r = 0.32, P = .0028). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Physicians may consider to evaluate male patients with COVID-19 for concomitant androgen deficiency. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS Strengths include the evidence about the alteration of male reproductive hormones under COVID-19. Limitations include the analysis limited to one general hospital, only a single measurement of TT was available, free and bioavailable testosterone levels were not evaluated. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates COVID-19 is associated with decreased level of TT and increased level of LH and prolactin. More serious COVID-19 causes more reduction in TT levels and prolongs hospitalization period. M Kadihasanoglu, S Aktas, E Yardimci, et al.

It is likely that the public health impact of pollen may increase in the future due to a higher population prevalence of pollen sensitization as well as earlier, longer, and more intense pollen seasons, trends attributed to climate change. The effects of pollen on health outcomes have previously been studied through cross-sectional design or at two time points, namely preceding and within the period of pollen exposure. We are not aware of any observational study in adults that has analyzed the dose-response relationship between daily ambient pollen concentration and cardiovascular, pulmonary, cognitive, sleep, or quality of life outcomes. Many studies have relied on self-reported pollen allergy status rather than objectively confirming pollen sensitization. In addition, many studies lacked statistical power due to small sample sizes or were highly restrictive with their inclusion criteria, making the findings less transferable to the real world. Methods: The EPOCHAL study is an observational panel study which aims to relate ambient pollen concentration to six specific health domains: (1) pulmonary function and inflammation; (2) cardiovascular outcomes (blood pressure and heart rate variability); (3) cognitive performance; (4) sleep; (5) health-related quality of life (HRQoL); and (6) allergic rhinitis symptom severity. Our goal is to enroll 400 individuals with diverse allergen sensitization profiles. The six health domains will be assessed while ambient exposure to pollen of different plants naturally varies. Health data will be collected through six home nurse visits (at approximately weekly intervals) as well as 10 days of independent tracking of blood pressure, sleep, cognitive performance, HRQoL, and symptom severity by participants. Through repeated health assessments, we aim to uncover and characterize dose-response relationships between exposure to different species of pollen and numerous acute health effects, considering (non-)linearity, thresholds, plateaus and slopes. Conclusion: A gain of knowledge in pollen-health outcome relationships is critical to inform future public health policies and will ultimately lead toward better symptom forecasts and improved personalized prevention and treatment.","output":"Rationale and Design of a Panel Study Investigating Six Health Effects of Airborne Pollen: The EPOCHAL Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without azithromycin have been widely promoted to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) following early in vitro antiviral effects against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin decreased COVID-19 mortality compared with the standard of care. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and MedRxiv were searched up to 25 July 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included published and unpublished studies comparing the mortality rate between patients treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin and patients managed with standard of care. PARTICIPANTS: Patients &#8805;18 years old with confirmed COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. METHODS: Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model. Multiple subgroup analyses were conducted to assess drug safety. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 839 articles, of which 29 met our inclusion criteria. All studies except one were conducted on hospitalized patients and evaluated the effects of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. Among the 29 articles, three were randomized controlled trials, one was a non-randomized trial and 25 were observational studies, including 11 with a critical risk of bias and 14 with a serious or moderate risk of bias. After excluding studies with critical risk of bias, the meta-analysis included 11 932 participants for the hydroxychloroquine group, 8081 for the hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin group and 12 930 for the control group. Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with mortality: pooled relative risk (RR) 0.83 (95% CI 0.65-1.06, n = 17 studies) for all studies and RR = 1.09 (95% CI 0.97-1.24, n = 3 studies) for randomized controlled trials. Hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin was associated with an increased mortality (RR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.04-1.54, n = 7 studies). We found similar results with a Bayesian meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: Hydroxychloroquine alone was not associated with reduced mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients but the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin significantly increased mortality.","output":"Effect of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin on the mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: To analyze the evolution of the nutritional status of Elementary School children, over four years, and to infer the impact of nutritional imbalances to child infection susceptibility Methods: A convenience sample of two elementary schools were studied during 4 school years, starting in 2016/2017 Weight and height were collected Body mass index (BMI) z-score was calculated using the WHO AnthroPlus software Nutritional status was evaluated according to WHO guidelines Results: 1155 students (6 - 14 years-old, 48 5% female) were included The mean z-scores of each year were: 0 43 1 17 in 2016/2017, 0 70 1 31 in 2017/2018, 0 38 1 30 in 2018/2019, and 0 34 1 86 in 2019/2020 The 2019/2020 school year recorded the highest percentage of underweight (10%), the highest percentage of normal weight was recorded in 2016/2017 (67 2%), 2017/2018 registered the highest percentage of overweight (24 6%) and the highest percentage of obesity was registered in 2019/2020 (18 2%) In these 4 years there has been an increase in the percentage of underweight (2 2% to 10%) and obesity (8 1% to 18 2%) and a decrease in the percentage of normal weight (67 2% to 54 6%) and overweight (22 5% to 17 1%) Conclusion: The increase in the prevalence of underweight and obesity between 2016 and 2020 is worrying, mainly during a pandemic that has obesity and malnutrition as risk factors Also, the decrease in the prevalence of overweight may be related to conversion of these cases into obesity cases, since normal weight cases also decreased We are implementing a nutrition education program in these schools to try reverting this serious public health problem, although facing some resistance Therefore, nutritionists are needed in Portuguese schools, to promote health and nutrition literacy among students, especially during pandemic times References: de Onis M, Onyango AW, Borghi E, Siyam A, Nishida C, Siekmann J Development of a WHO growth reference for school-aged children and adolescents Bull World Health Organ 2007;85(9):660-7 Disclosure of Interest: None declared","output":"Nutritional status of children in school age: A look of concern in an era of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was a pandemic.

Many of these decisions have profound, often irreversible, consequences for the child and family, as well as potential benefits for functioning, health and quality of life. Yet little is known about what influences these decisions. A systematic review of reasoning identified the range of reasons clinicians give in the literature when initiating technology dependence in a child, and as a result helps determine the range of influences on these decisions. METHODS Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Web of Science, ASSIA and Global Health Library databases were searched to identify all reasons given for the initiation of technology dependence in a child. Each reason was coded as a broad and narrow reason type, and whether it supported or rejected technology dependence. RESULTS 53 relevant papers were retained from 1604 publications, containing 116 broad reason types and 383 narrow reason types. These were grouped into broad thematic categories: clinical factors, quality of life factors, moral imperatives and duty and personal values; and whether they supported, rejected or described the initiation of technology dependence. The majority were conceptual or discussion papers, less than a third were empirical studies. Most discussed neonates and focused on end-of-life care. CONCLUSIONS There is a lack of empirical studies on this topic, scant knowledge about the experience of older children and their families in particular; and little written on choices made outside 'end-of-life' care. This review provides a sound basis for empirical research into the important influences on a child's potential technology dependence.","output":"Initiating technology dependence to sustain a child's life: a systematic review of reasons."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the spread of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic out of China, evolution in the pandemic worldwide shows dramatic differences among countries. In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concern, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the efficacy of containment, mitigation or attack strategies. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to quarantined populations in order to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the 17 individual regions (CCAA). Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follow an evolution similar to the isolation of 1,5 percent of the population and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum of over 1.4M infected around April 27. The effect on the epidemics of the ongoing partial confinement measures is yet unknown (an update of results with data until March 31st is included), but increasing the isolation around ten times more could drastically reduce the peak to over 100k cases by early April, while each day of delay in taking this hard containment scenario represents a 90 percent increase of the infected population at the peak. Dynamics at the sub aggregated levels of CCAA show epidemics at the different levels of progression with the most worrying situation in Madrid an Catalonia. Increasing alpha values up to 10 times, in addition to a drastic reduction in clinical cases, would also more than halve the number of deaths. Updates for March 31st simulations indicate a substantial reduction in burden is underway. A similar approach conducted for Italy pre- and post-interventions also begins to suggest substantial reduction in both infected and deaths has been achieved, showing the efficacy of drastic social distancing interventions.","output":"A modified SEIR model to predict the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain and Italy: simulating control scenarios and multi-scale epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammation contributes to the development of various pathologies, e.g. asthma, cardiovascular diseases, some types of cancer, and metabolic disorders.

Nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) are today thought to play a significant role in enabling serial harassers in American workplaces.Therefore, legislators have proposed either banning NDAs altogether when the allegation involves sexual misconduct or allowing NDAs only when requested by claimants and empowering them to reach agreements on favorable terms. However, these solutions inadequately respond to a significant, but narrower problem involving superstar or rainmaker employees. For most employers, investigating harassment allegations has always been important from the perspective of workplace morale and liability avoidance and, in our experience, employers take such allegations seriously showing little tolerance when presented with credible cases.The same cannot be said of misconduct committed by superstar or rainmaker employees and others who generate significant revenue flows or hold high executive positions in the companies they dominate. Beyond the prospect of being held strictly liable, a corporations financial position can be threatened when facing harassment claims against a superstar employee. Therefore, the all too expedient action is to offer claimants a settlement agreement that ensures each partys confidentiality. This is especially true where allegations lack concrete evidence and rely solely on the testimonies of the claimant and alleged harasser. The problem, however, is one of recidivism, when multiple allegations are raised against the same employee over time. Where there is a pattern of misconduct, we would ordinarily expect the companys human resources function to insist on the repeat offenders termination. Yet for superstars and rainmakers, HR departments frequently lack the internal influence to respond appropriately and prevent ongoing abuse. It is simply unrealistic to expect employers to properly police themselves when faced with such competing incentives. In our view, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) has a special role to play in counteracting the spiral that allows recidivist abusers to escape punishment for their misconductone that lies in reforming how the agency oversees claims of harassment. Based on its authority under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the EEOC could promulgate a new rule that requires employers to report basic information to the Commission whenever it reaches an agreement that includes nondisclosure provisions purporting to resolve a sexual misconduct claim. The Commission would then maintain a log of these reports, studying any unusual patterns involving the same employee or company. Should such a pattern emerge, the EEOC could then initiate a Commissioner Charge on its own accord under another Title VII provision. This solution can be modeled by the Department of Labors Occupational Safety and Health Administrations reporting scheme for workplace incidents and other comparable initiatives used by private colleges and universities. Importantly, the proposed offenders log also balances the relevant interests of employers, claimants, and the public alike by bolstering the resolve of in-house counsel and HR to address seriously the sexual harasser recidivists within their company, without preventing resolution of disputes between first-time alleged offenders and victims in a manner which avoids reputational harm to all parties.","output":"How the EEOCs Maintenance of an 'Alleged Offenders' Log Can Help Prevent the Next Harvey Weinstein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this prospective study, nasal swab samples from patients with acute respiratory infections were evaluated for the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

These metalloenzymes possess very similar active sites and may use a similar mechanism for catalysis. However, whether the substrates and inhibitors of other cyclic amidohydrolases can inhibit dihydropyrimidinase remains unclear. This study investigated the inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase by flavonoids and substrates of other cyclic amidohydrolases. Allantoin, dihydroorotate, 5-hydantoin acetic acid, acetohydroxamate, orotic acid, and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole could slightly inhibit dihydropyrimidinase, and the IC(50) values of these compounds were within the millimolar range. The inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase by flavonoids, such as myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, galangin, dihydromyricetin, and myricitrin, was also investigated. Some of these compounds are known as inhibitors of allantoinase and dihydroorotase. Although the inhibitory effects of these flavonoids on dihydropyrimidinase were substrate-dependent, dihydromyricetin significantly inhibited dihydropyrimidinase with IC(50) values of 48 and 40 M for the substrates dihydrouracil and 5-propyl-hydantoin, respectively. The results from the Lineweaver?Burk plot indicated that dihydromyricetin was a competitive inhibitor. Results from fluorescence quenching analysis indicated that dihydromyricetin could form a stable complex with dihydropyrimidinase with the K (d) value of 22.6 M. A structural study using PatchDock showed that dihydromyricetin was docked in the active site pocket of dihydropyrimidinase, which was consistent with the findings from kinetic and fluorescence studies. This study was the first to demonstrate that naturally occurring product dihydromyricetin inhibited dihydropyrimidinase, even more than the substrate analogs (>3 orders of magnitude).

The transcription factor, nuclear factor-&#954;-B (NF&#954;B) is a key inflammatory player that is antagonized via anti-inflammatory actions exerted by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). However, technical limitations have restricted our understanding of how GR is involved in the dynamics of NF&#954;B in vivo. In this study, we used an improved lentiviral-based reporter to elucidate the time course of NF&#954;B and GR activities during behavioral changes from sickness to depression induced by a systemic lipopolysaccharide challenge. The trajectory of NF&#954;B activity established a behavioral basis for the NF&#954;B signal transition involved in three phases, sickness-early-phase, normal-middle-phase, and depressive-like-late-phase. The temporal shift in brain GR activity was differentially involved in the transition of NF&#954;B signals during the normal and depressive-like phases. The middle-phase GR effectively inhibited NF&#954;B in a glucocorticoid-dependent manner, but the late-phase GR had no inhibitory action. Furthermore, we revealed the cryptic role of basal GR activity in the early NF&#954;B signal transition, as evidenced by the fact that blocking GR activity with RU486 led to early depressive-like episodes through the emergence of the brain NF&#954;B activity. These results highlight the inhibitory action of GR on NF&#954;B by the basal and activated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis during body-to-brain inflammatory spread, providing clues about molecular mechanisms underlying systemic inflammation caused by such as COVID-19 infection, leading to depression.","output":"Decoding the temporal nature of brain GR activity in the NFB signal transition leading to depressive-like behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune profiling of COVID-19 patients has identified numerous alterations in both innate and adaptive immunity.

Across a benchmark of large-scale datasets, LANTERN equals or outperforms all alternative approaches, including deep neural networks. LANTERN furthermore extracts useful insights into the landscape including its inherent dimensionality, a latent space of additive mutational effects, and novel metrics of landscape structure. LANTERN facilitates straightforward discovery of fundamental mechanisms in GPLs, while also reliably extrapolating to unexplored regions of genotypic-space.","output":"Interpretable modeling of genotype-phenotype landscapes with state-of-the-art predictive power"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives We investigated the participation and detection rates of cervical lesions in cervical screening non-attenders offered HPV (human papillomavirus) self-sampling with cytology triage.Methods From 2016 to 2018, HPV self-sampling was routinely offered as an option, along with cytology, to all non-attenders in Ebetsu City, Japan. The primary endpoints were CIN2 and CIN3 detection rates, and secondary endpoints were abnormal cytology rates and follow-up compliance.Results Overall, recall invitations were mailed to 6,116 non-attenders, with a response rate of 15.9% (cytology: 6.5%, HPV testing: 9.4%). Of the responders to undergo HPV self-sampling, 11.7% had a positive result and were referred to cytology triage. Moreover, CIN2 and CIN3 detection rates were 1.7% and 0.9%, respectively, in the HPV self-sampling group, and 1.0% and 0.8%, respectively, in the cytology group, showing no statistically significant differences. In those who underwent cytology triage following an HPV positive test, CIN2 and CIN3 detection rates were 23.8% and 11.9%, respectively, which was significantly higher than those who only underwent cytology alone.Conclusion HPV self-sampling followed by cytology triage is highly effective at detecting high grade disease in non-attenders. Thus, multi-municipality-based studies to standardize processes involving this method are warranted. Furthermore, HPV self-sampling could be a promising method for inviting non-attenders who have difficulty undergoing cervical screening in the COVID-19 pandemic era.","output":"[A feasibility study on cervical screening in non-attenders invited to undergo HPV self-sampling with cytology triage versus repeat invitation for cytology screening in Hokkaido]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) course may be affected by environmental factors. Ecological studies previously suggested a link between climatological factors and COVID-19 fatality rates. However, individual-level impact of these factors has not been thoroughly evaluated yet. AIM: To study the association of climatological factors related to patient location with unfavorable outcomes in patients. METHODS: In this observational analysis of the Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study: COVID-19 Registry cohort, the latitudes and altitudes of hospitals were examined as a covariate for mortality within 28 d of admission and the length of hospital stay. Adjusting for baseline parameters and admission date, multivariable regression modeling was utilized. Generalized estimating equations were used to fit the models. RESULTS: Twenty-two thousand one hundred eight patients from over 20 countries were evaluated. The median age was 62 (interquartile range: 49-74) years, and 54% of the included patients were males. The median age increased with increasing latitude as well as the frequency of comorbidities. Contrarily, the percentage of comorbidities was lower in elevated altitudes. Mortality within 28 d of hospital admission was found to be 25%. The median hospital-free days among all included patients was 20 d. Despite the significant linear relationship between mortality and hospital-free days (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.39 (1.04, 1.86), P = 0.025 for mortality within 28 d of admission; aOR = -1.47 (-2.60, -0.33), P = 0.011 for hospital-free days), suggesting that adverse patient outcomes were more common in locations further away from the Equator; the results were no longer significant when adjusted for baseline differences (aOR = 1.32 (1.00, 1.74), P = 0.051 for 28-day mortality; aOR = -1.07 (-2.13, -0.01), P = 0.050 for hospital-free days). When we looked at the altitudes effect, we discovered that it demonstrated a non-linear association with mortality within 28 d of hospital admission (aOR = 0.96 (0.62, 1.47), 1.04 (0.92, 1.19), 0.49 (0.22, 0.90), and 0.51 (0.27, 0.98), for the altitude points of 75 MASL, 125 MASL, 400 MASL, and 600 MASL, in comparison to the reference altitude of 148 m.a.s.l, respectively. P = 0.001). We detected an association between latitude and 28-day mortality as well as hospital-free days in this worldwide study. When the baseline features were taken into account, however, this did not stay significant. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that differences observed in previous epidemiological studies may be due to ecological fallacy rather than implying a causal relationship at the patient level.","output":"Association of latitude and altitude with adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19: The VIRUS registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Lockdowns have been implemented by countries to slow down SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

METHODS: All paediatric outpatients and inpatients seen in our hospital following an orthopaedic-related traumatic injury from the 8-week lockdown and 8 weeks post-lockdown were evaluated. Cases for matched periods in 2019 were identified retrospectively for baseline comparison. Patient demographics, venue of injury, anatomic location of injury, caregiver supervision and location of procedures performed in the hospital were assessed. RESULTS: 968 and 2810 injuries were observed in 2020 and 2019, respectively. While the proportion of injuries sustained by pre-schoolers and toddlers increased, those sustained by primary and secondary school children decreased in 2020 (p < 0.001). Majority of the injuries during the lockdown were sustained at home compared to schools or public recreational facilities (p < 0.001). Hand (26.2%) and elbow (20.8%) injuries were the most common during the lockdown. The proportion of procedures performed in the Children's Emergency during the lockdown was more than twice that of the same period in 2019 (p < 0.001).

We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic would be associated with increased anxiety and decreased sleep quality, with stronger associations in women. METHODS: One hundred three participants (61 female, 38  1 years) reported perceived changes in anxiety and sleep quality due to stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic and were administered the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Chi-square and T test analyses were utilized to assess sex differences in reported anxiety and sleep. Analysis of covariance was used to compare the associations between reported impact of COVID-19 and anxiety/sleep parameters. RESULTS: Women (80.3%) reported higher prevalence of increased general anxiety due to COVID-19 when compared to men (50%; p = 0.001) and elevated STAI state anxiety compared to men (43  1 vs. 38  1 a.u., p = 0.007). Despite these differences in anxiety, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on PSQI was not different between sexes. However, when stratified by perceived changes in anxiety due to COVID-19, participants with higher anxiety responses to COVID-19 had higher ISI compared to those with no perceived changes in anxiety (9  1 vs. 5  1 a.u., p = 0.003).

A 16S rRNA sequencing approach was employed to profile changes in bacterial community composition, within amoebic gill disease (AGD)-affected and non-affected gill tissue. The bacterial diversity of biopsies with and without diseased tissue was significantly lower in the AGD-affected fish compared to uninfected fish. Furthermore, within the AGD-affected tissue, lesions appeared to contain a significantly higher abundance of the Flavobacterium, Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi compared to adjunct unaffected tissues. Quantitative PCR specific to both N. perurans and T. dicentrarchi was used to further examine the co-abundance of these known fish pathogens. A moderate positive correlation between these pathogens was observed. Taken together, the present study sheds new light on the complex interaction between the host, parasite and bacterial communities during AGD progression.

Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine presents an attractive approach to achieve satisfactory outcomes; however, tumor antigen screening and vaccination candidates show a bottleneck in this field. We aimed to investigate the tumor antigens for mRNA vaccine development and immune subtypes for choosing appropriate patients for vaccination. We identified eight overexpressed and mutated tumor antigens with poor prognostic value of PRAD, including KLHL17, CPT1B, IQGAP3, LIME1, YJEFN3, KIAA1529, MSH5 and CELSR3. The correlation of those genes with antigen-presenting immune cells were assessed. We further identified three immune subtypes of PRAD (PRAD immune subtype [PIS] 1C3) with distinct clinical, molecular, and cellular characteristics. PIS1 showed better survival and immune cell infiltration, nevertheless, PIS2 and PIS3 showed cold tumor features with poorer prognosis and higher tumor genomic instability. Moreover, these immune subtypes presented distinguished association with immune checkpoints, immunogenic cell death modulators, and prognostic factors of PRAD. Furthermore, immune landscape characterization unraveled the immune heterogeneity among patients with PRAD.

One area that rose to this, with quick introduction of online sessions, was the Balint Group. We aimed to take a snapshot of the effect virtual Balint sessions have had and analyse the themes that members of virtual Balint groups have been identifying about their online group experience at this particularly challenging time for healthcare workers. We hope this will inform both leaders and participants of future online groups of the benefits and pitfalls found by these members reflecting on their first experiences of virtual Balint. Method Seven members of virtual Balint groups across the UK were randomly selected for interview from a pool of volunteers facilitated by the UK Balint Society after the first 6 months of their first virtual Balint experience. Interviews were conducted by two academic foundation doctors who were not members of the Balint groups. Qualitative thematic analysis was then conducted on these interview transcripts. Going forward, as Balint groups continue online, the researchers plan to interview further group members and leaders to look for change and development in the primary themes identified. Result Key positive themes identified when discussing virtual Balint were ease of access, increased anonymity, attention to facial expressions and interaction with participants from different parts of the country. The most common drawback themes were a lack of socialising and different group dynamic as well as the expected technical and environmental challenges. Interestingly all participants reported that silence and sitting/stepping back were still used in their online sessions. Core theme analysis indicates the virtual Balint descriptions draw out sentiments of safe, open and structured sessions. In these early sessions a frequent theme was the increased role of the leader. Conclusion All participants interviewed so far have felt their online experiences have had many positive aspects. They highlight areas they feel virtual Balint could develop to better replicate the original sessions. The fact some interviewees would prefer to maintain online Balint groups even when in person options resume makes it likely this will not be a transient rise in virtual Balint and that the style may be here to stay. Based on this, the role for feedback and constant evaluation and improvement will be central to virtual Balint evolution.","output":"Evaluating participant experience in Balint online sessions held during the COVID-19 pandemic C lessons learnt and moving forward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While protective measures in response to infectious diseases may reduce the freedom of tourists (regarding their behaviors), few studies have documented the effects of destination protective measures on the self-protective behaviors of tourists.

One of the most peculiar features of the COVID-19 pandemic is that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 respiratory infections disproportionately impact patients with hypertension, diabetes, and other cardiovascular comorbidities rather than those with allergic respiratory diseases and immune-compromised conditions. Migraine is a complex neuro-vasculo-inflammatory disorder that is also packed frequently with certain medical conditions including vascular disorders, hypertension, allergic diseases such as asthma and systemic inflammatory disorders. Accordingly, 2 different questions arise during the pandemic: (1) Do share comorbidities of cardiovascular diseases and hypertension increase the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 for migraine patients? (2) Do comorbid allergic and atopic diseases, including asthma act as opposite influencers alongside with female gender? This paper focuses on the co-existence of comorbidities of COVID-19, in comparison with migraine, based on a wide clinical dataset and available reports. Discussed mechanisms include potential strategic roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, angiotensin-II, and nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome, playing remarkable parts in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and migraine.

Saliency maps are one of the most widely-used local explanation tools to alleviate this problem. One of the primary approaches for generating saliency maps is by optimizing a mask over the input dimensions so that the output of the network is influenced the most by the masking. However, prior work only studies such influence by removing evidence from the input. In this paper, we present iGOS++, a framework to generate saliency maps that are optimized for altering the output of the black-box system by either removing or preserving only a small fraction of the input. Additionally, we propose to add a bilateral total variation term to the optimization that improves the continuity of the saliency map especially under high resolution and with thin object parts. The evaluation results from comparing iGOS++ against state-of-the-art saliency map methods show significant improvement in locating salient regions that are directly interpretable by humans.

The change of crackles during the course of the disease shall be investigated in a follow-up study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Crackles were recorded overnight from 22:00 to 06:00 h in 30 children with radiographically confirmed pneumonia. The data for a total of 28 800 recorded 30-s epochs were audiovisually analysed for fine and coarse crackles. RESULTS: Fine crackles and coarse crackles were recognised in every patient with pneumonia, but the number of epochs with and without crackles varied widely among the different patients: fine crackles were detected in 4022% (meansd), coarse crackles in 7620%. The predominant localisation of crackles as recorded during overnight monitoring was in accordance with the radiographic infiltrates and the classical auscultation in most patients. The distribution of crackles was fairly equal throughout the night. However, there were time periods without any crackle in the single patients so that the diagnosis of pneumonia might be missed at sporadic auscultation.

It is controversial as to whether the same treatment strategy can be applied for patients who develop recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. To investigate this issue, we compared the outcomes of patients who developed recurrences after treatment with or without adjuvant chemotherapy using the results of the Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial of S-1 for Gastric Cancer (ACTS-GC). METHODS Patients who had confirmed recurrence in the ACTS-GC trial were analyzed. We defined 2 independent cohorts. Cohort 1 patients were divided by whether they received adjuvant chemotherapy (adjuvant S-1 group and surgery-only group). Cohort 2 patients were divided by whether they received a regimen including S-1 (IS) or not including S-1 (NIS) after recurrence. RESULTS A total of 375 patients experienced recurrence (160 in the adjuvant S-1 group and 215 in the surgery-only group). In cohort 1, the median time from recurrence to death (TFRD) was 11.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-13.9) in the adjuvant S-1 group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.7-13.1) in the surgery-only group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84-1.31). In cohort 2, 292 patients received chemotherapy after recurrence and were divided into the IS (n = 189) or the NIS group (n = 103). The median TFRD was 13.9 months (95% CI, 12.7-15.6) in the IS group and 8.1 months (95% CI, 6.6-9.7) in the NIS group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.45-0.76), and there was no significant interaction between the adjuvant S-1 group and surgery-only group.

We reported on the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children cases to help health workers better understand and provide timely diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Retrospectively, two research centers' case series of 67 consecutive hospitalized cases including 53 adult and 14 children cases with COVID-19 between 23 Jan 2020 and 15 Feb 2020 from Jinan and Rizhao were enrolled in this study. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children and adults were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Most cases in children were mild (21.4%) and conventional cases (78.6%), with mild clinical signs and symptoms, and all cases were of family clusters. Fever (35.7%) and dry cough (21.4%) were described as clinical manifestations in children cases. Dry cough and phlegm were not the most common symptoms in children compared with adults (p = 0.03). In the early stages of the disease, lymphocyte counts did not significantly decline but neutrophils count did in children compared with adults (p = 0.02). There was a lower level of CRP (p = 0.00) in children compared with adults. There were 8 (57.1%) asymptomatic cases and 6 (42.9%) symptomatic cases among the 14 children cases. The age of asymptomatic patients was younger than that of symptomatic patients (p = 0.03). Even among asymptomatic patients, 5 (62.5%) cases had lung injuries including 3 (60%) cases with bilateral involvement, which was not different compared with that of symptomatic cases (p = 0.58, p = 0.74).

Long non-protein-coding RNAs may possess significant cellular functions. Plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1), a long non-coding RNA encoded by the human PVT1 gene, is an oncogene, which can regulate several tumor-related genes. In PCa, the function and mechanism of PVT1 are unclear. NOP2 is being pursued as a prognostic marker for cancer aggressiveness, which promotes mouse fibroblast growth and tumor formation. Essentially, nothing is known about the specific interactions between the PVT1 and NOP2. Methods: 190 pairs of PCa tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected and RNA sequencing was used to identify the differential lncRNAs. Real-time quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) confirmed these results and gene regulatory relationship. Lentiviral vectors were used to alter PVT1 and genes to analyze their effects on PCa progression. Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed to test the metastasis ability. Biofunction of PVT1 and NOP2 were confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Results: In this study, we reported that the long noncoding RNA-PVT1 was upregulated in PCa metastasis tissues and promoted migration of PCa cells in vitro and their metastasis in vivo. High levels of PVT1 significantly downregulated tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRNAs), such as miR-15b-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-143-3p, and miR-627-5p, whose levels in metastasis tissues were low compared to those in non-metastasis tissues. In vitro and in vivo, PVT1 promotes PCa metastasis via targeting miRNAs. Furthermore, the expression level of PVT1 was positively associated with the expression of NOP2, a cancer metastasis-related protein. We demonstrated that NOP2 promoted invasion and migration of PCa. For specific mechanism, correlation analysis showed that PVT1 promoted metastasis by up-regulating NOP2. Conclusion: Taken together, our results show that PVT1 acts as an inducer of PCa metastasis via targeting miRNAs, thereby promoting NOP2. This axis may have diagnostic and therapeutic potential for advanced PCa.","output":"Long Noncoding RNA PVT1 Promotes Prostate Cancer Metastasis by Increasing NOP2 Expression via Targeting Tumor Suppressor MicroRNAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Long-COVID is a postviral illness that can affect survivors of COVID-19, regardless of initial disease severity or age.

This hypothesis can be split into two parts. The first is the brainstem tropism and damage in COVID-19. As the brainstem has a relatively high expression of ACE2 receptor compared with other brain regions, SARS-CoV-2 may exhibit tropism therein. Evidence also exists that neuropilin-1, a co-receptor of SARS-CoV-2, may be expressed in the brainstem. Indeed, autopsy studies have found SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins in the brainstem. The brainstem is also highly prone to damage from pathological immune or vascular activation, which has also been observed in autopsy of COVID-19 cases. The second part concerns functions of the brainstem that overlap with symptoms of long-COVID. The brainstem contains numerous distinct nuclei and subparts that regulate the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and neurological processes, which can be linked to long-COVID. As neurons do not readily regenerate, brainstem dysfunction may be long-lasting and, thus, is long-COVID. Indeed, brainstem dysfunction has been implicated in other similar disorders, such as chronic pain and migraine and myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome.","output":"Persistent Brainstem Dysfunction in Long-COVID: A Hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article describes some of the changes occurring with community in the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Besides its high infectivity, SARS-CoV-2 causes multiple serious derangements, where the most prominent is severe acute respiratory syndrome as well as multiple organ dysfunction including heart and kidney injury. While the deleterious impact of SARS-CoV-2 on pulmonary and cardiac systems have attracted remarkable attention, the adverse effects of this virus on the renal system is still underestimated. Kidney susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is determined by the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor which is used as port of the viral entry into targeted cells, tissue tropism, pathogenicity and subsequent viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry receptor, ACE2, is widely expressed in proximal epithelial cells, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells and podocytes, where it supports kidney integrity and function via the enzymatic production of Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), which exerts vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and diuretic/natriuretic actions via activation of the Mas receptor axis. Loss of this activity constitutes the potential basis for the renal damage that occurs in COVID-19 patients. Indeed, several studies in a small sample of COVID-19 patients revealed relatively high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among them. Although SARS-CoV-1 -induced AKI was attributed to multiorgan failure and cytokine release syndrome, as the virus was not detectable in the renal tissue of infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 antigens were detected in kidney tubules, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infects the human kidney directly, and eventually induces AKI characterized with high morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are largely unknown. However, the fact that ACE2 plays a crucial role against renal injury, the deprivation of the kidney of this advantageous enzyme, along with local viral replication, probably plays a central role. The current review focuses on the critical role of ACE2 in renal physiology, its involvement in the development of kidney injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection, renal manifestations and therapeutic options. The latter includes exogenous administration of Ang (1-7) as an appealing option, given the high incidence of AKI in this ACE2-depleted disorder, and the benefits of ACE2/Ang1-7 including vasodilation, diuresis, natriuresis, attenuation of inflammation, oxidative stress, cell proliferation, apoptosis and coagulation.","output":"Renal Manifestations of Covid-19: Physiology and Pathophysiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a severe epidemic that has put the world in a global crisis.

A deeper understanding of the epidemic suggests that a person's negligence can cause widespread harm that would be difficult to negate. Since no vaccine is yet developed, social distancing must be practiced to detain COVID-19 spread. Therefore, we aim to develop a framework that tracks humans for monitoring the social distancing being practiced. To accomplish this objective of social distance monitoring, an algorithm is developed using object detection method. Here, CNN based object detector is explored to detect human presence. The object detector's output is used for calculating distances between each pair of humans detected. This approach of social distancing algorithm will red mark the persons who are getting closer than a permissible limit.

However, the extent to which non-COVID deaths contributed to excess mortality, its regional characterization, and the association between municipal-and individual-level sociodemographic inequality has not been characterized. METHODSWe conducted a retrospective municipal an individual-level study using death certificate data in Mexico from 2016-2020. We analyzed mortality related to COVID-19 and to non-COVID-19 causes using ICD-10 codes to identify cause-specific mortality. Excess mortality was estimated as the increase in deaths in 2020 compared to the average of 2016-2019, disaggregated by primary cause of death, death setting (in-hospital and out-of-hospital) and geographical location. We evaluated correlates of non-COVID-19 mortality at the individual level using mixed effects logistic regression and correlates of non-COVID-19 excess mortality in 2020 at the municipal level using negative binomial regression. RESULTSWe identified 1,069,174 deaths in 2020 (833.5 per 100,000 inhabitants), which was 49% higher compared to the 2016-2019 average (557.38 per 100,000 inhabitants). Overall excess mortality (276.11 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) was attributable in 76.1% to COVID-19; however, non-COVID-19 causes comprised one-fifth of excess deaths. COVID-19 deaths occurred primarily in-hospital, while excess non-COVID-19 deaths decreased in this setting and increased out-of-hospital. Excess non-COVID-19 mortality displayed geographical heterogeneity linked to sociodemographic inequalities with clustering in states in southern Mexico. Municipal-level predictors of non-COVID-19 excess mortality included levels of social security coverage, higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalization, and social marginalization. At the individual level, lower educational attainment, blue collar workers, and lack of medical care assistance were associated with non-COVID-19 mortality during 2020. CONCLUSIONNon-COVID-19 causes of death, largely chronic cardiometabolic conditions, comprised up to one-fifth of excess deaths in Mexico during 2020. Non-COVID-19 excess deaths occurred disproportionately out-of-hospital and were associated with both individual-and municipal-level sociodemographic inequalities. These findings should prompt an urgent call to action to improve healthcare coverage and access to reduce health and sociodemographic inequalities in Mexico to reduce preventable mortality in situations which increase the stress of healthcare systems, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Sociodemographic inequalities and excess non-COVID-19 mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic: A data-driven analysis of 1,069,174 death certificates in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) referred for lung scintigraphy for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), there has been an ongoing debate within the nuclear medicine community as to whether and when the ventilation study should be performed. Indeed, while PE diagnosis typically relies on the recognition of ventilation/perfusion (V/P) mismatched defects, the ventilation procedure potentially increases the risk of contamination to the healthcare workers. The primary aim of this study was to assess the role of ventilation imaging when performing lung scintigraphy for suspected PE in COVID-19 patients. The secondary aim was to describe practices and imaging findings in this specific population. Methods: A national registry was created in collaboration with the French Society of Nuclear Medicine to collect lung scans performed in COVID-19 patients for suspected PE. Practices of departments were assessed regarding imaging protocols and aerosol precautions. A retrospective review of V/P SPECT/CT scans was then conducted. Two physicians blinded to clinical information reviewed each case by sequentially using P SPECT, P SPECT/CT and V/P SPECT/CT images. Scans were classified in one of the four following categories: patients for whom PE could reasonably be excluded based on 1) perfusion SPECT only, 2) P SPECT/CT, 3) V/P SPECT/CT; or 4) patients with mismatched defects suggestive of PE according to the EANM criteria. Results: Data from 12 French nuclear medicine departments were collected. Lung scans were performed between 03/2020 and 04/2021. Personal protective equipment and dedicated cleaning procedures were used in all departments. Out of the 145 V/Q SPECT/CT included in the central review, PE could be excluded using only P SPECT, P SPECT/CT and V/P SPECT/CT in 27 (19%), 55 (38%) and 45 (31%) patients, respectively. V/P SPECT/CT was positive for PE in 18 (12%) patients, including 12 (67%) with a low burden of PE (10%). Conclusion: In this population of COVID-19 patients assessed with lung scintigraphy, PE could be confidently excluded without ventilation in only 57% of patients.

The aim of this trial is to assess whether the practice of using separate sterile gloves and instruments to close wounds at the end of surgery compared to current routine hospital practice can reduce surgical site infection at 30-days post-surgery for patients undergoing clean-contaminated, contaminated, or dirty abdominal surgery. METHODS: This study protocol describes a pragmatic, international, multi-centre, 2-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial, with an internal pilot. Clusters are defined as hospitals within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) defined by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Official Development Assistance (ODA) list, where there are at least 4 eligible hospitals per country. Hospitals (clusters) must be in LMICs where glove and instrument change are not currently routine practice. Patients (adults and children) undergoing emergency or elective abdominal surgery for a clean-contaminated, contaminated, or dirty operation are eligible for inclusion. Before closing the abdominal wall, surgeons and the scrub nurse will change gloves and use separate, sterile instruments (intervention), versus no changing gloves or using separate, sterile instruments (standard practice, control). The primary outcome is SSI within 30 days after surgery, using the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) criteria. Secondary outcomes are SSI before point of hospital discharge, and readmission, reoperation, length of hospital stay, return to normal activities, and death up to 30-days after surgery. A 12-month internal pilot, including 12 clusters and approximately 600 participants, aims to assess adherence to allocation and follow-up of patients. The main trial is powered to detect a minimum reduction in the primary outcome from 16 to 12%. A total of 12,800 participants will be recruited from 64 clusters (hospitals) each including at least 200 participants. DISCUSSION: Change of gloves and sterile instruments prior to fascial closure in abdominal surgery is a low-cost, simple, intraoperative intervention which involves all members of the surgical and scrub team. If effective at reducing SSI, this practice could be readily implemented across all contexts. The findings of this trial will inform future guideline updates from international healthcare organisations, including the World Health Organization.

The best compliance of the respiratory system, obtained after testing different PEEPs, was similar between the subjects with COVID-19 ARDS and the subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS (mean  SD 38  11 mL/cm H2O vs 37  11 mL/cm H2O, respectively; P = .61). The subjects with COVID-19 ARDS received higher median (interquartile range) PEEP (12 [10-14] cm H2O vs 8 [5-9] cm H2O; P < .001) and lower median (interquartile range) tidal volume (5.8 [5.5-6.3] mL/kg vs 6.6 [6.1-7.3] mL/kg; P < .001) than the subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS, being these differences maintained at multivariable analysis. In the multivariable analysis, the subjects with COVID-19 ARDS showed a lower risk of anamnestic arterial hypertension (odds ratio 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.45; P < .001) and lower neurologic sequential organ failure assessment score (odds ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.09-0.27; P < .001) than the subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect measurements of dead space were higher in subjects with COVID-19 ARDS compared with subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS. The best compliance of the respiratory system was similar in both ARDS forms provided that different PEEPs were applied. A wide range of compliance is present in every ARDS type; therefore, the setting of mechanical ventilation should be individualized patient by patient and not based on the etiology of ARDS.","output":"COVID-19 ARDS Is Characterized by Increased Dead Space Ventilation Compared With Non-COVID ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: It is currently unknown what effect SARS-CoV-2 infection has on the parameters of aseptic inflammation in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the long-term follow-up period and whether there is a relationship between the prolonged inflammatory response and the indicators of the global longitudinal strain, as the earliest marker of systolic dysfunction of left and right ventricles. PURPOSE: To study the dynamics of markers of the inflammatory response and to assess the potential relationship of biomarkers of inflammation with parameters of left and right ventricular systolic function in patients with CVD who underwent COVID-19-associated pneumonia at the reference point 3 months after hospitalization. METHODS: The study included 63 patients (mean age 49.016.0 years) within One-year Cardiac Follow-up of COVID-19 Pneumonia. Group 1 (n=26) included patients without a history of CVD, group 2 (n=37) - patients with CVD. Three months after discharge from the hospital, patients came for a visit, where blood sampling and echocardiography with speckle tracking analysis were performed. RESULTS: At the stage of hospitalization, according to the computed tomography data, there were no differences in the volume of lung lesions in the groups. Patients with CVD had a higher level of highly sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) upon admission to the hospital (group 1 C 33.12 [4.70C45.00] mg/l; group 2 C 47.16 [7.75C76.40] mg/L, p=0.039). Naturally, in the general group after 3 months, the indicators reflecting the inflammatory response significantly decreased: CRP from 26.10 [5.02C57.5] mg/L to 1.86 [0.76C3.43] mg/L, p<0.001; neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), from 2.05 [1.08C2.94] to 1.54 [1.27C1.90], p=0.009; coefficient of large platelets, MSD from 34.306.74 to 23.606.59, p<0.001. There were no differences between the groups in the dynamics of inflammation biomarkers. In group 1, there were no laboratory biomarkers associated with the parameters of myocardial systolic function. In group 2 negative relationship was recorded between the global longitudinal strain of the left ventricle and the CRP level c (r=?0.388; p=0.037) and with the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (r=?0.383; p=0.040); endocardial global longitudinal strain of the right ventricle with CRP level (r=?0.386; p=0.039). CONCLUSIONS: In patients who underwent COVID-19-associated pneumonia, after 3 months, the dynamics of laboratory markers of the inflammatory response did not depend on the presence of concomitant cardiac pathology, but only in patients with CVD there was a negative relationship between indicators of systolic function of the left and right ventricles and biomarkers of the inflammatory response.

METHODS: We conducted individual telephone interviews with patients with gynecological cancer 1C4 days after a telephone or video consultation during the COVID-19 outbreak in April and May 2020. We applied Braun and Clarkes thematic analysis to analyze the qualitative data. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with ovarian (50%), cervical (35%), vulvar (12%), and vaginal cancer (3%) participated in the study. The patients experienced that, combined, cancer and COVID-19 restrictions made their situation twice as challenging. In general, the patients valued face-to-face consultations, recommending that they were ideal for the initial appointment to build trust. Overall, there was a willingness to participate in digital consultations because of the restrictions, but the results also showed varying degrees of openness and that individual solutions were favored. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show that digital consultations were an accepted alternative during COVID-19. Even though this temporary solution was deemed to be beneficial for practical reasons, patients also experienced digital consultations to be impersonal. A key message is that faceCtoCface encounters create the foundation to establish a trusting relationship from where a valuable dialogue arises. Digital consultations should therefore be implemented with caution since no one-size-fits-all model is recommended.

There is currently no fully effective treatment for cryptosporidiosis, which has stimulated interest in anticryptosporidial development over the last 10 years with numerous lead compounds identified including several tRNA synthetase inhibitors. In this study, we report the results of a dairy calf efficacy trial of the methionyl-tRNA (CpMetRS) synthetase inhibitor 2093 and the spontaneous emergence of drug resistance. Dairy calves experimentally infected with Cryptosporidium parvum initially improved with 2093 treatment, but parasite shedding resumed in two of three calves on treatment day five. Parasites shed by each recrudescent calf had different amino acid altering CpMetRS mutations, coding either an aspartate 243 to glutamate (D243E) or a threonine 246 to isoleucine (T246I) mutation. Transgenic parasites engineered to have either the D243E or T246I CpMetRS mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 grew normally but were highly 2093 resistant; the D243E and T246I mutant expressing parasites respectively had 2093 EC50S of 613- or 128-fold that of transgenic parasites with wild-type CpMetRS. In studies using recombinant enzymes, the D243E and T246I mutations shifted the 2093 IC50 by >170-fold. Structural modeling of CpMetRS based on an inhibitor-bound Trypanosoma brucei MetRS crystal structure suggested that the resistance mutations reposition nearby hydrophobic residues, interfering with compound binding while minimally impacting substrate binding. This is the first report of naturally emerging Cryptosporidium drug resistance, highlighting the need to address the potential for anticryptosporidial resistance and establish strategies to limit its occurrence. Importance Cryptosporidium is a leading protozoan cause of diarrhea in young children with no reliable treatment. We report results of a dairy calf drug efficacy trial and the spontaneous emergence of drug resistance. Cryptosporidium parvum infected calves initially improved with drug treatment, but infection relapsed in two animals. Parasites shed by each recrudescent calf had mutations in the gene encoding the drug target that altered its amino acid sequence. Recapitulation of the drug target mutations by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing resulted in highly drug-resistant parasites, and recombinant mutant enzymes were resistant to inhibition. This is the first report of naturally emerging Cryptosporidium drug resistance. There is a currently a great opportunity to impact public health with new drugs to treat cryptosporidiosis, and this report highlights the need to address the potential for anticryptosporidial resistance and establish strategies to limit its occurrence in order to realize their full potential.

This pandemic compelled countries to enforce a socio-economic lockdown to prevent its widespread. This paper focuses on how the particulate matter pollution was reduced during the lockdown period (23 March to April 15, 2020) as compared to before lockdown. Both ground-based and satellite observations were used to identify the improvement in air quality of Pakistan with primary focus on four major cities of Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Peshawar. Both datasets have shown a substantial reduction in PM2.5 pollution levels (ranging from 13% to 33% in case of satellite observations, while 23%-58% in ground-based observations) across Pakistan. Result shows a higher rate of COVID-19 spread in major cities of Pakistan with poor air quality conditions. Yet more research is needed in order to establish linkage between COVID-19 spread and air pollution. However, it can be partially attributed to both higher rate of population density and frequent exposure of population to enhanced levels of PM2.5 concentrations before lockdown period.","output":"Exploring the linkage between PM2.5 levels and COVID-19 spread and its implications for socio-economic circles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Despite inpatient rehabilitation, many older adults post-hip fracture have difficulty returning to their prefracture levels of function and activity. This scoping review aims to identify interventions for community-dwelling older adults discharged from inpatient rehabilitation and examine the function and activity outcomes associated with these interventions. DESIGN This scoping review followed Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework. DATA SOURCES We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE and Ageline electronic databases for English-language articles published between January 1946 and January 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA We included studies with health and social interventions involving community-dwelling older adults and their caregivers after hip fracture and inpatient rehabilitation. The interventions were selected if initiated within 60 days post-hip fracture surgery. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and full texts and extracted the data based on the inclusion criteria. A third reviewer adjudicated any disagreement and collated the extracted data. RESULTS Of the 24 studies included in the review, most studies (79%) used exercise-based interventions, over half (63%) included activities of daily living training and/or home assessment and environment modification as intervention components, and three studies used social intervention components. Over half of the interventions (58%) were initiated in the inpatient setting and physiotherapists provided 83% of the interventions. Only seven studies (29%) involved tailored interventions based on the older adults' unique needs and progress in exercise training. Six studies (25%) enrolled patients with cognitive impairment, and only one study examined caregiver-related outcomes. Exercise-based interventions led to improved function and activity outcomes. 29 different outcome measures were reported. CONCLUSION While exercise-based multicomponent interventions have evidence for improving outcomes in this population, there is a paucity of studies, including social interventions. Further, studies with standardised outcome measures are needed, particularly focusing on supporting caregivers and the recovery of older adults with cognitive impairment.","output":"Health and social interventions to restore physical function of older adults post-hip fracture: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This pandemic has led to an emphasis on containment and treatment, even at great expense to many economies, and to the development of a vaccine.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine and compare the mucosal and systemic responses of recipients of two different vaccination platforms: mRNA (Comirnaty) and inactivated virus (CoronaVac). METHODS: Serial blood and nasal epithelial lining fluid (NELF) samples were collected from the recipients of either Comirnaty or CoronaVac. The plasma and NELF immunoglobulins A and G (IgA and IgG) specific to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (S1) and their neutralization effects were quantified. RESULTS: Comirnaty induced nasal S1-specific immunoglobulin responses, which were evident as early as 14  2 days after the first dose. In 64% of the subjects, the neutralizing effects of NELF persisted for at least 50 days. Moreover, 85% of Comirnaty recipients exhibited S1-specific IgA and IgG responses in plasma by 14  2 days after the first dose. By 7  2 days after the booster, all plasma samples possessed S1-specific IgA and IgG responses and were neutralizing. The induction of S1-specific plasma antibodies by CoronaVac was IgG dominant, and 83% of the subjects possessed S1-specific IgG by 7  2 days after the booster, with neutralizing effects. CONCLUSION: Comirnaty induces S1-specific IgA and IgG responses with neutralizing activity in the nasal mucosa; a similar response is not seen with CoronaVac.

The three components are (a) nearly simultaneous self-testing for the pathogen by an entire population, followed rapidly by (b) nearly simultaneous self-isolation of carriers, and (c) secondary screening at entrances to facilities where people congregate. After a period of preparation lasting roughly 5C10 weeks, these steps could and probably should be taken in a single day. The power of this methodology has already been demonstrated in varying degrees with groups ranging in size from 1,000 to 11 million. Although this plan might seem daunting, its costs are minimal compared to the losses we have incurred by relying on half measures, and the US and other countries have the technological, logistical, and industrial capacities to implement this plan in a matter of weeks.

A SIRD/CSP model suggests that the single-day testing and separation procedure will substantially lower the number of infections, even if compliance with the procedure is modest. Modeling also suggests that when long-term secondary screening is added to the 1-day procedure, over time, the pathogen is eradicated from the population.

However, the present efforts are focused on computational vaccination technique for evaluating candidates to design multi-epitope-based vaccine against pathogenic mechanism of novel SARS-COV-2. Based on recent published evidence, we recognized spike glycoprotein and envelope small membrane protein are the potential targets to combat the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, in the present study we identified epitope of both B and T cell associated with these proteins. Extremely antigenic, conserve, immunogenic and nontoxic epitope of B and T cell of Spike protein are WPWYVWLGFI, SRVKNLNSSEGVPDLLV whereas the CWCARPTCIK and YCCNIVNVSL are associated with envelope small membrane protein were selected as potential candidate for vaccine designing.

METHODS We analyzed data from practices enrolled in RISE between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017. Eight quality measures in the areas of RA disease management, cardiovascular risk reduction, and patient safety were examined. Variability in performance was evaluated at the practice level. Multivariate linear models were used to predict change in measure performance by year and determine the effect of practice characteristics on change in performance over time. RESULTS Data from 59,986 patients from 54 practices was examined. Mean age was 6214 years, 77% were female, 69% were Caucasian, and most patients were seen in a single-specialty group practice (46%). Average performance on measures related to RA treatments was consistently high (>90%) across the study period. Measures related to RA functional status and disease activity assessment had the greatest improvements over time (8.4% and 13.0% increase per year, respectively; p<0.001). Single-specialty group practices had the fastest rates of improvement over time across all measures. CONCLUSIONS Among practices participating in RISE between 2015 to 2017, performance on most RA quality measures improved. Single specialty group practices saw the fastest rates of improvement over time. Identification of workflow patterns leading to dramatic improvements in quality of care will help guide process redesign to address gaps in priority areas, such as TB screening and blood pressure control.","output":"Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) Practices See Significant Gains in Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality Measures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved catabolic process devoted to the removal of unnecessary and harmful cellular components. In its general form, autophagy governs cellular lifecycle through the formation of double membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, that enwrap and deliver unwanted intracellular components to lysosomes. In addition to this omniscient role, forms of selective autophagy, relying on specialized receptors for cargo recognition, exert fine-tuned control over cellular homeostasis. In this regard, xenophagy plays a pivotal role in restricting the replication of intracellular pathogens, thus acting as an ancient innate defense system against infections. Recently, selective autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), more simply ER-phagy, has been uncovered as a critical mechanism governing ER network shape and function. Six ER-resident proteins have been characterized as ER-phagy receptors and their orchestrated function enables ER homeostasis and turnover overtime. Unfortunately, ER is also the preferred site for viral replication and several viruses hijack ER machinery for their needs. Thus, it is not surprising that some ER-phagy receptors can act to counteract viral replication and minimize the spread of infection throughout the organism. On the other hand, evolutionary pressure has armed pathogens with strategies to evade and subvert xenophagy and ER-phagy. Although ER-phagy biology is still in its infancy, the present review aims to summarize recent ER-phagy literature, with a special focus on its role in counteracting viral infections. Moreover, we aim to offer some hints for future targeted approaches to counteract host-pathogen interactions by modulating xenophagy and ER-phagy pathways.","output":"Eating the unknown: Xenophagy and ER-phagy are cytoprotective defenses against pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) is on a global scale and that wearing a face mask at work is the only effective way to avoid becoming infected with the virus. The pandemic made governments worldwide stay under lock-downs to prevent virus transmissions. Reports show that wearing face masks would reduce the risk of transmission. With the rise in population in cities, there is a greater need for efficient city management in today's world for reducing the impact of COVID-19 disease. For smart cities to prosper, significant improvements to occur in public transportation, roads, businesses, houses, city streets, and other facets of city life will have to be developed. The current public bus transportation system, such as it is, should be expanded with artificial intelligence. The autonomous mask detection and alert system are needed to find whether the person is wearing a face mask or not. This article presents a novel IoT-based face mask detection system in public transportation, especially buses. This system would collect real-time data via facial recognition. The main objective of the paper is to detect the presence of face masks in real-time video stream by utilizing deep learning, machine learning, and image processing techniques. To achieve this objective, a hybrid deep and machine learning model was designed and implemented. The model was evaluated using a new dataset in addition to public datasets. The results showed that the transformation of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) classifier has better performance over the Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier;it has almost complete face-identification capabilities with respect to people's presence in the case where they are wearing masks, with an error rate of only 1.1%. Overall, compared with the standard models, AlexNet, Mobinet, and You Only Look Once (YOLO), the proposed model showed a better performance. Moreover, the experiments showed that the proposed model can detect faces and masks accurately with low inference time and memory, thus meeting the IoT limited resources.","output":"Automatic Face Mask Detection System in Public Transportation in Smart Cities Using IoT and Deep Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationally designed protein subunit vaccines are being developed for a variety of viruses including influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. These vaccines are based on stabilized versions of the primary targets of neutralizing antibodies on the viral surface, namely viral fusion glycoproteins. While these immunogens display the epitopes of potent neutralizing antibodies, they also present epitopes recognized by non or weakly neutralizing (off-target) antibodies. Using our recently developed electron microscopy epitope mapping approach, we have uncovered a phenomenon wherein off-target antibodies elicited by HIV trimer subunit vaccines cause the otherwise highly stabilized trimeric proteins to degrade into cognate protomers. Further, we show that these protomers expose an expanded suite of off-target epitopes, normally occluded inside the prefusion conformation of trimer, that subsequently elicit further off-target antibody responses. Our study provides critical insights for further improvement of HIV subunit trimer vaccines for future rounds of the iterative vaccine design process.","output":"Disassembly of HIV envelope glycoprotein trimer immunogens is driven by antibodies elicited via immunization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is one of the most important viral infections and is caused by Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus (CCHFV). Severity of CCHF can vary from a mild and nonspecific illness, to a severe disease with fatal outcomes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have increasing impact on the different pathways of viral infections. Within the transition process from acute phase to convalescence with 18 CCHF patients, we investigated the impacts on miRNA via microarray for the first time. We also compared miRNA gene expression within 16 severe and 15 mild cases. We identified Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) pathways associated with significant miRNAs utilizing DIANA TOOLS mirPath v.3. In this study miR-15b-5p and miR-29a-3p were significantly downregulated in statistical terms; miR-4741, miR-937-5p, miR-6068, miR-7110-5p miR-6126 and miR-7107-5p were upregulated in acute cases in comparison with convalescent patients (p0.05). 28 miRNAs (8 downregulated, 20 upregulated) were differentially expressed in severe CCHF patients compared with mild cases (p0.05). While miR-6732-3p, miR-4436b-5p, miR-483-3p, miR-6807-5p had the highest downregulation; miR-532-5p, miR-142-5p, miR-29c-3p and let-7f-5p had the highest upregulation in severe patients in comparison with mild cases. Consequently, we determined that CCHF induced miRNAs are associated with antiviral and proinflammatory pathways in acute and severe cases.

It is found that as of 8 February 2021, Korea has recorded 15.8 patients per 10,000 people, and this is used to calculate ratio to compare with other countries. On average, the number of Coronavirus patients in the world is 136.2 that is 8.6 times more than in Korea. The number of Covid-19 patients recorded in Korea is relatively smaller than other countries. There was no clear evidence on the atmospheric transport of Coronaviruses over 1 km to cause infection to other people. The infection of Coronaviruses appeared to occur mainly by close contact with an infected person or by airborne droplets in confined indoor environments, as noted earlier (Lancet, Respir Med 8(12):1159, 2020). To reduce the transmission of Coronavirus and related infections, the wearing of a pollution filter (mask) covering the nose and mouth is mandatory for Coronavirus patients. For the general public, however, we have invented a filter which covers only the nose. When there is no need for conversation and deep breathing, the nose band would be sufficient to filter out Coronavirus and air pollutants. Meanwhile, air and sea port activities including ground transport continued and strict policy on people mingle was not tightly enforced, and control measures to reduce infection were not so effective. However, it is believed that consuming fermented Korean spicy Kimchee and hot peppery soup plus warm rice tea helps in washing Coronaviruses around the throat deep down to the stomach. We find that cleansing the mouth and throat deeply including pathway is better than doing shallow gargling. A possible mechanism for cleansing the mouth and throat of Coronaviruses is here explored.

Emerging evidences indicate that MCM2-7 (MCMs) are highly expressed in tissues from various malignant tumors. However, little is known about the clinical values of MCMs in breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS In our study, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was performed to investigate expression patterns, potential functions, and prognostic values of MCMs in breast cancer, through ONCOMINE, bc-GenExMiner v4.1, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, cBioPortal and GeneMANIA databases. RESULTS We found that mRNA levels of MCMs were significantly elevated in breast cancer, especially in fast-growing and spreading tumor subtypes. These over-expressed MCMs predicted worse prognosis for breast cancer patients with shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival. Among these six factors, high expression of MCM2/4/5/7 significantly reduced the RFS for patients with Luminal-A or B breast cancer and elevated MCM6/7 indicated shorter RFS for patients with basal-like or HER2-positive breast cancer. We also found that genomic alteration of MCMs was frequently found in breast cancer and the most common alteration was mRNA upregulation and amplification. Furthermore, MCMs were highly correlated with CDC45, CDC7, TIMELESS, ORC6, MCM10, ORC5, ORC4 and ORC3, mainly functioning to control the DNA replication initiation and genome stability. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that MCMs are attractive prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer.

Providers of pre-service education have made pragmatic adaptations to course provision, including adopting the practice of remote visits to schools to assess pre-service teachers during practicum and to meet and discuss the pre-service teachers practice with school-based mentors. Taking the form of a case study, this paper explores the views of University Tutors in relation to the impact of the use of remote school visits on the training experience. Seven University Tutors from a university in the North West of England delivering a Secondary Postgraduate Certificate in Education Course with Qualified Teacher Status responded to the invitation to participate. The data, gathered from written statements from participants, highlights that changing practices have seen increased opportunities for developing pre-service teachers autonomy and reflective practice and opportunities for University Tutors to see mentors more frequently, and build relationships. There is evidence of shifts in agency that may have the possibility of enriching pre-service teachers experiences and facilitating opportunities for reflective practice and critical discussions. However, whilst the paper reports that shifts in agency within the training triad has the potential to be liberating, it also reports potential concerns with regard to equality within the training and assessment process. In accessing University Tutor voices about matters that involve them, this paper draws attention to both the challenges and opportunities faced by providers of pre-service education in the absence of accessing school settings.

We examined the relationship between DRD2/3 levels and both alcohol craving and alcohol motivation/wanting, using a cue reactivity procedure and an intravenous alcohol self-administration (IVASA) paradigm, respectively. [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO binding levels in AUD subjects were significantly lower than binding in HCs when looking at all DRD2/3 ROIs jointly (Wilks  = .58, F(6,28) =3.33, p = 0.013, (2)(p) = 0.42), however there were no region-specific differences. Binding values demonstrate ?12.3% and ?16.1% lower [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the SMST and SN respectively, though these differences did not withstand Bonferroni corrections. There was a positive association between [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the SN (almost exclusively reflective of DRD3) and alpha (lower values reflect higher alcohol demand) in the APT after Bonferroni corrections (r = 0.66, p = 0.0080). This demonstrates that AUD subjects with lower DRD3 levels in the SN exhibit increased demand for alcohol. These results replicate previous findings demonstrating reduced DRD2/3 levels while also supporting a lack of DRD3 upregulation and potential downregulation in early abstinent AUD. Furthermore, the finding that binding in the SN is associated with alcohol demand warrants further examination.","output":"Exploring regulation and function of dopamine D3 receptors in alcohol use disorder.

However, there are few studies on depression in older adults and the few existing results may be contradictory, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to determine the factors associated with depression in older adults in two coastal regions of Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : This study uses an analytical cross-sectional design in a population of older adults, who participated in a non-governmental ambulatory social support program in Callao and Ica, two coastal regions of Peru. We administered an on-site structured questionnaire to record sociodemographic data, the Geriatric Depression Scale by Yesavage to measure depression, and the Barthel Index to assess physical function. In order to determine cognitive impairment as an exclusion criterion, the MEC-30 was used. The association between variables was assessed through contingency tables, using the odds ratio (OR) with its corresponding confidence interval (95% CI) and the X2 test. Finally, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: : Out of the 244 older adults surveyed, 39% had depressive symptoms, of which 28.3% (n=69) and 10.7% (n=26) were moderately and severely depressive, respectively. The findings significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms were being 76 years old or older [p=0.005, OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.29-4.20], not participating in weekly recreational activities [p=0.004, OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.31-3.99] and the presence of comorbidities [p=0.026, OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.07-3.29]. Conclusion: There are few studies exploring depression in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic;this research shows the importance of mental health care in this population and, particularly, of those who are 76 or older because they suffer from comorbid conditions and have interrupted recreational activities.","output":"Factors related to depression in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in two coastal regions of Peru: An analytical cross-sectional study (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other SARS-related CoVs encode 3 tandem macrodomains within non-structural protein 3 (nsp3). The first macrodomain, Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs, and binds to and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from target proteins. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated anti-viral ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Mac1 is essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating it as a virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 exhibit similar structural folds and all 3 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low M affinities. Importantly, using ADP-ribose detecting binding reagents in both a gel-based assay and novel ELISA assays, we demonstrated de-MARylating activity for all 3 CoV Mac1 proteins, with the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein leading to a more rapid loss of substrate compared to the others. In addition, none of these enzymes could hydrolyze poly-ADP-ribose. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins are MAR-hydrolases with similar functions, indicating that compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad anti-CoV activity.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged into the human population and has led to a worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 that has caused greater than 1.2 million deaths worldwide. With, no currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. All coronaviruses encode for a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes ADP-ribose adducts from proteins in a dynamic post-translational process increasingly recognized as an important factor that regulates viral infection. The macrodomain is essential for CoV pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry and enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose, and describe its ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins. These results are an important first step for the design and testing of potential therapies targeting this unique protein domain.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 conserved macrodomain is a mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No one may be refused emergency medical treatment in South Africa (SA). Yet score-based categorical exclusions used in critical care triage guidelines disproportionately discriminate against older adults, the cognitively and physically impaired, and the disabled. Adults over the age of 60, who make up 9.1% of the SA population, are most likely to present with disabilities and comorbidities at triage. Score-based models, drawn from international precedents, deny these patients admission to an ICU when resources are constrained, such as during influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks. The Critical Care Society of Southern Africa and the South African Medical Association adopted the Clinical Frailty Scale, which progressively withholds admission to ICUs based on age, frailty and comorbidities in a manner that potentially contravenes constitutional and equality prohibitions against unfair discrimination. The legal implications for healthcare providers are extensive, ranging from personal liability to hate speech and crimes against humanity. COVID-19 guidelines and score-based triage protocols must be revised urgently to eliminate unlawful discrimination against legally protected categories of patients in SA, including the disabled and the elderly.

Emergency medical service (EMS) prehospital notification of potential patients with stroke could play an important role in improving the in-hospital medical response and timely treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke. We analyzed the effects of FASTroke, a mobile app that EMS can use to notify hospitals of patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke at the prehospital stage. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke at 5 major hospitals in metropolitan Daegu City, Korea, from February 2020 to January 2021. The clinical conditions and time required for managing patients were compared according to whether the EMS employed FASTroke app and further compared the factors by dividing the patients into subgroups according to the preregistration received by the hospitals when using FASTroke app. RESULTS: Of the 563 patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke, FASTroke was activated for 200; of these, 93 were preregistered. The FASTroke prenotification showed faster door-to-computed-tomography times (19 minutes vs. 25 minutes, P < 0.001), faster door-to-intravenous-thrombolysis times (37 minutes vs. 48 minutes, P < 0.001), and faster door-to-endovascular-thrombectomy times (82 minutes vs. 119 minutes, P < 0.001). The time was further shortened when the preregistration was conducted simultaneously by the receiving hospital. CONCLUSION: The FASTroke app is an easy and useful tool for prenotification as a regional stroke care system in the metropolitan area, leading to reduced transport and acute ischemic stroke management time and more reperfusion treatment. The effect was more significant when the preregistration was performed jointly.","output":"Prehospital Notification Using a Mobile Application Can Improve Regional Stroke Care System in a Metropolitan Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Public adherence to COVID\\\\19\\\\related government guidance varied during the initial lockdown in the UK, but the determinants of public adherence to such guidance are unclear.

Breast density is a well-known risk factor and has the potential to improve accuracy of risk prediction models. In this study we reviewed the impact on model performance of adding breast density to clinical breast cancer risk prediction models. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using a pre-specified search strategy for PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from January 2007 until November 2019. Studies were screened using the Covidence software. Eligible studies developed or modified existing breast cancer risk prediction models applicable to the general population of women by adding breast density to the model. Improvement in discriminatory accuracy was measured as an increase in the Area Under the Curve or concordance statistics. RESULTS: Eleven eligible studies were identified by the search and one by reference check. Four studies modified the Gail model, four modified the Tyrer-Cuzick model, and five studies developed new models. Several methods were used to measure breast density, including visual, semi- and fully automated methods. Eleven studies reported discriminatory accuracy and one study reported calibration. Seven studies found a statistically significantly increased discriminatory accuracy when including density in the model. The increase in AUC ranged 0.03 to 0.14. Four studies did not report on statistical significance, but reported an increased AUC ranging from 0.01 to 0.06.

Proper guidance for and refinement of such methods is continuously required. Here, we report on the educational experience students and academic staff at the neurosurgical department of a German university hospital made with digital teaching modules (DTMs) that were newly developed due to the transition to digital teaching during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and on the insights gained therefrom. Methods: Nine newly created DTMs provided students the option to anonymously evaluate each module by assigning a score from 0 (worst value) to 5 (best value) to it. Access count, evaluation count, average evaluation, number of included (interactive) figures, number of presented cases, number of linked publications, and number of included multiple-choice questions for each DTM were recorded retrospectively. For each DTM, we aimed to correlate access count, evaluation count, and average evaluation with the number of included (interactive) figures, number of presented cases, number of linked publications, and number of included multiple-choice questions. E-mail responses from individual students as to the DTMs were collected. Among students, an anonymous, voluntary online survey regarding the DTMs was conducted. Results: Number of figures and average evaluation per DTM were significantly positively correlated (Spearmans rho = 0.85; p = 0.0037). Number of figures and number of evaluations per DTM were also significantly positively correlated (Spearmans rho = 0.78; p = 0.0137). Responses from individual students indicated that illustrative cases and interactive figures might further increase DTM popularity. Conclusion: As a valuable adjunct in medical student education, DTMs should contain (interactive) figures, illustrative cases, a scoring option, and the option to give individual feedback towards the academic staff.","output":"Lessons Learned from Developing Digital Teaching Modules for Medical Student Education in Neurosurgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emergency general surgery (EGS) has high rates of morbidity, mortality, and readmission. Therefore, it might be expected that an EGS service fields many consultations for postoperative patients. However, with the known overutilization of emergency department visits for nonurgent conditions, we hypothesized most postoperative consults received by an EGS service would be nonurgent and could be appropriately managed as an outpatient. METHODS: We reviewed all EGS consults at a single urban safety net hospital over a 12-month period, screening for patients who had undergone surgery in the previous 12 mo. This included consultations from the emergency room and inpatient setting. Demographics, admission status, procedures performed, and other details were abstracted from the chart and Vizient reports. Consultation questions were categorized and then reviewed by an expert panel to determine if conditions could have been managed as an outpatient. RESULTS: The EGS service received a total of 1112 consults, with 99 (9%) for a postoperative condition. Overall, 85% of postoperative consults were admitted after consultation, 19% underwent surgery and 21% underwent a procedure with gastroenterology or interventional radiology. Expert review classified slightly over one-third (36%) of consults as nonurgent. CONCLUSIONS: Most postoperative consults seen at our urban safety net hospital represent true morbidity that required admission, intervention, or surgery. Despite this high acuity, one-third of postoperative consults could have been managed as an outpatient.

Methods: This is a retrospective study wherein patients, admitted from February 2020 to April 2020 with hyperglycemia, were selected and divided into 2 groups based on presence or absence of C-19. Data include demographics, comorbidities, blood glucose level, serum osmolality, serum bicarbonate, anion gap, acute kidney injury (AKI), serum creatinine, ICU admission, length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Data were analyzed using descriptive study and T-test. Results: 100 patients were included in the C-19 group (CG) and 88 patients were included in the Non C-19 group (NCG). Major comorbidities were similar in both groups including HTN, DM, CKD followed by ESRD. Mean age of patients (years) was 65.68 in CG and 61.17 in NCG. 61% were male in CG and 53.41% were male in NCG. 16% and 9% developed DKA and HHS in CG, and 13.64% and 6.82% developed DKA and HHS in NCG respectively. 15% in CG had combined DKA &amp;HHS and 3.41% had same in NCG. Mean blood glucose level (mg/dl) was 541.6 in CG and 460.0 in NCG (p=0.03). Mean serum osmolality (mOsm/kg) was 335.7 (SD41.01) in CG and 317.1 (SD30.54) in NCG (p=0.01). Mean serum bicarbonate (mEq/L) was 17.73 (SD6.31) in CG and 21.46 (SD5.94) in NCG (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Mean anion gap was 17.93 (SD7.6) in CG and 13.10 (SD7.2) in NCG (p&amp;lt;0.0001). 56% in CG and 37% in NCG developed AKI respectively (p=0.01). Mean serum creatinine (mg/dl) was 4.22 in CG and 1.65 in NCG (p=0.004). 55% of CG were admitted to ICU and 34% of NCG were admitted to ICU (p=0.003). Median LOS (days) in discharged patients was 8 in CG and 5 in NCG (p=0.02). Mortality was 40% in CG and 3.41% in NCG (p&amp;lt;0.0001). 12 patients in CG and 2 patients in NCG developed new-onset diabetes. In the subset of DKA, interestingly, mean age (years) was 61.63 (SD17.73) in CG and 39.67 in NCG (SD13.39) (p=0.001). Conclusion: In our study, patients in the CG carry worse laboratory parameters, unfavorable clinical outcomes and strikingly higher mortality. We discovered increased incidence of new-onset diabetes and elderly DKA in CG.

They have high risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: To assess the estimated clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness associated with strategies for COVID-19 management among adults experiencing sheltered homelessness. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytic model used a simulated cohort of 2258 adults residing in homeless shelters in Boston, Massachusetts. Cohort characteristics and costs were adapted from Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. Disease progression, transmission, and outcomes data were taken from published literature and national databases. Surging, growing, and slowing epidemics (effective reproduction numbers [Re], 2.6, 1.3, and 0.9, respectively) were examined. Costs were from a health care sector perspective, and the time horizon was 4 months, from April to August 2020. Exposures: Daily symptom screening with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of individuals with positive symptom screening results, universal PCR testing every 2 weeks, hospital-based COVID-19 care, alternative care sites (ACSs) for mild or moderate COVID-19, and temporary housing were each compared with no intervention. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative infections and hospital-days, costs to the health care sector (US dollars), and cost-effectiveness, as incremental cost per case of COVID-19 prevented. Results: The simulated population of 2258 sheltered homeless adults had a mean (SD) age of 42.6 (9.04) years. Compared with no intervention, daily symptom screening with ACSs for pending tests or confirmed COVID-19 and mild or moderate disease was associated with 37% fewer infections (1954 vs 1239) and 46% lower costs ($6.10 million vs $3.27 million) at an Re of 2.6, 75% fewer infections (538 vs 137) and 72% lower costs ($1.46 million vs $0.41 million) at an Re of 1.3, and 51% fewer infections (174 vs 85) and 51% lower costs ($0.54 million vs $0.26 million) at an Re of 0.9. Adding PCR testing every 2 weeks was associated with a further decrease in infections; incremental cost per case prevented was $1000 at an Re of 2.6, $27a?000 at an Re of 1.3, and $71a?000 at an Re of 0.9. Temporary housing with PCR every 2 weeks was most effective but substantially more expensive than other options. Compared with no intervention, temporary housing with PCR every 2 weeks was associated with 81% fewer infections (376) and 542% higher costs ($39.12 million) at an Re of 2.6, 82% fewer infections (95) and 2568% higher costs ($38.97 million) at an Re of 1.3, and 59% fewer infections (71) and 7114% higher costs ($38.94 million) at an Re of 0.9. Results were sensitive to cost and sensitivity of PCR and ACS efficacy in preventing transmission. Conclusions and Relevance: In this modeling study of simulated adults living in homeless shelters, daily symptom screening and ACSs were associated with fewer severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and decreased costs compared with no intervention. In a modeled surging epidemic, adding universal PCR testing every 2 weeks was associated with further decrease in SARS-CoV-2 infections at modest incremental cost and should be considered during future surges.","output":"Clinical Outcomes, Costs, and Cost-effectiveness of Strategies for Adults Experiencing Sheltered Homelessness During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Este es el reporte de situacin COVID-19 Colombia No 130 - 27 de agosto de 2020","output":"Reporte de situacion COVID-19 Colombia No. 130: 27 de agosto de 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Pharmacists are among the healthcare professionals involved in the response to COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining essential services.

Logistic regression was performed to identify the risk factors associated with burnout, and 2 test was used to compare the categorical variables training in the COVID-19 area with the confidence in caring for patients with this disease. Results: Concern for the future (77.2.5%), workload (72.7%), scarcity of resources (62.4%), and loss of control over the activity (54.6%) were the main influencing factors on work-related feelings. Pharmacists who had been trained in COVID-19 were the most confident and showed a higher efficacy/outcome rate. Workload appears only as a predictor of high EE, with great impact on those who worked during the 3-month period more than 50 hours per week and on those who worked almost every weekend. The latter with greater predictive power of high EE (p0,001).Conclusions: The new profile-based approach provides an understanding of the burnout experience and distinct relationships with various work-life factors and suggests that each profile reflects a different work-life crisis that would require a unique intervention strategy.

Methods: This was a pilot retrospective cohort study of all ISBCS and DSBCS patients who underwent senior resident-performed cataract surgery from May to September 2020 at a single academic institution. Outcome measures were final corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), final manifest refraction (MRx), intraoperative and postoperative complications rates, total number of visits, and patient satisfaction assessed postoperatively by telephone questionnaire. Results: Twenty-two eyes of 14 patients and 56 eyes of 28 patients underwent senior resident-performed ISBCS and DSBCS, respectively. Final CDVA was 20/25 or better in 21 (95%) ISBCS and 51 (91%) DSBCS eyes (P = 0.670). Deviation of final MRx from target refraction was within 0.50 D in 17 (77%) ISBCS and 47 (84%) DSBCS eyes (P = 0.522). There was no significant difference in intraoperative (P = 1.000) or postoperative (P = 1.000) complications. ISBCS patients averaged 3.5 fewer visits than DSBCS patients (5.9 vs 9.5, P < 0.001). All ISBCS and 20 DSBCS patients (87%) reported they were \\"very satisfied\\" or \\"satisfied\\" with their experience (P = 0.701).

The peptide, Leu-Glu-Asp-Gly-Pro-Lys-Phe-Leu, was shown to be rapidly degraded by peptidases. The half-life of the intact peptide was less than 6 min at 37 C in blood from the three species tested. The main fragments formed from THF-2 were found to be Glu-Asp-Gly-Pro-Lys-Phe-Leu (2C8), Asp-Gly-Pro-Lys-Phe-Leu (3C8) and Glu-Asp-Gly-Pro-Lys (2C6) in human and in rat blood and 2C8 and 2C6 in mouse blood. Analysis of the time course of degradation revealed a sequential removal of single amino acids from the N-terminus (aminopeptidase activities) in a process that was apparently unable to cleave the Gly-Pro bond (positions 4C5 in the peptide) together with an independent cleavage of the Lys-Phe bond (positions 6C7 in the peptide) to release the dipeptide Phe-Leu. This behaviour and the effects of inhibitors showed the involvement of metallo-exopeptidases in the N-terminal digestion and a phosphoramidon-sensitive metallo-endopeptidase in the cleavage of the Lys-Phe bond. The degradation patterns in human blood were modelled in terms of the competing pathways involved approximating to first-order kinetics, and an analytical solution obtained via the method of Laplace Transforms. The half-life of THF degradation in whole rat blood sample was found to be significantly lower than in human or mouse.","output":"Degradation of thymic humoral factor 2 in human, rat and mouse blood: An experimental and theoretical study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several problems associated with the available anti-measles vaccine emphasize the need for a single shot anti-measles vaccine which is efficacious by mucosal route of administration and functional in the presence of anti-measles neutralizing antibodies.

We aimed to evaluate the performance of a deep learning-based computer-aided detection (CAD) system in pneumonia detection in the CXRs of consecutive FN patients and investigated whether CAD could improve radiologists diagnostic performance when used as a second reader. METHODS: CXRs of patients with FN (a body temperature  38.3 C, or a sustained body temperature  38.0 C for an hour; absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm(3)) obtained between January and December 2017 were consecutively included, from a single tertiary referral hospital. Reference standards for the diagnosis of pneumonia were defined by consensus of two thoracic radiologists after reviewing medical records and CXRs. A commercialized, deep learning-based CAD system was retrospectively applied to detect pulmonary infiltrates on CXRs. For comparing performance, five radiologists independently interpreted CXRs initially without the CAD results (radiologist-alone interpretation), followed by the interpretation with CAD. The sensitivities and specificities for detection of pneumonia were compared between radiologist-alone interpretation and interpretation with CAD. The standalone performance of the CAD was also evaluated, using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Moreover, sensitivity and specificity of standalone CAD were compared with those of radiologist-alone interpretation. RESULTS: Among 525 CXRs from 413 patients (52.3% men; median age 59 years), pneumonia was diagnosed in 128 (24.4%) CXRs. In the interpretation with CAD, average sensitivity of radiologists was significantly improved (75.4% to 79.4%, P = 0.003) while their specificity remained similar (75.4% to 76.8%, P = 0.101), compared to radiologist-alone interpretation. The CAD exhibited AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.895, 88.3%, and 68.3%, respectively. The standalone CAD exhibited higher sensitivity (86.6% vs. 75.2%, P < 0.001) and lower specificity (64.8% vs. 75.4%, P < 0.001) compared to radiologist-alone interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with FN, the deep learning-based CAD system exhibited radiologist-level performance in detecting pneumonia on CXRs and enhanced radiologists performance.

The ability to evade, circumvent or subvert the hosts first line of defense, namely the innate immune system, is the key determinant for pathogen virulence, survival, and the establishment of successful infection. Unfortunately, we have only started to unravel the underlying viral mechanisms used to manipulate host innate immune responses. In this review, we gather current knowledge concerning the interplay between these viruses and components of host innate immunity, focusing on type I interferon induction and signaling in particular, and the mechanisms by which virus-encoded gene products antagonize and subvert host innate immune responses. Finally, we provide some perspectives on the advantages gained from a better understanding of host-pathogen interactions. This includes their implications for the future development of PEDV and PDCoV vaccines and how we can further our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying virus pathogenesis, virulence, and host coevolution.","output":"PEDV and PDCoV Pathogenesis: The Interplay Between Host Innate Immune Responses and Porcine Enteric Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 patients often develop severe cardiovascular complications, but it remains unclear if these are caused directly by viral infection or are secondary to a systemic response. Here, we examine the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) and smooth muscle cells (hPSC-SMCs). We find that that SARS-CoV-2 selectively infects hPSC-CMs through the viral receptor ACE2, whereas in hPSC-SMCs there is minimal viral entry or replication. After entry into cardiomyocytes, SARS-CoV-2 is assembled in lysosome-like vesicles and egresses via bulk exocytosis. The viral transcripts become a large fraction of cellular mRNA while host gene expression shifts from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism and upregulates chromatin modification and RNA splicing pathways. Most importantly, viral infection of hPSC-CMs progressively impairs both their electrophysiological and contractile function, and causes widespread cell death.

RESULTS: GSNO released considerable NO in the culture medium of PK-15 cells, and NO was scavenged by its scavenger hemoglobin (Hb) in a dose-dependent manner. NO strongly inhibited PCV2 replication in PK-15 cells, and the antiviral effect was reversed by Hb. An in vivo assay indicated that GSNO treatment reduced the progression of PCV2 infection in mice, evident as reductions in the percentages of PCV2-positive sera and tissue samples and in the viral DNA copies in serum samples. GSNO also improved the growth performance and immune organs (spleens and thymuses) of the PCV2-infected mice to some degree.

The COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in China in December 2019 has spread globally. Understanding its pattern of spread and how it affects the populace helps to guide formulation of strategies at curbing its spread, managing the disease and allocation of limited resources in tackling the pandemic. METHODOLOGY: This is a review article about the epidemiology of the coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19). Various search engines were used to accumulate literature on the topic;these include PubMed, Google scholar, Ajol. RESULTS: As at October 29, 2020, SARS-CoV2 has spread to all continents except the Antarctica. Though a zoonotic disease, human to human transmission has resulted to this pandemic is via direct and indirect contact of droplets with mucosal surfaces. Most severe cases occur among the elderly, males, and people with co-morbid diseases. The average incubation period is 2-10 days. When compared with SARS-CoV (Ro: 2.3-3.7, mortality rate 11%) and MERS-CoV (Ro: 0.8-1.3, mortality rate: 34.3%), SARS-Cov-2 is a highly infective (Ro: as high as 6.5) with low mortality rates (average range mortality rates 1.83- 6.3%).

The current study was designed to investigate the antidiabetic and renoprotective effects of vanillic acid by its various pharmacological activities. Streptozotocin (50 mg/kg)/nicotinamide (110 mg/kg) was used to induce diabetes in rats. Oral administration of vanillic acid once daily for 6 weeks (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) significantly reduced the hyperglycemia, increased liver enzymes and normalized lipid profile that was altered in diabetic rats. Moreover, vanillic acid attenuated the impaired renal function as evidenced by a reduction in serum creatinine, urea, uric acid and urinary microproteinuria levels with a concomitant increase in urinary creatinine clearance in the nephropathic rats. Diabetic rats showed a marked increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and superoxide anion generation (SAG) along with decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) in the renal tissue which was ameliorated in the vanillic acid-treated rats. Histopathologically, vanillic acid treatment was associated with reduced damage with normalized structural changes in renal tissue.

All patients underwent pre- and postoperative medical and professional evaluation by a multidisciplinary team. RESULTS Between the years 2006 and 2011, 32 adolescents underwent LSG in our center (20 females and 12males). Mean age was 16.75 years (range 14-18 years), mean weight was 121.88 kg (83-178 kg), and mean body mass index 43.23 (35-54). Thirty-four comorbid conditions were identified. LSG was the primary bariatric procedure in all the patients. Mean operative time was 60 minutes (range 45-80 min). Tiere were two complications (6.25%): an early staple line leak and a late acute cholecystitis. There were no deaths. Mean percent excess weight loss at 1, 3, 6, 9,12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post-surgery was 27.9%, 41.1%, 62.6%, 79.2%, 81.7%, 71%, 75%, 102.9% and 101.6%, respectively.

Methods: The 'CORONA-MONITORING bundesweit' (RKI-SOEP) study is a seroepidemiological survey among a dynamic cohort of the German adult population (n=15,122; October 2020 to February 2021). Dried blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and oral-nasal swabs for viral RNA. SEP was measured by education and income. Robust logistic regression was used to examine adjusted associations of SARS-CoV-2 infections with SEP. Results: 288 participants were seropositive, PCR-positive, or self-reported a previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

New vaccine candidates are therefore urgently needed. Highly conserved Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homologue-5 (PfRH5) has been identified as a potential candidate for anti-disease vaccine development. PfRH5 is essential for erythrocyte invasion by merozoites and crucial for parasite survival. However, there is paucity of data on the extent of genetic variations on PfRH5 in field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum. This study described genetic polymorphisms at the high affinity binding polypeptides (HABPs) 36718, 36727, 36728 of PfRH5 in Nigerian isolates of P. falciparum. This study tested the hypothesis that only specific conserved B and T cell epitopes on PfRH5 HABPs are crucial for vaccine development. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-five microscopically confirmed P. falciparum samples collected in a prospective cross-sectional study of three different populations in Lagos, Nigeria. Genetic diversity and haplotype construct of Pfrh5 gene were determined using bi-directional sequencing approach. Tajimas D and the ratio of nonsynonymous vs synonymous mutations were utilized to estimate the extent of balancing and directional selection in the pfrh5 gene. RESULTS: Sequence analysis revealed three haplotypes of PfRH5 with negative Tajimas D and dN/dS value of ? 1.717 and 0.011  0.020, respectively. A single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP (G  A) at position 608 was observed, which resulted in a change of the amino acid cysteine at position 203 to tyrosine. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities were 0.318  0.016 and 0.0046  0.0001 while inter-population genetic differentiation ranged from 0.007 to 0.037. Five polypeptide variants were identified, the most frequent being KTKYH with a frequency of 51.3%. One B-cell epitope, 151 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II T-cell epitopes, four intrinsically unstructured regions (IURs) and six MHC class I T-cell epitopes were observed in the study. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences showed clustering and evidence of evolutionary relationship with 3D7, PAS-2 and FCB-2 RH5 sequences. CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed low level of genetic polymorphisms in PfRH5 antigen with B- and T-cell epitopes in intrinsically unstructured regions along the PfRH5 gene in Lagos, Nigeria.

RESULTS We included seven patients with a mean age of 65 years. The parent vessel size ranged from 1.5 to 2.3 mm; mean 1.9 mm. Location of the aneurysms was as follows: two aneurysms centered along the pericallosal artery (one left, one right), one on the right angular artery, one aneurysm at the anterior communicating artery (ACom), one at the ACom-right A2 anterior cerebral artery (ACA), one at the lenticulostriate artery, and one at the A1-A2 ACA artery. Aneurysms ranged from 1 to 12 mm in diameter. All aneurysms were treated with a single Pipeline Embolization Device (PED). No peri- or post-procedural complications or mortality occurred.

Here, we investigated whether anosmia was associated with gray matter volume alterations at a network level, and whether these alterations were related to the olfactory-specific quality of life (QOL) and depressive symptoms. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging was acquired in 22 individuals with postinfectious or idiopathic anosmia (the anosmia group) and 30 age- and sex-matched controls (the control group). Using independent component analysis on the gray matter volumes, we identified 10 morphometric networks. The gray matter volumes of these networks were compared between the two groups. Olfactory-specific QOL and depressive symptoms were assessed by self-report questionnaires and clinician-administered interviews, respectively. The anosmia group showed lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus-amygdala and the precuneus networks, relative to the control group. Lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus-amygdala network were also linearly associated with lower olfactory-specific QOL and higher depressive symptom scores. These findings suggest a close relationship between anosmia and gray matter volume alterations in the emotional brain networks, albeit without determined causal relations.","output":"Gray matter volume reduction in the emotional brain networks in adults with anosmia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disparities in vaccination coverage by social vulnerability, defined as social and structural factors associated with adverse health outcomes, were noted during the first 2.5 months of the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination campaign, which began during mid-December 2020 (1). As vaccine eligibility and availability continue to expand, assuring equitable coverage for disproportionately affected communities remains a priority. CDC examined COVID-19 vaccine administration and 2018 CDC social vulnerability index (SVI) data to ascertain whether inequities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage with respect to county-level SVI have persisted, overall and by urbanicity. Vaccination coverage was defined as the number of persons aged 18 years (adults) who had received 1 dose of any Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 vaccine divided by the total adult population in a specified SVI category.? SVI was examined overall and by its four themes (socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, racial/ethnic minority status and language, and housing type and transportation). Counties were categorized into SVI quartiles, in which quartile 1 (Q1) represented the lowest level of vulnerability and quartile 4 (Q4), the highest. Trends in vaccination coverage were assessed by SVI quartile and urbanicity, which was categorized as large central metropolitan, large fringe metropolitan (areas surrounding large cities, e.g., suburban), medium and small metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan counties. During December 14, 2020-May 1, 2021, disparities in vaccination coverage by SVI increased, especially in large fringe metropolitan (e.g., suburban) and nonmetropolitan counties. By May 1, 2021, vaccination coverage was lower among adults living in counties with the highest overall SVI; differences were most pronounced in large fringe metropolitan (Q4 coverage = 45.0% versus Q1 coverage = 61.7%) and nonmetropolitan (Q4 = 40.6% versus Q1 = 52.9%) counties. Vaccination coverage disparities were largest for two SVI themes: socioeconomic status (Q4 = 44.3% versus Q1 = 61.0%) and household composition and disability (Q4 = 42.0% versus Q1 = 60.1%). Outreach efforts, including expanding public health messaging tailored to local populations and increasing vaccination access, could help increase vaccination coverage in high-SVI counties.","output":"Patterns in COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage, by Social Vulnerability and Urbanicity  United States, December 14, 2020CMay 1, 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to explore how the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 has been represented on the social media site Twitter.

This has led to considering new and unusual targets for SARS CoV-2. 2-O-Methyltransferase (nsp16) is a key and attractive target in the SARS CoV-2 life cycle since it is responsible for the viral RNA protection via a cap formation process. In this study, we propose a new potential inhibitor for SARS COV-2 2-O-methyltransferase (nsp16). A fragment library was screened against the co-crystal structure of the SARS COV-2 2-O-methyltransferase complexed with Sinefungin (nsp16 C PDB ID: 6WKQ), and consequently the best proposed fragments were linked via a de novo approach to build molecule AP-20. Molecule AP-20 displayed a superior docking score to Sinefungin and reproduced the key interactions in the binding site of 2-O-methyltransferase. Three molecular dynamic simulations of the 2-O-methyltransferase apo structure and its complexed forms with AP-20 and Sinefungin were performed for 150 nano-seconds to provide insights on the dynamic nature of such setups and to assess the stability of the proposed AP-20/enzyme complex. AP-20/enzyme complex demonstrated better stability for the ligandCenzyme complex compared to Sinefungin in a respective setup. Furthermore, MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations showed a better profile for AP-20/enzyme complex compared to Sinefungin/enzyme complex emphasizing the potential inhibitory effect of AP-20 on SARS COV-2 2-O-methyltransferase. We endorse our designed molecule AP-20 to be further explored via experimental evaluations to confront the spread of the emerging COVID-19.

Our findings also suggest that old age and living with the elderly are key predictors of preventive behavior adoption in the presence or even absence of state mandates. However, the economically insecure, such as the unemployed, those with low incomes and net worth, or without health insurance, are less likely to adopt preventive behaviors regardless of the mandates.

We reviewed studies reporting STEMI hospitalizations during COVID-19 pandemic, investigating whether differences in COVID-19 epidemiology or public health-related factors could explain discrepant findings in different countries. Methods Search through MedLine, Embase, Scopus, Web-of-Science, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, of studies comparing STEMI admissions during COVID-19 pandemic with a reference period, without language restrictions, as registered in PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Data independently extracted by multiple investigators were pooled using a random-effects model. Health-related metrics were from publicly-available sources. Results We included 79 articles (111,557 STEMI cases, from 57 countries). During peak COVID-19 pandemic, overall incidence rate-ratio (IRR) of STEMI hospitalizations over reference period decreased (0.80;95% CI 0.76C0.84;p < 0.05). Although wide variations and significant heterogeneity were detected among studies (I2 = 89%;p < 0.0001), no significant differences were observed by report methodology (survey vs registry), or observation/reference period. However, large differences emerged at country level not explained by COVID-related epidemiological data, nor by public health strategies. Instead, IRRs for STEMI admissions were inversely related to hospital bed availability in each country (p < 0.05). Conclusions During COVID-19 pandemic hospitalization for STEMI significantly decreased, although to a smaller extent than initially reported. Large variability emerged across countries, unrelated to COVID-related epidemiology or social containment measures. Disparities in healthcare organization likely contributed, indicating that proper organization of emergency medicine should be preserved during pandemics.","output":"Worldwide differences of hospitalization for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction during COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Many schools and higher education settings have confronted the issue of reopening their facilities after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: After propensity score matching, we retrospectively studied patients with BCAS (N = 620) and without BCAS (N = 2,314) through an analysis. The cumulative incidence of PTB or pneumonia was analyzed through Cox proportional regression. After adjustment for sex, age, comorbidities, and medications [including long-acting beta2 agonist/muscarinic antagonists (LABAs/LAMAs), short-acting beta2 agonist/muscarinic antagonists (SABAs/SAMAs), leukotriene receptor antagonist, montelukast, steroids (inhaled corticosteroids, ICSs; oral steroids, OSs), anti-depressants (fluoxetine), and anti-anxiety drugs (benzodiazepines, BZDs)], we calculated the adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for these risks. Similar to OSs, ICSs are associated with an increased risk of PTB or pneumonia, lumping these two as steroids (ICSs/OSs). Results: For the aHR (95% CI), with non-LABAs/non-OSs as the reference 1, the use of LABAs [0.70 (0.52C0.94)]/OSs [0.35 (0.29C0.44)] was associated with a lower risk of PTB or pneumonia.

However, thromboembolic events (TEs) continue to be the major complications during the periprocedural phase. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the prophylactic use of tirofiban, combined with the conventional dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT), as a new antiplatelet protocol in patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with FDs. METHODS At least 3-5 days before the procedure, daily DAT were administrated to the patients. Tirofiban was administered as an intravenous bolus (5 g/kg) over a 3 min period during or immediately after FD deployment, followed by a 0.05 g/kg/min maintenance infusion for 24-48 hours. Periprocedural TEs and hemorrhagic events (HEs) were recorded. RESULTS A total of 331 patients were included, including 229 (69.2%) who received tirofiban administration (tirofiban group) and 102 (30.8%) who received only DAT (non-tirofiban group). Periprocedural TEs occurred in 12 (3.6%) patients, including eight (7.8%) in the non-tirofiban group and four (1.7%) in the tirofiban group. In multivariate analysis, patients receiving tirofiban administration had significantly lower TEs as compared with those who received only DAT (P=0.004). Balloon angioplasty and longer procedure time (>137 min) were also risk factors for TEs. Also, no increase was observed in the rate of HEs related to tirofiban administration.

In the present investigation, we developed a novel xCuO?(100 ? x) [CaF(2)?3P(2)O(5)?CaO] glass system with 0  x  16 mol% in order to determine the influence of doping on the composition structure of glasses. The samples were characterized by dissolution tests, pH measurements, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Scanning Electron Microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) and afterward, their antitumor character was assessed. The glasses were mostly soluble in the aqueous medium, their dissolution rate being directly proportional to the increase in pH and the level of doping up to x = 8 mol%. FT-IR spectra of glass samples show the presence of all structural units characteristic to P(2)O(5) in different rates and directly depending on the depolymerization process. SEM-EDX results revealed the presence of an amorphous glass structure composed of P, O, Ca, and Cu elements. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay showed strong cytotoxicity for tumoral cells A375 even in low concentrations for Cu-treatment.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the experience of fellowship applicants in answering radiology questions in an audiovisual format using their own smartphones after answering radiology questions in a traditional printed text format as part of the application process during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that fellowship applicants would find that recorded audiovisual radiology content adds value to the conventional selection process, may increase engagement by using their own smartphone device, and facilitate the understanding of imaging findings of radiology-based questions, while maintaining social distancing. METHODS: One senior staff radiologist of each subspecialty prepared 4 audiovisual radiology questions for each subspecialty. We conducted a survey using web-based questionnaires for 123 fellowship applications for musculoskeletal (n=39), internal medicine (n=61), and neuroradiology (n=23) programs to evaluate the experience of using audiovisual radiology content as a substitute for the conventional text evaluation. RESULTS: Most of the applicants (n=122, 99%) answered positively (with responses of agree or strongly agree) that images in digital forms are of superior quality to those printed on paper. In total, 101 (82%) applicants agreed with the statement that the presentation of cases in audiovisual format facilitates the understanding of the findings. Furthermore, 81 (65%) candidates agreed or strongly agreed that answering digital forms is more practical than conventional paper forms. CONCLUSIONS: The use of audiovisual content as part of the selection process for radiology fellowships is a new approach to evaluate the potential to enhance the applicants experience during this process. This technology also allows for the evaluation of candidates without the need for in-person interaction. Further studies could streamline these methods to minimize work redundancy with traditional text assessments or even evaluate the acceptance of using only audiovisual content on smartphones.","output":"Audiovisual Content for a Radiology Fellowship Selection Process During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Pilot Web-Based Questionnaire Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is postulated that intraoperative injury to the cavernosal nerves results in hemodynamic and histologic changes within the penis, which manifest clinically as ED. We hypothesize that non-neuronal cause, such as vascular insults due to intraoperative tissue handling, may also have a minor but definite role in penile ischemia and consequent postoperative sexual dysfunction. Between May 2008 and July 2008, 64 patients were enrolled in the study (group 1). Following sterilization, the Odissey Tissue Oximeter probe was placed on the shaft of the penis, 2 cm from its base. The patient underwent continuous penile tissue saturation monitoring. Surgical dissection was altered whenever the oxygen saturation alarm went off until it was restored to 85%. In addition, 192 patients, matched for age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, baseline sexual function, Charlson comorbidity index and nerve-sparing status operated between October 2007 and July 2008, formed the control group (group 2). These patients did not have any intraoperative tissue oxygenation monitoring. Opening of the endopelvic fascia and steps of nerve sparing were associated with significant drops in oxygen levels, especially if done using torque. Drop in oxygen levels were also noted whenever excessive traction was applied on the Foley catheter, seminal vesicles or prostate during apical dissection. We deliberately modified our surgical steps to make surgery more traction free. A significantly higher percentage of group 1 patients with bilateral nerve sparing had no ED compared with group 2 patients at 6 weeks (24.5% vs 10.4%; P=0.014) and 52 weeks (83.7% vs 68%; P=0.029). Overall, 93.9% of patients in study group had Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score of 17 (mild to no ED) at 1 year compared with 78.4% of patients in the control group. We demonstrated that avoidance of ischemic stress, aided by intraoperative penile oxygenation monitoring, may help surgeons improve their technique and thus functional outcomes in patients.","output":"Technique of traction-free nerve-sparing robotic prostatectomy: delicate tissue handling by real-time penile oxygen monitoring."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introdu??o: O corona vrus (2019-nCoV OU HCOV-19 ou CoV2), emergiu na China como a principal causa de pneumonia viral (COVID-19, Doen?a do Coronavrus 19) Objetivo: Avaliar evidncias cientficas sobre Fisioterapia e Funcionalidade em pacientes com COVID-19 adulto e peditrico Mtodos: Trata-se de uma revis?o de literatura do tipo integrativa utilizando a bases de dados do MedLine/PubMed, bioblioteca da Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Cincias da Sade (LILACS) e Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDRo) Resultados:Os pacientes com COVID-19 apresentam sinais de deficincia respiratria com hipoxemia, com baixo impacto em crian?as estas evoluem sem sintomas ou com quadro de baixa gravidade alm de observar impacto na restri??o da participa??o a fisioterapia atua na oxigenioterapia e ventila??o dos pacientes Conclus?o: A COVID-19 causa altera??es na fun??o pulmonar com forma??o de deficincia respiratria hipoxmica e de complacncia, com repercuss?es cardiovasculares que leva a necessidade da fisioterapia no desfecho desta pandemia, seja por meio da oxigenioterapia e/ou do suporte ventilatrio (invasivo e n?o-invasivo) (AU) Introduction: The corona virus (2019-nCoV OR HCOV-19 or CoV2), has emerged in China as the main cause of viral pneumonia (COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease-19) Aim: To provide evidence-based Physiotherapy and functionality in patients with adult and pediatric COVID-19 Methods: This is an integrative literature review using the MedLine / PubMed databases, library of Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences (LILACS) and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDRo) Results: Part of the patients with covid 19 show signs of respiratory deficiency with hypoxemia, with low severity in children Impaired functionality is also expected Conclusion: COVID-19 causes low pulmonary compliance and important changes in lung function with hypoxemia and cardiovascular repercussions These changes lead to the need for Physiotherapy and the management of oxygen therapy and ventilatory support (invasive and non-invasive) for these patients","output":"Evidncias cientficas sobre Fisioterapia e funcionalidade em pacientes com COVID-19 adulto e peditrico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: A solid understanding of anatomy and its application is crucial to the development of safe surgeons. Cadaveric dissection has traditionally been the gold standard for learning anatomy however the disruption of anatomy teaching from the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a shift in methods for teaching both undergraduate and postgraduate students. We sought to design, deliver and evaluate a virtual MRCS anatomy revision course for doctors led by anatomy demonstrators. METHOD: A series of six high yield revision sessions on the anatomy of the abdomen and pelvis, upper limb, lower limb, thorax and head and neck were organised on a virtual platform. The course was advertised on social media targeting groups for doctors. These sessions were taught by a senior anatomy demonstrator and previous examiner for the MRCS. This was followed by a series of interactive single best answer questions. The answers were then discussed in a subsequent session facilitated by current junior anatomy demonstrators. Feedback on student satisfaction, relevance and content of each session was collated. RESULTS: Online feedback was completed by 263 students and was universally positive. Our results highlight the relevance of the sessions for doctors preparing for both MRCS part A and B examinations. Our aim is to develop this teaching series to create an environment where postgraduate learners feel supported and can build on pre-existing knowledge.

Dysfunctional microvascular pericytes are characterized by their location in the neurovascular unit, either on the arteriole or venule side. Pathophysiological and pathological changes caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include pulmonary hypertension, edema, focal hemorrhage, microvascular congestion, and thrombosis. In this paper, I have extended the application of the pericytes-centered hypothesis to COVID-19 by proposing the concept of a pulmonary neurovascular unit (pNVU); application of this concept implies that human lungs contain approximately 300 million pNVUs. This concept of existing local regulation of microvascular blood flow is supported by the observation of pathophysiology in pulmonary embolism and in acute high-altitude illness. The autonomic control seen in these three disease states matches blood flow with oxygen supply in each pNVU to maintain physiological blood oxygen saturation level. Here, I illustrate how the malfunction of microvascular pericytes may cause focal hemorrhage, edema or microvascular congestion and thrombosis. A bypass existing in each pNVU would autonomically deviate blood flow from a COVID-19-affected pNVU to other healthy pNVUs. This action would prevent systemically applied medicines from reaching the therapeutic threshold in COVID-19- affected pNVUs. While testing this hypothesis with experimental evidence is urgently needed, supporting therapy aimed at improving microcirculation or rebuilding the physiological function of microvascular pericytes is recommended as a potentially effective treatment of COVID 19.","output":"Pericytes within a pulmonary neurovascular unit in coronavirus disease 2019-elicited pathological changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prevention and control of infection in dentistry is an essential matter that has gained immense attention in recent years.

Unlike forward contact tracing, backward contact tracing identifies the source of newly detected cases. This approach is particularly valuable when there is high individual-level variation in the number of secondary transmissions (overdispersion). Methods: By using a simple branching process model, we explored the potential of combining backward contact tracing with more conventional forward contact tracing for control of COVID-19. We estimated the typical size of clusters that can be reached by backward tracing and simulated the incremental effectiveness of combining backward tracing with conventional forward tracing. Results: Across ranges of parameter values consistent with dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, backward tracing is expected to identify a primary case generating 3-10 times more infections than average, typically increasing the proportion of subsequent cases averted by a factor of 2-3. The estimated number of cases averted by backward tracing became greater with a higher degree of overdispersion.

PURPOSE: To examine the effectiveness of N95, surgical, and cloth masks in community and health care settings for preventing respiratory virus infections, and effects of reuse or extended use of N95 masks. DATA SOURCES: Multiple electronic databases, including the World Health Organization COVID-19 database and medRxiv preprint server (2003 through 14 April 2020; surveillance through 2 June 2020), and reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials of masks and risk for respiratory virus infection, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and observational studies of mask use and coronavirus infection risk were included. New evidence will be incorporated by using living review methods. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer abstracted data and assessed methodological limitations; a second reviewer provided verification. DATA SYNTHESIS: 39 studies (18 randomized controlled trials and 21 observational studies; 33 867 participants) were included. No study evaluated reuse or extended use of N95 masks. Evidence on SARS-CoV-2 was limited to 2 observational studies with serious limitations. Community mask use was possibly associated with decreased risk for SARS-CoV-1 infection in observational studies. In high- or moderate-risk health care settings, observational studies found that risk for infection with SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus probably decreased with mask use versus nonuse and possibly decreased with N95 versus surgical mask use. Randomized trials in community settings found possibly no difference between N95 versus surgical masks and probably no difference between surgical versus no mask in risk for influenza or influenza-like illness, but compliance was low. In health care settings, N95 and surgical masks were probably associated with similar risks for influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed viral infection; clinical respiratory illness had inconsistency. Bothersome symptoms were common. LIMITATIONS: There were few SARS-CoV-2 studies, observational studies have methodological limitations, and the review was done by using streamlined methods. CONCLUSION: Evidence on mask effectiveness for respiratory infection prevention is stronger in health care than community settings. N95 respirators might reduce SARS-CoV-1 risk versus surgical masks in health care settings, but applicability to SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain.

To support early recognition of clinical deterioration, wireless sensor technologies that enable continuous vital signs monitoring in a ward setting are emerging. OBJECTIVE: This study explored nurses and surgeons expectations of the potential effectiveness and impact of continuous wireless vital signs monitoring in patients admitted to the ward after esophagectomy. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted at 3 esophageal cancer centers in the Netherlands. In each center, 2 nurses and 2 surgeons were interviewed regarding their expectations of continuous vital signs monitoring for early recognition of complications after esophagectomy. Historical data of patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were collected in each center and presented to the local participants to support estimations on clinical outcome. RESULTS: The majority of nurses and surgeons expected that continuous vital signs monitoring could contribute to the earlier recognition of deterioration and result in earlier treatment for postoperative complications, although the effective time gain would depend on patient and situational factors. Their expectations regarding the impact of potential earlier diagnosis on clinical outcomes varied. Nevertheless, most caregivers would consider implementing continuous monitoring in the surgical ward to support patient monitoring after esophagectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers expected that wireless vital signs monitoring would provide opportunities for early detection of postoperative complications in patients undergoing esophagectomy admitted to the ward and prevent sequelae under certain circumstances.

METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed medical records including socio-demographics, past medical history, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, treatment and disease outcome of 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 54 years (IQR: 38C64), and there was no significant gender difference (51% of male). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (55 [34%]), diabetes (31 [19%]) and obesity (13 [8%]). Fever (93 [58%]), cough (92 [57%]), fatigue (87 [54%]), shortness of breath (72 [45%]) and myalgia (33 [21%]) were the most common symptoms, upon admission. Patients were categorized into mild (92 [57%]), moderate (19 [12%]) and severe (49 [31%]). Severe patients were older and were more likely to have comorbidities, compared to mild ones. The majority of patients (92% [147 of 160]) patients received hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine phosphate.

Over hundreds of years, the Hakka have developed their own medical practices to prevent and cure diseases, such as medicinal soup, an important characteristic of Hakka cuisine. This study aims at documenting plant taxa used to make Hakka medicinal soup, along with their associated ethnomedical knowledge. METHODS: Data on Hakka soup-making plants were collected through key-informant interviews, semi-structured interviews, participatory field collection, and direct observation. The choosing of participants has followed the snowball sampling method. Herbs used for preparing medicinal soup were purchased on the local market or collected from the wild, and voucher specimens were collected and identified. The study result was also compared with published studies on soup-making plants in other parts of Guangdong province and the Hakka areas in Fujian Province of China. RESULTS: Eighty-three taxa belonging to 70 genera within 38 families were listed by our informants as being used to treat 55 kinds of health problems. Most documented plants are herbaceous species, followed by shrubs and woody liana. Roots were the most frequently used plant parts for medicinal purposes, followed, in descending order, by the whole plant, rhizomes, and flowers. Most plants used to prepare medicinal soup are wild-harvested (56 species), 4 cultivated, and 23 wild harvested or cultivated. According to the comparison, 18 Hakka medicinal soup species are shown both in Fujian Province and Guangdong Province. The Hakka soup-making plants in both provinces share very similar therapeutic functions. This study helps to extend the Hakka menu in both provinces.

Enveloped viruses predominantly infect animal cells although a few are known to infect plants, bacteria, and Archaea. The lipid bilayer can be derived from a variety of cellular membranes with the plasma membrane being the most common source. The presence of the lipid envelope allows enveloped viruses to bud out of cells without disrupting the cell membrane and, therefore, require an intact cell for particle release. Viral glycoproteins are found embedded in the lipid bilayer, usually in the form of transmembrane proteins, which allows communication of viral components across the membrane. These glycoproteins play crucial roles in the virus life cycle including assembly, budding, receptor binding, and membrane fusion. The assembly of two groups of icosahedral enveloped viruses (the alphaviruses and the flaviviruses) is described in detail in this article in order to present common themes in enveloped virus assembly.","output":"Assembly of Viruses: Enveloped Particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The comparative efficacy of targeted systemic therapies for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) has not been systematically assessed using recent phase 3 data. This network meta-analysis assesses the comparative efficacy of targeted systemic therapies without the addition of topical corticosteroids (TCS) and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) in adults with moderate to severe AD. METHODS The systematic literature review searched through 17 May 2021 for phase 3/4 trials with upadacitinib, interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-13 (IL-13), or JAK inhibitors compared with placebo or active intervention for adults and adolescents with moderate to severe AD with inadequate response to TCS/TCI or for whom TCS/TCI was medically inadvisable, without restrictions on year or region. Researchers assessed data using PRISMA guidelines. The proportion of patients achieving trial co-primary endpoints [Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) and reduction of  2 points from baseline; proportion of patients achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) improvement  75% from baseline (EASI-75)]; EASI improvement  90% from baseline (EASI-90); and  4-point improvement on Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale from baseline (NRS  4) were evaluated using Bayesian network meta-analysis. RESULTS Of 3415 initially identified records, network meta-analysis (NMA) ultimately included 6 records representing 9 unique studies. Two upadacitinib trials were also included. Eleven clinical trials including 6254 patients were analyzed. Upadacitinib 30 mg daily was the most efficacious therapy across all endpoints at the primary endpoint (week 12 or 16) and at earlier timepoints, followed by upadacitinib 15 mg daily and abrocitinib 200 mg daily. DISCUSSION Many factors need to be considered for treatment selection for AD. These findings can help healthcare providers when personalizing a patient's treatment. CONCLUSION Upadacitinib 30 mg daily, upadacitinib 15 mg daily, and abrocitinib 200 mg daily may be the most efficacious targeted systemic therapies over 12-16 weeks of therapy in AD.","output":"Comparative Efficacy of Targeted Systemic Therapies for Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis without Topical Corticosteroids: Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Predictions have been made that Africa would be the most vulnerable continent to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Interestingly, the spread of the disease in Africa seems to be slower than in many parts of the World. Among possible hypotheses, some parts of Africa may have undergone a silent COVID-19 epidemic and acquired a herd immunity before the official declaration of the disease in December 2019. Case presentation : We report two cases (one 55-year-old man and one 25-year-old woman) of acute respiratory distress secondary to atypical pneumonia in Bukavu, in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which occurred between September and December 2019, before the official beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. One patient had returned from China and the other had close contacts with travellers from China in the 2 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. In either case, the aetiology could not be accurately determined. However, the two cases presented a clinical picture (progressive dyspnoea, preceded by dry cough and fever) and laboratory changes (procalcitonin within the normal range, slight inflammation, and lymphopenia) compatible with a viral infection. The chest X-Rays series of the first patient showed lesions (reticulations, ground glass, and nodules  6 mm) similar to those found in COVID-19. In addition, unlike the 25-year-old female patient who had no comorbidity, the 55-year-old male patient who had hypertension as comorbidity, developed a more severe acute respiratory distress which progressed to death. Conclusion: These cases bring to the attention a number of facts which make us suspect that the COVID-19 epidemic may have already been present in the region months before the official beginning of the pandemic.","output":"On two cases of atypical respiratory distress in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo months before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared.

Nowadays, the world is in the grip of the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID 19) pandemic. In these patients, cytokine storm is associated with disease severity. In consideration of the role of vitamin D in the immune system, aim of this study was to analyse vitamin D levels in patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and to assess any correlations with disease severity and prognosis. METHODS: In this retrospective, observational study, we analysed demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 42 patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19, treated in Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit (RICU) of the Policlinic of Bari from March, 11 to April 30, 2020. RESULTS: Eighty one percent of patients had hypovitaminosis D. Based on vitamin D levels, the population was stratified into four groups: no hypovitaminosis D, insufficiency, moderate deficiency, and severe deficiency. No differences regarding demographic and clinical characteristics were found. A survival analysis highlighted that, after 10 days of hospitalization, severe vitamin D deficiency patients had a 50% mortality probability, while those with vitamin D &#8805; 10 ng/mL had a 5% mortality risk (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was found in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure, treated in a RICU. Patients with severe vitamin D deficiency had a significantly higher mortality risk. Severe vitamin D deficiency may be a marker of poor prognosis in these patients, suggesting that adjunctive treatment might improve disease outcomes.","output":"Vitamin D deficiency as a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Selenium (Se) is an essential mineral in multiple human metabolic pathways with immune modulatory effects on viral diseases including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and HIV. Plant-based foods contain Se metabolites with unique functionalities for the human metabolism. In order to assess the value of common salad greens as Se source, we conducted a survey of lettuce commercially grown in 15 locations across the USA and Canada and found a tendency for Se to accumulate higher (up to 10 times) in lettuce grown along the Colorado river basin region, where the highest amount of annual solar radiation of the country is recorded. In the same area, we evaluated the effect of sunlight reduction on the Se content of two species of arugula [Eruca sativa (E. sativa) cv. Astro and Diplotaxis tenuifolia (D. tenuifolia) cv. Sylvetta]. A 90% light reduction during the 7 days before harvest resulted in over one-third Se decline in D. tenuifolia. The effect of light intensity on yield and Se uptake of arugula microgreens was also examined under indoor controlled conditions. This included high intensity (HI) (160  mol(?2) s(?1) for 12 h/12 h light/dark); low intensity (LI) (70  mol m(?2) s(?1) for 12 h/12 h light/dark); and HI-UVA (12 h light of 160  mol m(?2) s(?1), 2 h UVA of 40  mol m(?2) s(?1), and 10 h dark) treatments in a factorial design with 0, 1, 5, and 10 ppm Se in the growing medium. HI and HI-UVA produced D. tenuifolia plants with 25C100% higher Se content than LI, particularly with the two higher Se doses. The addition of Se produced a marked increase in fresh matter (>35% in E. sativa and >45% in D. tenuifolia).

AM can be conceptualized as a disorder of motivation wherein patients exhibit a loss of speech and spontaneous movement, owing to disruption of underlying frontal-subcortical circuits. OBJECTIVES: Review the concept and differential diagnosis of AM, as well as the clinical literature on AM in COVID-19. Discuss potential implications for underlying functional neuroanatomy and mechanistic pathways, as well as clinical management. METHODS: A narrative literature review was performed using PubMed querying published articles for topics associated with AM and its occurrence in COVID-19. RESULTS: AM has been described in case reports and a prospective cohort study of COVID patients with neurological complaints. Three COVID-19 AM subgroups can be distinguished, including individuals with severe respiratory illness, those with meningoencephalitis, and those with delirium and pre-existing neuropsychiatric illness. Electrophysiology and functional imaging suggest COVID-19 AM may result from underlying frontal lobe dysfunction and disruption of associated distributed circuits subserving goal-directed behavior. Distinctive combinations of pathophysiological mechanisms may be at play in the different subgroups of COVID-19 AM cases. CONCLUSION: AM has been described in association with COVID-19 and may manifest in clinically heterogenous subgroups with distinct underlying mechanisms. The diagnosis of AM and evaluation of potential etiologies can be complex.

A novel SARS-CoV-2 strain, the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), is spreading worldwide. The Delta variant has reportedly high infectivity and immune evasion potency. In June 2021, the World Health Organization categorized it as a variant of concern (VOC). Therefore, it is vital to develop tests that can exclusively identify the Delta variant. Here, we developed a rapid screening assay to detect characteristic mutations observed in the Delta variant using high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. In this assay, we determined L452R and T478K, among which T478K is an identifier of the Delta variant since L452R is seen in other strains (Kappa and Epsilon variants). Additionally, nested PCR-based HRM analysis, which involved RT-PCR (1st PCR) and HRM analysis (2nd PCR), was developed to improve the specificity and sensitivity. Our method discriminated between the L452R mutant and wild-type L452. In addition, HRM analysis distinguished the T478K mutant from the wild-type T478. Seven clinical samples containing the Delta variant were successfully identified as L452R/T478K mutants. These results indicate that this HRM-based genotyping method can identify the Delta variant.

CASE SUMMARY: Three patients aged 51C84 developed a pericarditis related to COVID-19, associated for two of them with a myocarditis. Case 1 was a COVID-19 cardiac tamponade without myocarditis, confirmed by a positive chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Case 2 showed a COVID-19 myopericarditis, confirmed by a positive chest CT scan and a SARS-coronavirus-2 positive swab. Case 3 was a cardiac tamponade due to COVID-19 pericarditis, with a positive polymerase chain reaction on pericardial fluid. They were all treated by colchicine and their condition improved rapidly. DISCUSSION: Presumably rare, we reported three cases of pericardial effusions (PEs) occurring in a single cardiology centre. There is a higher incidence of COVID-19-related cardiac diseases such as pericarditis that can manifest as a minimal PE to a cardiac tamponade, which should result in a higher awareness of cardiologists. A systematic measure of the high-sensitivity troponin kinetic in patients affected by COVID-19 could be interesting in order to screen for potential myocarditis.

METHODS: A modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered, and Deceased (SEIRD) model was employed to assess the situation in Israel, a small country with 9 million people. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of these strategies as well as the expected number of infected individuals and deaths were calculated. RESULTS: A nationwide lockdown is expected to save, on average, 274 (median 124, interquartile range: 71-221) lives compared to the testing, tracing, and isolation approach. However, the ICER will be, on average, $45 104 156 (median $49.6 million, interquartile range: 22.7-220.1) to prevent 1 case of death.

It is hoped that the study can serve as a reference for policy making during the resumption of work in other countries or regions experiencing similar situations. METHODS: This study comprised a quantitative cross-sectional online survey design. Purposive sampling and Cluster sampling were used to recruit all HCWs working in public hospitals in Huangzhou District, Huanggang City, Hubei Province, China. From April 23 to May 14, 2020, surveys were sent electronically to all 13 public hospitals in this area. RESULTS: In total, 2,079 responses were received and 2,050 completed forms were included. After analysis, 47.9 and 46.6% of HCWs indicated that they possessed very good knowledge or good knowledge of preventative measures, respectively. Multivariable log-binomial regression indicated that male, tertiary hospital, medical staff, and undergraduate/postgraduate qualification were associated with good knowledge. Good knowledge was also well-correlated with good practice (OR: 3.277; 95% CI: 2.734C3.928; P < 0.01). 59.8% of HCWs reported worries about resuming work; especially asymptomatic infections. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) indicated that 10.8% of participants had mild anxiety, 1.5% moderate anxiety, and 0.1% severe anxiety. Female, divorced/widowed, and working in a high risk hospital (the Huangzhou District People's Hospital was used for throat swab examinations of returning workers) were risk factors for concerns about resuming work and anxiety symptoms. However, good preventive knowledge was a protective factor for anxiety. HCWs' trust in using TCM to treat COVID-19 was significantly higher than their trust in using TCM for prevention (P < 0.001). Regarding preferences for preventative TCM products, oral TCM granules were the most preferred (62.4%). HCWs also indicated they wanted to know more about the clinical efficacy, applicable population, and adverse reactions of preventative TCM products (89.3, 81.1, and 81.4%, respectively). CONCLUSION: While HCWs had good knowledge of COVID-19 preventative measures, this did not eliminate the psychological impact of resumption of work. Promotion of COVID-19 prevention knowledge reduces the risk of infection, and alleviates the worries and anxiety symptoms of HCWs about resuming work (especially in administrative staff, those with low education, and those working in primary hospitals).

MethodsWe assembled a cohort 12 to 39 years old patients, insured by Kaiser Permanente Northwest, who received at least one dose of an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) between December 2020 and October 2021. We followed them for up to 30 days after their second dose of an mRNA vaccine to identify encounters for myocarditis, pericarditis or myopericarditis. We compared two identification methods: A method that searched all encounter diagnoses using a brief text description (e.g., ICD-10-CM code I40.9 is defined as acute myocarditis, unspecified). We searched the text description of all inpatient or outpatient encounter diagnoses (in any position) for \\"myocarditis\\" or \\"pericarditis.\\" The other method was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), which searched for emergency department visits or hospitalizations with a select set of discharge ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. For both methods, two physicians independently reviewed the identified patient records and classified them as confirmed, probable or not cases using the CDCs case definition. ResultsThe encounter methodology identified 14 distinct patients who met the confirmed or probable CDC case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis with an onset within 21 days of receipt of COVID-19 vaccination. Three of these 14 patients had an ICD-10 code of I51.4 \\"Myocarditis, Unspecified\\" which was overlooked by the VSD algorithm. The VSD methodology identified 11 patients who met the CDC case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis. Seven (64%) of the eleven patients had initial care for myopericarditis outside of a KPNW facility and their diagnosis could not be ascertained by the VSD methodology until claims were submitted (median delay of 33 days; range of 12-195 days). Among those who received a second dose of vaccine (n=146,785), we estimated a risk as 95.4 cases of myopericarditis per million second doses administered (95% CI, 52.1 to 160.0). ConclusionWe identified additional valid cases of myopericarditis following an mRNA vaccination that would be missed by the VSDs search algorithm, which depends on select hospital discharge diagnosis codes.

We investigated the social outcomes of school leavers with cerebral palsy (CP) in Victoria, Australia and explored the determinants of desirable outcomes. Methods: We used the Victorian CP Register to invite all adults with CP aged 18C25 years (n = 649). On-line and/or paper-based surveys explored participation in education, employment, community activities, living situation, relationships and life satisfaction. Functional and health status data were collected. Social outcomes were summarized descriptively and compared between individuals with CP and non-disabled peers aged 18C25 years from the Household Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia dataset. Within the CP cohort we explored whether physical and mental health and level of functioning were associated with social outcomes. In addition, a descriptive comparison was undertaken between the social outcomes of the current CP cohort with that of a previously reported 2007 cohort. Results: Ninety participants (57% male; mean age 22.4 years (SD: 2.2) in 2020; 61.1% self-reported) provided data for analyses; response rate 16.9%. CP characteristics were similar between respondents and non-respondents. In comparison to similar aged peers, 79.8% had completed secondary school (compared to 83.2%); 32.6% (compared to 75.8%) were in paid work; 87.5% (compared to 48.2%) were living in their parental home; and 3.4% (compared to 31.6%) were married or partnered. Individuals with CP and higher levels of functional capacity and better physical health were more likely to undertake post-secondary education. Higher levels of functional capacity and physical health, as well as lower mental health status were associated with being employed. Conclusions: While foundational education completion rates were similar to non-disabled peers, significant gaps in social outcomes remain, including residence in the parental home and single status.

This situation has created an alarming public health emergency of international concern requiring the detection of this life-threatening viral candidate due to increased cases of newborn microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection. Hence, this review reports possible methods and strategies for the fast and reliable detection of ZIKV with particular emphasis on current updates, knowledge, and new hypotheses that might be helpful for medical professionals in poor and developing countries that urgently need to address this problem. In particular, we emphasize liposome-based biosensors. Although these biosensors are currently among the less popular tools for human disease detection, they have become useful tools for the screening and detection of pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses because of their versatile advantageous features compared to other sensing devices. This review summarizes the currently available methods employed for the rapid detection of ZIKV and suggests an innovative approach involving the application of a liposome-based hypothesis for the development of new strategies for ZIKV detection and their use as effective biomedicinal tools.","output":"Rapid Detection Strategies for the Global Threat of Zika Virus: Current State, New Hypotheses, and Limitations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vitro inactivation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) and povidone-iodine (PVP-I) oral antiseptic rinses at clinically recommended concentrations and contact times. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 strain virus stock was prepared prior to testing by growing in Vero 76 cells. The culture media for prepared virus stock was minimum essential medium (MEM) with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 50 g/mL gentamicin. Test compounds consisting of PVP-I oral rinse solutions and H2 O2 aqueous solutions were mixed directly with the virus solution so that the final concentration was 50% of the test compound and 50% of the virus solution. Thus PVP-I was tested at concentrations of 0.5%, 1.25%, and 1.5%, and H2 O2 was tested at 3% and 1.5% concentrations to represent clinically recommended concentrations. Ethanol and water were evaluated in parallel as standard positive and negative controls. All samples were tested at contact periods of 15 seconds and 30 seconds. Surviving virus from each sample was then quantified by standard end-point dilution assay and the log reduction value of each compound compared to the negative control was calculated. RESULTS: After the 15-second and 30-second contact times, PVP-I oral antiseptic rinse at all 3 concentrations of 0.5%, 1.25%, and 1.5% completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2. The H2 O2 solutions at concentrations of 1.5% and 3.0% showed minimal viricidal activity after 15 seconds and 30 seconds of contact time. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 virus was completely inactivated by PVP-I oral antiseptic rinse in vitro, at the lowest concentration of 0.5 % and at the lowest contact time of 15 seconds. Hydrogen peroxide at the recommended oral rinse concentrations of 1.5% and 3.0% was minimally effective as a viricidal agent after contact times as long as 30 seconds. Therefore, preprocedural rinsing with diluted PVP-I in the range of 0.5% to 1.5% may be preferred over hydrogen peroxide during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Comparison of In Vitro Inactivation of SARS CoV-2 with Hydrogen Peroxide and Povidone-Iodine Oral Antiseptic Rinses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:Forecasting nonlinear stochastic systems most often is quite difficult, without giving in to temptations to simply simplify models for the sake of permitting simple computations.Objective:Here, two basic algorithms, Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) and path-integral codes PATHINT/PATHTREE (and their quantum generalizations qPATHINT/qPATHTREE) are offered to detail such systems.Method:ASA and PATHINT/PATHTREE have been effective to forecast properties in three disparate disciplines in neuroscience, financial markets, and combat analysis.

IR encounters were collected by gathering the weekly volume of submitted E&amp;M current procedural technology (CPT) codes from the IR division. IR encounters were classified as outpatient or telehealth E&amp;M. The E&amp;M volume in 2019 was used as a historical control. Data were divided into three periods: pre-surge (January 6CMarch 15, 2020), surge (March 16CJune 7, 2020), and recovery (June 8CAugust 23, 2020). The mean encounters per week during the surge and recovery periods were compared to the pre-surge baseline using a Welch t test for 2020 data, and the same comparison was made for 2019 data for a historical control. Results: During the surge period, outpatient E&amp;M volume, inclusive of telemedicine, fell by 55.8% relative to the pre-surge 2020 baseline. The volume grew steadily during the recovery period but remained 19.8% below pre-surge 2020 levels. The surge and recovery mean weekly E&amp;M volume was significantly different from the equivalent periods in 2019 (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively). During the surge, telemedicine comprised 44.6% of the total outpatient E&amp;M. The contribution of telemedicine gradually fell over the recovery period, comprising just 11.5% in the final week of the study, and 16.7% during the recovery. Outpatient E&amp;M reached a nadir during the week of April 13th, reflecting a 70.6% decline relative to the same period in 2019. The recovery period demonstrated a gradual increase in outpatient E&amp;M with a decline in telehealth encounters balanced by a growth of in-person visits. During the last week of the recovery period (week of 8/17), outpatient in-person E&amp;M had recovered to 2019 levels, and with the inclusion of telehealth exceeded E&amp;M in 2019 for the same period by 93.3%. Conclusions: Telemedicine becomes an important way to maintain outpatient E&amp;M volume in the event of a pandemic when social distancing and stay-at-home orders preclude face-to-face visits.

DESIGN: We performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of quarantine strategies when one or more SARS-CoV-2 tests were administered during the quarantine. Simulations were based on statistical models for the transmissibility and viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the sensitivities of available testing methods. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of perturbations in model assumptions on the outcomes of optimal strategies. RESULTS: We found that SARS-CoV-2 testing can effectively reduce the length of a quarantine without compromising safety. A single reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) test performed before the end of quarantine can reduce quarantine duration to 10 days. Two tests can reduce the duration to 8 days, and three highly sensitive RT-PCR tests can justify a 6-day quarantine. More strategic testing schedules and longer quarantines are needed if tests are administered with less-sensitive RT-PCR tests or antigen tests. Shorter quarantines can be used for applications that tolerate a residual postquarantine transmission risk comparable to a 10-day quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: Testing could substantially reduce the length of isolation, reducing the physical and mental stress caused by lengthy quarantines.

After achieving a stable guiding sheath position within the proximal cervical carotid artery, a hypercompliant balloon catheter was manipulated beyond the tortuous cervical internal carotid segment into the distal carotid artery. The balloon was then inflated to anchor it distally within an intracranial (cavernous or petrous) segment of the internal carotid artery. The guiding catheter was then advanced beyond the tortuous cervical segment, over the balloon catheter, as gentle counter traction was applied to the balloon. RESULTS Balloon-assisted guiding catheter placement was used to perform endovascular treatments of 12 anterior circulation aneurysms. One patient underwent coiling alone. Five patients underwent balloon-assisted coiling. One patient underwent balloon and stent assisted coil embolization.

Conclusions: After one year of COVID-19 and a disastrous management of the disease, Brazil has more than 11 million cases, 270,000 deaths, and the highest number of daily deaths due to COVID-19 in the world, most of which could have been avoided and can be credited to negligence of municipal, state, and federal authorities, especially President Jair Messias Bolsonaro. Unfortunately, the country is an example of what not to do in a pandemic setting. Key Points: One year after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Brazil had the second higher number of cases and deaths, and the highest number of daily deaths due to the disease. Lack of massive testing, non-stringent and ineffective collective health policies, poor management of the public health care system, and political instability were the main drivers of the countrys flawed management of the COVID-19 advancement. Anti-science and sabotaging actions by government had a pivotal role in the countrys current situation. Brazil has a large territory and is marked by social contrasts among different regions and states, which showed contrasting data regarding the impact caused by COVID-19. COVID-19 databases and data sharing are important to provide an overview of epidemiological aspects of the disease; however, Brazil lacks standardization in these datasets.","output":"One Year of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Brazil: A Political and Social Overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the COVID-19 emergency has raised, the entire world had to stop, adapt, and face the challenge.

The project, driven by scientific international studies, was bringing the intervention of designers on the topic with experimental pilot actions, designed and led by designers on-field, that were going on inside the hospital environment when the emergency changed the scenario, limited the environment, shifted the eye on a new, wider target of healthy people. Observing the new scenario and the initiatives risen on social media the designers involved in the ongoing project made knitting a tool to help individuals spending the forced time at home in meaningful ways. The project took a new perspective and evolved into a social media campaign, proposing virtual workshops for a better living in emergency times. The two projects, on-field and online, showed knitting to be a meaningful solution not only for healthcare but also for the daily life of people, and outlined how designers and a designdriven approach can act and react on the product-service creation, improvement, consolidation, and communication. ? 2020 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

The study aims to report the incidence of hospital-acquired infections in patients with hematological malignancies and the risk factors associated with them. MATERIAL AND METHODS An observational study with cross-sectional data collection was carried out from January 1, 2019, to April 30, 2020, in the department of hematology of Brazzaville University Hospital. The study concerned 77 patients diagnosed with hematological malignancies admitted for a course of chemotherapy. Written consent was obtained from each participant. Participants were divided into two groups: with HAI (n=50) and without HAI (n=27). They were compared using the chi-square test and Student's T-test. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the association of HAI with all the risk factors were performed for analysis of the 2 x k contingency tables and repeated using logistic regression. RESULTS The cumulative incidence was 64.9% with a 95% confidence interval of [53.8-74.7]. The time to onset of HAIs was 10.66.50 days. The incidence of HAI was significantly greater in acute myelogenous leukemia (80%), grade 4 neutropenia (80%). The risk factors were hospitalization stay of over 14 days (OR: 1.09), the regimen: daunorubicin-aracytine (OR: 5.96), the hemoglobin level on admission (OR: 0.72), and the neutropenia of grade 4 (OR: 7.9).

The fit of simple cloth masks on the face as well as the resulting perimeter leakage and face mask efficacy are expected to be highly dependent on the type of mask and facial topology. However, this effect has to date, not been examined and quantified. Here, we study the leakage of a rectangular cloth mask on a large virtual population of subjects with diverse facial features, using computational mechanics modeling. The effect of weight, age, gender, and height on the leakage is studied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended mask size was used as a basis for comparison and was found not to be the most effective design for all subjects. Thin, feminine, and young faces benefit from mask sizes smaller than that recommended by the CDC. The results show that side-edge tuck-in of the masks could lead to a larger localized gap opening in many face categories, and is therefore not recommended for all. The perimeter leakage from the face mask worn by thin/feminine faces is mostly from the leakage area along the bottom edge of the mask and therefore, a tuck-in of the bottom edge of the mask or a mask smaller than the CDC recommended mask size are proposed as a more effective design. The leakage from the top edge of the mask is determined to be largely unaffected by mask size and tuck-in ratio, meaning that other mechanical alterations such as a nose wire strip are necessary to reduce the leakage at this site.","output":"One size fits all?: Modeling face-mask fit on population-based faces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outbreaks of infectious diseases that spread via respiratory route, e.g. influenza, are common amongst Hajj congregation in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

In this article we review the latest evidence on influenza control and discuss our experience of influenza and its prevention at Hajj and possible application to other mass gatherings. Depending on study design the attack rate of seasonal influenza at Hajj has ranged from 6% in polymerase chain reaction or culture confirmed studies to 38% in serological surveillance.

In all, there is a relatively poor evidence base for control of influenza. Until better evidence is obtained, vaccination coupled with rapid antiviral treatment of symptomatic individuals remains the mainstay of prevention at Hajj and other mass gatherings.

The article bases its arguments on the optimal currency area theory and the Mundell-Fleming model. The analytical part of the article approaches the example of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, a well-matched comparison given that they are both small open economies with a common history but also because they faced the coronavirus pandemic at the same time and were affected to a similar extent. Unlike its Czech neighbour, the Slovak Republic adopted a single currency, the Euro, in 2009 and therefore became a member of the eurozone. Therefore, the use of its own currency to mitigate the coronavirus pandemic effects can be approximated by comparing the two countries. The analysis in this article results in the identification of the following five arguments for the advantage of having an independent currency: 1) absence of an optimal monetary area in the eurozone, 2) an independent monetary policy, 3) foreign trade support, 4) mitigating the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on price level changes, 5) supporting domestic production and services.

We herein studied the field observation and statistical analysis of 10-year data of PM(2.5) and selected emitted co-pollutants (CO, NO(x), and O(3)), in the vicinity of three major Canadian airports, with moderate to cold climates. The decadal data analysis indicated that in colder climate airports, pollutants like PM(2.5) and CO accumulate disproportionally to their emissions in fall and winter, in comparison to airports in milder climates. Decadal daily averages and standard errors of PM(2.5) concentrations were as follows: Vancouver, 5.31  0.017; Toronto, 6.71  0.199; and Montreal, 7.52  0.023 g/m(3). The smallest and the coldest airport with the least flights/passengers had the highest PM(2.5) concentration. QQQ-ICP-MS/MS and HR-S/TEM analysis of aerosols near Montreal Airport indicated a wide range of emerging contaminants (Cd, Mo, Co, As, Ni, Cr, and Pb) ranging from 0.90 to 622 g/L, which were also observed in the atmosphere.

Our study investigates coagulation markers and the incidence of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients receiving recommended anticoagulation strategies. METHODS: In a retrospective single-center analysis at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, we investigated 31 adult COVID-19 patients between April 6(th) and May 13(th), 2020 and with at least one laboratory assessment of the coagulation markers prothrombin time/Quick, thrombin time, fibrinogen and D-dimers. For antithrombotic prophylaxis low-molecular-weight-heparin or unfractionated heparin was administered and two patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia received argatroban. RESULTS: We analyzed 31 patients (68% male, mean age 60 SD 15 years). 22 (71%) of these required intensive care unit treatment, 5 (16%) were hospitalized in a ward, and 4 (13%) were outpatients. Mean fibrinogen levels were markedly elevated to 6.4 SD 1.8g/l, with a peak in the third week of the disease and no significant decrease over time. D-dimers were elevated to a mean value of 5.14.4mg/l with peak levels of 6.85.3mg/l in the fourth week of disease, and a subsequent decrease. Platelet count (308136G/l) and PT/Quick (8522%) showed no significant changes over time. Sensitivity analyses for patients treated in the ICU showed that D-dimer levels were higher in this group. The results of other sensitivity analyses were comparable. Thromboembolic events were diagnosed in 4 (13%) patients and 5 (16%) patients died during the observation period.

This provides opportunities to observe changes in sports bettors' behaviour when their primary form of activity is removed and assess the impact of Covid-19 related circumstances upon gambling. METHODS: In July 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey of people who bet regularly (at least monthly) on sports before Covid-19 (n = 3866). Bi-variate analyses compared changes in gambling behaviours before and during the initial lockdown. Multi-variate logistic regression models explored associations between problem gambling (men) and moderate risk or problem gambling (MRPG) (women) with changes in Covid-19 related circumstances and changing gambling behaviours during Britain's initial 'lockdown' (March-June 2020). RESULTS: 29.8% of male sports bettors and 33.4% of female sports bettors stopped gambling altogether during the initial Covid-19 lockdown, though 17.3% of men and 16.5% of women started a new form of gambling during lockdown. Among men, adjusted odds ratios of problem gambling were higher among those starting a new gambling activity during lockdown (OR = 2.50 [95% CI 1.38-4.53]). Among women, adjusted odds ratios of MRPG were higher among those whose frequency of gambling on any activity increased during lockdown (OR = 4.21 [1.99-8.92] and among those shielding for health reasons. Poorer wellbeing was associated with problem gambling for men and MRPG for women.

The smartphone-read LFA signals for positive clinical samples tested (N = 15, with known Ct) were statistically different (p < 0.001) from negative clinical samples tested (N = 11). The translation-ready phage LFA technology combined with smartphone chemiluminescence imaging can enable the timely development of ultrasensitive, affordable point-of-care testing platforms for SARS-CoV-2 and beyond.","output":"Smartphone-Read Phage Lateral Flow Assay for Point-of-Care Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lung ultrasound (LUS) and chest radiography (CXR) are the most used chest imaging tools in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. However, the relationship between LUS and CXR is not clearly defined. The aim of our study was to describe the comparison between LUS interpretation and CXR readings in the first approach to patients suspected of COVID-19. METHODS: In the time of the first COVID-19 pandemic surge, we prospectively evaluated adult patients presenting to an emergency department complaining of symptoms raising suspicion of COVID-19. Patients were studied by LUS and only those performing also CXR were analyzed. All the patients performed viral reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). LUS studies were classified in 4 categories of probabilities, based on the presence of typical or alternative signs of COVID-19-associated interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, the CXR readings were retrospectively adapted by 2 experts in 4 categories following the standard language that describes the computed tomography (CT) findings. Patients were divided in two groups, based on the agreement of the LUS and CXR categories. Results were also compared to RT-PCR and, when available, to CT studies. RESULTS: We analyzed 139 cases (55 women, mean age 59.1  15.5 years old). The LUS vs CXR results disagreed in 60 (43.2%) cases. RT-PCR was positive in 88 (63.3%) cases. In 45 cases, a CT scan was also performed and only 4 disagreed with LUS interpretation versus 24 in the comparison between CT and CXR. In 18 cases, LUS detected signs of COVID-19 pneumonia (high and intermediate probabilities) while CXR reading was negative; in 14 of these cases, a CT scan or a RT-PCR-positive result confirmed the LUS interpretation. In 6 cases, LUS detected signs of alternative diagnoses to COVID-19 pneumonia while CXR was negative; in 4 of these cases, CT scan confirmed atypical findings. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated a strong disagreement between LUS interpretation and CXR reading in the early approach to patients suspected of COVID-19. Comparison with CT studies and RT-PCR results seems to confirm the superiority of LUS over a second retrospective reading of CXR.","output":"Descriptive analysis of a comparison between lung ultrasound and chest radiography in patients suspected of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the majority of pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases have not been critical, occurrences of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have been emerging as the pandemic progresses.

METHODS: Retrospectively collected patients with definite etiological results using nasal and pharyngeal swabs in a fever clinic. RESULTS: Overall, 1860 patients were screened, and 136 patients were enrolled. 72 (52.94%) of them were diagnosed as influenza (Flu) A virus infection. 32 (23.53%) of them were diagnosed as Flu B virus infection. 18 (13.24%) and 14 (10.29%) of them were diagnosed as COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, respectively. The COVID-19 group had a higher rate of contact with the epidemic area within 14 days and of clustering onset than other groups. Fever was the most common symptom in these patients. The ratio of fever to the highest temperature was higher in Flu A virus infection patients than in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had a lower white blood cell count and neutrophil count than Flu A virus and RSV infection groups, but higher lymphocyte count than Flu A and B virus infection groups. The COVID-19 group (83.33%) had a higher rate of pneumonia in chest CT scans than Flu A and B virus infection groups.

This review features a series of technological advancements that can significantly improve the care of patients requiring isolation. The working conditions in isolation could cause gaps or barriers in communication, fatigue, and poor documentation of provided care. The available technology has several advantages including (a) facilitating appropriate paperless documentation and communication between all health care givers working in isolation rooms or large isolation areas; (b) testing patients and staff at the bedside using smart point-of-care diagnostics (SPOCD) to confirm COVID-19 infection; (c) allowing diagnostics and treatment at the bedside through point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) and thromboelastography(TEG); (d) adapting the use of anesthetic machines and the use of volatile anesthetics.

Numerous surveys on the waste management system reveal that approximately 90% of the MSW systems are improperly disposing the wastages in open dumps and landfills. Classifying the wastages into biodegradable and non-biodegradable helps converting them into usable energy and disposing properly. The advancements of effective computational approaches like artificial intelligence and image processing provide wide range of solutions for the present problem identified in MSW management. The computational approaches can be programmed to classify wastes that help to convert them into usable energy. Existing methods of waste classification in MSW remain unresolved due to poor accuracy and higher error rate. This paper presents an experimented effective computer visionCbased MSW management solution with the help of the Internet of Things (IoT), and machine learning (ML) techniques namely regression, classification, clustering, and correlation rules for the perception of solid waste images.

ResNet V2 supports training large datasets in deep neural networks to achieve improved accuracy and reduced error rate in identity mapping. In addition, batch normalization and mixed hybrid pooling techniques are incorporated in CNN to improve stability and yield state of art performance. The proposed model identifies the type of waste and classifies them as biodegradable or non-biodegradable to collect in respective waste bins precisely. Furthermore, observation of performance metrics, accuracy, and loss ensures the effective functions of the proposed model compared to other existing models.

This has led to higher chances of infection being spread to non-COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers and an overall increased probability of cross contamination. The effects of design parameters on the performance of ventilation systems to control the spread of airborne particles in intensive care units are studied numerically. Four different cases are considered, and the spread of particles is studied. Two new criteria for the ventilation systemviz., dimensionless timescale and extraction timescaleare introduced and their performances are compared. Furthermore, an optimization process is performed to understand the effects of design variables (inlet width, velocity, and temperature) on the thermal comfort conditions (predicted mean vote, percentage of people dissatisfied, and air change effectiveness) according to suggested standard values and the relations for calculating these parameters based on the design variables are proposed. Desirability functions that are comprised of all three thermal condition parameters are used to determine the range of variables that result in thermally comfortable conditions and a maximum desirability of 0.865 is obtained. The results show that a poorly designed ventilation system acts like a perfectly stirred reactorwhich enormously increases the possibilities of contaminationand that when air is injected from the ceiling and extracted from behind the patient beds, the infection spread is least probable since the particles exit the room orders of magnitude faster.","output":"Minimizing the COVID-19 spread in hospitals through optimization of ventilation systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initial optimism regarding the development of COVID-19 vaccines has been tempered by the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2.

Globally, the occurrence of periodontal diseases such as gingivitis and chronic periodontitis is high among Indigenous people. This systematic review aims to quantify, at a global level, the prevalence of periodontal disease among Indigenous populations compared to non-Indigenous populations. METHODS: This review will only consider studies that have reported the prevalence (%) of periodontal disease among Indigenous and compared against non-Indigenous populations. Studies that have no comparative population or data only on one particular population or lack of data on periodontal clinical assessment will be excluded. An electronic search will be conducted using keywords and appropriate MeSH terms across several databases capturing both published and unpublished articles. The search will be conducted from the time of database inception to February 2021. After the initial search, duplicates will be removed, and the remaining titles and abstracts will be assessed for eligibility. The full text of eligible studies will be assessed by two independent reviewers who will also complete the critical appraisals and data extraction. Outcomes measures would be the mean prevalence (%) and standard deviation of periodontal disease among Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. From the selected studies, we will conduct a random-effects meta-analysis using standardized mean difference as the effect measure. Forest plots will be used for the visualization of differences in the prevalence of periodontitis. A subgroup analysis will be conducted based on the definition of periodontitis, age, publication type, and geographical location. Heterogeneity among studies will be assessed by I(2) and chi-square test. Eggers test and funnel plots will be used to assess publication bias.

Despite their effectiveness, SSPs in many settings are hampered by social and political opposition. We aimed to estimate the impact of closure and temporary interruption of SSP service provision on the HIV epidemic among PWID in a rural US setting.Methods: Using an agent-based model calibrated to observed surveillance data, we simulated HIV risk behaviors and transmission in adult populations who inject and do not inject drugs in Scott County, Indiana, a rural American setting that experienced a devastating HIV outbreak in 2015. We projected HIV incidence and prevalence between 2020 and 2025 for scenarios with permanent closure, delayed closure (one additional renewal for 24 months before closure), and temporary closure (representing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic) of an SSP in comparison to SSP maintenance.Findings: With sustained SSP operation, we projected an incidence rate of 0.16 per 100 person-years among the overall population (95% simulation interval: 0.08-0.29). Permanently closing the SSP would cause an average of 62 more HIV infections and a 52.0% increase in the incidence rate during 2021 to 2025, resulting in a higher prevalence of 59.0% [48.3%-68.4%] (22.0% increase) among PWID by 2025. A delayed closure (from 2023 to 2025) would increase the five-year incidence rate by 33.2%. A temporary closure (lasting 12 months) would cause 12 (32.8%) more infections during 2020 to 2021.Interpretation: Our analysis suggests that temporary interruption and permanent closure of existing SSPs operating in rural US settings may lead to rebound HIV outbreaks among PWID. To maintain control of the HIV epidemic, it will be necessary to sustain existing or implement new SSPs in combination with other prevention interventions.Funding Statement: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant number DP2DA040236 to B.D.L.M and grant number R25MH083620 to W.C.G.)Declaration of Interests: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.","output":"The Impact of Syringe Services Program Closure on the Risk of Rebound HIV Outbreaks Among People Who Inject Drugs: A Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the registration quality of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical trials for COVID-19, H1N1, and SARS.

The deficiencies in the registration of TCM clinical trials (CTs) mainly focus on a low percentage reporting detailed information about interventions (46.6%), primary outcome(s) (37.7%), and key secondary outcome(s) (18.4%) and a lack of summary result (0%). For the TCM items, none of the clinical trial registrations reported the TCM background and rationale; only 6.6% provided the TCM diagnosis criteria or a description of the TCM intervention; and 27.9% provided TCM outcome(s). CONCLUSION: Overall, although the number of registrations of TCM CTs increased, the registration quality was low. The registration quality of TCM CTs should be improved by more detailed reporting of interventions and outcomes, TCM-specific information, and sharing of the result data.","output":"Calling for improved quality in the registration of traditional Chinese medicine during the public health emergency: a survey of trial registries for COVID-19, H1N1, and SARS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant global health impact, rates of maternal to infant vertical transmission remain low (<5%). Parenchymal changes of placentas from COVID-19 infected mothers have been reported by several groups, but the localization and relative abundance of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and cellular entry machinery has not been fully characterized within larger placental tissue cohorts. METHODS: An extended placental tissue cohort including samples from 15 COVID-19 positive maternal-fetal dyads (with n = 5 cases with evidence of fetal transmission) in comparison with 10 contemporary COVID-19 negative controls. Using comparative immunofluorescence, we examined the localization and relative tissue abundance of SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein (CoV2 SP) along with the co-localization of two SARS-CoV2 viral entry proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: CoV2 SP was present within the villous placenta in COVID-19 positive pregnancies with and without evidence of fetal transmission. We further identified the predominance of ACE2 expression in comparison with TMPRSS2. Importantly, both CoV2 SP and ACE2 expression consistently localized primarily within the outer syncytiotrophoblast layer placental villi, a key physiologic interface between mother and fetus. Overall this study provides an important basis for the ongoing evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 physiology in pregnancy and highlights the importance of the placenta as a key source of primary human tissue for ongoing diagnostic and therapeutic research efforts to reduce the global burden of COVID-19.","output":"Consistent localization of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and ACE2 over TMPRSS2 predominance in placental villi of 15 COVID-19 positive maternal-fetal dyads"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the interconnectedness and vulnerability of human systems, requiring integrated transdisciplinary studies aimed at breaking unsustainable and unjust practices In this work, a horticultural collaborative production system is addressed, inspired by the community-supported agriculture (CSA) model In a highly industrialised area of Northern Italy, with significant wild land consumption, an alternative bottom-up experience is described for the provision of vegetables in a short and cooperative not-for-sale supply chain Local organic farming and just labour conditions seek ecological sustainability and social equity beyond market dynamics This CSA project contributes to the resilience of a territory currently affected by health and economic plights Its claims, limits, and potentials of a project of this kind are investigated for the first time by means of the Emergy Assessment (EMA) The socio-ecological and economic inputs in the system at issue are identified and quantified, partly eased by the transparent process of the target community, and some key indicators are calculated The new specific emergy values for the organic horticultural produce at hand are 3 15E+12 sej/kg (without labour and services), with organic manure as a leading input (37%) and 1 02E+13 sej/kg (with L&S), with labour as a leading input (38% paid, 8% voluntary) as key inputs;their calculation corrects underestimations present in some biased studies This EMA provides fruitful insights of a single replicable and/or scalable project, thus offering current barrier and future opportunities for local improvement and exportability to crisis and post-crisis scenarios, and anyway for pursuing sustainability goals","output":"Organic vegetables from community-supported agriculture in Italy: emergy assessment and potential for sustainable, just, and resilient urban-rural local food production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary care workers are the first point of contact for patients Therefore, it is critical for this group of workers to understand the significant role of personal protective equipment and the importance of adhering to proper donning, doffing, and discarding protocols in epidemic control These measures are crucial in curtailing disease transmission and the overall containment of the contagion","output":"The importance of wearing masks in curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the study was to demonstrate attitudes towards wind energy facilities in the area of the Korsze Commune.

The mixing of susceptible and infectious individuals in many high-density man-made environments such as waiting queues involves pedestrian movement, which is generally not taken into account in modeling studies of disease dynamics. In this paper, a social force-based pedestrian-dynamics approach is used to evaluate the contacts among proximate pedestrians which are then integrated with a stochastic epidemiological model to estimate the infectious disease spread in a localized outbreak. Practical application of such multiscale models to real-life scenarios can be limited by the uncertainty in human behavior, lack of data during early stage epidemics, and inherent stochasticity in the problem. We parametrize the sources of uncertainty and explore the associated parameter space using a novel high-efficiency parameter sweep algorithm. We show the effectiveness of a low-discrepancy sequence (LDS) parameter sweep in reducing the number of simulations required for effective parameter space exploration in this multiscale problem. The algorithms are applied to a model problem of infectious disease spread in a pedestrian queue similar to that at an airport security check point.

OBJECTIVE In this study, we hypothesized that atorvastatin could prevent the neurons lost in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region after transient global ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) through its anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic activities. METHOD Twenty-four male Wistar rats 12-13 weeks old and weighing 250-300 g, were divided randomly into four groups: control, I/R, vehicle (I/R treated with NaCl) and experiment (I/R treated with atorvastatin, 10 mg/kg) and rats were sacrificed 96 hours after I/R. Quantitative expression of genes (caspase 8, p53, bax, bcl2, cytochrome c) was studied. The MDA level, SOD, CAT, and GPx activities were measured with biochemical tests. To detect apoptotic cells, TUNEL and Nissl staining were performed. Mitochondria were prepared from the hippocampus rats, used to the quantification of mitochondrial ROS, ATP level, GSH content, membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and determination of mitochondrial swelling. RESULTS Atorvastatin attenuated the overexpression of bax, cytochrome C, p53, and caspase8 mRNAs and induced expression of bcl-2 mRNA (P<0.001). Atorvastatin treatment increased anti-oxidant enzyme levels (P<0.01). Treatment with atorvastatin reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells. It could decrease the cytochrome c release (P<0.01), inhibit the decrease of MMP (P<0.001) and increased the ATP level (P<0.001) in mitochondrial hippocampal in compared with I/R group. CONCLUSION Atorvastatin treatment in I/R rats decreases oxidative stress, production of ROS, apoptosis rate in neuronal cells, and improves the mitochondrial function.

Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with increased risk of thrombosis with both venous and arterial thromboembolism observed. While d-dimer elevation has been shown to be associated with thrombosis, this elevation is present in over 50% of COVID-19 infections demonstrating a clear need for more specific biomarkers of thrombosis in this population. While there are a variety of theories to explain the increased risk for thrombosis: all center on Virchow's triad, specifically hypercoagulability and inflammation. Platelets play a significant role in hypercoagulability. Immature platelets, which are thought to be hyper-reactive, may specifically be associated with thrombosis in COVID-19. It would thus be reasonable to expect immature platelet fraction (IPF) and immature platelet count (IPC) to be predictive biomarkers of thrombosis in this population. Beyond hypercoagulability, High-Sensitivity (HS) Cardiac troponin-I can be a biomarker of inflammation and may also be predictive of thrombotic events in COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between IPF, IPC, HS cardiac troponin-I and thrombotic events in COVID-19. Methods Using a single center COVID-19 data registry, we extracted all patients with COVID-19 at our single center between May 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021. Patients were stratified into two groups based on thrombotic events during hospitalization, the thrombosis and no thrombosis groups. Biomarker values, including IPF, IPC, platelet counts, d-dimer, and HS cardiac troponin I were extracted. Two-sided Wilcoxon rank test was conducted to test group differences in IPF, IPC, platelet, d-dimer, and HS cardiac troponin-I values. Results There were no significant differences in measurements of IPF at admission, peak IPF , platelet count at admission, peak platelet count, IPC at admission, and peak IPC between the thrombosis and no thrombosis groups. Minimum platelet count values were significantly lower in the thrombosis group compared to the no thrombosis group. D-dimer and troponin values were significantly higher in the thrombosis group than the no thrombosis group. (Table 1) Discussion To our knowledge this is the first study assessing the relationship between IPF, IPC, HS cardiac troponin-I and thrombosis in COVID-19. HS cardiac troponin did appear to be a predictive biomarker for thrombosis in COVID-19. This may be related to vascular inflammation playing a significant role in thrombosis. It may also be secondary to myocardial inflammation associated with severe disease in COVID-19.3 Patients with more severe disease are more prone to thrombosis. Unsurprisingly, our study corroborates evidence in the literature that d-dimer is associated with thrombotic events in COVID-19. On the other hand, IPF and IPC do not appear to be predictive biomarkers for thrombosis in this cohort. This appears consistent with the limited data assessing the relationship between IPF, IPC, and thrombosis outside of COVID-19. This does not dispel the importance of immature platelets in COVID-19, however. IPF and IPC are increased in patients with COVID-19, and our published data indicates they are predictors of COVID-19 severity. However, the relationship between immature platelets and outcomes in acute illness can be complex, as in sepsis, where the trend of IPC is associated with mortality, rather than the initial value. Future studies should delineate the relationship between trends in IPF or IPC and outcomes in COVID-19. Furthermore, it is crucial to define biomarkers of thrombosis and disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 which can potentially guide therapeutic interventions.

To date, no effective medical therapy has been established for overt rabies. The rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which is a serial vaccination against rabies starting as soon as possible after the patient was bitten by a suspected rabid animal, is the only way to prevent death. In Japan, no rabies case has been reported for about 50 years. However, rabies is epizootic in many Asian countries, where more than 50% of the rabies deaths in the world occur. The Japanese travelers who visit these countries every year may not be aware of this fact since no rabies occurs in their own country. Therefore, the risk of being bitten by a rabid animal abroad and developing rabies after returning to Japan seems to be high. All medical staff should keep in mind that imported rabies cases can occur at any time. In addition, pre-exposure vaccination against rabies should be recommended to international travelers in order to ensure the preventative effect of PEP.","output":"Rabies: a preventable but incurable disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dalam kehidupan era globalisasi saat ini terjadi suatu wabah yaitu pandemi COVID-19 dimana munculnya patogen baru yang berkembang secara pesat.

Owing to participation of multiple qualitative and quantitative attributes, the low-carbon tourism strategy (LCTS) selection process can be considered as multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. As uncertainty is usually occurred in LCTSs evaluation, the theory of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) has been established as more flexible and efficient tool to model the uncertain decision-making problems. The idea of the present study is to develop an extended method using additive ratio assessment (ARAS) framework and similarity measures in a way to find an effective solution to the decision-making problems using IVIFSs. The bases of the proposed method are the IVIFSs operators, some modifications in the traditional ARAS framework and a calculation procedure of the weights of the criteria. To calculate criterion weight, new similarity measures for IVIFSs are developed aiming at the achievement of more realistic weights. Also, a comparison is demonstrated to the currently used similarity measures in order to show the efficiency of the developed approach. To confirm that the developed IVIF-ARAS approach can be successfully employed to practical decision-making problems, a case study of LCTS selection problem is considered. The final results from the developed approach and the extant models are compared for the validation of the proposed approach in this study.","output":"Low-carbon tourism strategy evaluation and selection using interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy additive ratio assessment approach based on similarity measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE S-1 is a standard postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II or III gastric cancer in Asia. Neoadjuvant or perioperative strategies dominate in Western countries, and docetaxel has recently shown significant survival benefits when combined with other standard regimens in advanced cancer and perioperative settings. PATIENTS AND METHODS This randomized phase III study was designed to prove the superiority of postoperative S-1 plus docetaxel over S-1 alone for R0 resection of pathologic stage III gastric cancer. The sample size of 1,100 patients was necessary to detect a 7% increase in 3-year relapse-free survival as the primary end point (hazard ratio, 0.78; 2-sided  = .05;  = .2). RESULTS The second interim analysis was conducted when the number of events reached 216 among 915 enrolled patients (median follow-up, 12.5 months). Analysis demonstrated the superiority of S-1 plus docetaxel (66%) to S-1 (50%) for 3-year relapse-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.632; 99.99% CI, 0.400 to 0.998; stratified log-rank test, P < .001), and enrollment was terminated as recommended by the independent data and safety monitoring committee. Incidences of grade 3 or greater adverse events, particularly neutropenia and leukopenia, were higher in the S-1 plus docetaxel group, but all events were manageable. CONCLUSION Addition of docetaxel to S-1 is effective with few safety concerns in patients with stage III gastric cancer. The present findings may also be applicable in countries in which perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation is not standard.","output":"Addition of Docetaxel to Oral Fluoropyrimidine Improves Efficacy in Patients With Stage III Gastric Cancer: Interim Analysis of JACCRO GC-07, a Randomized Controlled Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, most preclinical HIV treatment trials use a protocol of administering repeated low-dose challenges (RLCs) of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) to macaques. Statistical analyses of treatment efficacy under the RLC protocol need to consider two confounding hypotheses, both pertinent biologically to HIV: (1) the non-infecting challenges may immunize animals against SIV; and (2) the animals may vary in intrinsic infectability (frailty). To explore the two hypotheses, a previous study (Regoes 2012) assembled a database from 7 articles with SIV-macaque treatment trials. With two explicable exceptions, Regoes concluded that the control data did not support either confounding hypothesis. Recent SIV-macaque trials present opportunities to evaluate the conclusions robustness. Accordingly, the present article assembles from 24 articles an updated database containing net survival curves from both control and treatment arms in SIV-macaque treatment trials. Broad patterns of statistical significance (at p<0.05, uncorrected for multiple testing) made it difficult to dismiss the confounding hypotheses completely in the controls. Although statistical analysis has focused on defense against variable frailty, only one set of controls showed significant variable frailty, whereas many sets showed significant immunization. As trials progressed, changes in the probability of infection per challenge were significant in 8/28 trials (1/3 trials using oral challenges; 2/4 trials using vaginal challenges; and 5/21 trials using rectal challenges). The results suggest the possibility that vaginal challenges may immunize animals faster than rectal challenges, and they also bear on previous conclusions that repeated exposure to HIV without treatment may have no effect on infectability or may even reduce it. Author Summary Many preclinical trials of HIV treatments rely on repeatedly administering low-dose SIV challenges to macaques until infection occurs. The repeated low-dose protocol reuses macaques and is more sensitive to subtle therapeutic efficacies than a protocol administering a single large dose to each macaque. The animal reuse raises some pertinent biological questions, notably: (1) do macaques have intrinsically variable infectabilities? and (2) do the repeated SIV challenges immunize macaques against infection? A 2012 study collected a database of eight macaque trials, concluding that variable infectability and immunization were at most sporadic and readily explicable. I expanded the 2012 database to twenty-eight trials, discovering that the conclusions were not robust. Although only 1/28 SIV-macaque trials showed variable infectability, 7/28 showed immunization, with few ready explanations. Statistical analysis of SIV-macaque trials has focused on the confounding effects of variable infectability to the neglect of immunization, so the expanded database provides a rich empirical resource. The trials have general medical importance because they provide a model for analyzing animal trials of infectious disease therapies and other sparse trials, e.g., for breast cancer. My findings also indirectly suggest that repeated human exposure to HIV inconsistently immunizes and can foster either immune priming or tolerance.","output":"Recent SIV-Macaque Trials: A Reassessment of Immune Priming and Varying Infectability in Repeated Low-dose Challenge Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep reinforcement learning algorithms require large and diverse datasets in order to learn successful policies for perception-based mobile navigation. However, gathering such datasets with a single robot can be prohibitively expensive. Collecting data with multiple different robotic platforms with possibly different dynamics is a more scalable approach to large-scale data collection. But how can deep reinforcement learning algorithms leverage such heterogeneous datasets? In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with hierarchically integrated models (HInt). At training time, HInt learns separate perception and dynamics models, and at test time, HInt integrates the two models in a hierarchical manner and plans actions with the integrated model. This method of planning with hierarchically integrated models allows the algorithm to train on datasets gathered by a variety of different platforms, while respecting the physical capabilities of the deployment robot at test time. Our mobile navigation experiments show that HInt outperforms conventional hierarchical policies and single-source approaches.","output":"Hierarchically Integrated Models: Learning to Navigate from Heterogeneous Robots"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The standard initial treatment for ovarian cancer is surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy and potentially maintenance therapy with avastin or inhibitors of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). While a proportion of women are cured by this approach, the vast majority will relapse and become resistant to platinum chemotherapy either initially or on subsequent treatment. There is an unmet need to improve response to treatment and quality of life in these women. TAK228 is a novel therapy that can be added to standard treatment in the participant population and the aim of the DICE trial is to assess its effectiveness. Laboratory and clinical research has shown that these ovarian cancers may respond to the molecular target of a drug such as TAK228, and there have been studies using it in other advanced solid tumours including endometrial cancer. METHODS: One hundred twenty-four eligible women will be recruited from participating research sites in the United Kingdom (UK) and Germany. Randomised participants will receive either weekly paclitaxel alone (standard treatment, n = 62) or TAK228 plus weekly paclitaxel (n = 62) until the cancer significantly worsens; there are significant adverse events or any other protocol-defined stopping criteria. Participants will be monitored for response to treatment (using radiological imaging), adverse events and quality of life during both randomised treatment and subsequent follow-up. DISCUSSION: The primary objective/endpoint of the study is to compare the two treatments in terms of progression-free survival, or the length of time that each participant is alive without the cancer significantly worsening according to defined assessment criteria. If the addition of TAK228 to weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy is shown to significantly improve this statistically, and adverse events and quality of life are not significantly worse than standard treatment, then TAK228 plus weekly paclitaxel could potentially be taken forward within the context of a larger phase III trial.

In this review, we focus on the significance of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE) as a diagnostic or post-therapeutic prognostic marker for various forms of NSCLCs. RECENT FINDINGS The lungs have the highest levels of basal RAGE expression in mammals. The physiologic RAGE in lungs may be involved in adhesion and spreading of AT-1 cells and maintenance of pulmonary homeostasis. However, high level expression of RAGE complicates various diseases including acute lung injury. In NSCLCs, while a number of studies report decreased RAGE expression, inferring a protective role, others suggest that RAGE expression may contribute to NSCLC pathogenesis. Genetic polymorphisms of RAGE are reportedly associated with NSCLC development and complications. RAGE and its polymorphic variants may be useful diagnostic or post-therapeutic prognostic markers of NSCLCs.","output":"Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) and Its Polymorphic Variants as Predictive Diagnostic and Prognostic Markers of NSCLCs: a Perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Omicron BA.2 variant has become a dominant infective strain worldwide. Receptor binding studies reveal that the Omicron BA.2 spike trimer have 11-fold and 2-fold higher potency to human ACE2 than the spike trimer from the wildtype (WT) and Omicron BA.1 strains. The structure of the BA.2 spike trimer complexed with human ACE2 reveals that all three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) in the spike trimer are in open conformation, ready for ACE2 binding, thus providing a basis for the increased infectivity of the BA.2 strain. JMB2002, a therapeutic antibody that was shown to have efficient inhibition of Omicron BA.1, also shows potent neutralization activities against Omicron BA.2. In addition, both BA.1 and BA.2 spike trimers are able to bind to mouse ACE2 with high potency. In contrast, the WT spike trimer binds well to cat ACE2 but not to mouse ACE2. The structures of both BA.1 and BA.2 spike trimer bound to mouse ACE2 reveal the basis for their high affinity interactions. Together, these results suggest a possible evolution pathway for Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants from human-cat-mouse-human circle, which could have important implications in establishing an effective strategy in combating viral infection.","output":"Structural and biochemical mechanism for increased infectivity and immune evasion of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants and their mouse origins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During intravenous sedation, a decrease in SpO2 is usually the result of respiratory failure.

In this paper, we assessed the literature involving the use of COVID-19 vaccines in cancer patients and reported the seroconversion rates as the main outcome and severity of COVID-19 infection and side effects following COVID-19 vaccination as the secondary outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed. Searches were conducted in electronic websites, databases, and journals, including Scopus, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from January 01, 2019, to November 30, 2021. Studies reporting data on the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccine in cancer patients using any human samples were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the NEWCASTLE-OTTAWA scale in the included studies. RESULTS: A total of 724 articles were identified from databases, out of which 201 articles were duplicates and were discarded. Subsequently, 454 articles were excluded through initial screening of the titles and abstracts. Moreover, 41 studies did not report the precise seroconversion rate either based on the type of cancer or after injection of a second dose of COVID vaccine. Finally, 28 articles met all the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. The overall seroconversion rates after receiving a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, based on type of cancer were 88% (95% CI, 81%-92%) and 70% (95% CI, 60%-79%) in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, respectively.

After six passages of GIBV, a minority of plaques were observed that had reverted to the larger plaque size and virus from these plaques no longer expressed EGFP. Direct sequencing of RT-PCR products derived from cells infected with the plaque-purified virus, which had lost expression of EGFP, confirmed loss of the EGFP ORF.

Despite the genetic mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome being recently investigated, its transcriptomic genetic polymorphisms at inter-host level and the viral gene expression level based on each Open Reading Frame (ORF) remains unclear. Using available High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data and based on SARS-CoV-2 infected human transcriptomic data, this study presents a high-resolution map of SARS-CoV-2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) hotspots in a viral population at inter-host level. Four throat swab samples from COVID-19 infected patients were pooled, with RNA-Seq read retrieved from SRA NCBI to detect 21 SNPs and a replacement across the SARS-CoV-2 genomic population. Twenty-two RNA modification sites on viral transcripts were identified that may cause inter-host genetic diversity of this virus. In addition, the canonical genomic RNAs of N ORF showed higher expression in transcriptomic data and RT-qPCR compared to other SARS-CoV-2 ORFs, indicating the importance of this ORF in virus replication or other major functions in virus cycle. Phylogenetic and ancestral sequence analyses based on the entire genome revealed that an Iranian strain and a Turkish isolate of SARS-COV-2 are closely related to each other and confirming that SARS-CoV-2 is possibly derived from a recombination event between SARS-CoV and Bat SARS-like CoV. Ancestor analysis of the isolates from different locations including Iran suggest shared Chinese ancestry.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 COVID-19 patients referred or admitted to Loghman-e-Hakim Hospital of Tehran, Iran, from February to June 2020. After patient selection, demographic information of all patients was recorded. Eventually, the relationship between basic demographic and clinical findings with vitamin D levels in all patients was evaluated. Results: The mean Vit-D levels in intubated and non-intubated patients were 22.95 +/- 22.23 ng/mL and 21.64 +/- 29.2 0 ng/mL, respectively(P = 0.018). In most of the outpatients (46.7%), Vit-D levels were between 21 - 30 ng/mL, and 47.6% of admitted patients had Vit-D <= 20 ng/mL.

Herein, we comprehensively reviewed existing literature and analyzed clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through searching PubMed until June 03, 2020, we identified 16 relevant case studies (33 cases) from a total of 45 studies that have reported on patients with COVID-19 and hematologic malignancies. We investigated the clinical and laboratory characteristics including type of hematologic malignancies, initial symptoms, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes. Then, we compared those characteristics and outcomes of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19 to the general population infected with COVID-19. RESULTS: The median age was 66-year-old. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was the most common type of hematologic malignancy (39.4%). Fever was the most common symptom (75.9%). Most patients had normal leukocyte counts (55.6%), lymphocytosis (45.4%), and normal platelet counts (68.8%). In comparison to patients with COVID-19 without underlying hematologic malignancies, dyspnea was more prevalent (45.0 vs. 24.9%, p=0.025). Leukocytosis (38.9 vs. 9.8%, p=0.001), lymphocytosis (45.4 vs. 8.2%, p=0.001), and thrombocytopenia (31.3 vs. 11.4%, p=0.036) were significantly more prevalent and lymphopenia (18.2 vs. 57.4%, p=0.012) less prevalent in patients with hematologic malignancies. There were no clinical and laboratory characteristics predicting mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies. Mortality was much higher in patients with hematologic malignancies compared to those without this condition (40.0 vs. 3.6%, p<0.001).

Unfortunately, little attention has been given, neither has extant literature adequately covered the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak as it directly affects households in a rural community in Nigeria.Design/methodology/approachThis study proceeded from on both a qualitative and quantitative method and adopted a mixed-method and case study research design. Data for this study was collected through primary and secondary data. Primary data for this study was collected through a questionnaire and focus group discussions (FGD). The questionnaire used for this study was a validated instrument designed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to measure food security amongst households. The USDA households instrument was used and then modified to access the food security status of households during the lockdown.FindingsFindings from this study revealed that households, in general, were categorised as having very low food security during the lockdown as they testified to all the food insecure conditions. In general, the food intake of household members reported irregular eating patterns as the household lacked the money to purchase food. This study further indicated that a high number of respondents see violence as a means of attaining food. Extreme volatility in their inability to access food as a result of food shortages and the inability to benefit from government palliatives has been found to trigger incidents of conflict and malnutrition on households.Research limitations/implicationsThis method was sampling method was adopted because of the compulsory and constitutional lockdown imposed by the government to curb the spread of the novel COVID-19 which limited the movement of the researcher to other households in the community which proved to be limited during the time this research was carried limiting the scope of the sample size.Originality/valueThis research adopted mixed-method research and was written by the researchers who did the study.

Because RSV-induced pulmonary disease is associated with immunopathology, we evaluated the role of IL-10 in modulating the RSV-specific immune response. We found that IL-10 protein levels in the lung were increased following acute RSV infection, with maximum production corresponding to the peak of the virus-specific T cell response. The majority of IL-10-producing cells in the lung during acute RSV infection were CD4(+) T cells. The IL-10-producing CD4(+) T cells included Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, Foxp3(-) CD4(+) T cells that coproduce IFN-, and Foxp3(-) CD4(+) T cells that do not coproduce IFN-. RSV infection of IL-10-deficient mice resulted in more severe disease, as measured by increased weight loss and airway resistance, as compared with control mice. We also observed an increase in the magnitude of the RSV-induced CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell response that correlated with increased disease severity in the absence of IL-10 or following IL-10R blockade. Interestingly, IL-10R blockade during acute RSV infection altered CD4(+) T cell subset distribution, resulting in a significant increase in IL-17A-producing CD4(+) T cells and a concomitant decrease in Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. These results demonstrate that IL-10 plays a critical role in modulating the adaptive immune response to RSV by limiting T-cell-mediated pulmonary inflammation and injury.","output":"Multiple CD4+ T cell subsets produce immunomodulatory IL-10 during respiratory syncytial virus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Male sex and older age have been reported to be associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19. It was postulated that estrogens may play a role in reducing the severity of the disease and may therefore offer a treatment option for COVID-19 patients. However, more female cases and deaths from COVID-19 have been recorded in Canada. To determine the potential role of estrogens, we analyzed COVID-19 data from Canada, focusing on the impact of sex and age. Although the overall incidence rate is higher in females than in males, when several high risk groups, including health care workers and long-term care residences, which are predominantly females, were excluded, we found that females had a lower incidence rate than males between the ages of 20s to 70s. Interestingly, this sex-based difference is more evident in females of the reproductive ages (20-49) than in postmenopausal patients (60s or older). Males have significantly higher hospitalization, ICU admission, and case fatality rates; however, a greater difference was observed in the older age groups. Finally, symptom manifestation varied between sexes. Some of the symptoms, which were more frequently observed in patients who recovered than patients who died, were more commonly observed in females of the reproductive age compared to their male counterparts. Since only females of the reproductive age have much higher circulating estrogens than males, these findings suggest that estrogens may play a role in reducing COVID-19 incidence and in the development of symptoms, especially those related to better survival.","output":"Incidence, clinical features, and outcomes of COVID-19 in Canada: impact of sex and age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past years, short anti-microbial peptides have drawn growing attention in the research and trade literature because they are usually capable of killing a broad spectrum of pathogens by employing unique mechanisms of action. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-bacterial effects of a previously designed peptide named PVP towards the clinical strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vitro. Secondary structure, cytotoxicity, and membrane-permeabilizing effects of the peptide were also assessed. PVP had a tendency to adopt alpha-helical conformation based upon structural predictions and circular dichroism spectroscopy (in 50% trifluoroethanol). The peptide showed MIC values ranging from 1 to 16 g/mL against 10 strains of MRSA. In contrast to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, PVP at sub-lethal concentration (1 g/mL) did not provoke the development of peptide resistance after 14 serial passages. Remarkably, 1 h of exposure to 4  MBC of PVP (8 g/mL) was sufficient for total bacterial clearance, whereas 4  MBC of vancomycin (8 g/mL) failed to totally eradicate bacterial cells, even after 8 h. PVP showed negligible cytotoxicity against human dermal fibroblasts at concentrations required to kill the MRSA strains. The results of flow cytometric analysis and fluorescence microscopy revealed that PVP caused bacterial membrane permeabilization, eventually culminating in cell death. Owing to the potent anti-bacterial activity, fast bactericidal kinetics, and negligible cytotoxicity, PVP has the potential to be used as a candidate antibiotic for the topical treatment of MRSA infections.","output":"Anti-Staphylococcal and cytotoxic activities of the short anti-microbial peptide PVP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model is extensively used for the study of the spread of infectious diseases.

Data collection was done from 10(th) October to 9th November 2020 after taking ethical approval from the concerned authorities. Data was analysed using SPSS v. 19.0. RESULTS: Two-hundred-forty responses were received with a response rate of 63%. Female participants (62.8%) were in majority and most of the participants were working in urban (88.5%) or semi-urban (9%) locality in either teaching (35.9%) or tertiary care hospitals (34.6%). Seventy-three percent of the doctors didnt receive formal training with more than half of the doctors reporting non-availability of infrastructure and specific hardware. A large number of the participants were concerned regarding the non-availability of regulatory bodies, evaluations and accreditations of the service providers, the risks of malpractice, missed-diagnosis, prescription errors and medico-legal issues. The availability of specific infrastructure was statistically related to the hospital setup, locality and the specialty of the participants. Lack of technological literacy and infrastructure were considered the main constraints for the public in using telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Evidence of effectiveness of telemedicine across different fields is inconsistent and lacks technical, legal, cultural and ethical considerations.

Factors that predict poor prognosis in this disease have not yet been sufficiently investigated. OBJECTIVES We examined the characteristics and short-term clinical outcomes of patients with AIT (up to six months from diagnosis). We evaluated the relationship between T3 and T4 levels at time of presentation and complications associated with AIT. METHODS A retrospective epidemiological study was conducted reviewing all cases diagnosed with thyrotoxicosis and amiodarone consumption of patients treated in the Carmel Medical Center between the years 2004-2008. We examined the characteristics of patients who tend to develop AIT. In addition, we examined whether T3 and T4 levels at the time of presentation were a predictor of a poor prognosis. Three major complications associated with AIT were defined as primary outcomes within six months of diagnosis: 1. mortality; 2. development of AIT-related complications that required hospitalization; 3. the need for thyroidectomy. RESULTS A total of 400 patients were diagnosed with thyrotoxicosis and consumed amiodarone. However, only 39 patients met the definition of AIT. The composite outcome of mortality, AIT-related complications and thyroidectomy were found in the vast majority of patients (94.8%, 37 out of 39 participants); 3 (7.6%) died and 35 (89.7%) were hospitalized with AIT-related complications and 8 (20.5%) required thyroidectomy. We found a statistically significant relationship between high T4 levels (above 64.3 mcg/dL or above 3 times the upper limit of the norm) and the composite of two main endpoints: mortality and the need for thyroidectomy in the first half year of diagnosis (P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS AIT is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. An elevated level of free T4 reflects the severity of AIT. In patients with significantly increased T4 values, an early surgical intervention should be considered.","output":"[AMIODARONE-INDUCED THYROTOXICOSIS - RISK FACTORS AND PREDICTORS OF OUTCOME: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the outbreak of COVID-19, an overabundance of information related to the virus was released through social media.

For instance, CT and MRI have advantages over each other in terms of imaging quality, artifacts, and output characteristics that lead to differential diagnosis. The capacity of current segmentation techniques is only allow to work for an individual domain due to their differences. However, the models that are capable of working on all modalities are essentially needed for a complete solution. Furthermore, robustness is drastically affected by the number of samples in the training step, especially for deep learning models. Hence, there is a necessity that all available data regardless of data domain should be used for reliable methods. For this purpose, this manuscript aims to implement a novel model that can learn robust representations from cross-domain data by encapsulating distinct and shared patterns from different modalities. Precisely, covariate shift property is retained with structural modification and adversarial loss where sparse and rich representations are obtained. Hence, a single parameter set is used to perform cross-domain segmentation task. The superiority of the proposed method is that no information related to modalities are provided in either training or inference phase. The tests on CT and MRI liver data acquired in routine clinical workflows show that the proposed model outperforms all other baseline with a large margin. Experiments are also conducted on Covid-19 dataset that it consists of CT data where significant intra-class visual differences are observed.

The purpose of this paper is to characterise growth and metabolic performance of BSF larvae on substrate moisture contents from 45 to 85%. Larvae developed into prepupae only at 45-75% substrate moisture content. Within this interval, the maximal specific growth rate was highest (0.73 day-1), the growth period shortest (13 days), and the maximal dry weight lowest (88 mg) at 45% moisture content. Differences in cost of growth and maintenance were not observed at the different substrate moisture contents, and differences in larval performance were likely associated to differences in co-occurring microbial activities. As much as 22% of the substrate carbon was emitted as CO2 at 45% moisture content by microorganisms, measured as the difference between total respiration and larval respiration, whereas microbial CO2 production amounted to only 3% of the substrate carbon at 75% moisture content. As consequence of the high specific growth rate and short growth phase, the overall net growth efficiency was higher at 45% moisture content (0.62) than at 75% moisture content (0.52). Overall, the metabolic performance of the BSF larvae was insensitive to differences in substrate moisture content.

Research has recently proven that skeletal muscle can also release extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the circulation following a bout of exercise. However, EVs potential role, including as a biomarker, in the response to eccentric resistance exercise stimulus remains unclear. Methods: Twelve (younger, n=7, 27.01.5years and older, n=5, 63.01.0years) healthy, physically active males, undertaking moderate, regular physical activity (3C5 times per week) performed a unilateral high intensity eccentric exercise protocol. Venous plasma was collected for assessment of EVs and creatine kinase (CK) prior to EIMD, immediately after EIMD, and 1C72h post-EIMD, and maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) were assessed at all time points, except 1 and 2h post-EIMD. Results: A significant effect of both time (p=0.005) and group (p<0.001) was noted for MVIC, with younger participants MVIC being higher throughout. Whilst a significant increase was observed in DOMS in the younger group (p=0.014) and in the older group (p=0.034) following EIMD, no significant differences were observed between groups. CK was not different between age groups but was altered following the EIMD (main effect of time p=0.026), with increased CK seen immediately post-, at 1 and 2h post-EIMD. EV count tended to be lower in older participants at rest, relative to younger participants (p=0.056), whilst EV modal size did not differ between younger and older participants pre-EIMD. EIMD did not substantially alter EV modal size or EV count in younger or older participants; however, the alteration in EV concentration (Count) and EV modal size (Mode) between post-EIMD and pre-EIMD negatively associated with CK activity. No significant associations were noted between MVIC or DOMS and either Count or Mode of EVs at any time point. Conclusion: These findings suggest that profile of EV release, immediately following exercise, may predict later CK release and play a role in the EIMD response. Exercise-induced EV release profiles may therefore serve as an indicator for subsequent muscle damage.","output":"Preliminary Investigations Into the Effect of Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage on Systemic Extracellular Vesicle Release in Trained Younger and Older Men"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is largely caused by airborne transmission, a phenomenon that rapidly gained the attention of the scientific community.

We follow the position and evaporation of thousands of respiratory droplets by massive state-of-the-art numerical simulations of the airflow caused by a typical cough.

Methods: All SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive persons from April 16 to December 31, 2020 with a PCR-positive swab &gt;=14 days after the first-positive antibody test were investigated for evidence of reinfection. Viral genome sequencing was conducted for paired viral specimens to confirm reinfection. Incidence of reinfection was compared to incidence of infection in the complement cohort of those who were antibody-negative. Findings: Among 43,044 antibody-positive persons who were followed for a median of 16.3 weeks (range: 0-34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) had at least one PCR positive swab &gt;=14 days after the first-positive antibody test. Of these individuals, 129 (41.1%) had supporting epidemiological evidence for reinfection. Reinfection was next investigated using viral genome sequencing. Applying the viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, the incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56-0.78). Incidence rate of reinfection versus month of follow-up did not show any evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of follow-up. Meanwhile, in the complement cohort of 149,923 antibody-negative persons followed for a median of 17.0 weeks (range: 0-45.6), incidence rate of infection was estimated at 13.69 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 13.22-14.14). Efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated at 95.2% (95% CI: 94.1-96.0%). Reinfections were less severe than primary infections. Only one reinfection was severe, two were moderate, and none were critical or fatal. Most reinfections (66.7%) were diagnosed incidentally through random or routine testing, or through contact tracing.

Patients were assessed with two different scales: the MGTS, and the INCB-MG chosen as gold standard and from whom MGTS was partially derived. Visit in presence with INCB-MG and televisit with MGTS were performed consecutively. Televisit was conducted by another neurologist between two rooms. A blind method was adopted. The strength of correlation was determined by the correlation coefficient (r);analysis of covariance (ANOVA-Kruskal Wallis test) was used to compare subgroups. Significance was set to p<0,05. Results: 131 patients were included in the study, 71 females, 60 males. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the INCB-MG scale and the MGTS was 0.825 (p < 0.001), indicating a very strong correlation between them. Different items showed different correlations from low to high (0,32 to 0,80). As expected correlation was lower between items with different evaluation modality (anamnestic vs clinical). Conclusions: The MGTS demonstrated a good correlation with INCB. It is reliable and has demonstrated construct validity.","output":"Development and validation of the myasthenia gravis telescore (MGTS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We briefly review the literature on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chain decisions.

People get scared on seeing the posts related to COVID-19 on the social media. This paper focusses on this issue and applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on Sina Weibo data to classify COVID-19-related information into seven categories including warning and advice, notice and action, contribution of money, products or services, emotional support, looking for help, expressing and assessing doubts and counter-rumours based on situational information. Only situational intelligence is of use to the public and the authorities to respond to the outbreak. It is, therefore, necessary to recognise them and comprehend how it is being distributed on social media, so that proper information publication techniques can be updated about the COVID-19 outbreak. The informative efficiency of word embedding is tested and compared with a Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach based on classification accuracy. The initial findings indicate the guaranteed capability of the textual data in the overview of various stages of the outbreak. Emergency response reviews from social media after the epidemic offer useful insights about effective public health conditions. On Sina Weibo, the influential Chinese social media, posts with negative feelings are useful in analysing public issues. About 999,978 randomly chosen COVID-19 based Weibo articles are reviewed from 1 January 2020 to 18 February 2020.

We attempted to predict the scale of the latter half of the pandemic based on real data using the ratio between the early and latter halves from countries where the pandemic is largely over. We collected daily pandemic data from China, South Korea, and Switzerland and subtracted the ratio of pandemic days before and after the disease apex day of COVID-19. We obtained the ratio of pandemic data and created multiple regression models for the relationship between before and after the apex day. We then tested our models using data from the first wave of the disease from 14 countries in Europe and the US. We then tested the models using data from these countries from the entire pandemic up to March 30, 2021. Results indicate that the actual number of cases from these countries during the first wave mostly fall in the predicted ranges of liniar regression, excepting Spain and Russia. Similarly, the actual deaths in these countries mostly fall into the range of predicted data. Using the accumulated data up to the day of apex and total accumulated data up to March 30, 2021, the data of case numbers in these countries are falling into the range of predicted data, except for data from Brazil. The actual number of deaths in all the countries are at or below the predicted data. In conclusion, a linear regression model built with real data from countries or regions from early pandemics can predict pandemic scales of the countries where the pandemics occur late.

However, children and paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) were affected indirectly. We analysed the impact of the pandemic on PICU admission patterns and patient characteristics in the UK and Ireland. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all admissions to PICUs in children < 18 years during JanCDec 2020, using data collected from 32 PICUs via a central database (PICANet). Admission patterns, case-mix, resource use, and outcomes were compared with the four preceding years (2016C2019) based on the date of admission. RESULTS: There were 16,941 admissions in 2020 compared to an annual average of 20,643 (range 20,340C20,868) from 2016 to 2019. During 2020, there was a reduction in all PICU admissions (18%), unplanned admissions (20%), planned admissions (15%), and bed days (25%). There was a 41% reduction in respiratory admissions, and a 60% reduction in children admitted with bronchiolitis but an 84% increase in admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis during 2020 compared to the previous years. There were 420 admissions (2.4%) with either PIMS-TS or COVID-19 during 2020. Age and sex adjusted prevalence of unplanned PICU admission reduced from 79.7 (2016C2019) to 63.1 per 100,000 in 2020. Median probability of death [1.2 (0.5C3.4) vs. 1.2 (0.5C3.4) %], length of stay [2.3 (1.0C5.5) vs. 2.4 (1.0C5.7) days] and mortality rates [3.4 vs. 3.6%, (risk-adjusted OR 1.00 [0.91C1.11, p = 0.93])] were similar between 2016C2019 and 2020. There were 106 fewer in-PICU deaths in 2020 (n = 605) compared with 2016C2019 (n = 711). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a high-quality international database allowed robust comparisons between admission data prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant reduction in prevalence of unplanned admissions, respiratory diseases, and fewer child deaths in PICU observed may be related to the targeted COVID-19 public health interventions during the pandemic.

The purpose of this study was to examine the variables that affect total joint arthroplasty reimbursement. Along with standard economic variables, we include unique health-care variables. Given the focus on value in the Affordable Care Act, the model examines the relationship of the quality of care to total joint arthroplasty reimbursement. We hoped to find that reimbursement patterns reward quality and reflect standard economic principles. METHODS Multivariable regression was performed to identify variables that correlate with Medicare reimbursement for total joint arthroplasty. Inpatient charge or reimbursement data on Medicare reimbursements were available for 2,750 hospitals with at least 10 discharges for uncomplicated total joint arthroplasty from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for fiscal year 2011. Reimbursement variability was examined by using the Dartmouth Atlas to group institutions into hospital referral regions and hospital service areas. Independent variables were taken from the Dartmouth Atlas, CMS, the WWAMI (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, Idaho) Rural Health Research Center, and the United States Census. RESULTS There were 427,207 total joint arthroplasties identified, with a weighted mean reimbursement of $14,324.84 (range, $9,103 to $38,686). Nationally, the coefficient of variation for reimbursements was 0.19. The regression model accounted for 52.5% of reimbursement variation among providers. The total joint arthroplasty provider volume (p < 0.001) and patient satisfaction (p < 0.001) were negatively correlated with reimbursement. Government ownership of a hospital (p < 0.001) and higher Medicare costs (p < 0.001) correlated positively with reimbursement. CONCLUSIONS Medicare reimbursements for total joint arthroplasty are highly variable. Greater reimbursement was associated with lower patient volume, lower patient satisfaction, a healthier patient population, and government ownership of a hospital. As value-based reimbursement provisions of the Affordable Care Act are implemented, there will be dramatic changes in total joint arthroplasty reimbursements. To meet these changes, providers should expect qualities such as high patient volume, willingness to care for sicker patient populations, patient satisfaction, safe outcomes, and procedural demand to correlate with their reimbursement. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Practicing orthopaedic surgeons and hospital administrators should be aware of discrepancies in inpatient reimbursement for total joint arthroplasty from Medicare. Furthermore, these discrepancies are not associated with typical economic factors. These findings warrant further investigation and collaboration between policymakers and providers to develop value-based reimbursement.","output":"Medicare Reimbursement for Total Joint Arthroplasty: The Driving Forces."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus infection, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2, causes daunting diseases that can be fatal because of lung failure and systemic cytokine storm. The development of coronavirus-evoked pneumonia is associated with excessive inflammatory responses in the lung, known as cytokine storms, which results in pulmonary edema, atelectasis, and acute lung injury (ALI) or fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). No drugs are available to suppress overly immune response-mediated lung injury effectively. In light of the low toxicity and its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activity, it is plausible to speculate that curcumin could be used as a therapeutic drug for viral pneumonia and ALI/ARDS. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the mounting evidence obtained from preclinical studies using animal models of lethal pneumonia where curcumin exerts protective effects by regulating the expression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and COX-2, promoting the apoptosis of PMN cells, and scavenging the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which exacerbates the inflammatory response.

To identify key process of care measures that could be linked to changes in diet, we undertook a secondary analysis of a Canadian pre-post study of lifestyle treatment of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Diet counselling process measures were documented and association with diet quality changes after 3 months were assessed. Results of the primary study showed 19% reversal of MetS after 1 year. METHODS: Registered dietitians (RDs) reported on contact time, specific food behaviour goals (FBG), behaviour change techniques (BCT; adapted from the Michie CALO-RE taxonomy) and teaching resources at each contact. Diet quality was measured by 2005 Canadian Healthy Eating Index (HEI-C) and assessed for possible associations with individual BCT and FBG. RESULTS: Food behaviour goals associated with improved HEI-C at 3 months were: poultry more than red meat, increased plant protein, increased fish, increased olive oil, increased fruits and vegetables, eating breakfast, increased milk and alternatives, healthier fats, healthier snacks and increased nuts, with an adverse association noted for more use (> 2 times/ 3 months) of the balanced meal concept (F test; p < 0.001). Of 16 BCT, goal setting accounted for 15% of all BCT recorded, yet more goal setting (> 3 times/3 months) was associated with poorer HEI-C at 3 months (F test; p = 0.007). Only self-monitoring, feedback on performance and focus on past success were associated with improved HEI-C. CONCLUSIONS: These results identify key aspects of process that impact diet quality. Documentation of both FBG and BCT is highly relevant in diet counselling and a summary diet quality score is a promising target for assessing short-term counselling success.

About 20% (197) of the hybridomas specific for TGE virus produced neutralizing MAbs specific for site A, which was one of the antigenically dominant determinants. Site A was differentiated in three antigenic subsites: a, b and c, by characterization of 11 MAb resistant (mar) mutants, that were defined by 8, 3, and 3 MAbs, respectively. These subsites were further subdivided in epitopes. A total of 11 epitopes were defined in E2 glycoprotein, eight of which were critical for virus neutralization. Neutralizing MAbs were obtained only when native virus was used to immunize mice, although to produce hybridomas mice immunizations were made with antigen in the native, denatured, or mixtures of native and denatured form. All neutralizing MAbs reacted to conformational epitopes. The antigenic structure of the E2-glycoprotein has been defined with murine MAbs, but the antigenic sites were relevant in the swine, the natural host of the virus, because porcine sera reacted against these sites. MAbs specific for TGE virus site C reacted to non-immune porcine sera. This reactivity was not directed against porcine immunoglobulins.

In a concurrent inpatient cohort of 7933 hospitalized with COVID\\\\19, we tested their association with in\\\\hospital mortality. The robustness of the observations was assessed in a contemporary cohort (MayCAugust). In the outpatient study, neither ACE inhibitors (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 0.53C1.13, P=0.18) nor ARBs (HR, 0.88; 0.61C1.26, P=0.48) were associated with hospitalization risk.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading worldwide, and WHO declared the outbreak of this disease a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Though some of the countries have succeeded in slowing down the rate of the spread of this pandemic, most the countries across the globe are still continuing to experience an increasing trend in the growth and spread of this deadly disease. Hence, in the current scenario, is has now become essential to control and finally irradicate this deadly disease using an effective vaccine. One can expect the prominent role of already available antivirals, antibodies and anti-inflammatory drugs in the market, in this pandemic. Immunomodulatory and biological therapeutics are also in the high expectations to combat COVID-19. RNA based vaccines might be more advantageous over traditional vaccines, to deal with the pandemic threat. Aiming towards this direction, clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine are currently underway all across the globe. Currently, about 150 health related organizations and research labs are in the progress for the evolution of COVID-19 vaccines, globally.

However, because of their historical and geo-civilizational ties, India has focused on development diplomacy in general and education diplomacy (E.D) in particular to improve educational infrastructures.","output":"The Double Whammy of Pandemic and War: A Systematic Review of Indias Education Diplomacy to Address Educational Inequities in Afghanistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review article concerns the production of recombinant antibody fragments for applications mainly in the diagnostic sector. The so-called \\"point of care diagnostics\\" is very important for timely diagnosis and treatment, thus being able to save lives and resources. There is intense pressure for more accurate and less expensive rapid diagnostic tests, with a value preferably <$1. Thus, the large-scale cost-effective production of recombinant antibodies is vital. The importance of Escherichia coli toward the production of inexpensive rapid tests will be explained in this review paper. Details about the different strains of E. coli, the strategies used for the insertion and the expression of recombinant proteins, and the challenges that still exist are provided. Afterward, the importance of the expression scale and culture parameters in the final yield of the antibodies are examined. From this analysis, it appears that for good yields of recombinant antibodies, aside from appropriate gene transfer and expression, the culturing parameters are of paramount importance. Larger scale production is more favorable, mainly due to the higher cell densities that can be achieved. Yields of functional Fab fragments in the range of 10-20 mg/L are considered good in shake flasks, whereas in bioreactors can be up to 1-2 g/L. An amount of 10-500 mg of such antibody per million rapid tests is required. Despite the substantial importance of the production of the antibodies and their fragments, their downstream processing should be appropriately considered from the beginning for achieving the target value of the final rapid diagnostic tests.","output":"Escherichia coli as an antibody expression host for the production of diagnostic proteins: significance and expression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Besides short-term non-genomic effects, the G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) also mediates long-term genomic effects of estrogen.

With the exponential increase of patients worldwide, the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is being better defined and new symptoms are emerging. Numerous reports are documenting the occurrence of different cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To provide a brief overview of cutaneous lesions associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A literature search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases up to 30 April 2020. This narrative review summarizes the available data regarding the clinical and histological features of COVID-19-associated skin manifestations. RESULTS: The literature reports showed a great heterogeneity in COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations, as well as in their latency periods and associated extracutaneous symptoms. Pathogenic mechanisms are unknown, although the roles of a hyperactive immune response, complement activation and microvascular injury have been hypothesized. Based on our experience and the literature data, we subdivided the reported cutaneous lesions into six main clinical patterns: (i) urticarial rash; (ii) confluent erythematous-maculopapular-morbilliform rash; (iii) papulovesicular exanthem; (iv) chilblain-like acral pattern; (v) livedo reticularis-livedo racemosa-like pattern; and (vi) purpuric 'vasculitic' pattern. These six patterns can be merged into two main groups: the first - inflammatory and exanthematous - includes the first three groups listed above, and the second includes the vasculopathic and vasculitic lesions of the last three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The possible presence of cutaneous findings leading to suspect COVID-19 puts dermatologists in a relevant position.

Our aim was to compare effectiveness between PCs and CTs by performing the first randomized controlled trial (RCT). We hypothesize PCs work equally as well as CTs in management of traumatic HTX/HPTX. METHODS: Prospective RCT comparing 14Fr PCs to 28C32Fr CTs for management of traumatic HTX/HPTX from 07/2015 to 01/2018. We excluded patients requiring emergency tube placement or who refused. Primary outcome was failure rate defined as retained HTX or recurrent PTX requiring additional intervention. Secondary outcomes included initial output (IO), tube days and insertion perception experience (IPE) score on a scale of 1C5 (1 = tolerable experience, 5 = worst experience). Unpaired Students t-test, chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were utilized with significance set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were enrolled. Baseline characteristics between PC patients (N = 20) and CT patients (N = 23) were similar. Failure rates (10% PCs vs. 17% CTs, P = 0.49) between cohorts were similar. IO (median, 650 milliliters[ml]; interquartile range[IR], 375C1087; for PCs vs. 400 ml; IR, 240C700; for CTs, P = 0.06), and tube duration was similar, but PC patients reported lower IPE scores (median, 1, I can tolerate it; IR, 1C2) than CT patients (median, 3, It was a bad experience; IR, 3C4, P = 0.001).

Postoperative care is usually managed by nonexpert clinicians. Prolonged decannulation is associated with a high incidence of complications. At present, no clinical protocol exists to guide clinicians through decannulation. To address this deficiency, we developed a low-risk tracheotomy clinical pathway. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of our low-risk tracheotomy clinical pathway on the time to decannulation and to determine its safety and sustainability by assessing the incidence of adverse events. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Our study combined retrospective and prospective cohorts from July 1, 2008, through January 31, 2012. Low-risk adult patients undergoing tracheotomy at a tertiary care hospital constituted the study population. A baseline cohort of 26 patients underwent retrospective assessment. After development of the pathway, a pilot group of 34 consecutive patients underwent evaluation; of these, 13 were ineligible because of high-risk factors, which included potential upper airway obstruction, unfavorable neck anatomy, or medical factors such as coagulopathy. To assess the sustainability of the pathway, a follow-up cohort underwent assessment. Of 107 consecutive patients, 39 met the low-risk criteria. Length of follow-up was 30 days after decannulation. INTERVENTION The low-risk tracheotomy clinical pathway, which provides a stepwise approach to decannulation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Total time to decannulation (in days). We hypothesized that the pathway would reduce the total time to decannulation. The secondary outcome constituted adverse events. All hypotheses were formulated before data collection. RESULTS Mean (SD) total time to decannulation in the baseline cohort was 15.50 (12.08) days. After implementation of the pathway in the pilot cohort, mean (SD) total time to decannulation decreased to 5.74 (2.79) days (P < .001). In the follow-up cohort, mean (SD) total time to decannulation was 8.13 (7.09) days (P = .003). We found no association between adverse events and use of the pathway. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our low-risk tracheotomy clinical pathway is associated with a sustainable decrease in total time to decannulation without any associated increase in adverse events. We therefore believe that this pathway is a safe and effective tool to guide clinicians in the management of tracheotomy.","output":"Changing practice and improving care using a low-risk tracheotomy clinical pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic is increasingly being recognized in infants and some develop cytokine storm mediated tissue damage.

A batch reactor with a horizontal furnace was used to mediate the thermal decomposition of PP-IG. Enhanced surface area and porosity value of PP-IG derived char were obtained via an optimised slow pyrolysis approach. The results showed that the amount of yielded char was inversely proportional to the temperature. This process relied heavily on the process parameters, especially pyrolytic temperature. Additionally, as the heating rate decreased, as well as longer isothermal residence time, the char yields were increased. Optimised temperature for maximum char yields was recorded. The enhanced SBET values for the char and its pore volume were collected, ~24 m(2) g(?1) and ~0.08 cm(3) g(?1), respectively. The char obtained at higher temperatures display higher volatilisation and carbonisation.

First and second wave evaluations showed an increase in mental health problems and a reduction of quality of life in adolescents. In August 2021, two vaccines against COVID-19 were approved for adolescents aged 12-17 years in Germany. Aim of the study was to assess mental health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after 1.5 years of COVID-19 pandemic in adolescents who decided to receive a vaccination. Methods: In the German region of Siegen-Wittgenstein, all students from 12-17 years from secondary level schools, vocational schools and universities were offered a prioritized vaccination against COVID-19. Mental health and HRQoL were assessed at the first vaccination appointment by self- and parental report. Adolescents and their parents completed the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the KIDSCREEN-10. Results: Data from 1412 adolescents (49.2% female, 47.7% male;mean age 14.3 years, SD=1.64) and 908 parents were collected. Mean self-reported HRQoL was T=53.7 (SD=11.2), in boys significantly higher than in girls (56.0 vs. 51.3), and significantly higher in younger (12-14 years) than in older (15-17 years) adolescents (56.2 vs. 51.5). Parental-reported HRQoL was T=51.8 (SD=12.8). In total, 18.5% of adolescents reported clinically relevant psychological symptoms, especially peer problems (23.7%), emotional problems (16.7%) and hyperactivity (17.2%). Girls reported significantly higher scores on emotional, peer and total problems than boys, whereas younger adolescents reported more hyperactivity and less emotional and peer problems than older ones. Comparing the present data to evaluations after the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Germany, adolescents facing vaccination after the third wave rated a higher HRQoL and reported less mental health problems. The data from the present study are comparable to those from pre-COVID evaluations. Conclusion: After 1.5 years of living with the pandemic, adolescents may have adapted to the changes in everyday life which has lowered the anticipated stress. Further, the relaxation of restrictions, better school organization and the prospect of the vaccination may have increased optimism, wellbeing and contentment, leading to declining but still alarming rates of psychological symptoms.","output":"Mental Health and Health-related Quality of Life in German Adolescents After the Third Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the robustness of the optimal lockdown strategy to the postulated social welfare criterion.

AIM AND METHODS: A narrative review which aims to provide a summary and assessment of vitamin D nutritional status data globally. This review divides the world into the Food and Agriculture Organisations (FAO) major regions: the Americas, Europe, Oceania, Africa and Asia. Emphasis was placed on published data on the prevalence of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) < 25/30 and <50 nmol/L (reflecting vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy, respectively) as well as vitamin D intake, where possible from nationally representative surveys. RESULTS: Collating data from the limited number of available representative surveys from individual countries might suggest a relatively low overall prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in South America, Oceania and North America, whereas there is more moderate prevalence in Europe and Asia, and possibly Africa. Overall, the prevalence of serum 25(OH)D < 25/30 and <50 nmol/L ranges from ~5 to 18% and 24 to 49%, respectively, depending on FAO world region. Usual intakes of vitamin D can also vary by FAO world region, but in general, with a few exceptions, there are very high levels of inadequacy of vitamin D intake.

Are there any links between sustainability and records management and archives programs? And, to what extent are records managers, archivists and technologists engaged in climate action? The paper also provides background on climate change in the Canadian and global contexts, defines relevant terminology, and presents a literature review that positions sustainability, adaptation and mitigation in relation to records management and archives.Design/methodology/approachThe paper is based on qualitative participatory research involving expert interviews in 24 government agencies, universities and businesses located in 10 Canadian cities.FindingsThe organizations in the study are committed to sustainability and have developed significant programs and activities in support of this aim. Although the records managers, archivists and technologists interviewed are involved in related activities, there is a gap between what they are doing as a matter of course and the wider sustainability efforts of their parent organizations. As resources are tight, sustainability measurement entails more work and there are no real incentives to add sustainability components to programs, the participants are focused on delivering the programs they are hired to do. As a result, there is a sense of serendipity around outcomes that do occur C sometimes, green is the outcome.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper presents the results of research conducted at 24 organizations in 10 Canadian cities, a small but meaningful sample that provides a springboard for considering climate action in records and archives. Based on the discussion, there is a need for a records and archives agenda that directly responds the United Nation's climate action targets: strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters;integrating climate change measures into policies, strategies and planning;and improving education, awareness-raising and human institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning. In support of this aim, the paper charts possible material topics from the literature and compares these with research findings.Practical implicationsFrom a top-down perspective, organizations need to expand sustainability programs to address all business areas, including records and archives. From a bottom-up perspective, records managers and archivists should include adaptation in disaster planning and consider the program benefits of developing economic, environmental and social sustainability initiatives to mitigate climate change.Originality/valueThe paper defines resilience, sustainability, adaption and mitigation and positions these terms in records management and archives. The paper examines how records managers, archivists and technologists think about sustainability;where sustainability intersects with records and archives work;and how records managers and archivists can engage in climate action.","output":"Sometimes, green is the outcome: climate action in records management and archives in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a change in the incidence and transmission of respiratory pathogens was observed. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on the epidemiologic characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection among children in Chengdu, one of the largest cities of western China. Method: M. pneumoniae infection was diagnosed in 33,345 pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms at the Chengdu Womens & Childrens Central Hospital between January 2017 and September 2020, based on a titer of 31:160 measured by the passive agglutination assay. Differences in infection rates were examined by sex, age, and temporal distribution. Results: . Two epidemic outbreaks occurred between OctoberCDecember 2017 and AprilCDecember 2019, and two infection peaks were detected in the second and fourth quarters of 2017, 2018, and 2019. Due to the public health response to COVID-19, the number of positive M. pneumoniae cases significantly decreased in the second quarter of 2020. The rate of M. pneumoniae infection among children aged 3C6 years was higher than that in other age groups. Conclusion: Preschool children are more susceptible to M. pneumoniae infection and close contact appears to be the predominant factor favoring pathogen transmission.

With little knowledge of COVID-19 virus, very few published reports on surgical outcomes; hospitals stopped elective surgery, whilst emergency surgery was offered only after exhausting all conservative treatment modalities. This study presents our experience of outcomes of emergency appendectomies performed during the pandemic. Methods - Prospectively we collected data on 132 patients in peak pandemic period from 1st March to 5th June 2020 and data compared with 206 patients operated in similar period in 2019. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, pre-operative events, investigations, surgical management, postoperative outcomes and complications were analysed. Results - Demographics and ASA grades of both cohorts were comparable. In study cohort 84.4% and 96.7% in control cohort had laparoscopic appendicectomy. Whilst the study cohort had 13.6% primary open operations, control cohort had 5.3%. Mean length of stay and early post-operative complications (<30 days) were similar in both cohorts apart from surgical site infections (p = 0.02) and one mortality in study cohort. Conclusion - In these overwhelming pandemic times, although conservative treatment of acute appendicitis is an option, a proportion of patients will need surgery. Our study shows that with careful planning and strict theatre protocols, emergency appendicectomy can be safely offered with minimal risk of spreading COVID-19 infection.

The primary aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic GB drainage for patients with symptomatic GB disease. METHODS Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were performed in accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Pooled proportions were calculated for measured outcomes including technical success, clinical success, adverse event rate, recurrence rate, and rate of reintervention. Subgroup analyses were performed for transmural versus transpapillary, transmural lumen apposing stent (LAMS), and comparison to percutaneous transhepatic drainage. Heterogeneity was assessed with I2 statistics. Publication bias was ascertained by funnel plot and Egger regression testing. RESULTS Thirty-six studies (n = 1538) were included. Overall, endoscopic GB drainage achieved a technical and clinical success of 87.33% [(95% CI 84.42-89.77); I2 = 39.55] and 84.16% [(95% CI 80.30-87.38); I2 = 52.61], with an adverse event rate of 11.00% [(95% CI 9.25-13.03); I2 = 7.08]. On subgroup analyses, EUS-guided transmural compared to ERC-assisted transpapillary drainage resulted in higher technical and clinical success rates [OR 3.91 (95% CI 1.52-10.09); P = 0.005 and OR 4.59 (95% CI 1.84-11.46); P = 0.001] and lower recurrence rate [OR 0.17 (95% CI 0.06-0.52); P = 0.002]. Among EUS-guided LAMS studies, technical success was 94.65% [(95% CI 91.54-96.67); I2 = 0.00], clinical success was 92.06% [(95% CI 88.65-94.51); I2 = 0.00], and adverse event rate was 11.71% [(95% CI 8.92-15.23); I2 = 0.00]. Compared to percutaneous drainage, EUS-guided drainage possessed a similar efficacy and safety with significantly lower rate of reintervention [OR 0.05 (95% CI 0.02-0.13); P < 0.001].

Here, we analyzed the phenotype and function of circulating neutrophils from children with COVID-19. METHODS: An observational study including 182 children with COVID-19, 21 children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), and 40 healthy children was performed in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Neutrophil phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry in blood samples. Cytokine production, plasma levels of IgG antibodies directed to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and citrullinated histone H3 were measured by ELISA. Cell-free DNA was quantified by fluorometry. FINDINGS: Compared with healthy controls, neutrophils from children with COVID-19 showed a lower expression of CD11b, CD66b, and L-selectin but a higher expression of the activation markers HLA-DR, CD64 and PECAM-1 and the inhibitory receptors LAIR-1 and PD-L1. No differences in the production of cytokines and NETs were observed. Interestingly, the expression of CD64 in neutrophils and the serum concentration of IgG antibodies directed to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 distinguished asymptomatic from mild and moderate COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Acute lung injury is a prominent feature of severe COVID-19 in adults. A low expression of adhesion molecules together with a high expression of inhibitory receptors in neutrophils from children with COVID-19 might prevent tissue infiltration by neutrophils preserving lung function.

Several COVID-19 vaccines are being developed using different production systems, including plants, which promises the production of cheap, safe, stable, and effective vaccines. The potential of a plant-based system for rapid production at a commercial scale and for a quick response to an infectious disease outbreak has been demonstrated by the marketing of carrot-cell-produced taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) for Gaucher disease and tobacco-produced monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp) for the 2014 Ebola outbreak.

In this 14-day daily diary study, 54 heterosexually married couples (N = 108) aged 28 to 71 years participated. After reporting their demographic information at the start of the study, they reported their perceived positive support from their partner, daily stress, and feelings of gratitude at the end of each day of the study for 14 consecutive days. Using a multivariate outcome, multilevel cross-classification, we found that daily positive support was negatively associated with daily stress, mediated by daily feelings of gratitude. On a day when a person reported more perceived positive support than others, this person also reported a higher level of feelings of gratitude and a lower level of stress, regardless of age. We found only an actor effect, no partner effect. These findings show how greater daily positive support is linked to greater daily feelings of gratitude, which in turn is linked to less daily stress during an emergent public health crisis.

Vaccine efficacy against infectiousness (VEI) is an important measure for understanding the full impact of a vaccine, yet it is currently not identifiable in many vaccine trial designs because it requires knowledge of the vaccination status of infectors. Recent advances in pathogen genomics have improved our ability to accurately reconstruct transmission networks. We aim to assess if augmenting classical randomized controlled trial designs with pathogen sequence and contact tracing data can permit these trials to estimate VEI. Methods: We develop a transmission model with a vaccine trial in an outbreak setting, incorporate pathogen sequence evolution data and sampling as well as contact tracing data, and assign probabilities to likely infectors. We then propose and evaluate the performance of an estimator of VEI. Results: We find that under perfect knowledge of infector-infectee pairs, we are able to accurately estimate VEI. Use of sequence data results in imperfect reconstruction of the transmission networks, biasing estimates of VEI towards the null, with approaches using deep sequence data performing better than approaches using consensus sequence data. Inclusion of contact tracing data reduces the bias. Conclusion: Pathogen genomics enhance identifiability of VEI from individually randomized controlled trials, but imperfect transmission network reconstruction biases the estimates towards the null and limits our ability to detect VEI. Given the consistent direction of the bias, estimates obtained from trials using these methods will provide lower bounds on the true VEI. A combination of sequence and epidemiologic data results in the most accurate estimates, underscoring the importance of contact tracing in reconstructing transmission networks.","output":"Leveraging pathogen sequence and contact tracing data to enhance vaccine trials in emerging epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal (NPS)/oropharyngeal swabs is the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral load monitoring Oral fluid (OF) is an alternate clinical sample, easy and safer to collect and could be useful for COVID-19 diagnosis, monitoring viral load and shedding Methods: Optimal assay conditions and analytical sensitivity were established for the commercial Simplexa?

To better understand the species adaptability of MERS-CoV, we identified a suboptimal species-derived variant of DPP4 to study viral adaption. Passaging virus on cells expressing this DPP4 variant led to accumulation of mutations in the viral spike which increased replication. Parallel passages revealed distinct paths of viral adaptation to the same DPP4 variant. Structural analysis and functional assays showed that these mutations enhanced viral entry with suboptimal DPP4 by altering the surface charge of spike.

Here, we study the binding of two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses isolated from pangolins, GX/P2V/2017 and GD/1/2019, to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the receptor of SARS-CoV-2. We find that the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of pangolin CoVs binds to hACE2 as efficiently as the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in vitro. Furthermore, incorporation of pangolin CoVs RBDs allows entry of pseudotyped VSV particles into hACE2-expressing cells.

DESIGN: Prospective Study. SETTING: Population-based study drawn from a probability-based internet panel of over 100 000 Israelis. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 18 years or more, representative of the adult Israeli population. The participants were measured at two time points (time 1 (T1) pre-second lockdown N=1029; response rate=76.17%; time 2 (T2) post-second lockdown N=764; response rate=74.24%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trajectories of anxiety and adjustment disorder based on clinical cut-off score for probable diagnoses across T1-T2, somatic symptoms at T2. The four trajectories: stable-low, (no probable diagnosis), stable-high (stable probable diagnosis), exacerbation (no probable diagnosis at T1, probable diagnosis at T2), recovery (probable diagnosis at T1, no probable diagnosis at T2). RESULTS: Three anxiety trajectories predicted probable somatic symptoms (stable-high OR=6.451; exacerbation OR=5.379; recovery OR=2.025) compared with the stable-low trajectory. The three adjustment disorder trajectories also predicted somatic symptoms (stable-high OR=4.726; exacerbation OR=6.419; recovery OR=4.666) compared with the stable-low trajectory. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show elevated somatic symptoms among those whose mental health trajectories were poor, exacerbated and those who recovered following the second lockdown.

The aim of this proposed study is to develop and evaluate physician-pharmacist collaborative clinics to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in primary hospitals in Hunan province. METHODS: A multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the physician-pharmacist collaborative clinics compared with usual care for Chinese patients with T2DM. Six primary hospitals will participate in the study, which will recruit 600 eligible patients. Patients in the intervention group will receive services from both physicians and pharmacists in the collaborative clinics, while the control group will receive usual care from physicians.

A geographical information system (GIS) was used to analyze three triatomine species within the United States known to harbor Trypanosoma cruzi and that exhibit qualities of domesticity. An analysis of the minimum temperature threshold for increased triatomine activity delineates the current population at increased risk, and by incorporating temperature predictions for 2030, the population at risk under a future climate scenario was also delineated.

The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic illustrates this at a global level. The sudden increased demand on delivery systems puts unique pressures on pre-established care pathways. These extraordinary times require efficient tools for smart governance and resource allocation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an innovative web-based solution addressing the seemingly insurmountable challenges of triaging, monitoring, and delivering nonhospital services unleashed by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An adaptable crisis management digital platform was envisioned and designed with the goal of improving the systems response on the basis of the literature; an existing shared health record platform; and discussions between health care providers, decision makers, academia, and the private sector in response to the COVID 19 epidemic. RESULTS: The Crisis Management Platform was developed and offered to health authorities in Ontario on a nonprofit basis. It has the capability to dramatically streamline patient intake, triage, monitoring, referral, and delivery of nonhospital services. It decentralizes the provision of services (by moving them online) and centralizes data gathering and analysis, maximizing the use of existing human resources, facilitating evidence-based decision making, and minimizing the risk to both users and providers. It has unlimited scale-up possibilities (only constrained by human health risk resource availability) with minimal marginal cost.

Results show that most of participants' houses had radiators for heating and relied on window opening for ventilation and cooling. Air systems (e.g., HVAC systems) resulted in higher perceived dominance compared to other systems, but only when evaluated for WFH. Sound dominance from building services was in turn related to soundscape evaluation. Spaces with less dominant sounds from building services were more appropriate for both WFH and relaxation, and spaces with fewer dominant sounds were assessed better, but just for WFH. Participants' evaluations generally did not differ according to building service typology. The presence of air-cooling systems was associated with better perceived sound environments, most likely due to better acoustics conditions in newly built or retrofitted dwellings, more probably equipped with air cooling systems. Preliminary findings point out the importance of carefully considering the dominance of sounds by building services, especially for air systems, in relation to traditional and new uses of residential buildings. ? 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

It is important to understand the reliability of assays with different antigen or antibody targets to detect humoral immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection and to understand how antibody (Ab) binding assays compare to those detecting neutralizing antibody (nAb), particularly as we move into the era of vaccines. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of six commercially available Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs), including a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT), for detection of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG), total or nAb. A result subset was compared to a cell culture-based microneutralisation (MN) assay. We tested sera from patients with prior RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, pre-pandemic sera and potential cross-reactive sera from patients with other non-COVID-19 acute infections. RESULTS: For sera collected > 14 days post-symptom onset, the assay achieving the highest sensitivity was the Wantai total Ab at 100% (95% confidence interval: 94.6-100) followed by 93.1% for Euroimmun NCP-IgG, 93.1% for GenScript sVNT, 90.3% for Euroimmun S1-IgG, 88.9% for Euroimmun S1-IgA and 83.3% for Wantai IgM. Specificity for the best performing assay was 99.5% for the Wantai total Ab and for the lowest performing assay was 97.1% for sVNT (as per IFU). The Wantai Total Ab had the best agreement with MN at 98% followed by Euroimmun S1-IgA, Euro NCP-IgG and sVNT (as per IFU) with (97%, 97% and 95% respectively) and Wantai IgM having the poorest agreement at 93%. CONCLUSION: Performance characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 serology assays detecting different antibody types are consistent with those found in previously published reports. Evaluation of the surrogate virus neutralization test in comparison to the Ab binding assays and a cell culture-based neutralization assay showed good result correlation between all assays. However correlation between the cell-based neutralization test and some assays detecting Abs not specifically involved in neutralization was higher than with the sVNT. This study demonstrates the reliability of different assays to detect the humoral immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be used to optimise serological test algorithms for assessing antibody responses post SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination.","output":"Evaluation of six commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology assays detecting different antibodies for clinical testing and serosurveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Maine veterans represent 11.8% of Maine population, twice that of the United States.

We hypothesized that children may have been victims of more physical abuse during the lockdown, involving an increase in the relative frequency of hospitalization. METHODS: Using the national administrative database on all admissions to public and private hospitals (PMSI), we selected all children aged 0C5 years hospitalized and identified physically abused children based on ICD-10 codes. We included 844,227 children hospitalized in MarchCApril 2017C2020, of whom 476 (0.056%) were admitted for physical abuse. Relative frequency of hospitalization for physical abuse observed in March to April 2020 were compared with those from the same months in the three previous years (2017C2019). FINDINGS: Even if absolute number of children exposed to physical abuse did not fluctuate significantly, we found a significant increase in the relative frequency of young children hospitalized for physical abuse from 2017 (0.053%) to 2020 (0.073%). Compared with the 2017C2019 period, and considering the observed decrease in the number of overall hospital admissions during the first lockdown, the number of children exposed to physical violence was 40% superior to what would be expected. INTERPRETATION: The sharp increase in the relative frequency of hospitalizations for physical abuse in children aged 0C5 years in France is alarming. As only the most severe cases were brought to the hospital for treatment during the lockdown, our figures probably only represent the tip of the iceberg of a general increase of violence against young children.","output":"Physical abuse of young children during the COVID-19 pandemic: Alarming increase in the relative frequency of hospitalizations during the lockdown period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current gold standard technique for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics is hydrolysis probe-based RT-qPCR.

The quantity-based optimization model generates a progressive allocation of limited quantities of mitigation resources, including vaccines, antiviral, administration capacities, and social distancing enforcement resources. The budget-based optimization model strives instead allocating a total resource budget. Both models seek to minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks. The models incorporate measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, translated into the societal and economic costs of lost productivity and medical expenses. The models were calibrated using historic pandemic data and implemented on a sample outbreak in Florida, with over four million inhabitants. The quantity-based model was found to be inferior to the budget-based model, which was advantageous in its ability to balance the varying relative cost and effectiveness of individual resources.

Information from the medical record, including clinical features, radiographic and laboratory results, complications, treatments, and clinical outcomes, were extracted for the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 311 (32.94%) patients had comorbidity with hypertension. In COVID-19 patients with hypertension, the coexistence of type 2 diabetes (56.06% vs 43.94%), coronary heart disease (65.71% vs 34.29%), poststroke syndrome (68.75% vs 31.25%) and chronic kidney diseases (77.78% vs 22.22%) was significantly higher, while the coexistence of hepatitis B infection (13.04% vs 86.96%) was significantly lower than in COVID-19 patients without hypertension.

Partial proteolysis of purified E2 protein allowed the isolation of a 28K fragment recognized by both site A- and site C-specific MAbs. An antiserum against this fragment bound to a synthetic peptide containing residues 1 to 18 and to an expression product containing residues 1 to 325. The same expression product was recognized by site C-specific MAbs. These data indicate that residues within the sequence 1 to 325 contribute to site C and possibly also to site A. Sequencing of mar mutants that escaped neutralization by site A-specific MAbs indicated that residues 538 and 543 also belong to site A.

Ethical approval for the study was granted in August 2020 from The Healthcare Research Ethics Committee (SREC reference: REC741). Data generation will be informed by science and technology studies and practice theories. DISCUSSION: Ensuring adequate numbers of nurses are available to care for patients in response to shifting demand is an international policy priority.

The peptide has been studied for its physical changes in the presence of both zwitterionic DPC and negatively charged SDS model membrane micelles, respectively, with the help of a battery of biophysical techniques including two-dimensional solution state NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, in both micellar environments, TK9 adopted an alpha helical conformation; however, the helical propensities were much higher in the case of DPC compared to those of SDS micelle, suggesting that TK9 has more specificity towards eukaryotic cell membrane than the bacterial cell membrane. The orientation of the peptide TK9 also varies in the different micellar environments. The peptide's affinity was further manifested by its pronounced membrane disruption ability towards the mammalian compared to the bacterial membrane mimic. Collectively, the in-depth structural information on the interaction of TK9 with different membrane environments explains the host specificity and membrane orientation owing to subsequent membrane disruption implicated in the viral pathogenesis.","output":"Structural insights of a self-assembling 9-residue peptide from the C-terminal tail of the SARS corona virus E-protein in DPC and SDS micelles: A combined high and low resolution spectroscopic study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review article highlights some of the key research conducted at the ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (ICMR-NIRT) over the years since its inception in 1956 till the present.

BACKGROUND: Health services for homeless populations focus on the 11% of rough sleepers, little is done for the 22% of children in Australia living in housing instability; many of whom are from First Nations families. Little is known of the health status of these children or their connections to appropriate primary health care. METHODS: This research implemented an innovative model of extended health care delivery, embedding a Nurse Practitioner in a homeless service to work with families providing health assessments and referrals, using clinically validated assessment tools. This article reports on proof of concept findings on the service that measured immunisation rates, developmental, medical, dental and mental health needs of children, particularly First Nations children, using a three-point severity level scale with Level 3 being the most severe and in need of immediate referral to a specialist medical service. FINDINGS: Forty-three children were referred by the service to the Nurse Practitioner over a 6-month period, with nine identifying as First Nations children. Differences in severity levels between First Nations/non-First Nations children were Level 1, First Nations/non-First Nations 0/15%; Level 2, 10/17%; and Level 3, 45/29%. Forty-five percent of First Nations children had no health problems, as compared to 29% on non-First Nations children. Immunisation rates were low for both cohorts. No First Nations child was immunised and only 9% of the non-First Nations children. While numbers for both cohorts are too low for valid statistical analysis, the lower levels of severity for First Nations children suggest stronger extended family support and the positive impact of cultural norms of reciprocity.","output":"Aboriginal children and family connections to primary health care whilst homeless and in high housing mobility: observations from a Nurse Practitioner-led service"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We showed ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) 2 is higher in the kidney of male compared with female mice.

ACE2 also had an effect on renal protein expression of the neutral endopeptidase NEP (neprilysin), the enzyme that catabolizes Ang-[1-10] (angiotensin [1-10]), the precursor of Ang-[1-8]. Ang-[1-8] infusion downregulated NEP protein expression by 20% in WT male, whereas there was a slight increase in NEP expression in WT female mice. Deletion of Ace2 resulted in lowered NEP expression after Ang-[1-8] infusion in both sexes. These findings suggest sex-specific ACE2 regulation of the renin-angiotensin system contributes to female protection from Ang-[1-8]-induced hypertension. These findings have ramifications for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, especially in hypertension since ACE2 is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and hypertension is a major risk factor for poor outcomes.","output":"Sex-Specific Modulation of Blood Pressure and the Renin-Angiotensin System by ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) 2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Being able to predict which patients with COVID-19 are going to deteriorate is important to help identify patients for clinical and research practice Clinical prediction models play a critical role in this process, but current models are of limited value because they are typically restricted to baseline predictors and do not always use contemporary statistical methods We sought to explore the benefits of incorporating dynamic changes in routinely measured biomarkers, non-linear effects and applying 'state-of-the-art' statistical methods in the development of a prognostic model to predict death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 DESIGN: The data were analysed from admissions with COVID-19 to three hospital sites Exploratory data analysis included a graphical approach to partial correlations Dynamic biomarkers were considered up to 5 days following admission rather than depending solely on baseline or single time-point data Marked departures from linear effects of covariates were identified by employing smoothing splines within a generalised additive modelling framework SETTING: 3 secondary and tertiary level centres in Greater Manchester, the UK PARTICIPANTS: 392 hospitalised patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 RESULTS: 392 patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis were identified Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased from 0 73 using admission data alone to 0 75 when also considering results of baseline blood samples and to 0 83 when considering dynamic values of routinely collected markers There was clear non-linearity in the association of age with patient outcome CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that clinical prediction models to predict death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 can be improved by taking into account both non-linear effects in covariates such as age and dynamic changes in values of biomarkers","output":"Value of dynamic clinical and biomarker data for mortality risk prediction in COVID-19: a multicentre retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients with complex needs require greater biopsychosocial support. Fragmented services often result in gaps, duplication or incompatibility in treatments, leading to poorer health outcomes and higher utilization of costly hospital-based healthcare services. Patient-Centred Medical Home (PCMH) is a primary care model reform advocated as more appropriate for patients with complex needs. This analysis assessed the impact of a PCMH demonstration on healthcare utilization for patients with complex needs in Singapore. Methods: : This study assessed the Community for Successful Ageing (ComSA)-PCMH in Singapore that was launched in Nov2016. ComSA-PCMH serves adults aged 40 and above with complex needs, delivering care integrated between its primary care clinic, home-based care management, an acute hospital and other community-based services. This was a matched cohort analysis that used a difference-in-difference approach to compare quarterly healthcare utilization of PCMH study participants and controls. 165 PCMH study participants enrolled between Oct2017 and Apr2019 were compared against 5,385 controls selected using Coarsened Exact Matching from a neighbouring geographical precinct. Healthcare utilization data spanning Oct2014 to Mar2020 were extracted from a public regional health system, including primary care, specialist outpatient clinic and emergency department utilization, and inpatient admissions. Two-part models were fitted, with controls for socio-demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index, secular trends including effect of COVID-19, and between-group differences. Statistical inferences were based on cluster-robust standard errors at the individual level. Results: : At 4 four quarters post-enrolment, PCMH study participants had sustained reductions of 1.08 polyclinic visits ( p< 0.001), 0.37 SOC visits ( p= 0.047), 0.04 ED visits ( p= 0.013) and 0.02 inpatient admissions ( p= 0.093) per person-quarter, compared to the quarter before enrolment and controls. Conclusions: : ComSA-PCMH study participants reduced healthcare utilization after enrolment into the programme, adding to a growing global body of evidence supporting the benefits of PCMH for patients with complex needs and pointing to its potential in Asia.

Severe COVID-19 disease is accompanied by reduced erythrocyte turnover, low hemoglobin levels along with increased total bilirubin and ferritin serum concentrations. Moreover, expansion of erythroid progenitors in peripheral blood together with hypoxia, anemia, and coagulopathies highly correlates with severity and mortality. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects erythroid precursor cells, impairs hemoglobin homeostasis and aggravates COVID-19 disease. METHODS: Erythroid precursor cells derived from peripheral CD34+ blood stem cells of healthy donors were infected in vitro with SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant and differentiated into red blood cells (RBCs). Hemoglobin and iron metabolism in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and controls were analyzed in plasma-depleted whole blood samples. Raman trapping spectroscopy rapidly identified diseased cells. RESULTS: RBC precursors express ACE2 receptor and CD147 at day 5 of differentiation, which makes them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. qPCR analysis of differentiated RBCs revealed increased HAMP mRNA expression levels, encoding for hepcidin, which inhibits iron uptake. COVID-19 patients showed impaired hemoglobin biosynthesis, enhanced formation of zinc-protoporphyrine IX, heme-CO(2), and CO-hemoglobin as well as degradation of Fe-heme. Moreover, significant iron dysmetablolism with high serum ferritin and low serum iron and transferrin levels occurred, explaining disturbances of oxygen-binding capacity in severely ill COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data identify RBC precursors as a direct target of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induced dysregulation in hemoglobin- and iron-metabolism contributes to the severe systemic course of COVID-19.

A team process that helps teams process information and adapt is in-action team reflection (TR), defined as concurrent collective reflection on group objectives, strategies, or processes during an ongoing care event. However, the health care field lacks a means for systematically observing and ultimately training in-action TR in acute care teams. To bridge this gap, the authors developed a theoretically and empirically informed framework, TuRBO (Team Reflection Behavioral Observation), for measuring in-action TR. METHOD In 2018 at ETH, Zurich, Switzerland, the authors developed a theoretical framework based on the literature and theory. They then conducted exploratory reviews of preexisting videos of acute care teams training simulated emergencies. The authors adapted observation codes using an iterative approach. Using the developed coding framework, they coded 23 video recordings of acute care teams and provided validity evidence from the 3 sources: content, internal structure (interrater reliability), and relations to other variables. RESULTS The final TuRBO framework consists of 3 general dimensions-seeking information, evaluating information, and planning-that are further specified in 7 subcodes. Interrater agreement of the coding was substantial ( = 0.80). As hypothesized, the data showed a positive relationship between in-action TR and team performance. Also, physicians spent significantly more time on in-action TR than nurses. CONCLUSIONS The TuRBO framework for assessing in-action TR in acute care teams provides positive validity evidence of the data. TuRBO integrates different team communication and calibration processes under the overarching concept of in-action TR and provides descriptive behavioral markers. TuRBO taps into powerful cultural and normative components of patient safety. This tool can augment team training that allows all team members to serve as an important resource for flexible, resilient, and safer patient care.","output":"Reflection on the Fly: Development of the Team Reflection Behavioral Observation (TuRBO) System for Acute Care Teams."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global alarm. With the advances in artificial intelligence, the COVID-19 testing capabilities have been greatly expanded, and hospital resources are significantly alleviated. Over the past years, computer vision researches have focused on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can significantly improve image analysis ability. However, CNN architectures are usually manually designed with rich expertise that is scarce in practice. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can automatically search for the proper CNN architectures and voluntarily optimize the related hyperparameters. The networks searched by EAs can be used to effectively process COVID-19 computed tomography images without expert knowledge and manual setup. In this paper, we propose a novel EA-based algorithm with a dynamic searching space to design the optimal CNN architectures for diagnosing COVID-19 before the pathogenic test. The experiments are performed on the COVID-CT data set against a series of state-of-the-art CNN models. The experiments demonstrate that the architecture searched by the proposed EA-based algorithm achieves the best performance yet without any preprocessing operations. Furthermore, we found through experimentation that the intensive use of batch normalization may deteriorate the performance.

Therefore, the exploration of prognostic predictors for patients with COVID-19 is vital for prompt clinical intervention. Our study aims to explore the predictive value of hematological parameters in the prognosis of patients with severe COVID-19. Methods Ninety-eight patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at Jingzhou Central Hospital and Central Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei Province, were included in this study. Results The median age of the patients was 59 [28-80] years; the median age of patients with a good prognosis was 56 [28-79] years, and the median age of patients with a poor outcome was 67 [35-80] years. The patients in the poor outcome group were older than the patients in the good outcome group (P<0.05). The comparison of hematological parameters showed that lymphocyte count (Lym#), red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) were significantly lower in the poor outcome group than in the good outcome group (P<0.05). Further, the red cell volume distribution width-CV (RDW-CV) and red cell volume distribution width-SD (RDW-SD) were significantly higher in the poor outcome group than in the good outcome group (P<0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed RDW-SD, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.870 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.796-0.943], was the most significant single parameter for predicting the prognosis of severe patients.

Reticulocyte (RET) channel results showed the RET level was significantly higher in critical patients than in moderate patients and severe patients (P<0.05), which may be one cause of the elevated RDW in patients with a poor outcome.

Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of Rhesus macaques is similar in many key aspects to human HIV-1 infection and consequently this non-human primate (NHP) model has and continues to prove instrumental in evaluating HIV prevention, treatment and eradication approaches.

Efforts to define ways to assess functionality of health systems have however varied, with many not translating into concrete policy action and influence on system development. We present an approach to provide countries with information on the functionality of their systems in a manner that will facilitate movement towards universal health coverage. We conceptualise functionality of a health system as being a construct of four capacities: access to, quality of, demand for essential services and its resilience to external shocks. We test and confirm the validity of these capacities as appropriate measures of system functionality. We thus provide results for functionality of the 47 countries of the WHO African Region based on this. The functionality of health systems ranges from 34.4 to 75.8 on a 0-100 scale. Access to essential services represents the lowest capacity in most countries of the region, specifically due to poor physical access to services.

It seems reasonable to argue that the risk patterns for COVID-19 have to be usefully studied in quantitative terms too, whenever possible applying the same approach to the relationship 'dose of the exposure vs pathological response' commonly used for chemicals and already followed for several biological agents to SARS-CoV-2, too. Such an approach is of particular relevance in the fields of both occupational epidemiology and occupational medicine, where the identification of the sources of a dangerous exposure and of the web of causation of a disease is often questionable and questioned: it is relevant when evaluating the population risk, too. Specific occupational scenarios, basically involving health workers, exhibit important proportions of both subjects simply infected by SARS-CoV-2 and of ill subjects with, respectively, mild, moderate, and severe disease. Similar patterns have been described referring to various circumstances of community exposure, e.g., standing in crowded public places, travelling on crowded means of transport, living in accommodation or care homes, living in the same household as a COVID-19 case. The hypothesis that these findings are a consequence not only of high probabilities of exposure, but also of high doses (as a product of both intensity and duration, with possible autonomous effects of peaks of exposure) deserves to be systematically tested, in order to reconstruct the web of causation of COVID-19 individual and clustered cases and to cope with situations at critical risk for SARS-CoV-2, needing to be identified, mapped, and dealt with at the right time. A limited but consistent set of papers supporting these assumptions has been traced in the literature. Under these premises, the creation of a structured inventory of both values of viral concentrations in the air (in case and if possible, of surface contaminations too) and of viral loads in biological matrixes is proposed, with the subsequent construction of a scenario-exposure matrix. A scenario-exposure matrix for SARS-CoV-2 may represent a useful tool for research and practical risk management purposes, helping to understand the possibly critical circumstances for which no direct exposure measure is available (this is an especially frequent case, in contexts of low socio-economic level) and providing guidance to determine evidence-based public health strategies.","output":"SARS-CoV-2: exposure to high external doses as determinants of higher viral loads and of increased risk for COVID-19.

The Flow-Redirection Intraluminal Device (FRED) system has not been previously assessed in a large cohort of patients with posterior circulation aneurysms. The purpose of the present study was to assess safety and efficacy of FRED in this location. MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients with posterior circulation aneurysms treated at 8 centers participating in the European FRED study (EuFRED) between April 2012 and January 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Complication and radiographic and functional outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Eighty-four patients (median age, 54 years) with 84 posterior circulation aneurysms were treated with the FRED. A total of 25 aneurysms (29.8%) had previously ruptured, even though most aneurysms were diagnosed incidentally (45.2%). The intradural vertebral artery was the most common location (50%), and saccular, the most common morphology (40.5%). The median size was 7 mm. There were 8 (9.5%) symptomatic thromboembolic and no hemorrhagic complications. Thromboembolic complications occurred mostly (90.9%) in nonsaccular aneurysms. On last follow-up at a median of 24 months, 78.2% of aneurysms were completely occluded. Functional outcome at a median of 27 months was favorable in 94% of patients. All mortalities occurred in patients with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage and its sequelae. CONCLUSIONS The largest cohort of posterior circulation aneurysms treated with the FRED to date demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy profiles of the device for this indication. Treatment in the setting of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage was strongly related to mortality, regardless of whether procedural complications occurred.","output":"The FRED for Cerebral Aneurysms of the Posterior Circulation: A Subgroup Analysis of the EuFRED Registry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A healthy 33 year old male presented in December with a 3 week history of fever and fatigue.

Delirium may precede respiratory symptoms, and in some cases, it may be the only symptom, leading to a delay in the diagnosis. Therefore, screening for delirium should be part of the routine clinical practice for older people with dementia and suspected COVID-19 infection.

Exposure pathogenesis to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 likely will lead to similar outcomes. Immunogenic peptides in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogenic priming peptides (similar to the more diffuse idea of immune enhancement). Here I provide an assessment of potential for human pathogenesis via autoimmunity via exposure, via infection or injection. SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins, and all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, immunogenic epitopes in each SARS-CoV-2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homologous matching. Only one immunogenic epitope in a SARS-CoV-2 had no homology to human proteins. If all of the parts of the epitopes that are homologous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogenic priming, the remaining immunogenic parts of the epitopes may be still immunogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development. Mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in COVID-19 disease. It also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself, targeting elements of MHC Class I and Class II antigen presentation, PD-1 signaling, cross-presentation of soluble exogenous antigens and the ER-Phagosome pathway.

The purpose of this study was to identify the independent risk factors for psychological distress in order to develop a more effective strategy and precise evidence-based psychological intervention for medical workers. METHODS: This multisite cross-sectional survey recruited doctors and nurses from local and nonlocal medical teams working at 16 hospitals in Wuhan to complete this online survey from February to March, 2020. Psychological status was evaluated through Perceived Stress Scales (PSS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS). RESULTS: Of 966 participants, the prevalence of stress (95.9%), depression (46.0%) and anxiety (39.3%) were high. Local medical workers exhibited even higher scores of PSS, PHQ-9, GAD-7 and ASDS than those from outside Hubei (P<0.001). Females had more severe perceived stress, depression and anxiety than males (P<0.001). Multiple logistic regression showed that perceived stress is associated with increased odds of depression (OR=1.413; 95% CI: 1.338C1.493; P<0.001) and anxiety (OR=1.515; 95% CI: 1.407C1.631; P<0.001).

The neuroinvasive potential of CoVs might be responsible for at least part of these symptoms and may contribute to the respiratory failure observed in affected patients. Therefore, in the present manuscript, we have reviewed the available preclinical evidence on the mechanisms and consequences of CoVs-induced CNS damage, and highlighted the potential role of CoVs in determining or aggravating acute and long-term neurological diseases in infected individuals. We consider that a widespread awareness of the significant neurotropism of CoVs might contribute to an earlier recognition of the signs and symptoms of viral-induced CNS damage. Moreover, a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CoVs affect CNS function and cause CNS damage could help in planning new strategies for prognostic evaluation and targeted therapeutic intervention.","output":"Neurobiology of coronaviruses: Potential relevance for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In 2017 around 14C19 million miners were exposed to multiple hazards in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). ASGM is characterized by basic and compromised mining methods with either very limited control of hazards or none at all. There is little knowledge about health and safety among artisanal and small-scale gold miners in Zimbabwe. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the interaction between hazards, control measures, and health and safety in Zimbabwes ASGM. METHODS: Triangulation and mixed methods were applied using standardized questionnaires, Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), focus group discussions (FGDs), and summary notes from in-depth interviews (IDIs). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, regression analysis, and thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Quantitative data were collected through HIRA, which was conducted on 34 mining sites. 401 participants, selected through multi-stage sampling, were assessed through standardized questionnaires. Qualitative data was collected through six FGDs, and existing summary notes from 84 IDIs. The most prioritized hazards from the questionnaires were silica dust, noise, and workplace violence as indicated by 238 (62.0%), 107 (26.8%), and 104 (26.7%) respondents (respectively). HIRA identified noise, dust, unsafe shafts, violence, poor sanitation, and poor hygiene as key hazards requiring urgent attention. A key finding of this study was the poor application of the hierarchy of controls in managing workplace hazards. After adjusting for confounders, association with experiencing health and safety challenges was working underground (AOR = 2.0, p = 0.03), workplace violence (AOR = 3.3, p = 0.002), and long working hours (AOR = 2.8, p = 0.019). Injuries and fatalities were common without mitigation strategies. CONCLUSIONS: ASGM in Zimbabwe is characterized by underground mining, long working hours, and workplace violence. The poor application of the hierarchy of controls is characterized by increased workplace injuries and fatalities.

METHODS: This study adopted a descriptive correlational design. Data were collected between August 16 and August 30, 2020, through self-administered questionnaires from 148 bedside nurses caring for COVID-19 patients, from four hospitals designated for COVID-19 treatment. Modified versions of the Nursing Intention Questionnaire for SARS Patient Care, Psychological Capital Questionnaire, and Halls Professional Inventory were used. The collected data were analyzed using stepwise multiple regression. RESULTS: In total, 165 questionnaires were distributed, and 148 questionnaires (89.7%) were included in the final analysis. Factors influencing nurses intention to care were: age (30<:  = .18, p = .026; 50:  = .23, p = .005), department (ICU:  = -.26, p = .001), sufficient clinical experience and skills to care for COVID-19 patients (sufficient:  = .18, p = .019), and positive psychological capital ( = .22, p = .044).

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of crank length manipulations on physiological and biomechanical aspects of recumbent handcycling performance in highly trained recumbent handcyclists at a constant linear handgrip speed and sport-specific intensity. Nine competitive handcyclists completed a 3-min trial in an adjustable recumbent handbike in four crank length settings (150, 160, 170 & 180 mm) at 70% peak power output. Handgrip speed was controlled (1.6 m?s-1 ) across trials with cadences ranging from 102 to 85 rpm. Physiological economy, heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion were monitored in all trials. Handcycling kinetics were quantified using an SRM (Schoberer Rad Messtechnik) powermeter and upper limb kinematics were determined using a 10-camera VICON motion capture system. Physiological responses were not significantly affected by crank length. However, greater torque was generated (p < 0.0005) and peak torque occurred earlier during the push and pull phase (p  0.001) in longer cranks. Statistical parametric mapping revealed that the timing and orientation of shoulder flexion, shoulder abduction and elbow extension was significantly altered in different crank lengths. Despite the biomechanical adaptations, these findings suggest that at constant handgrip speeds (and varying cadence) highly trained handcyclists may select crank lengths between 150 - 180 mm without affecting their physiological performance.

The identification of infected individuals is vital to prevent the spread of illness to staff and other patients as well as to identify those who may be at risk for disease-related complications. This is particularly relevant with the resumption of elective orthopaedic surgery around the world. We report the results of a universal testing protocol for COVID-19 in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery during the coronavirus pandemic and to describe the postoperative course of asymptomatic patients who were positive for COVID-19. METHODS A retrospective review of adult operative cases between March 25, 2020, and April 24, 2020, at an orthopaedic specialty hospital in New York City was performed. Initially, a screening questionnaire consisting of relevant signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath) or exposure dictated the need for nasopharyngeal swab real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for all admitted patients. An institutional policy change occurred on April 5, 2020, that indicated nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR testing for all orthopaedic admissions. Screening and testing data for COVID-19 as well as relevant imaging, laboratory values, and postoperative complications were reviewed for all patients. RESULTS From April 5, 2020, to April 24, 2020, 99 patients underwent routine nasopharyngeal swab testing for COVID-19 prior to their planned orthopaedic surgical procedure. Of the 12.1% of patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 58.3% were asymptomatic. Three asymptomatic patients developed postoperative hypoxia, with 2 requiring intubation. The negative predictive value of using the signs and symptoms of disease to predict a negative test result was 91.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81.0% to 97.1%). Including a positive chest radiographic finding as a screening criterion did not improve the negative predictive value of screening (92.5% [95% CI, 81.8% to 97.9%]). CONCLUSIONS A protocol for universal testing of all orthopaedic surgery admissions at 1 hospital in New York City during a 3-week period revealed a high rate of COVID-19 infections. Importantly, the majority of these patients were asymptomatic. Using chest radiography did not significantly improve the negative predictive value of screening.

However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the limitation of this project is that testing could not be executed to determine the efficacy of the said solution. Furthermore, the proposed solution has limitations, such as requiring pre-constructed infrastructure in applicable construction sites. Therefore, regular quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) are required to ensure proper functionality. In the future, AR LiDAR sensors could be a possibility as it provides increased accuracy of AR measurements which is critical in engineering. ? 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

COVID-19 is an existential threat that has resulted in an unprecedented loss of lives, disruption of flight schedules, shutdown of businesses and much more. Though several researchers have highlighted the enormous benefits of 4IR technologies in containing the COVID-19 pandemic, the recent waves of the pandemic call for a thorough review of these technological interventions. The cyber-physical space has had its share of the COVID-19 pandemic effect, and through this review, we highlight the salient issues to help policy formulation towards managing the impact of subsequent COVID-19 waves within such environments. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to review the application of 4IR technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic waves and to highlight their shortcomings. Recent research articles were sourced from an online repository and thoroughly reviewed to highlight 4IR technology applications, innovations, shortcomings and multi-sector challenges. The outcome of this review indicates that the second wave of the pandemic resulted in a lower proportion of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and a lower rate of thrombotic events. In addition, it was revealed that the delay between ICU admissions and tracheal intubation was longer in the second wave in the health care sector. Again, the review suggests that 4IR technologies have been utilized across all the sectors including education, businesses, society, manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture and mining. Businesses have revised their service delivery models to include 4IR technologies and avoid physical contacts. In society, digital certificates, among other digital platforms, have been utilized to assist with the movements of persons who have been vaccinated. Manufacturing concerns have also utilized robots in manufacturing to reduce human-to-human physical contact. The mining sector has automated their work processes, utilising smart boots to prevent infection, smart health bands and smart disinfection tunnels or walkthrough sanitization gates in the mining work environment. However, the identified challenges of implementing 4IR technologies include low-skilled workers, data privacy issues, data analysis poverty, data management issues and many more. The boom in 4IR technologies calls for intense legislation on sweeping data privacy for regulated tech companies. These findings hold salient implications for policy formulation towards tackling future pandemic outbreaks.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic Waves: 4IR Technology Utilisation in Multi-Sector Economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The UK government wants people to lose weight to reduce their risk of severe covid-19, but slimming down is no simple task, reports Clare Wilson","output":"Get fit to stay healthy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues with resurgent second and third waves worldwide. Vaccination is one of several measures that are needed to end this pervasive threat. Pakistan, however, has a relatively low rate of routine vaccine acceptance. Our study aimed to determine the proportion and predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (VH) among adults in Pakistan. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was conducted from December 27, 2020 to March 6, 2021. Non-probability sampling was applied to recruit study participants through social media platforms (ie, Facebook and Twitter) and through free messaging services (WhatsApp). Stata 16 was used to generate descriptive statistics and logistic regression models for identifying predictive variables of vaccine hesitancy. A p-value of <0.05 was considered strong evidence against the null hypothesis. RESULTS: Out of 1014 participants, 35.8% (n=363) were hesitant about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Reasons for VH included concerns about side effects (42.4%), belief in conspiracy theories (20.1%), perceived inefficacy of the vaccine (13.2%), and perceived protection through precautionary measures (12.6%). Urban residency (AOR 2.34, 95% CI 1.54C3.57), reservations about vaccine safety (AOR 3.29, 95% CI 1.68C6.44), uncertainty about vaccine efficacy (AOR 2.70, 95% CI 1.50C4.86), failure of the vaccine to reduce hospitalization and death (AOR 6.36, 95% CI 4.01C10.22), and unfelt need for vaccination awareness among public (AOR 2.02, 95% CI 1.28C3.14) were associated with higher rates of VH. At least one chronic disease (AOR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39C0.92), knowing someone infected with COVID-19 (AOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39C0.81), and trusting information from the ministry of health (AOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.41C0.99) and physicians (AOR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13C0.53) were found to be associated with lower rates of COVID-19 VH.

In response to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, a new initiative to support health care staff to share healthy meals with their families was developed. At a hospital in Queensland, Australia, dietetic staff collaborated with the on-site food service retailer to develop and offer a range of hot meals that staff could take home for their families at the end of their day. The meals were nutritious, reasonably priced, and designed to feed a family of four. The dietetic staff worked with the hospital marketing department and staff health and wellness program to promote the initiative. Over the 3 months that it has been running, nearly 300 meals have been purchased. Anecdotal comments from the food service retailer highlighted that the initiative was a good thing to do for staff to maintain a positive reputation of the business.

DESIGN: Test negative case-control study. SETTING: Community testing for covid-19 in England. PARTICIPANTS: 156 930 adults aged 70 years and older who reported symptoms of covid-19 between 8 December 2020 and 19 February 2021 and were successfully linked to vaccination data in the National Immunisation Management System. INTERVENTIONS: Vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were polymerase chain reaction confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, admissions to hospital for covid-19, and deaths with covid-19. RESULTS: Participants aged 80 years and older vaccinated with BNT162b2 before 4 January 2021 had a higher odds of testing positive for covid-19 in the first nine days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore compared with the baseline post-vaccination period. Vaccine effects were noted 10 to 13 days after vaccination, reaching a vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% confidence interval 59% to 78%), then plateauing. From 14 days after the second dose a vaccination effectiveness of 89% (85% to 93%) was found compared with the increased baseline risk. Participants aged 70 years and older vaccinated from 4 January (when ChAdOx1-S delivery commenced) had a similar underlying risk of covid-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (51% to 69%) from 28 to 34 days after vaccination, then plateaued. With ChAdOx1-S, effects were seen from 14 to 20 days after vaccination, reaching an effectiveness of 60% (41% to 73%) from 28 to 34 days, increasing to 73% (27% to 90%) from day 35 onwards. On top of the protection against symptomatic disease, a further 43% (33% to 52%) reduced risk of emergency hospital admission and 51% (37% to 62%) reduced risk of death was observed in those who had received one dose of BNT162b2. Participants who had received one dose of ChAdOx1-S had a further 37% (3% to 59%) reduced risk of emergency hospital admission. Follow-up was insufficient to assess the effect of ChAdOx1-S on mortality. Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease, a single dose of either vaccine was about 80% effective at preventing admission to hospital with covid-19 and a single dose of BNT162b2 was 85% effective at preventing death with covid-19. CONCLUSION: Vaccination with either one dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic covid-19 in older adults, and with further protection against severe disease. Both vaccines showed similar effects. Protection was maintained for the duration of follow-up (>6 weeks). A second dose of BNT162b2 was associated with further protection against symptomatic disease. A clear effect of the vaccines against the B.1.1.7 variant was found.","output":"Effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines on covid-19 related symptoms, hospital admissions, and mortality in older adults in England: test negative case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: The use of general anesthesia for cesarean delivery has declined in the last decades due to the widespread utilization of neuraxial techniques and the understanding that neuraxial anesthesia can be provided even in urgent circumstances. In fact, the role of general anesthesia for cesarean delivery has been revisited, because despite recent devices facilitating endotracheal intubation and clinical algorithms, guiding anesthesiologists facing challenging scenarios, risks, and complications of general anesthesia at the time of delivery for both mother and neonate(s) remain significant. In this review, we will discuss clinical scenarios and risk factors associated with general anesthesia for cesarean delivery and address reasons why anesthesiologists should apply strategies to minimize its use. RECENT FINDINGS: Unnecessary general anesthesia for cesarean delivery is associated with maternal complications, including serious anesthesia-related complications, surgical site infection, and venous thromboembolic events. Racial and socioeconomic disparities and low-resource settings are major contributing factors in the use of general anesthesia for cesarean delivery, with both maternal and perinatal mortality increasing when general anesthesia is provided. In addition, more significant maternal pain and higher rates of postpartum depression requiring hospitalization are associated with general anesthesia for cesarean delivery. SUMMARY: Rates of general anesthesia for cesarean delivery have overall decreased, and while general anesthesia no longer is a contributing factor to anesthesia-related maternal deaths, further opportunities to reduce its use should be emphasized. Raising awareness in identifying situations and patients at risk to help avoid unnecessary general anesthesia remains crucial.","output":"The Current Role of General Anesthesia for Cesarean Delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emergency risk communication is a critical component in emergency planning and response. It has been recognised as significant for planning for and responding to public health emergencies. While there is a growing body of guidelines and frameworks on emergency risk communication, it remains a relatively new field. There has also been limited attention on how emergency risk communication is being performed in public health organisations, such as acute hospitals, and what the associated challenges are. This article seeks to examine the perception of crisis and emergency risk communication in an acute hospital in response to COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore and to identify its associated enablers and barriers. METHODS: A 13-item Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) Survey, based on the US Centers for Disease and Control (CDC) CERC framework, was developed and administered to hospital staff during February 24-28, 2020. The survey also included an open-ended question to solicit feedback on areas of CERC in need of improvement. Chi-square test was used for analysis of survey data. Thematic analysis was performed on qualitative feedback. RESULTS: Of the 1154 participants who responded to the survey, most (94.1%) reported that regular hospital updates on COVID-19 were understandable and actionable. Many (92.5%) stated that accurate, concise and timely information helped to keep them safe. A majority (92.3%) of them were clear about the hospital's response to the COVID-19 situation, and 79.4% of the respondents reported that the hospital had been able to understand their challenges and address their concerns. Sociodemographic characteristics, such as occupation, age, marital status, work experience, gender, and staff's primary work location influenced the responses to hospital CERC. Local leaders within the hospital would need support to better communicate and translate hospital updates in response to COVID-19 to actionable plans for their staff. Better communication in executing resource utilization plans, expressing more empathy and care for their staff, and enhancing communication channels, such as through the use of secure text messaging rather than emails would be important. CONCLUSION: CERC is relevant and important in the hospital setting to managing COVID-19 and should be considered concurrently with hospital emergency response domains.","output":"Perception survey of crisis and emergency risk communication in an acute hospital in the management of COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion (LAAO) with the Watchman device is considered an elective procedure, and thus often deferred during outbreak peaks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with bleeding issues on anticoagulation may require additional hospitalization for bleeding episodes or suffering increased risk of stroke by postponing occlusion while anticoagulation is discontinued. We chose to develop a protocol for screening, same day discharge, and follow up of selected LAAO patients and continuing to provide quality clinical outcomes while accounting for decreased bed and staff capacity due to the pandemic. Methods: Utilizing Knowledge to Action (KTA) nursing framework, a protocol was developed and reviewed with key stakeholders. Criteria for Same Day Discharge (SDD) includes: support at home, stable vitals and access site hemostasis prior to DC, agreeable to SDD, tolerant of oral intake, ability to urinate and safely ambulate prior to DC. Exclusion for SDD includes: Liver disease, Plt count <70,000, ESRD or CKD IV or any site or procedure complications. With Perclose usage patients must have 3 hours of bedrest, with manual pressure closure must have bedrest for 6 hours and purse string suture removed. This is followed by a next day phone call to ensure the patient is taking appropriate medicines and have no medical issues. Results: 38 out of 113 patients were screened as SDD candidates from January 2021-October 2021. Average patient age was 76, 31% female, with average CHA2DS2-VASc of 5. One patient required overnight hospitalization due to underlying asthma and need for nebulizer. One patient presented to an outpatient ED on a weekend with chest pain and underwent heart catheterization due to elevated troponin and did not require intervention. There were no access site complications. No patients contracted SARS-Cov-2 within 6 weeks post procedurally, compared with 2 of the overnight stays during the same period (75 patients). Conclusion: SDD in a carefully selected patient population is a feasible and safe strategy for LAAO patients.

The ultrasensitivity is achieved by shifting freeze-out region to intrinsic region in carrier density and modulation of fermi energy level of p-type SiNM through the development of a novel gold-doping strategy. The Au-doped SiNM is readily transferred onto an ultrathin polymer layer with a well-designed serpentine mesh structure, capable of being utilized as an epidermal temperature sensor array.

Extending Code's case study of Carson, I argue for an approach that combines (1) ecological relational ontologies, (2) the ethics and politics of knowledge making, (3) crossing social imaginaries of knowledge making and (4) a reconfigured view of knowledge makers as working towards just and cohabitable worlds. ?

Such a framework is important as the ED environment will always remain vulnerable to infectious diseases outbreaks in the future. AIMS: This paper aims to address issues and principles around ED design and workflow amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a conceptual framework and checklist for EDs to be prepared for future outbreaks as well. METHODS: A scoping literature review was conducted, of the experiences of EDs in managing outbreaks such as SARS, H1N1 and COVID-19. The combined experiences of the authors and the experiences from the literature were grouped under common themes to develop the conceptual framework. RESULTS: Four key principles were derived- (1) situational awareness, surveillance and perimeter defence, (2) ED staff protection, (3) surge capacity management and (4) ED recovery. The findings were integrated in a proposed conceptual framework to guide ED design in response to an infectious disease outbreak. There are various elements which need to be considered at ED input, throughput and output. These elements can be categorised into (1) system (workflow, protocols and communication), (2) staff (human resources), (3) space (infrastructure), and (4) supply (logistics) and are placed in a checklist for pragmatic use. CONCLUSION: The ED needs to be in a constant state of preparedness. A framework can be useful to guide ED design and workflow to achieve this.

Beta blockers (BBs) may blunt the sympathetic effect and catecholamine surge associated with ruptured cerebral aneurysms and prevent cardiac dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between preadmission BB therapy and cVSP, cardiac dysfunction, and in-hospital mortality following aSAH. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with aSAH who were treated at a tertiary high-volume neurovascular referral center. The exposure was defined as any preadmission BB therapy. The primary outcome was cVSP assessed by serial transcranial Doppler with any mean flow velocity  120 cm/sec and/or need for endovascular intervention for medically refractory cVSP. Secondary outcomes were cardiac dysfunction (defined as cardiac troponin-I elevation > 0.05 g/L, low left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] < 40%, or LV wall motion abnormalities [LVWMA]) and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS The cohort consisted of 210 patients treated between February 2009 and September 2010 (55% were women), with a mean age of 53.4  13 years and median Hunt and Hess Grade III (interquartile range III-IV). Only 13% (27/210) of patients were exposed to preadmission BB therapy. Compared with these patients, a higher percentage of patients not exposed to preadmission BBs had transcranial Doppler-mean flow velocity  120 cm/sec (59% vs 22%; p = 0.003). In multivariate analyses, lower Hunt and Hess grade (OR 3.9; p < 0.001) and preadmission BBs (OR 4.5; p = 0.002) were negatively associated with cVSP. In multivariate analysis, LVWMA (OR 2.7; p = 0.002) and low LVEF (OR 1.1; p = 0.05) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Low LVEF (OR 3.9; p = 0.05) independently predicted medically refractory cVSP. The in-hospital mortality rate was higher in patients with LVWMA (47.4% vs 14.8%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The study data suggest that preadmission therapy with BBs is associated with lower incidence of cVSP after aSAH. LV dysfunction was associated with higher medically refractory cVSP and in-hospital mortality.

In this review, we have discussed various aspects of black fungus particularly the etiology, taxonomy, risk factors, transmission, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and line of treatment to keep up to date on how to manage this fungal infection better.","output":"Mucormycosis (black fungus) and its impact on the COVID-19 patients: an updated review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Patella baja after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common problem that is usually treated via proximal transfer of the tibial tubercle. As the long-term outcomes of this procedure are unclarified, this study aimed to investigate the changes in clinical function and radiographic patellar height during five years of follow-up. METHODS: Sixty patients with patella baja after TKA who underwent proximalisation of the tibial tubercle were followed up for a mean of 71 months (range 21-153 months). The pre- and postoperative range of motion (ROM) and clinical scores (Knee Society Score (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)) were compared. The radiographic patellar height was measured with the Caton-Deschamps index (CDI), Blackburne-Peel ratio (BP), and modified Insall-Salvati index (MIS). RESULTS: Proximalisation of the tibial tubercle resulted in a significant improvement in the ROM from 80 to 88. The KSS and WOMAC did not improve or even worsened after the intervention. The radiographic patellar height immediately after tibial tubercle transfer was not better than prior to the intervention (CDI 0.72 vs. 0.63, p = 0.72; BP 0.66 vs. 0.61, p = 0.72; MIS 1.59 vs. 1.55, p = 1.00) and further decreased significantly so that the mean final values were worse than the values in the native joint (CDI 0.59 vs. 0.78, p = 0.001; BP 0.58 vs. 0.74, p = 0.001; MIS 1.39 vs. 1.81, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Proximalisation of the tibial tubercle in patients with patella baja after TKA does neither lead to significant improvements in the clinical outcome nor in the radiographic patellar height during long-term follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: To gather information regarding CIED procedures during active COVID-19, performed with personal protective equipment, based on an international survey. METHODS: Fifty-three centers from 13 countries across 4 continents provided information on 166 patients with known active COVID-19 who underwent a CIED procedure. RESULTS: CIED procedure rate in 133,655 hospitalized COVID-19 patients ranged from 0 to 16.2 per 1000 patients (p<0.001). Most devices were implanted due to high degree / complete AV block (112, 67.5%) or sick sinus syndrome (31, 18.7%). Of the166 patients surveyed, the 30-day complication rate was 13.9% and the 180-day mortality rate was 9.6%. One patient had a lethal outcome as a direct result of the procedure. Differences in patient and procedural characteristics and outcomes were found between Europe and North America. An older population (76.6 vs. 66 years, p<0.001) with a non-significant higher complication rate (16.5% vs. 7.7%, p=0.2) were observed in Europe, while a higher rate of critically ill patients (3.3% vs. 33.3%, p<0.001) and mortality (5% vs. 26.9%, p=0.002) were observed in North America.

In non\\\\ambulant DMD patients, hand function is relatively preserved and crucial for daily\\\\life activities. We used quantitative MRI (qMRI) to establish whether the thenar muscles could be valuable to monitor treatment effects in non\\\\ambulant DMD patients. METHODS: Seventeen non\\\\ambulant DMD patients (range 10.2C24.1 years) and 13 healthy controls (range 9.5C25.4 years) underwent qMRI of the right hand at 3 T at baseline. Thenar fat fraction (FF), total volume (TV), and contractile volume (CV) were determined using 4\\\\point Dixon, and T2(water) was determined using multiecho spin\\\\echo. Clinical assessments at baseline (n = 17) and 12 months (n = 13) included pinch strength (kg), performance of the upper limb (PUL) 2.0, DMD upper limb patient reported outcome measure (PROM), and playing a video game for 10 min using a game controller. Group differences and correlations were assessed with non\\\\parametric tests. RESULTS: Total volume was lower in patients compared with healthy controls (6.9 cm(3), 5.3C9.0 cm(3) vs. 13.0 cm(3), 7.6C15.8 cm(3), P = 0.010). CV was also lower in patients (6.3 cm(3), 4.6C8.3 cm(3) vs. 11.9 cm(3), 6.9C14.6 cm(3), P = 0.010). FF was slightly elevated (9.7%, 7.3C11.4% vs. 7.7%, 6.6C8.4%, P = 0.043), while T2(water) was higher (31.5 ms, 30.0C32.6 ms vs. 28.1 ms, 27.8C29.4 ms, P < 0.001). Pinch strength and PUL decreased over 12 months (2.857 kg, 2.137C4.010 to 2.243 kg, 1.930C3.339 kg, and 29 points, 20C36 to 23 points, 17C30, both P < 0.001), while PROM did not (49 points, 36C57 to 44 points, 30C54, P = 0.041).

Seven air disinfection techniques, including UV-C light, filtration, and face masks, among others, were applied to 13 different bacterial pathogens. More than 80% of studies suggested that air disinfection techniques were more effective at inactivating or killing bacteria than the comparator or baseline condition. However, it was not possible to compare these techniques because of methodological heterogeneity and the relatively small number of the studies.

The ability of lung transplant providers (LTP) to conduct face\\\\to\\\\face clinic visits for high\\\\risk immunocompromised patients, such as lung transplant recipients (LTR), was limited. Through the implementation of comprehensive medication management visits, pharmacists were able to assist LTP in the transition to telemedicine. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of telephone encounters from cardiothoracic (CT) transplant pharmacists at our center from March to September 2020 was completed. LTR scheduled for clinic visits with LTP were called prior to the visit by CT transplant pharmacists who conducted medication list reviews, adherence assessments, and medication access assistance. Clinical recommendations were communicated directly to the LTP and documented in patient electronic medical records. The primary outcome was the number of pharmacist\\\\driven clinical interventions. Secondary endpoints included the clinical severity and value of service of each intervention, percentage of accepted recommendations, patient cost savings interventions, prevention of adverse events, and avoidance of inappropriate doses. RESULTS: From March to September 2020, the CT transplant pharmacists conducted 385 virtual visits on 157 LTR with a median of 20 minutes spent per visit. There were 891 total interventions made by CT transplant pharmacists, including 778 medication discrepancies identified. Over 60% of encounters demonstrated some form of medication error and over 55% of encounters exhibited value of pharmacy services. CONCLUSION: Implementation of CT transplant pharmacist telehealth visits has potential for increased patient access to pharmacy care and improved accuracy of medication lists.

The membrane was dissolved in a medium, and the viral load was measured using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and a plaque assay. The approximate viral recovery rate of this system was 10% in simulation experiments to collect and quantify the viral particles aerosolized by a nebulizer.

The total viral detection rate was 41% (23/56), and the viral loads varied significantly (from <10, less than the detection limit, to 2240 viral gene copies/cough). Viable viruses were detected from 3 samples with 18 plaque forming units per cough sample. The virus detection rates were similar among different groups of patients infected with different viral subtypes and during different influenza seasons. Among patients who did not receive antiviral treatment, viruses were detected in one of six cases in the vaccinated group and four of six cases in the unvaccinated group.

METHODS: An online survey of 8158 Chinese adults between February 22 and March 5, 2020, was conducted. Bivariate associations between categorical variables were examined using Fisher exact test. We also explored the determinants of four NPIs as well as their association with COVID-19 infection using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 8158 adults included, 57 (0.73%) were infected with COVID-19. The overwhelming majority of respondents showed a positive attitude (n=8094, 99.2%), positive risk perception (n=8146, 99.9%), and high knowledge levels that were among the strongest predictors of the four adopted NPIs (handwashing: n=7895, 96.8%; proper coughing: 5997/6444, 93.1%; social distancing: n=7104/8158, 87.1%; and mask wearing: 5011/5120, 97.9%).

For those who did practice all other three NPIs, wearing a mask was associated with a significantly reduced risk of infection compared to those who did not wear a mask (0.6% vs 16.7%; P=.04). Similarly, for those who did not practice all or part of the other three NPIs, wearing a mask was also associated with a significantly reduced risk of infection.

For coronaviruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important polymerase that catalyzes the replication of RNA from RNA template and is an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we screened these chemical structures from traditional Chinese medicinal compounds proven to show antiviral activity in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the similar chemical structures through a molecular docking study to target RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We found that theaflavin has a lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp in SARS-CoV-2 (-9.11 kcal/mol), SARS-CoV (-8.03 kcal/mol), and MERS-CoV (-8.26 kcal/mol) from idock. To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin has lower binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol when it docks in the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by using the Blind Docking server. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were found between theaflavin and RdRp. Moreover, one &#960;-cation interaction was formed between theaflavin and Arg553 from the Blind Docking server. Our results suggest that theaflavin could be a potential SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor for further study.","output":"The potential chemical structure of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Published research on COVID-19 is increasing rapidly and integrated in guidelines. The trustworthiness of guidelines can vary depending on the methods used to assemble and evaluate the evidence, the completeness and transparency of reporting on the process undertaken and how conflicts of interest are addressed. With a global consortium of partners and collaborators, we have created a catalogue of COVID-19 recommendations as our direct response to the increased need for structured access to high quality guidance in the field. The COVID19 map of recommendations and gateway to contextualization (https://covid19.recmap.org) is a living project: emerging guideline literature is added on an ongoing basis, allowing granular access to individual recommendations. Building on prior work on mapping recommendations for the World Health Organization tuberculosis guidelines, a novel feature of this map is the self-directed contextualization of the recommendations using the GRADE-Adolopment approach to adopt, adapt or synthesize de novo recommendations for context specific questions. Through our map, stakeholders access the evidence underpinning a recommendation, select what needs to be contextualized and go through the steps of development of adapted recommendations. This one-stop shop portal of evidence-informed recommendations, built with intuitive functionalities, easy to navigate and with a support team ready to guide users across the maps, represents a long-needed tool for decision-makers, guideline developers and the public at large.","output":"Getting trustworthy guidelines into the hands of decision-makers and supporting their consideration of contextual factors for implementation globally: recommendation mapping of COVID-19 guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Insufficient physical activity (PA) is a critical public health issue especially in the context of COVID-related deconditioning.

This study aims to determine the yield of CTA and MRA in a prospective cohort of patients with SAH and a negative initial catheter angiogram. METHODS From January 1, 2005, until September 1, 2010, the authors instituted a prospective protocol in which patients with SAH-as documented by noncontrast CT or CSF xanthochromia and a negative initial catheter angiogram- were evaluated using CTA and MRA to assess for causative cerebral aneurysms. Two neuroradiologists independently evaluated the noncontrast CT scans to determine the SAH pattern (perimesencephalic or not) and the CT and MR angiograms to assess for causative cerebral aneurysms. RESULTS Seventy-seven patients were included, with a mean age of 52.8 years (median 54 years, range 19-88 years). Fifty patients were female (64.9%) and 27 male (35.1%). Forty-three patients had nonperimesencephalic SAH (55.8%), 29 patients had perimesencephalic SAH (37.7%), and 5 patients had CSF xanthochromia (6.5%). Computed tomography angiography demonstrated a causative cerebral aneurysm in 4 patients (5.2% yield), all of whom had nonperimesencephalic SAH (9.3% yield). Mean aneurysm size was 2.6 mm (range 2.1-3.3 mm). Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated only 1 of these aneurysms. No causative cerebral aneurysms were found in patients with perimesencephalic SAH or CSF xanthochromia.

Interleukin (IL)-1 or IL-6 inhibitors have been used to treat this patient population, but the comparative effectiveness of these different strategies remains undetermined. We aimed to compare IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. Methods: This cohort study included patients admitted to San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and hyperinflammation, defined as serum C-reactive protein concentration of 100 mg/L or more or ferritin concentration of 900 ng/mL or more. The primary endpoint was survival, and the secondary endpoint was a composite of death or mechanical ventilation (adverse clinical outcome). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving IL-1 inhibition (anakinra) or IL-6 inhibition (tocilizumab or sarilumab) with those of patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, after accounting for baseline differences. All patients received standard care. Interaction tests were used to assess the probability of survival according to C-reactive protein or lactate dehydrogenase concentrations. Findings: Of 392 patients included between Feb 25 and May 20, 2020, 275 did not receive interleukin inhibitors, 62 received the IL-1 inhibitor anakinra, and 55 received an IL-6 inhibitor (29 received tocilizumab and 26 received sarilumab). In the multivariable analysis, compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, patients treated with IL-1 inhibition had a significantly reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0450, 95% CI 0204-0990, p=0047), but those treated with IL-6 inhibition did not (0900, 0412-1966; p=079). In the multivariable analysis, there was no difference in adverse clinical outcome risk in patients treated with IL-1 inhibition (HR 0866, 95% CI 0482-1553; p=063) or IL-6 inhibition (0882, 0452-1722; p=071) relative to patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For increasing C-reactive protein concentrations, patients treated with IL-6 inhibition had a significantly reduced risk of mortality (HR 0990, 95% CI 0981-0999; p=0031) and adverse clinical outcome (0987, 0979-0995; p=00021) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For decreasing concentrations of serum lactate dehydrogenase, patients treated with an IL-1 inhibitor and patients treated with IL-6 inhibitors had a reduced risk of mortality; increasing concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase in patients receiving either interleukin inhibitor were associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 1009, 95% CI 1003-1014, p=00011 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1006, 1001-1011, p=0028 for IL-6 inhibitors) and adverse clinical outcome (1006, 1002-1010, p=00031 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1005, 1001-1010, p=0016 for IL-6 inhibitors) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. Interpretation: IL-1 inhibition, but not IL-6 inhibition, was associated with a significant reduction of mortality in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. IL-6 inhibition was effective in a subgroup of patients with markedly high C-reactive protein concentrations, whereas both IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition were effective in patients with low lactate dehydrogenase concentrations.

While pathogen evolution, co-infection, and behavioural changes have been proposed as possible mechanisms for the occurrence of subsequent outbreaks, the effect of public health interventions remains undetermined. METHODS: We develop mean-field and stochastic epidemiological models for disease transmission, and perform simulations to show how control measures, such as drug treatment and isolation of ill individuals, can influence the epidemic profile and generate sequences of infection waves with different characteristics. RESULTS: We demonstrate the impact of parameters representing the effectiveness and adverse consequences of intervention measures, such as treatment and emergence of drug resistance, on the spread of a pathogen in the population. If pathogen resistant strains evolve under drug pressure, multiple outbreaks are possible with variability in their characteristics, magnitude, and timing. In this context, the level of drug use and isolation capacity play an important role in the occurrence of subsequent outbreaks. Our simulations for influenza infection as a case study indicate that the intensive use of these interventions during the early stages of the epidemic could delay the spread of disease, but it may also result in later infection waves with possibly larger magnitudes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the importance of intervention parameters in the process of public health decision-making, and in evaluating control measures when facing substantial uncertainty regarding the epidemiological characteristics of an emerging infectious pathogen. Critical factors that influence population health including evolutionary responses of the pathogen under the pressure of different intervention measures during an epidemic should be considered for the design of effective strategies that address short-term targets compatible with long-term disease outcomes.","output":"Public health interventions for epidemics: implications for multiple infection waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Selenium deficiency adversely affects the clinical outcome of measles in the tropics.

Thus, identifying the status and related factors of protective behaviors among them after receiving vaccination will be crucial for epidemic control. This study aimed to gather information on the protective behaviors and to identify the associations of COVID-19 risk perception, eHealth literacy, and protective behaviors for Chinese college students following vaccination. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of college students engaged in protective behaviors post vaccination was conducted using the COVID-19 risk perception scale, eHealth literacy scale, and protective behaviors following vaccination questionnaire in one of the groups. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to confirm the correlation among the COVID-19 risk perception, eHealth literacy, and protective behaviors for Chinese college students. RESULTS: A total of 5,641 Chinese college students were included. Male students comprised 59.01% with an average age of (21.39  2.75) years and most students rating their health as very good (44.85%) or pretty good (46.98%). A smaller percentage (13.76%) believed that they would likely or most likely be infected with COVID-19 after getting vaccinated. In addition, more than 1 in 10 (10.35%) college students had ever suspected to suffer from post-vaccination reactions following the COVID-19 vaccination. The mean score of protective behaviors was 26.06  3.97. Approximately one-third (30.42%) of the students always or often did not wear a mask when going out. Some college students (29.25%) did not maintain distance of at least 1 m from others in social situations. Older female college students who were in good health and perceived as being at a low risk of getting infected with COVID-19, and those never suspected to suffer from post-vaccination reactions expected to engage in post-vaccination protective measures. Those with a higher level of perceived risk, severe risk perception and eHealth literacy, and a lower level of unknown risk perception were more likely to engage in further protective behaviors after getting vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the level of protective behaviors among the Chinese college students following vaccination could be improved, especially for male, younger college students in poor health. This study revealed the predictive effects of risk perception and eHealth literacy on protective behaviors, recommending that the negative and positive effects of risk perception should be balanced in epidemic risk management, and eHealth literacy promotion should also be emphasized for public health and social measures.","output":"Associations of COVID-19 Risk Perception, eHealth Literacy, and Protective Behaviors Among Chinese College Students Following Vaccination: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Corticosteroids, in particular dexamethasone, are one of the primary treatment options for critically ill COVID-19 patients.

This study also explores the effect of e-service quality on users' perception and satisfaction.FindingsThe results reveal that e-service quality directly affects the perceived value and satisfaction but has no direct effect on the willingness to pay. Secondly, perceived value and satisfaction mediated the relationships between service quality and willingness to pay. However, it is observed that perceived value has a more significant impact on the willingness to pay compared to satisfaction. It is further reported that perceived value is one of the antecedents of satisfaction. The study also explores the direct relationship between perceived value and willingness to pay, and introduces satisfaction as a mediating variable between perceived value and willingness to pay.Research limitations/implicationsThe sample is geographically limited as only online faculty and staff working at private universities participated in the study.

Various epidemiological and deep learning models have been developed to predict the COVID-19 outbreak, but all have limitations that affect the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. Our method aims at addressing these limitations and making earlier and more accurate pandemic outbreak predictions by (1) using patients' EHR data from different counties and states that encode local disease status and medical resource utilization condition; (2) considering demographic similarity and geographical proximity between locations; and (3) integrating pandemic transmission dynamics into deep learning models. MATERIALS AND METHODS We proposed a spatio-temporal attention network (STAN) for pandemic prediction. It uses an attention-based graph convolutional network to capture geographical and temporal trends and predict the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also designed a physical law-based loss term for enhancing long-term prediction. STAN was tested using both massive real-world patient data and open source COVID-19 statistics provided by Johns Hopkins university across all U.S. counties. RESULTS STAN outperforms epidemiological modeling methods such as SIR and SEIR and deep learning models on both long-term and short-term predictions, achieving up to 87% lower mean squared error compared to the best baseline prediction model. CONCLUSIONS By using information from real-world patient data and geographical data, STAN can better capture the disease status and medical resource utilization information and thus provides more accurate pandemic modeling. With pandemic transmission law based regularization, STAN also achieves good long-term prediction performance.","output":"STAN: Spatio-Temporal Attention Network for Pandemic Prediction Using Real World Evidence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE.

We calculate the water resources related to food consumption in nine major Mediterranean countries, by means of the water footprint (WF), for the existing situation (period 2011-2013) as well as the Mediterranean and EAT-Lancet diets. We account for different food intake requirements according to gender and six age groups. These nine countries C Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco - represent 88% of the population of all countries bordering the Mediterranean. As first major observation, we find that the EAT-Lancet diet, a scientifically optimised diet for both nutrition and certain environmental indicators, requires less water resources than the Mediterranean diet, a culturally accepted diet within the region. In terms of water resources use, adherence to the former is thus more beneficial than adherence to the latter. As second major observation, we find that the EAT-Lancet diet reduces the current WF for all nations consistently, within the range -17% to -48%, whereas the Mediterranean diet reduces the WF of the European countries, Turkey, Egypt and Morocco within the range of -4% to -35%. For the Maghreb countries Tunisia and Algeria, the Mediterranean diet WF is slightly higher compared to the current WF and the proportions of food product groups differ.

The analysis suggests that per capita income is a positive function of the effective trade openness and of the new Global Health Security Index indicator from the NTI/Johns Hopkins University.

This scenario is of particular concern when high consequence pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are circulating. Thousands of HCWs have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the determinants of aerosol generation during medical procedures and their relative risk to HCWs remain poorly characterized. RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this study was to characterize aerosols produced during airway intubation by using an uninfected translational animal model and in human subjects undergoing elective aerosol-generating procedures. The study also determined the particle size distribution of generated particles. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Aerosol generation was measured during highly controlled experimental (pig) intubations (N = 16) and elective bronchoscopies in uninfected patients (N = 49) using an optical particle counter. Recovery of normal respiratory flora was used as a surrogate for pathogen dispersion. RESULTS: There was a small but significant (P = .03) decrease in 0.3 m size particles during highly controlled pig intubations compared with baseline. The concentration of 1.0 m and 5.0 m aerosol particles did not significantly change, although oral bacteria were collected from the air. For elective patient bronchoscopies, there was a significant decrease in the generation of larger particles (1.0 m and 5.0 m) compared with baseline (P < .01); however, 18 of 39 (46%) patients showed increased aerosol production in 0.3 m size particles, four of whom exhibited measurable increases. INTERPRETATION: Although the total amount of aerosols produced during intubation and bronchoscopy did not increase significantly relative to preprocedural levels, a small number of participants exhibited a measurable increase in submicron particle emission, meriting further research to delineate determinants of fine particle production during aerosol-generating procedures.","output":"Characterization of Experimental and Clinical Bioaerosol Generation During Potential Aerosol-Generating Procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not applicable because this is an editorial","output":"EXPRESS: Faecal immunochemical tests in the COVID-19 pandemic;safety-netting of patients with symptoms and low faecal haemoglobin concentration a can a repeat test be used?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and this infectious disease is termed COVID-19 in short.

Different variants of TGEV-specific SIPs were created, of epsilon and alpha isotypes, by exploiting the dimerizing domains epsilonCH4 and alphaCH3 of human and swine origin. Transfected cells secreted these recombinant mini-antibodies efficiently, mainly as dimers stabilized covalently by inter-chain disulphide bridges. The specificity and functionality of the recombinant TGEV-specific SIPs were determined by in vitro binding, neutralization and infection-interference assays. The neutralization indices of the TGEV-specific SIPs were all very similar to that of the original TGEV-specific mAb, thus confirming that the immunological properties have been preserved in the recombinant SIPs.

This study aims to provide a comprehensive molecular profiling of the immune cell-enriched SARS-CoV-2 interacting protein USP13. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The list of immune cell-enriched proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved from The Human Protein Atlas. Genomic alterations were identified using cBioPortal. Survival analysis was performed via Kaplan-Meier Plotter. Analyses of protein expression and tumor infiltration levels were carried out by TIMER. KEY FINDINGS: 14 human proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 were enriched in immune cells. Among these proteins, USP13 had the highest frequency of genomic alterations. Higher USP13 levels were correlated with improved survival in breast and lung cancers, while resulting in poor prognosis in ovarian and gastric cancers.

Study Design: A prospective study including all women delivering at a large urban hospital in Miami, Florida between April 30 - July 31, 2020 was performed. Admitted patients were screened for SV. The FHT in all SV positive cases and SV negative controls 2 hours prior to delivery were evaluated for the presence of late decelerations, severe variable decelerations, loss of variability and persistent tachycardia. Cases and controls were matched for age, race, BMI, gestational age and comorbidities. Two investigators blinded to perinatal outcomes independently evaluated FHTs, and a 3rd resolved discrepancies. Placentas were graded by a perinatal pathologist based on Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group criteria. Result(s): 224 subjects consented to participate. 188 (83.9%) were negative and 36 (16.0%) were positive for SV. Placentas from SV positive participants were more likely to show FVM (P=0.001).

Nonetheless, the capacity planning of the SESs is challenging as it needs to fulfil the fluctuating demand from a long-term perspective, in addition to the intermittency and unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources (RESs). Owing to the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the capacity planning problem, an efficient technique must be employed to achieve a cost-effective system. Existing techniques are, subject to some constraints on the derivability and continuity of the objective function, prone to premature convergence, computationally demanding, follows rigorous procedures to fine-tune the algorithm parameters in different applications, and often do not offer a fair balance during the exploitation and exploration phase of the optimization process. Furthermore, the literature review indicates that researchers often do not implement and examine the energy management scheme (EMS) of a microgrid while computing for the capacity planning problem of microgrids. This paper proposes a rule-based EMS (REMS) optimized by a nature-inspired grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) for long-term capacity planning of a grid-independent microgrid incorporating a wind turbine, a photovoltaic, a battery (BT) bank and a diesel generator ([Formula: see text]). In which, a rule-based algorithm is used to implement an EMS to prioritize the usage of RES and coordinate the power flow of the proposed microgrid components. Subsequently, an attempt is made to explore and confirm the efficiency of the proposed REMS incorporated with GOA. The ultimate goal of the objective function is to minimize the cost of energy (COE) and the deficiency of power supply probability (DPSP). The performance of the REMS is examined via a long-term simulation study to ascertain the REMS resiliency and to ensure the operating limit of the BT storage is not violated. The result of the GOA is compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a cuckoo search algorithm (CSA). The simulation results indicate that the proposed techniques superiority is confirmed in terms of convergence to the optimal solution. The simulation results confirm that the proposed REMS has contributed to better adoption of a cleaner energy production system, as the scheme significantly reduces fuel consumption, [Formula: see text] emission and COE by 92.4%, 92.3% and 79.8%, respectively as compared to the conventional [Formula: see text].

The sequences were categorized according to sampling region, country, year, subtype, gene name, and sequence and were saved in a database constructed for this study. The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values of matrix, capsid, and gp120 and gp41 genes were calculated using correspondence analysis. The synonymous codon usage patterns based on the geographical regions of African countries showed broad distributions; when all the other regions, including Asia, Europe, and the Americas, were taken into account, the Asian countries tended to be divided into two groups. The sequences were clustered into nine non-CRF subtypes. Among these, subtype C showed the most distinct codon usage pattern. To determine why the codon usage patterns in Asian countries were divided into two groups for four target genes, the sequences of the isolates from the Asian countries were analyzed. As a result, the synonymous codon usage patterns among Asian countries were divided into two groups, the southern Asian countries and the other Asian countries, with subtype 01_AE being the most dominant subtype in southern Asia. In summary, the synonymous codon usage patterns among the individual HIV-1 subtypes reflect genetic variations, and this bioinformatics technique may be useful in conjunction with phylogenetic methods for predicting the evolutionary patterns of pandemic viruses.","output":"Epidemiological comparisons of codon usage patterns among HIV-1 isolates from Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a systemic entity that frequently implies neurologic features at presentation and complications during the disease course. We aimed to describe the characteristics and predictors for developing in-hospital neurologic manifestations in a large cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Mexico City. METHODS: We analyzed records from consecutive adult patients hospitalized from March 15 to June 30, 2020, with moderate to severe COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Neurologic syndromes were actively searched by a standardized structured questionnaire and physical examination, confirmed by neuroimaging, neurophysiology of laboratory analyses, as applicable. RESULTS: We studied 1,072 cases (65% men, mean age 53.213 years), 71 patients had pre-existing neurologic diseases (diabetic neuropathy: 17, epilepsy: 15, history of ischemic stroke: eight, migraine: six, multiple sclerosis: one, Parkinson disease: one), and 163 (15.2%) developed a new neurologic complication. Headache (41.7%), myalgia (38.5%), dysgeusia (8%), and anosmia (7%) were the most common neurologic symptoms at hospital presentation. Delirium (13.1%), objective limb weakness (5.1%), and delayed recovery of mental status after sedation withdrawal (2.5%), were the most common new neurologic syndromes. Age, headache at presentation, preexisting neurologic disease, invasive mechanical ventilation, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio &#8805;9 were independent predictors of new in-hospital neurologic complications.

Around 100 million people in Brazil (50% of the inhabitants) are users of social media networks, and a substantial amount of false information about the disease circulates in these media. Objectives: In this study, we examine the agenda-setting, media frame and content of misinformation published on the topic. Methods: We analysed all pieces of misinformation published by the Brazilian fact-checking service Lupa Agency during six months of 2020. We used content analysis to classify the texts into categories, and three types of rumours were identified: Misleading content; fabricated content; false context. Results: We analysed 232 pieces of misinformation. Most were published on Facebook (76%), followed by Whatsapp, with 10% of total cases. Half of the stories (47%) are classified as real-life, that is, the focus is on everyday situations, or circumstances involving people. Regarding the type of misinformation, there is a preponderance of fabricated content, with 53% of total, followed by false context (34%) and misleading content (13%). Wrong information was mostly published in text format (47%). We discuss the influence that misinformation can have on the behaviour of the Brazilian population during the pandemic and how the media's agenda-setting is influenced by false information published on social media. Conclusions: This study shows that misinformation about COVID-19 in Brazil seem to help establish an agenda-setting in the country, and the media frame is aligned with President Bolsonaro's political position.","output":"When governments spread lies, the fight is against two viruses: A study on the novel coronavirus pandemic in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Homelessness is associated with significant psychosocial and health disparities.

Previous studies have described potentially pathogenic infections of Babesia vesperuginis in insectivorous bats in Europe, the Americas and Asia. To date, no babesial infections have been documented in the bats of Madagascar, or in any frugivorous bat species worldwide. RESULTS: We used standard microscopy and conventional PCR to identify babesiae in blood from the endemic Madagascan flying fox (Pteropus rufus). Out of 203 P. rufus individuals captured between November 2013 and January 2016 and screened for erythrocytic parasites, nine adult males (4.43%) were infected with babesiae. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences obtained from positive samples indicates that they cluster in the Babesia microti clade, which typically infect felids, rodents, primates, and canids, but are distinct from B. vesperuginis previously described in bats. Statistical analysis of ecological trends in the data suggests that infections were most commonly observed in the rainy season and in older-age individuals. No pathological effects of infection on the host were documented; age-prevalence patterns indicated susceptible-infectious (SI) transmission dynamics characteristic of a non-immunizing persistent infection. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the first report of any erythrocytic protozoan infecting Madagascan fruit bats and the first record of a babesial infection in a pteropodid fruit bat globally. Given the extent to which fruit bats have been implicated as reservoirs for emerging human pathogens, any new record of their parasite repertoire and transmission dynamics offers notable insights into our understanding of the ecology of emerging pathogens.

As countries try to achieve universal health coverage (UHC), quality delivery of health services is crucial. CRC health care is an initiative around the need to provide quality care services to clients and patients. However, there is an evidence gap on the status of CRC health care service delivery. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to map global evidence on the status of CRC health service delivery practice. METHODS: An exhaustive literature review and Delphi technique were used to answer the 2 research questions: What is the current status of CRC health care practices among health workers? and Is it possible for health professionals, health managers, administrators, and policy makers to incorporate it into their activity while designing strategies that could improve the humanistic and holistic approach to health care provision? The studies were searched from the year 2014 to September 2020 using electronic databases such as MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Hinari, and the World Health Organization (WHO) library. Additionally, grey literature such as Google, Google Scholar, and WorldWideScience were scrutinized. Studies that applied any study design and data collection and analysis methods related to CRC care were included. Two authors extracted the data and compared the results. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion, or the third reviewer made the decision. Findings from the existing literature were presented using thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1193 potentially relevant studies were generated from the initial search, and 20 studies were included in the final review. From this review, we identified 5 thematic areas: the status of CRC implementation, facilitators for CRC health care service delivery, barriers to CRC health care delivery, disrespectful and abusive care encountered by patients, and perspectives on CRC. The findings of this review indicated that improving the mechanisms for monitoring health facilities, improving accountability, and becoming aware of the consequences of maltreatment within facilities are critical steps to improving health care delivery practices. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review identified that there is limited CRC service provision. Lack of training, patient flow volume, and bed shortages were found to be the main contributors of CRC health care delivery. Therefore, the health care system should consider the components of CRC in health care delivery during in-service training, pre-service training, monitoring and evaluation, community engagement, workload division, and performance appraisal.","output":"Status of Compassionate, Respectful, and Caring Health Service Delivery: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Document: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) executes the Secretary of Homeland Security's authorities to secure critical infrastructure Consistent with these authorities, CISA has developed, in collaboration with other federal agencies, State and local governments, and the private sector, an 'Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce' advisory list This list is intended to help State, local, tribal and territorial officials as they work to protect their communities, while ensuring continuity of functions critical to public health and safety, as well as economic and national security Decisions informed by this list should also take into consideration additional public health considerations based on the specific COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019]-related concerns of particular jurisdictions [ ] The advisory list identifies workers who conduct a range of operations and services that are typically essential to continued critical infrastructure viability, including staffing operations centers, maintaining and repairing critical infrastructure, operating call centers, working construction, and performing operational functions, among others It also includes workers who support crucial supply chains and enable functions for critical infrastructure The industries they support represent, but are not limited to, medical and healthcare, telecommunications, information technology systems, defense, food and agriculture, transportation and logistics, energy, water and wastewater, law enforcement, and public works COVID-19 (Disease);Critical infrastructure;Disaster recovery;Employees","output":"Advisory Memorandum on Identification of Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers During COVID-19 Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breast cancer (BC) is the cancer with the highest incidence in women in the world.

Businesspersons must make personnel, financial, and operational decisions to minimize transmission while preserving their business's vitality. Members of the public must make personal decisions about personal protective equipment and changing social, recreational, occupational, and spiritual behavior to protect themselves and others. The scientific community can shift how they illustrate the virus's behavior to the public in an appropriate and understandable way so that the public can make informed decisions. This article suggests the use of a single-case design and logarithmic analyses to improve the current methodologies for COVID-19 analysis and illustration.

RESULTS: Analysis and data visualization are standardized, providing an accurate depiction of the virus's growth for public dissemination and decision-making. An analytic strategy is demonstrated for retrospectively detecting meaningful changes in viral growth or prospectively measuring such changes that coincide with known mitigation strategies.

The ability to perform these experiments online provided University of Florida undergraduates located throughout the world access to unique, one-of-a-kind laboratory experiences. The virtual laboratories allowed students to undertake in-depth exploration and application of course content that is not possible in a residential setting. Completion of the Evolutionary Developmental Biology course provided undergraduate students the opportunity to obtain a science degree without ever visiting the universitys residential campus.

However, few data from a European population have been published, especially from hypertensive patients. AIM: To study the association between ACEi or ARB treatments and major adverse outcomes during hospitalisation in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We studied 545 consecutive hypertensive patients admitted to our institution due to COVID-19 with respiratory involvement. We analysed the incidence of combined event (death or mechanical ventilatory support) during hospitalisation, as well as the time to independent events. RESULTS: 188 (34.5%) patients presented the combined endpoint. 182 (33.4%) patients died, and 21 (3.9%) needed mechanical ventilatory support. Patients with previous treatment with ACEi or ARB presented similar incidence of the combined endpoint during hospitalisation (31.6% vs. 41.8%; p = 0.08), with a lower all-cause mortality rate (30.4% vs. 41.2%; p = 0.03) compared with those without prior treatment.

All PWID with SIRI were offered multidisciplinary care while inpatient, including the option of addiction medicine consultation and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). All patients were offered oral antibiotics in the event of a PDD either at discharge or immediately after discharge through an infectious diseases telemedicine clinic. Additional support services included health coaches, a therapist, a case manager, free clinic follow-up, and medications in an outpatient bridge program. Patient demographics, comorbidities, 90-day readmissions, and substance use disorder clinic follow-up were compared between PWID with PDD on oral antibiotics and those who completed intravenous (IV) antibiotics using an as-treated approach. RESULTS: Of 166 PWID with SIRI, 61 completed IV antibiotics inpatient (37%), while 105 had a PDD on oral antibiotics (63%). There was no significant difference in 90-day readmission rates between groups (P = .819). For PWID with a PDD on oral antibiotics, 7.6% had documented nonadherence to antibiotics, 67% had documented adherence, and 23% were lost to follow-up.

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.80). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, -5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).

Data on sociodemographic, COVID-19 symptoms/diagnoses for self or someone close, and anxiety were collected. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS Anxiety among individuals affected by the pandemic remained stable over time. Individuals or those with someone close diagnosed with COVID-19 had greater odds of having anxiety (OR = 1.55; 95%CI 1.12, 2.14) compared to those who had not been diagnosed (self or close other) with COVID-19. Individuals or those with someone close to them who had symptoms of COVID-19 had greater odds of having anxiety (OR = 2.08; 95%CI 1.51, 2.87) compared to those who did not report symptoms (self or close other). CONCLUSIONS This evidence highlights the importance of targeted psychosocial interventions for those directly impacted by the COVID-19 virus.","output":"The association between COVID-19 diagnosis or having symptoms and anxiety among Canadians: A repeated cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic introduced many challenges for research scientists: reduction of lab and field observation collection and in-person meetings. These new constraints forced researchers to remote work and virtual networking, dramatically influencing scientific inquiry. Such challenges are compounded for those in early stages of their career, where data collection and networking are vital to be seen as productive. However, during this trying time of remote work, we, as a collective of early-career oceanographers, were actively developing and improving on an already-existent hybrid community of practice. Through our experiences, we believe this type of framework can enhance virtual collaboration to the point that it outlasts the pandemic and helps create new synergies that will diversify and enhance scientific inquiry within the ocean science community. We describe a hybrid community of practice and an example workflow that models effective collaboration. We have found that three components to this model are necessary for effective collaboration, inspiration, and communication: 1) openly accessible data, 2) software, computational, and professional-development resources, and 3) a team science approach. In our experience, both the in-person and remote aspects of the model are important. In person collaboration is key to expanding the community of practice and invigorating those already within the community. Remote collaboration has been critical for effective collaborations between in-person activities and has proven to maximize outputs during in-person collaborations. While the three components of this model are not new to the scientific community, we believe that utilizing them strategically post-pandemic will diversify and expand scientific collaboration in oceanography.","output":"Catalyzing Remote Collaboration During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: Early Career Oceanographers Adopt Hybrid Open Science Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in infants undergoing cardiac surgery is associated with significant mortality and prolonged ventilation; surfactant administration may be a useful therapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of low-dose exogenous surfactant therapy on infants suffering ARDS after cardiac surgery. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of infants diagnosed with moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 150) after cardiac surgery. A case was defined as a patient that received surfactant and standard therapy, while a control was defined as a patient that underwent standard therapy. The primary endpoint was the improvement in oxygenation index (OI) after 24-h of surfactant treatment; and secondary endpoints were the ventilator time and PICU time. RESULTS: Twenty-two infants treated with surfactant were matched with 22 controls. Early low-dose (20 mg/kg) surfactant treatment was associated with improved outcomes. After surfactant administration for 24-h, the surfactant group was much better compared with the control group at the 24-h in OI (difference in average change from baseline, ? 6.7 [95% CI, ? 9.3 to ? 4.1]) (P < 0.01) and ventilation index (VI, mean difference, ? 11.9 [95% CI, ? 18.1 to ? 5.7]) (P < 0.01). Ventilation time and PICU time were significantly shorter in the surfactant group compared with the control group (133.6 h  27.2 vs 218.4 h  28.7, P < 0.01; 10.7d  5.1 vs 17.5d  6.8, P < 0.01). Infants in the surfactant group under 3 months benefit more from OI and VI than the infants over 3 months in a preliminary exploratory analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In infants with moderate-to-severe ARDS after cardiac surgery, early low-dose exogenous surfactant treatment could prominently improve oxygenation and reduce mechanical ventilation time and PICU time. Infants younger than 3 months may get more benefit of oxygenation than the older ones. Randomized controlled trials are needed to explore the effect of surfactant to ARDS of cardiac surgical infants.","output":"Effect of low-dose exogenous surfactant on infants with acute respiratory distress syndrome after cardiac surgery: a retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The relationship between knowledge, risk perceptions, health belief towards seasonal influenza and vaccination and the vaccination behaviours of nurses was explored.

Effective communication of this risk to both clinicians and patients can be problematic. The purpose of this study was to develop a metric called the efficiency index (EI), defined as the ratio of test accuracy and inaccuracy, to evaluate screening tests for dementia. This measure was compared with a previously described likelihood to be diagnosed or misdiagnosed (LDM), also based on numbers needed metrics. Datasets from prospective pragmatic test accuracy studies examining four brief cognitive screening instruments (Mini-Mental State Examination; Montreal Cognitive Assessment; Mini-Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination (MACE); and Free-Cog) were analysed to calculate values for EI and LDM, and to examine their variation with test cut-off for MACE and dementia prevalence. EI values were also calculated using a modification of McGees heuristic for the simplification of likelihood ratios to estimate percentage change in diagnostic probability. The findings indicate that EI is easier to calculate than LDM and, unlike LDM, may be classified either qualitatively or quantitatively in a manner similar to likelihood ratios. EI shows the utility or inutility of diagnostic and screening tests, illustrating the inevitable trade-off between diagnosis and misdiagnosis. It may be a useful metric to communicate risk in a way that is easily intelligible for both clinicians and patients.","output":"Communicating Risk: Developing an Efficiency Index for Dementia Screening Tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental education enables students to critically analyze their impact on the world while producing environmentally knowledgeable and engaged global citizens with the skills and motivation necessary to participate in developing and implementing solutions to societal and environmental challenges.

Systemic efforts to address the use of firearms in suicide had been largely evaded. In June 2020, the White House published the Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End the National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS) task force report, which verified the link between, and the need to address, at-risk veterans and their access to firearms. This paper reviews the literature on the intersection of veterans, firearms, and suicide, then explores existing VA prevention initiatives aimed at reducing at-risk veterans' access to lethal means and offers policy recommendations to expand efforts in the context of the PREVENTS Roadmap. Observations The PREVENTS report recommends widespread distribution of safety education materials that encourage at-risk individuals to temporarily transfer or store their guns safely and the expansion of free or affordable options for storing weapons. Recommended policy actions to accomplish this goal include delaying access to firearms for at-risk veterans, facilitating temporary storage out of the home, improving in-home safe storage options, requiring that health care providers who care for high-risk veterans are trained in lethal means safety counseling, and creating campaigns to shift cultural norms for firearms' storage during crises. Conclusions Suicide prevention requires a multimodal approach, and attention to firearms access must become a more salient component.

MethodsThis systematic literature review assessed studies published between December 2019 and April 1, 2021 in Medline and Embase, which included studies that assessed educational settings from approximately January 2020 to January 2021. The inclusion criteria were based on the PCC framework (P-Population, C-Concept, C-Context). The study Population was restricted to people 1-17 years old (excluding neonatal transmission), the Concept was to assess child-to-child and child-to-adult transmission, while the Context was to assess specifically educational setting transmission clusters. ResultsFifteen studies met inclusion criteria, ranging from daycare centers to high schools and summer camps, while eight studies assessed the re-opening of schools in the 2020-2021 school year. In principle although there is sufficient evidence that children can both be infected by and transmit SARS-CoV-2 in school settings, the SAR remain relatively low -when NPI measures are implemented in parallel. Moreover, although the evidence was limited there was an indication that younger children may have a lower SAR than adolescents. ConclusionsTransmission in educational settings in 2020 was minimal -when NPI measures were implemented in parallel. However, with an upsurge of cases related to variants of concern, continuous surveillance and assessment of the evidence is warranted to ensure the maximum protection of the health of students and the educational workforce, while also minimising the numerous negative impacts that school closures may have on children.

METHODS: The VITOM? is a specially designed exoscope mounted onto a versatile mechanical arm. It is attached to a high definition (HD) digital camera displayed on the HD video monitor of a standard endoscopy stack. This technology has been utilised in other surgical subspecialties, but there is no documented use within extraocular surgery.

In addition, vitamin D has been associated with pulmonary function and the incidence of airway infections. As vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, supplementation might have a beneficial effect in these patients. OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on respiratory muscle strength and physical performance in vitamin D-deficient COPD patients. Secondary outcomes are pulmonary function, handgrip strength, exacerbation rate, and quality of life. METHODS We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Participants were randomly allocated to receive 1,200 IU vitamin D3 per day (n=24) or placebo (n=26) during 6 months. Study visits were conducted at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months after randomization. During the visits, blood was collected, respiratory muscle strength was measured (maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure), physical performance and 6-minute walking tests were performed, and handgrip strength and pulmonary function were assessed. In addition, participants kept a diary card in which they registered respiratory symptoms. RESULTS At baseline, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration (nmol/L) was 42.3 (15.2) in the vitamin D group and 40.6 (17.0) in the placebo group. Participants with vitamin D supplementation had a larger increase in serum 25(OH)D compared to the placebo group after 6 months (mean difference (SD): +52.8 (29.8) vs +12.3 (25.1), P<0.001). Primary outcomes, respiratory muscle strength and physical performance, did not differ between the groups after 6 months. In addition, no differences were found in the 6-minute walking test results, handgrip strength, pulmonary function, exacerbation rate, or quality of life.

In this context, the role of resolvins, specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), deriving from omega-3 essential fatty acids, may be crucial. Indeed, differential production in numerous high-risk conditions associated with both childbirth and neonatal health, the correlation between maternal omega-3 intake and resolvin concentrations in maternal blood and at the placental level, and the high values found in breast milk in the first month of breastfeeding, are some of the most important hallmarks of these autacoids. In addition, a growing body of scientific evidence supports the lack of SPMs, at the level of immune-metabolic tissues, in the case of obesity. Furthermore, the obesity-related lack of SPMs seems to be decisive in the context of the current outbreak of COVID-19, as it appears to be one of the causes associated with the higher incidence of complications and negative outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The usefulness of metabolomics in this field appears clear, given that through the metabolome it is possible to observe the numerous and complex interactions between the mother, the placenta and the fetus in order to identify specific biomarkers useful in the prediction, diagnosis and monitoring of the various obstetric conditions.

Data regarding the host response within the lung are sparse. The objective is to compare alveolar and systemic inflammation response patterns, mitochondrial alarmin release, and outcomes according to ARDS etiology (i.e., COVID-19 vs. non-COVID-19). METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma were obtained from 7 control, 7 non-COVID-19 ARDS, and 14 COVID-19 ARDS patients. Clinical data, plasma, and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentrations of 45 inflammatory mediators and cell-free mitochondrial DNA were measured and compared. RESULTS: COVID-19 ARDS patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) for significantly longer, even after adjustment for potential confounders. There was a trend toward higher concentrations of plasma CCL5, CXCL2, CXCL10, CD40 ligand, IL-10, and GM-CSF, and ELF concentrations of CXCL1, CXCL10, granzyme B, TRAIL, and EGF in the COVID-19 ARDS group compared with the non-COVID-19 ARDS group. Plasma and ELF CXCL10 concentrations were independently associated with the number of ventilator-free days, without correlation between ELF CXCL-10 and viral load. Mitochondrial DNA plasma and ELF concentrations were elevated in all ARDS patients, with no differences between the two groups. ELF concentrations of mitochondrial DNA were correlated with alveolar cell counts, as well as IL-8 and IL-1 concentrations. CONCLUSION: CXCL10 could be one key mediator involved in the dysregulated immune response. It should be evaluated as a candidate biomarker that may predict the duration of MV in COVID-19 ARDS patients. Targeting the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis could also be considered as a new therapeutic approach.

Indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) of breastmilk tryptophan was identified as the anti-inflammatory metabolite involved in probiotic conditioned media from Bifidobacteria longum subsp infantis. This study aimed to explore the molecular endocytic pathways involved in the protective ILA effect against inflammation. H4 cells, Caco-2 cells, C57BL/6 pup and adult mice were used to compare the anti-inflammatory mechanisms between immature and mature enterocytes in vitro and in vivo. The results show that ILA has pleiotropic protective effects on immature enterocytes including anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and developmental regulatory potentials in a region-dependent and an age-dependent manner. Quantitative transcriptomic analysis revealed a new mechanistic model in which STAT1 pathways play an important role in IL-1-induced inflammation and ILA has a regulatory effect on STAT1 pathways. These studies were validated by real-time RT-qPCR and STAT1 inhibitor experiments. Different protective reactions of ILA between immature and mature enterocytes indicated that ILAs effects are developmentally regulated. These findings may be helpful in preventing NEC for premature infants.","output":"The impact of indole-3-lactic acid on immature intestinal innate immunity and development: a transcriptomic analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) usually causes localized zoster in adults. However, in immunocompromised patients, it can cause systemic infection accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and hepatitis. Although most of critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) are immunologically compromised, they are usually not considered to be at risk for systemic VZV infection. We report two cases of systemic VZV infection occurring in critically ill patients in an ICU. One patient was a 69-year-old man with Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced purpurafulminans, and the other was a 75-year-old woman with severe acute pancreatitis. During the clinical course in the ICU, characteristic vesicles with umbilical fossa appeared diffusely and bilaterally on their face, trunk, and extremities. VZV-specific IgG levels were confirmed to be elevated compared to that of the pre-onset, and a diagnosis of recurrent VZV infection was made in both patients. The patients were treated at the same ICU but did not coincide with each other; therefore a cross-infection was unlikely. They were treated with intravenous acyclovir, but the latter patient eventually died of respiratory failure. VZV infection can cause a number of serious complications, and can lead to death in some patients. Early detection and proper treatment are needed to prevent the infection from spreading out and save the patients. It might be necessary to consider antiviral prophylaxis against VZV infection for a part of critically ill patients in ICU, although the effectiveness of this approach is yet to be established.","output":"Systemic varicella-zoster virus infection in two critically ill patients in an intensive care unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Temporal dynamics of behavior, particularly facial expressions, are fundamental for communication between individuals from very early in development. Facial expression processing has been widely demonstrated to involve embodied simulative processes mediated by the motor system. Such processes may be impaired in patients with congenital facial palsy, including those affected by Moebius syndrome (MBS). The aims of this study were to investigate (a) the role of motor mechanisms in the processing of dynamic facial expression timing by testing patients affected by congenital facial palsy and (b) age-dependent effects on such processing. Accordingly, we recruited 38 typically developing individuals and 15 individuals with MBS, ranging in age from childhood to adulthood. We used a time comparison task where participants were asked to identify which one of two dynamic facial expressions was faster. Results showed that MBS individuals performed worse than controls in correctly estimating the duration of facial expressions. Interestingly, we did not find any performance differences in relation to age. These findings provide further evidence for the involvement of the motor system in processing facial expression duration and suggest that a sensorimotor matching mechanism may contribute to such timing perception from childhood.","output":"Facial Expression Time Processing in Typical Development and in Patients with Congenital Facial Palsy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac alterations are frequently observed after acute neurological disorders. Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) represents an acute heart failure syndrome and is increasingly recognized as part of the spectrum of cardiac complications observed after neurological disorders. A systematic investigation of TTS patients with neurological disorders has not been conducted yet. The aim of the study was to expand insights regarding neurological disease entities triggering TTS and to investigate the clinical profile and outcomes of TTS patients after primary neurological disorders. The International Takotsubo Registry is an observational multicenter collaborative effort of 45 centers in 14 countries (ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT01947621). All patients in the registry fulfilled International Takotsubo Diagnostic Criteria. For the present study, patients were included if complete information on acute neurological disorders were available. 2402 patients in whom complete information on acute neurological status were available were analyzed. In 161 patients (6.7%) an acute neurological disorder was identified as the preceding triggering factor. The most common neurological disorders were seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke. Time from neurological symptoms to TTS diagnosis was  2 days in 87.3% of cases. TTS patients with neurological disorders were younger, had a lower female predominance, fewer cardiac symptoms, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and higher levels of cardiac biomarkers. TTS patients with neurological disorders had a 3.2-fold increased odds of in-hospital mortality compared to TTS patients without neurological disorders. In this large-scale study, 1 out of 15 TTS patients had an acute neurological condition as the underlying triggering factor. Our data emphasize that a wide spectrum of neurological diseases ranging from benign to life-threatening encompass TTS.

This study aims to evaluate the use of open-source data from the epidemic observatory, EpiWATCH, to identify the early signals of pneumonia of unknown cause as a proxy for COVID-19 in Indonesia. METHODS: Using open-source data on pneumonia of unknown cause in Indonesia between 1 November 2019 and 31 March 2020 (extracted from EpiWATCH, an open-source epidemic observatory), a descriptive analysis was performed to identify the trend of pneumonia of unknown cause in Indonesia before official notification of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: A rise in reports of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Indonesia, starting from late January 2020. There were 304 reported cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, 30 of which occurred before the identification of the first COVID-19 cases on 2 March 2020. The early signals of pneumonia of unknown cause in Indonesia may indicate possible unrecognized circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before official detection. DISCUSSION: Open-source data may provide rapid, unvalidated information for early detection of outbreaks. Although unvalidated, such information may be used to supplement or trigger investigation and testing.

Objective: To describe how maternal health sociodemographic factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, education), health behaviours (e.g., diet), and traditional health care use during pregnancy impact infant diet at age 1-year. Methods: Data were collected from the Indigenous Birth Cohort (ABC) study, a prospective birth cohort formed in partnership with an Indigenous community-based Birthing Centre in southwestern Ontario, Canada. 110 mother-infant dyads are included in the study and were enrolled between 2012 and 2017. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to understand factors associated with infant diet scores at age 1-year, with a higher score indicating a diet with more healthy foods. Results: The mean age of women enrolled during pregnancy was 27.3 (5.9) years. Eighty percent of mothers had low or moderate social disadvantage, 47.3% completed more than high school education, and 70% were cared for by a midwife during their pregnancy. The pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was <25 in 34.5% of women, 15.5% of mothers smoked during pregnancy, and 14.5% of mothers had gestational diabetes. Being cared for by an Indigenous midwife was associated with a 0.9-point higher infant diet score (p = 0.001) at age 1-year, and lower maternal social disadvantage was associated with a 0.17-point higher infant diet quality score (p = 0.04). Conclusion: This study highlights the positive impact of health care provision by Indigenous midwives and confirms that higher maternal social advantage has a positive impact on child nutrition.","output":"Impact of Maternal Health Behaviours and Social Conditions on Infant Diet at Age 1-Year: Results from a Prospective Indigenous Birth Cohort in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: High blood pressure is an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is a major cause of disability and death. Managing a healthy lifestyle has been shown to reduce blood pressure and improve health outcomes. We aim to investigate the effectiveness of a lifestyle modification intervention program for lowering blood pressure in a rural area of Bangladesh. METHODS: A single-center cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). The study will be conducted for 6 months, a total of 300 participants of age 30 to 75 years with 150 adults in each of the intervention and the control arms. The intervention arm will involve the delivery of a blended learning education program on lifestyle changes for the management of high blood pressure. The education program comprises evidence-based information with pictures, fact sheets, and published literature about the effects of high blood pressure on CVD development, increased physical activity, and the role of a healthy diet in blood pressure management. The control group involves providing information booklets and general advice at the baseline data collection point. The primary outcome will be the absolute difference in clinic SBP and DBP. Secondary outcomes include the difference in the percentage of people adopting regular exercise habits, cessation of smoking and reducing sodium chloride intake, health literacy of all participants, and the perceived barriers and enablers to adopt behavior changes by collecting qualitative data. Analyses will include analysis of covariance to report the mean difference in blood pressure between the control and the intervention group and the difference in change in blood pressure due to the intervention. DISCUSSION: The study will assess the effects of physical activity and lifestyle modification in controlling high blood pressure. This study will develop new evidence as to whether a simple lifestyle program implemented in a rural region of a low- and middle-income country will improve blood pressure parameters for people with different chronic diseases by engaging community people.

METHODS: 66 women with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and their 42 neonates were included in the prospective observational study. Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and instrumental data of pregnancy, delivery, postpartum period, including pharmacotherapy and neonatal outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: 15 (22.7%) women were asymptomatic, 25 (38%) had mild disease, while moderate and severe forms were detected in 20 (30.2%) and 6 (9.1%) cases, respectively. Additional oxygenation was required in 6 (9%) cases: 4 (6%) received CPAP therapy and 2 (3%) - mechanical ventilation. Main clinical symptoms were cough (51.5%), anosmia (34.9%), and hyperthermia (33.3%). Laboratory changes included increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine, d-dimer, and C-reactive protein (CRP), anemia, and leukopenia. All pregnant women received low molecular weight heparin and interferon alfa-2b according to the National clinical recommendations. Antimicrobial drugs included Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid (46%) and macrolides (28%) or carbapenems in severe cases of disease. Spontaneous abortion was reported in 6.1% of cases.

No cases of neonatal COVID-19 infection were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Mostly, the manifestations of COVID-19 were mild. However, 9% of cases were severe, and could contribute to preterm delivery or maternal morbidity. Main predictors of severe COVID-19 course in pregnant women were a decrease in the levels of erythrocytes and lymphocytes and increase in the levels of alanine aminotransferase and CRP.

Recently, several updated operational guidelines for HVAC systems have been issued by various institutions to control the airborne transmission and mitigate infection risks in enclosed environments. Challenges and innovations emerge in response to operational variations of HVAC systems.

Our objective is to evaluate whether HFNC oxygenation for preoxygenation and apnoeic oxygenation maintains higher oxygen saturation (SpO2) during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in ED patients compared to usual care. METHODS This was a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial in adult ED patients requiring RSI. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to either intervention (HFNC oxygenation at 60L/min) group or control (non-rebreather mask for preoxygenation and nasal prongs of at least 15L/min oxygen flow for apnoeic oxygenation) group. Primary outcome was lowest SpO2 during the first intubation attempt. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SpO2 falling below 90% and safe apnoea time. RESULTS One hundred and ninety patients were included, with 97 in the intervention and 93 in the control group. Median lowest SpO2 during the first intubation attempt was 100% in both groups. Incidence of SpO2 falling below 90% was lower in the intervention group (15.5%) compared to the control group (22.6%) (adjusted relative risk=0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-1.25).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 30 patients with overdentures, who were selected from the dental records filed at the institution. Data on general health and the dental implants involved (brand, type of prosthetic connection, number of implants, and additional overdenture retention system) were collected from the medical records. The 30 patients were invited to answer the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) and visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaires, and due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, it was possible to contact 15 patients. RESULTS: Most of the prostheses studied were mandibular overdentures, and 66.66% of the cases were retained by the O-ring system. As for the oral health self-perception of the individuals, it was concluded that male patients had a lower mean overall score (p = 0.047) and functional domain (p = 0.042) in the OHIP-14. The number of implants and the installation arch interfered with functional domain and psychological capacity (p <0.05). The VAS showed that women have greater esthetic satisfaction with prostheses (p = 0.048) and that the bar-clip retention system is more satisfactory than the O-ring (p = 0.017).

We aimed to examine the evolution of the proportion of seropositive children at schools from June-July 2020 to March-April 2021. We also examined symptoms, under-detection of infections, potential preventive effect of face masks, and reasons for non-participation in the study. METHODS Children in lower (7C10 years), middle (8C13 years) and upper (12C17 years) school levels in randomly selected schools and classes in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, were invited to participate in the prospective cohort study Ciao Corona. Three testing rounds were completed in June-July 2020, October-November 2020 and March-April 2021. From 5230 invited, 2974 children from 275 classes in in 55 schools participated in at least one testing round. We measured SARS-CoV-2 serology in venous blood, and parents filled in questionnaires on sociodemographic information and symptoms. RESULTS The proportion of children seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 increased from 1.5% (95% credible interval [CrI] 0.6C2.6%) by June-July 2020, to 6.6% (4.0C8.9%) by October-November, and to 16.4% (12.1C19.5%) by March-April 2021. By March-April 2021, children in upper school level (12.4%; 7.3C16.7%) were less likely to be seropositive than those in middle (19.5%; 14.2C24.4%) or lower school levels (16.0%; 11.0C20.4%). The ratio of PCR-diagnosed to all seropositive children changed from one to 21.7 (by June-July 2020) to one to 3.5 (by March-April 2021). Potential clusters of three or more newly seropositive children were detected in 24 of 119 (20%) classes, 17 from which could be expected by chance. Clustering was not higher than expected by chance in middle and upper school levels. Children in the upper school level, who were wearing face masks at school from November 2020, had a 5.1% (95% confidence interval 9.4% to 0.7%) lower than expected seroprevalence by March-April 2021 than those in middle school level, based on difference-in-differences analysis. Symptoms were reported by 37% of newly seropositive and 16% seronegative children. Fear of blood sampling (64%) was the most frequently reported reason for non-participation. CONCLUSIONS Although the proportion of seropositive children increased from 1.5% in June-July 2020 to 16.4% in March-April 2021, few infections were likely associated with potential spread within schools.

In this paper, we investigate the role of demographic patterns, urbanisation and comorbidities on the possible trajectories of COVID-19 in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal. METHODS: We use an augmented deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to predict the true spread of the disease, under the containment measures taken so far. We disaggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19. We also account for age structures, urbanisation and comorbidities (HIV, tuberculosis, anaemia). RESULTS: In our baseline model, we project that the peak of active cases will occur in July, subject to the effectiveness of policy measures. When accounting for the urbanisation, and factoring in comorbidities, the peak may occur between 2 June and 17 June (Ghana), 22 July and 29 August (Kenya) and, finally, 28 May and 15 June (Senegal). Successful containment policies could lead to lower rates of severe infections. While most cases will be mild, we project in the absence of policies further containing the spread, that between 0.78% and 1.03%, 0.61% and 1.22%, and 0.60% and 0.84% of individuals in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal, respectively, may develop severe symptoms at the time of the peak of the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Compared with Europe, Africa's younger and rural population may modify the severity of the epidemic. The large youth population may lead to more infections but most of these infections will be asymptomatic or mild, and will probably go undetected. The higher prevalence of underlying conditions must be considered.","output":"The relatively young and rural population may limit the spread and severity of COVID-19 in Africa: a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with interest the Editorial by Cron and Chatam (1) suggesting a cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) occurring in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and, consequently, a possible role for targeted approaches to blocking inflammatory cytokines.","output":"Absence of severe complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with rheumatic diseases treated with biologic drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In recent months, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health challenge. Nutrition is a key determining factor of health. In the present research, we assess and compare dietary food groups and nutrient supplements intake of diabetic, hypertensive and heart disease patients with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and asymptomatic controls. Methods: : This retrospective case-control research was conducted on 98 patients with diabetes, hypertension, and/or heart disease that 37 of them were COVID-19 positive with clinical symptoms. Dietary intakes of participants were recorded using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), which was designed and validated for the Iranian population. Results: : 54% of all subjects had nutritional supplements consumption in the last 6 months, and there was no significant difference in the type of nutritional supplements between cases and controls. There was no significant difference in the median intake of food groups, in the last year, in metabolic syndrome patients with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 compared to controls. Crud OR shown, adequate consumption of any food groups was not associated with the occurrence of COVID-19.

Genomic viral integrations, termed endogenous viral elements (EVEs), could protect the host from infection. It is widely known past viral infections and EVEs play an active role in antiviral defence in invertebrates and plants. This study aimed to characterise actively transcribed EVEs in Australian marsupial species, because they may play an integral role in cellular defence against viruses. This study screened publicly available RNA sequencing data sets (n = 35) and characterised 200 viral transcripts from thirteen Australian marsupial species. Of the 200 transcripts, 188 originated from either Bornaviridae, Filoviridae, or Parvoviridae EVEs. The other twelve transcripts were from putative active infections from members of the Herpesviridae and Anelloviridae, and Hepadnaviridae. EVE transcripts (n = 188) were mapped to marsupial genomes (where available, n = 5/13) to identify the genomic insertion sites. Of the 188 transcripts, 117 mapped to 39 EVEs within the koala, bare-nosed wombat, tammar wallaby, brushtail possum, and Tasmanian devil genomes. The remaining eight animals had no available genome (transcripts n = 71). Every marsupial has Bornaviridae, Filoviridae, and Parvoviridae EVEs, a trend widely observed in eutherian mammals. Whilst eutherian bornavirus EVEs are predominantly nucleoprotein-derived, marsupial bornavirus EVEs demonstrate a surprising replicase gene bias. We predicted these widely distributed EVEs were conserved within marsupials from ancient germline integrations, as many were over 65 million years old. One bornavirus replicase EVE, present in six marsupial genomes, was estimated to be 160 million years old, predating the AmericanCAustralian marsupial split. We considered transcription of these EVEs through small non-coding RNA as an ancient viral defence. Consistent with this, in koala small RNA sequence data sets, we detected Bornaviridae replicase and Filoviridae nucleoprotein produced small RNA. These were enriched in testis tissue, suggesting they could protect marsupials from vertically transmitted viral integrations.","output":"Ancient viral integrations in marsupials: a potential antiviral defence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A tcnica de PCR pode ser empregada para a detec??o e identifica??o de agentes patognicos e, tem por isso grande aplicabilidade em estudos de epidemiologia molecular.

We examined the frequency of acute intracranial abnormalities seen on CT and/or MR imaging in patients with COVID-19 and investigated possible associations between these findings and clinical parameters, including length of hospital stay, requirement for intubation, and development of acute kidney injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective study performed at a large academic hospital in the United States. A total of 641 patients presented to our institution between March 3, 2020, and May 6, 2020, for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019, of whom, 150 underwent CT and/or MR imaging of the brain. CT and/or MR imaging examinations were evaluated for the presence of hemorrhage, infarction, and leukoencephalopathy. The frequency of these findings was correlated with clinical variables, including body mass index, length of hospital stay, requirement for intubation, and development of acute kidney injury as documented in the electronic medical record. RESULTS Of the 150 patients, 26 (17%) had abnormal CT and/or MR imaging findings, with hemorrhage in 11 of the patients (42%), infarction in 13 of the patients (50%), and leukoencephalopathy in 7 of the patients (27%). Significant associations were seen between abnormal CT/MR imaging findings and intensive care unit admission (P = .039), intubation (P = .004), and acute kidney injury (P = .030). CONCLUSIONS A spectrum of acute neuroimaging abnormalities was seen in our cohort of patients with coronavirus disease 2019, including hemorrhage, infarction, and leukoencephalopathy. Significant associations between abnormal neuroimaging studies and markers of disease severity (intensive care unit admission, intubation, and acute kidney injury) suggest that patients with severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 may have higher rates of neuroimaging abnormalities.","output":"Clinical and Neuroimaging Correlation in Patients with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework provides a rich and actionable repository of adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures.

Its diagnosis primarily depended on real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results. This study investigated epidemiological, clinical and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 with negative RT-PCR results before confirmation. METHODS: COVID-19 patients were enrolled and divided into two groups, negative group with negative RT-PCR results before confirmation and positive group with positive results at the first detection. Epidemiological and clinical features were compared. Dynamic chest CT images of negative group were evaluated. RESULT: Nighty-nine laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 including eight patients (8%) with negative RT-PCR results were included. Patients from negative group had similar epidemiological features as the average age (50.2513.27 y in the negative group and 53.7016.64 y in the positive group) and gender distribution (males made up 50% of the negative group and 62.6% of the positive group) were comparable. No significant difference of clinical symptoms were observed between the two groups. It was found that fever was the most common symptom for both groups, followed by cough, expectoration, chest distress, fatigue and gastroenterological symptoms. Moreover, ground-glass opacities and consolidations were main manifestations in chest CT of COVID-19 patients with or without confirmed RT-PCR results. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of initial RT-PCR results, COVID-19 patients had similar epidemiological, clinical and chest CT features.

L1Oc repeats have a common 3 end that terminates in a poly A addition signal and an A-rich tract, but individual repeats have different 5 ends, indicating a polar truncation from the 5 end during their synthesis or propagation. As a result of the polar truncations, the 5 end of L1Oc is present in about 11,000 copies per haploid genome, whereas the 3 end is present in at least 66,000 copies per haploid genome. One type of L1Oc repeat has internal direct repeats of 78 bp in the 3 untranslated region, whereas other L1Oc repeats have only one copy of this sequence. The longest repeat sequenced, L1Oc5, is 6.5 kb long, and genomic blot-hybridization data using probes from the 5 end of L1Oc5 indicate that a full length L1Oc repeat is about 7.5 kb long, extending about 1 kb 5 to the sequenced region. The L1Oc5 sequence has long open reading frames (ORFs) that correspond to ORF-1 and ORF-2 described in the mouse L1 sequence. In contrast to the overlapping reading frames seen for mouse L1, ORF-1 and ORF-2 are in the same reading frame in rabbit and human L1s, resulting in a discistronic structure. The region between the likely stop codon for ORF-1 and the proposed start codon for ORF-2 is not conserved in interspecies comparisons, which is further evidence that this short region does not encode part of a protein. ORF-1 appears to be a hybrid of sequences, of which the 3 half is unique to and conserved in mammalian L1 repeats.

METHODS ARF patients were identified from a total of 78 (33 men and 45 women) probable SARS cases admitted to a single hospital. The clinical features of patients with ARF were characterized, and the etiologies analyzed. RESULTS Patients were assigned to ARF (n = 13; 17%) and non-ARF groups (n = 65). Patients with ARF were older than their non-ARF counterparts. ARF developed 7.2 +/- 4.3 days after admission. The incidence of ARF was higher in males (77% vs 35%; p < 0.05). Comorbidities of diabetes and heart failure were more common in patients who developed ARF (38% vs 6%, p < 0.01 and 38% vs 2%, p < 0.001, respectively) and the incidence of respiratory failure (85% vs 26%, p < 0.001) and mortality (77% vs 8%, p < 0.001) were also higher. Multiple organ system failure usually accompanied ARF. Hypotension (77%) caused by nosocomial infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, or SARS per se, and rhabdomyolysis (43%) was associated with ARF in addition to pre-renal factors. Five patients in the ARF group and 1 female patient with end-stage renal failure underwent renal replacement therapy during hospitalization; however, both eventually died. Of the 16 medical staff performing renal replacement therapy, none was subsequently infected with SARS coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS Development of ARF during the disease course in SARS patients is associated with catastrophic outcome.

The secondary aim is the evaluation of the impact of IVUS assistance in the procedural outcomes and long-term patency rates of carotid artery stenting. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty patients who underwent carotid artery stenting (CAS) during a 14-month period were evaluated prospectively. Thirty patients (50%) underwent IVUS assisted CAS, 30 patients (50%) underwent CAS using angiography as the unique diagnostic tool. All patients were enrolled through a primary duplex ultrasound evaluation; as a secondary evaluation, 54 patients (90%) underwent a preprocedural magnetic resonance angiography, whereas six patients (10%) underwent computed tomography-angiography. Patients with preocclusive stenoses (>85%) were excluded. Mean follow-up was 23 W 5.3 months. RESULTS No periprocedural or late complications were observed. No statistical significance was observed in long-term stent patency between the two groups. Mean procedural time length of IVUS-assisted procedures was 10.3 W 5 min longer than non-IVUS-assisted procedures. Virtual histology (VH) IVUS evaluation of plaque morphology led to a different stent choice in three patients.

Since therapeutic interventions aiming to improve BVP symptoms are emerging, the need for a new standardized assessment tool that encompasses the specific aspects of BVP arises. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a multi-item Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) that captures the clinically important symptoms of BVP and assesses its impact on daily life. METHODS: The development of the Bilateral Vestibulopathy Questionnaire (BVQ) consisted of two phases: (I) initial item generation and (II) face and content validity testing. Items were derived from a literature review and individual semi-structured interviews focusing on the full spectrum of reported BVP symptoms (I). Subsequently (IIa), individual patient interviews were conducted using thinking aloud and concurrent verbal probing techniques to assess the comprehensibility of the instructions, questions and response options, and the relevance, missing domains, or missing items. Interviews continued until saturation of input was reached. Finally, international experts with experience in the field of the physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms of BVP participated in an online focus group to assess the relevance and comprehensiveness of the BVQ (IIb). RESULTS: The BVQ consisted of two sections. The first section included 50 items scored on a six-point Likert scale arranged into seven constructs (i.e., imbalance, oscillopsia, other physical symptoms, cognitive symptoms, emotional symptoms, limitations and behavioral changes and social life). The second section consisted of four items, scored on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100, to inquire about limitations in daily life, perceived health and expectations regarding future recovery. Interviews with BVP patients [n = 8, 50% female, mean age 56 years (range 24C88 years)] and the expert meeting confirmed face and content validity of the developed BVQ. CONCLUSION: The BVQ, which was developed to assess the spectrum of BVP symptoms and its impact on daily life, proved to have good face and content validity. It can be used to characterize current self-reported symptoms and disability and to evaluate symptom burden before and after therapeutic interventions in future research and clinical practice.","output":"Development and Content Validity of the Bilateral Vestibulopathy Questionnaire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is responsible for generating a global effort to discover urgent therapeutic solutions to limit the human damage caused by COVID-19.

They were treated with antiviral therapy according to local guidelines: D group (53 cases), treated with darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r); and K group (52 cases), treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). Patients from the K group required 7.5 days of hospitalization less compared to those from the D group (P<0.001). The blood oxygen saturation values recorded in the groups were statistically different [K group (94.023.12%) vs. D group (92.134.24%), P=0.010].

Here, we characterized a recombinant form of the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) nsp8 and found that the protein has metal ion-dependent RNA 3-terminal adenylyltransferase (TATase) activity, while other nucleotides were not (or very inefficiently) transferred to the 3 ends of single-stranded and (fully) double-stranded acceptor RNAs. Using partially double-stranded RNAs, very efficient TATase activity was observed if the opposite (template) strand contained a short 5 oligo(U) sequence, while very little (if any) activity was detected for substrates with other homopolymeric or heteropolymeric sequences in the 5 overhang. The oligo(U)-assisted/templated TATase activity on partial-duplex RNAs was confirmed for two other coronavirus nsp8 proteins, suggesting that the activity is conserved among coronaviruses. Replacement of a conserved Lys residue with Ala abolished the in vitro RNA-binding and TATase activities of nsp8 and caused a nonviable phenotype when the corresponding mutation was introduced into the HCoV-229E genome, confirming that these activities are mediated by nsp8 and critical for viral replication. In additional experiments, we obtained evidence that nsp8 has a pronounced specificity for adenylate and is unable to incorporate guanylate into RNA products, which strongly argues against the previously proposed template-dependent RNA polymerase activity of this protein. Given the presence of an oligo(U) stretch at the 5 end of coronavirus minus-strand RNAs, it is tempting to speculate (but remains to be confirmed) that the nsp8-mediated TATase activity is involved in the 3 polyadenylation of viral plus-strand RNAs. IMPORTANCE Previously, coronavirus nsp8 proteins were suggested to have template-dependent RNA polymerase activities resembling those of RNA primases or even canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, while more recent studies have suggested an essential cofactor function of nsp8 (plus nsp7) for nsp12-mediated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. In an effort to reconcile conflicting data from earlier studies, the study revisits coronavirus nsp8-associated activities using additional controls and proteins. The data obtained for three coronavirus nsp8 proteins provide evidence that the proteins share metal ion-dependent RNA 3 polyadenylation activities that are greatly stimulated by a short oligo(U) stretch in the template strand. In contrast, nsp8 was found to be unable to select and incorporate appropriate (matching) nucleotides to produce cRNA products from heteropolymeric and other homooligomeric templates. While confirming the critical role of nsp8 in coronavirus replication, the study amends the list of activities mediated by coronavirus nsp8 proteins in the absence of other proteins.","output":"Identification and Characterization of a Human Coronavirus 229E Nonstructural Protein 8-Associated RNA 3-Terminal Adenylyltransferase Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zebrafish has been a reliable model system for studying human viral pathologies.

At human relevant doses of 12 and 58 g/kg, Coronil inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, induced humanized zebrafish mortality, and rescued from behavioral fever. Morphological and cellular abnormalities along with granulocyte and macrophage accumulation in the swim bladder were restored to normal.

Multiplex immunoblot (IB) assays termed COVID-19 IB assays were developed for detecting IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Recombinant nucleocapsid protein and the S1, S2 and receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used as target antigens in the COVID-19 IBs. Specificity of the IB assay was established with 231 sera from persons with allergy, unrelated viral infections, autoimmune conditions and suspected tick-borne diseases, and 32 goat antisera to human influenza proteins. IgG and IgM COVID-19 IBs assays were performed on 84 sera obtained at different times after a positive RT-qPCR test from 37 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. RESULTS: Criteria for determining overall IgG and IgM antibody positivity using the four SARS-CoV-2 proteins were developed by optimizing specificity and sensitivity in the COVID-19 IgG and IgM IB assays. The estimated sensitivities and specificities of the COVID-19 IgG and IgM IBs for IgG and IgM antibodies individually or for either IgG or IgM antibodies meet the US recommendations for laboratory serological diagnostic tests. The proportion of IgM-positive sera from the COVID-19 patients following an RT-qPCR positive test was maximal at 83% before 10 days and decreased to 0% after 100 days, while the proportions of IgG-positive sera tended to plateau between days 11 and 65 at 78-100% and fall to 44% after 100 days. Detection of either IgG or IgM antibodies was better than IgG or IgM alone for assessing seroconversion in COVID-19. Both IgG and IgM antibodies detected RBD less frequently than S1, S2 and N proteins.

To this end we developed a deterministic transmission model based on the renewal equation and fitted the model to daily case and death data in the first few months of 2020 in 79 countries and states, representing 4.2 billions individuals. Based on a region-specific infection fatality ratio, we inferred the time-varying probability of case detection and the time-varying decline in transmissiblity. As a validation, the predicted total number of infected was close to that found in serosurveys; more importantly, the inferred probability of detection strongly correlated with the number of daily tests per inhabitant, with 50 % detection achieved with 0.003 daily tests per inhabitants. Most of the decline in transmission was explained by the reductions in transmissibility (social distancing), which avoided 10 millions deaths in the regions studied over the first four months of 2020. In contrast, symptom-based testing and isolation of positive cases was not an efficient way to control the spread of the disease, as a large part of transmission happens before symptoms and only a small fraction of infected individuals was typically detected. The latter is explained by the limited number of tests available, and the fact that increasing test capacity often increases the probability of detection less than proportionally. Together these results suggest that little control can be achieved by symptom-based testing and isolation alone.","output":"Estimating the global reduction in transmission and rise in detection capacity of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 caused large outbreaks of COVID-19 worldwide.

Despite recent advances in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying asthma exacerbations, current therapeutic modalities are inadequate for complete prevention and treatment of these episodes. The pathological role of cellular senescence, especially that involving the silent information regulator 2 homolog sirtuin (SIRT) protein family, has recently been demonstrated in stable and exacerbated chronic respiratory disease states.

It also discusses the role of SIRT1 in inflammatory cells that play an important role in virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Recent studies have hypothesized that SIRT1 is one of major contributors to cellular senescence. SIRT1 levels decrease in Th2 and non-Th2-related airway inflammation, indicating the role of SIRT1 in several endotypes and phenotypes of asthma. Moreover, several models have demonstrated relationships between viral infection and SIRT1.

The primary endpoint included evaluating therapy response and disease control rate (DCR) using the RECIST 1.1 criteria. Additional secondary endpoints comprised clinical response assessment using EORTC QLQ-H&N35 questionnaire, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG), analgesic score (AS), dose alterations of anti-hypertensive drugs (anti-HTN), and the safety and side-effect profile evaluation as per CTCAE criteria version 5.0. RESULTS: Following (225)Ac-DOTATATE treatment, morphological response revealed partial response in 50%, stable disease in 37.5%, and disease progression in 12.5%, with a DCR of 87.5%. Similarly, the symptomatic response was remarkable, and anti-HTN drugs were stopped in 25% and reduced in 37.5%. Another significant finding in our study revealed a morphologic DCR of 66.6% (2/3) in patients who failed previous lutetium-177 peptide receptor radionuclide therapy ((177)Lu-PRRT). Regarding the KPS, ECOG, and AS performance scores, a notable improvement was observed post-(225)Ac-DOTATATE treatment. The QLQ-H&N35 symptom scores evaluated in seven H&N PGL patients showed significant improvement in all aspects. No improvement in sexual function was noted (P = 0.3559).

The arterial blood pressure (ABP) was gradually reduced until it dropped to below the LLA. Several autoregulation indices were calculated using correlation and wavelet methods, including the pressure reactivity index (PRx and wPRx), cerebral oximetry index (COx and wCOx), and hemoglobin volume index (HVx and wHVx). Wavelet methodology had less index variability with smaller standard deviations. Both wavelet and correlation methods distinguished functional autoregulation (ABP above LLA) from dysfunctional autoregulation (ABP below the LLA). Both wavelet and correlation methods also identified ABPopt with high agreement. Thus, wavelet methodology using NIRS may offer an accurate vasoreactivity monitoring method with reduced signal noise after pediatric cardiac arrest.","output":"Comparison of wavelet and correlation indices of cerebral autoregulation in a pediatric swine model of cardiac arrest."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To study the experiences and views within the health science community regarding the spread and prevention of science misinformation within and beyond the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An exploratory study with an empirical ethics approach using qualitative interviews with Australians who produce, communicate and study health science research. RESULTS: Key elements that participants considered might facilitate misinformation included: the production of low-quality, fraudulent or biased science research; inadequate public access to high-quality research; insufficient public reading of high-quality research. Strategies to reduce or prevent misinformation could come from within the academic community, academic and lay media publishing systems, government funders and educators of the general public. Recommended solutions from within the scientific community included: rewarding research translation, encouraging standardised study design, increasing use of automated quality assessment tools, mandating study protocol registration, transparent peer review, facilitating wider use of open access and use of newer technologies to target public audiences. There was disagreement over whether preprints were part of the problem or part of the solution. CONCLUSIONS: There is concern from within the health science community about systemic failings that might facilitate the production and spread of false or misleading science information. We advocate for further research into ways to minimise the production and spread of misinformation about COVID-19 and other science crises in the future.","output":"Misinformation: an empirical study with scientists and communicators during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccination in Brazil required a phased program, with priorities for age groups, health workers, and vulnerable people. Social distancing and isolation interventions have been essential to mitigate the advance of the pandemic in several countries. We developed a mathematical model capable of capturing the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 dissemination aligned with social distancing, isolation measures, and vaccination. Surveillance data from the city of Rio de Janeiro provided a case study to analyze possible scenarios, including non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination in the epidemic scenario. Our results demonstrate that the combination of vaccination and policies of transmission suppression potentially lowered the number of hospitalized cases by 380+ and 66+ thousand cases, respectively, compared to an absence of such policies. On top of transmission suppression-only policies, vaccination impacted more than 230+ thousand averted hospitalized cases and 43+ thousand averted deaths. Therefore, health surveillance activities should be maintained along with vaccination planning in scheduled groups until a large vaccinated coverage is reached. Furthermore, this analytical framework enables evaluation of such scenarios.","output":"Modelling policy combinations of vaccination and transmission suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 worldwide pandemic, patients with heart failure are a high-risk group with potential higher mortality if infected. Although lockdown represents a solution to prevent viral spreading, it endangers regular follow-up visits and precludes direct medical assessment in order to detect heart failure progression and optimize treatment. Furthermore, lifestyle changes during quarantine may trigger heart failure decompensations. During the pandemic, a paradoxical reduction of heart failure hospitalization rates was observed, supposedly caused by patient reluctance to visit emergency departments and hospitals. This may result in an increased patient mortality and/or in more complicated heart failure admissions in the future. In this scenario, different telemedicine strategies can be implemented to ensure continuity of care to patients with heart failure. Patients at home can be monitored through dedicated apps, telephone calls, or devices. Virtual visits and forward triage screen the patients with signs or symptoms of decompensated heart failure. In-hospital care may benefit from remote communication platforms. After discharge, patients may undergo remote follow-up or telerehabilitation to prevent early readmissions. This review provides a comprehensive appraisal of the many possible applications of telemedicine for patients with heart failure during Coronavirus disease 2019 and elucidates practical limitations and challenges regarding specific telemedicine modalities.","output":"Telemedicine in Heart Failure During COVID-19: A Step Into the Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: While exercise was found to affect cognitive performance in adolescents, the underlying mechanisms need to be considered. This study compared the effect of a 20 min game-based exercise with different intensities on hormonal responses and potential links to cognitive performance. METHODS: 37 adolescents (24 girls and 13 boys; 15-16 years of age) were randomly assigned into light intensity (LIG; 58.64% HRmax), vigorous intensity (VIG; 89.51% HRmax), and control group (CON). The concentration of salivary Testosterone and Cortisol was measured before, immediately after, 20 min and 60 min after the intervention. RESULTS: Repeated-measure ANOVA revealed that neither light nor vigorous game-based exercise acutely affects Testosterone, while Cortisol was higher in the VIG, 20 min after the intervention compared to the LIG and CON. Furthermore, changes in Testosterone were negatively associated with changes in cognitive performance after the acute vigorous intensity exercise (r = -0.63, p = .039) and control condition (r = -0.78, p = .003), but positively associated with post-intervention cognitive performance after the acute light intensity exercise (r = 0.67, p = .012). CONCLUSION: The intensity of game-based exercise affected Cortisol concentration in adolescents, while Testosterone concentration did not change after the intervention.

Yet since 1977, representatives spent roughly one of every eight days with members of only their political party. Some members have spent more than a month's worth of time in a single congress traveling and never doing so with a member from the other party. This paper examines the causes and consequences of the members who are willing to travel overseas so long as it is not with a member of the other party. We find that liberal Democrat are more likely than moderate Democrat to travel with their copartisans, and moderate Democrat are more likely than liberals to travel abroad in cross-party delegations. For Republicans, the former relationship holds, though we uncover no relationship for the latter.

The study included forty healthy volunteers (50% were men). All volunteers were examined using two ultrasound systems, the Philips Epiq 7 and the General Electric Vivid 6. Left ventricular diastolic (DIVPG) and systolic (SIVPG) intraventricular pressure gradients were measured from the spatiotemporal distribution of intraventricular propagation flow velocities using color Doppler M-mode in standard apical views. There was good feasibility for both systolic and diastolic IVPG measurements (82.5% and 85%, respectively). Intra and inter-observer test-retest variability measured with the intraclass correlation coefficient were 0.98 and 0.93 for DIVPG respectively, and 0.95 and 0.89 for SIVPG respectively. The inter-system concordance was weak to moderate with Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.59 for DIVPG and 0.25 for SIVPG. In conclusion, it is feasible and reproducible to assess systolic and diastolic IVPG using color Doppler M-mode in healthy volunteers.

Results: We identified 371 articles, 9 articles 11 studies with a total number of 1334 cases were eligible for inclusion of this meta-analysis. The results showed that OS (DPS) in low-expression group was higher than that in high-expression group. However, the difference between the two groups was not significant (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = [0.88, 1.91]; P = 0.18), and there was great statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 66%, P = 0.002). After subgroup analysis, the HR for OS of the patients with reduced expression of SOX2 was 1.34 (95% CI = [1.04, 1.74], P = 0.03), and the heterogeneity became acceptable (I2 = 32%, P = 0.16). The HR for DFS of the patients with reduced expression of SOX2 was 1.39 (95% CI = [1.00, 1.93]; P = 0.05). Conclusion: The findings of this meta-analysis are indicative of that high SOX2 expression is a negative prognostic factor of HNSCC and exhibit both worse OS and DFS.

Favipiravir (FVP) triphosphate, a purine nucleoside analog, inhibits that enzyme. We have conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis on efficacy and safety of the drug FVP as a treatment for COVID-19. METHODS: Databases like Pubmed, Pubmed Central, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, preprint sites, and clinicaltirals.gov were searched. The studies with the standard of care (SOC) and FVP as a treatment drug were considered as the treatment group and the SOC with other antivirals and supportive care as the control group. Quantitative synthesis was done using RevMan 5.4. Clinical improvement, negative conversion of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), adverse effects, and oxygen requirements were studied. RESULTS: We identified a total of 1798 studies after searching the electronic databases. Nine in the qualitative studies and four studies in the quantitative synthesis met the criteria. There was a significant clinical improvement in the FVP group on the 14th day compared to the control group (RR 1.29, 1.08C1.54). Clinical deterioration rates were less likely in the FVP group though statistically not significant (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.30C1.14) at the endpoint of study (7C15 days). The meta-analysis showed no significant differences between the two groups on viral clearance (day 14: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84C1.33), non-invasive ventilation or oxygen requirement (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.42C1.39), and adverse effects (OR 0.69, 0.13C3.57). There are 31 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) registered in different parts of the world focusing FVP for COVID-19 treatment.

There is no effective remedy with mortality high at 30C40%. Most functional proteins are dynamic and stringently governed by ubiquitin proteasomal degradation. Protein ubiquitination is reversible, the covalently attached monoubiquitin or polyubiquitin moieties within the targeted protein can be removed by a group of enzymes called deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Deubiquitination plays an important role in the pathobiology of ALI/ARDS as it regulates proteins critical in engagement of the alveolo-capillary barrier and in the inflammatory response.

OBJECTIVES To report the clinical efficacy and safety of MARS therapy for intractable pruritus in cholestasis patients with stable chronic liver disease, characterizing the impact of MARS on cytokine levels and on the transcriptome in the blood compartment. METHODS MARS therapy was performed on three patients with cholestatic liver disease using 8 h runs for two consecutive days. The expression levels of 65 cytokines?chemokines and 24,000 genes were profiled by Luminex (Luminex Corporation, USA) and microarray, respectively. RESULTS A quality-of-life assessment demonstrated a marked improvement during therapy, which was sustained in two of three patients. No bleeding or infectious complications were observed. Bile acid levels were markedly reduced following MARS (mean [ SD] pretreatment 478.9112.2 mol?L versus post-treatment 89.768.8 mol?L). Concordant decreases in cytokine?chemokine levels were noted for interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 (p40), RANTES, tranforming growth factor-alpha, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and thrombopoietin following MARS. On microarray profiling, biologically relevant concordant changes among all patients were evident for 20 different genes (10 upregulated and 10 downregulated). The upregulation of several potentially immune suppressive?regulatory genes (eg, early growth response 3 [EGR-3], ephrin-A2 [EFNA2] and serum amyloid A1 [SAA1]), concurrent with downregulation of genes involved in innate immunity (eg, toll-like receptor 4 interactor with leucine-rich repeats [TRIL]) and inflammation (eg, ephrin receptor B1 [EPHB1]), was observed. CONCLUSIONS This investigative approach offers new insights into intractable pruritus and suggests future therapeutic targets. The clinical benefit of MARS in cholestasis patients with intractable pruritus may not exclusively result from filtration of pruritogens, but also from systemic changes in cytokine?chemokine levels and changes in gene expression of blood cells.","output":"Blood cytokine, chemokine and gene expression in cholestasis patients with intractable pruritis treated with a molecular adsorbent recirculating system: a case series."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study requirements for safe communication in systems of reactive components in which components communicate via synchronised execution of common actions.

In this short paper, we reconsider the concept of safe communication in terms of reception and responsiveness requirements, originally defined for synchronisation policies determined by a synchronisation type. Illustrated by a motivating example, we propose three extensions. First, compliance, i.e. satisfaction of communication requirements, does not have to be immediate.

Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant strains, both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes.

These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to emerging viral variants, confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose, and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to their infection-na?ve counterparts.","output":"mRNA vaccine-induced T cells respond identically to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern but differ in longevity and homing properties depending on prior infection status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Such testing and trying time probably never seen before in the human history.

There were increases in unintentional exposures and exposures to hand and surface sanitizers among household and cleaning products. There was a decrease in calls concerning medications, which were mostly from hospitals and emergency departments. We observed increases in exposures requiring clinical observations among adults and referral to the emergency department among pre-school children. CONCLUSIONS: Public health protection measures against COVID-19 to improve hygiene and maintain clean environments can increase exposures to hazardous products in the domestic environment. We observed an increase in unintentional exposures to household and cleaning products during the lockdown and an increase in ED referrals for pre-school children compared to the previous year.

Our objective is to realize a civic tech matchmaking system to assist such communities in finding better partners with IT experience in their issues. In this study, as the first step toward collaboration, we acquire relevant social issues and information technologies by association rule mining. To meet our challenge, we supply a questionnaire to members of civic tech communities and obtain answers on their faced issues and their available technologies. Subsequently, we match the relevant issues and technologies from the answers. However, most of the issues and technologies in this questionnaire data are infrequent, and there is a significant bias in their occurrence. Here, it is difficult to extract truly relevant issues--technologies combinations with existing interestingness measures. Therefore, we introduce a new measure called weighted casual confidence, and show that our measure is effective for mining relevant issues--technologies pairs.","output":"Matching Social Issues to Technologies for Civic Tech by Association Rule Mining using Weighted Casual Confidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus is induced by staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB).

Six weeks following oral dosing of recombinant spores, significant differences were not found in the serum biochemical indices between the mSEB group and the na?ve and CotC groups. Furthermore, oral administration of mSEB spores increased the survival rate by 33.3% in mice intraperitoneally injected with 5 g of wild-type SEB plus 25 g lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In summation, recombinant spores stably expressing mSEB were developed, and oral administration of such recombinant spores induced a humoral immune response and provided protection against SEB challenge in mice.","output":"Oral administration of recombinant Bacillus subtilis spores expressing mutant staphylococcal enterotoxin B provides potent protection against lethal enterotoxin challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown instigated serious mental health conditions. So far, the UAE data on mental health problems due to this pandemic outbreak is still scarce. The objective of this study was to identify the prevalent psychological difficulties experienced by university students, faculty members, and staff during COVID-19 lockdown and the coping strategies used. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to collect data from 737 participants using an online electronic survey. Participants included students, faculty members, and staff from universities in the UAE. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to measure general distress, Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ-16) was used to measure worry, and the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS-48) was administered to measure coping strategies used by participants during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Data were collected during May to June 2020. Results: The results indicated that 60.4% of students, 57.4% of the faculty members, and 52.3% of the staff experienced mild psychiatric problems. About 32.9% of students, 33.7% of the faculty members, and 25% of the staff experienced high levels of worry during the COVID-19 lockdown. Changes in eating patterns, worsening chronic health problems, change in sleep patterns, and concentration difficulties were reported. Furthermore, significant differences were observed in worry and coping strategies among participants. Women use more avoidance and emotion-focused coping compared to men.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the risk factors of symptoms onset and clinical features in asymptomatic COVID-19 infected patients. Methods: A retrospective study was performed in 70 asymptomatic COVID-2019 infected patients confirmed by nucleic acid tests in Hunan province, China between 28 January 2020 and 18 February, 2020. The epidemiological, clinical features and laboratory data were reviewed and analyzed. Presence or absence at the onset of symptoms was taken as the outcome. A Cox regression model was performed to evaluate the potential predictors of the onset of symptoms. Results: The study included 36 males and 34 females with a mean age of 33.2420.40 years (range, 0.5-84 years). There were 22 asymptomatic carriers developed symptoms during hospitalization isolated observation, and diagnosed as confirmed cases, while 48 cases remained asymptomatic throughout the course of disease. Of 70 asymptomatic patients, 14 (14/70, 20%) had underlying diseases, 3 (3/70, 4.3%) had drinking history, and 11 (11/70, 15.7%) had smoking history. 22 patients developed symptoms onset of fever (4/22, 18.2%), cough (13/22, 59.1%), chest discomfort (2/22, 9.1%), fatigue (1/22, 4.5%), pharyngalgia (1/22, 4.5%) during hospitalization; only one (1/22, 4.5%) patient developed signs of both cough and pharyngalgia. Abnormalities on chest CT were detected among 35 of the 69 patients (50.7%) after admission, except for one pregnant woman had not been examined. 4 (4/70, 5.7%) and 8 (8/70, 11.4%) cases showed leucopenia and lymphopenia. With the effective antiviral treatment, all the 70 asymptomatic infections had been discharged, none cases developed severe pneumonia, admission to intensive care unit, or died. The mean time from nucleic acid positive to negative was 13.26.84 days. Cox regression analysis showed that smoking history (P=0.028, hazard ratio=4.49, 95% CI 1.18-17.08) and existence of pulmonary disease (P=0.038, hazard ratio=7.09, 95% CI 1.12-44.90) were risk factors of the onset of symptoms in asymptomatic carries. Conclusion: The initially asymptomatic patients can develop mild symptoms and have a good prognosis.

Online databases, including MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and government and non-government websites, and websites of migrant workers-supporting organizations were searched for peer reviewed and non-peer reviewed papers and reports published between 1966-2020 regarding food security of TFWs. Articles reviewed were analyzed to determine publication type, country, year, target population, and main findings. Content analysis was performed to identify major themes. Of 291 sources identified, 11 met inclusion criteria. Most article (n=10) were based on studies conducted in the U.S. The prevalence of food insecurity among TFWs ranged between 28% and 87%. From the content analysis, we formulated 9 themes, representing a diversity of perspectives, including access to resources, income, housing and related facilities, food access, dietary pattern and healthy food choices, and migrant's legal status. Instruments reported for the measurement of food security include USDA Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) (8, 72.7%), modified version of the USDA HFSSM (1, 9%), hunger measure (1, 9%), modified CDC's NHANES (1, 9%), and 24-hourr recall, diet history and/or food frequency questionnaire (3, 27.3%).

Despite the rapid progression of the disease, there is limited information of the factors associated with mortality in Florida. This study aims to review the demographics, characteristics, comorbidities, complications, and outcomes of hospitalized patients, and their association with mortality. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: A community-based tertiary-care hospital of Orlando Health, Orlando Regional Medical Center. PATIENTS/SUBJECTS: Data of hospitalized patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020, at the Orlando Regional Medical Center. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Main data assessed included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, complications, outcomes, and inhospital mortality. The median age for hospitalized patients was 61 years; among them, 56% were males. Most were of African American (n = 288, 35.9%), Hispanic (n = 237, 29.6%), and Caucasian (n = 217, 27.1%) descent. More patients presented with symptoms developing at home (n = 589, 75.9%) than from skilled nursing and long-term acute care facilities. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (42.8%), obesity (39.2%), lung disease (23.3%), coronary artery disease (20.2%), and congestive heart failure (18.3%). Complications with higher odds of mortality were mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 148.00, p < 0.001), coinfections (odds ratio, 56.42, p < 0.001), acute kidney injury (odds ratio, 84.01, p < 0.001), atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 28.30, p < 0.001), acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 23.29, p < 0.001), and acute venous thromboembolism (odds ratio, 26.43, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We identified an increase of severity of coronavirus disease 2019 within older patients of African American and Hispanic descent with comorbidities such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cancer, liver disease, or cerebrovascular disease. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen may have helped avert mechanical ventilation, and this may have improved patient outcomes over the course of the study period.","output":"Characteristics, Comorbidities, Complications, and Outcomes Among 802 Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in a Community Hospital in Florida"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused huge deaths and economic losses worldwide in the current pandemic. The main protease (M(pro)) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is thought to be an ideal drug target for treating COVID-19. Leupeptin, a broad-spectrum covalent inhibitor of serine, cysteine, and threonine proteases, showed inhibitory activity against M(pro), with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) value of 127.2 M in vitro in our study here. In addition, leupeptin can also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells, with 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) values of 42.34 M. More importantly, various strains of streptomyces that have a broad symbiotic relationship with medicinal plants can produce leupeptin and leupeptin analogs to regulate autogenous proteases. Fingerprinting and structure elucidation using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), respectively, further proved that the Qing-Fei-Pai-Du (QFPD) decoction, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula for the effective treatment of COVID-19 during the period of the Wuhan outbreak, contains leupeptin. All these results indicate that leupeptin at least contributes to the antiviral activity of the QFPD decoction against SARS-CoV-2. This also reminds us to pay attention to the microbiomes in TCM herbs as streptomyces in the soil might produce leupeptin that will later infiltrate the medicinal plant.

We observed that the two DREP constructs were immunogenic in mice inducing both binding and neutralizing antibodies as well as T cell responses. Interestingly, the DREP coding for the unmodified spike turned out to be more potent vaccine candidate, eliciting high titers of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies that were able to efficiently neutralize pseudotyped virus after a single immunization. In addition, both DREP constructs were able to efficiently prime responses that could be boosted with a heterologous spike protein immunization.

Case confirmation is based on identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in clinical samples. However, these tests have suboptimal sensitivity, especially during the early and late course of infection. Using open data, we estimated that among 1 343 730 people tested in Mexico since February 27th, there were 838 377 (95% CL 734 605 - 1 057 164) cases, compared with 604 376 considering only positive tests. ICU admissions and deaths were around 16% and 9% higher than reported. Thus, we show that accounting for the sensitivity of SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR diagnostic tests is a simple way to improve estimations for the true number of COVID-19 cases in tested people, particularly in high-prevalence populations.

Results: : Gastrointestinal and psychological disorder (45.5%) were observed in COVID-19 patients during post-infection recovery, improvement of which were observed after FMT. Most of the lab results including blood routine and blood biochemistry, within the normal range. The general distribution of 69 different types of lymphocytes differed between before and after FMT. FMT exert significant effect on B cells which was characterized as decreased naive B cell ( P =0.012) and increased memory B cells ( P = 0.001) and non-switched B cells ( P = 0.012).The microbial community richness indicated by OTUs number, observed species and Chao1 estimators was marginally increased after FMT, whereas the community diversity estimated by the Shannon and Simpson index showed no significant changes after FMT. Gut microbiome composition of discharged COVID-19 patients differed from that of the general population at both phylum and genera level, which was characterized with a lower proportion of Firmicutes (41.0%) and Actinobacteria (4.0%), higher proportion of Bacteroidetes (42.9%) and Proteobacteriato (9.2%). FMT can partially restore the gutdysbiosis by increasing the relative abundance of Actinobacteria (15.0%) and reducing Proteobacteriato (2.8%) at the phylum level. At the genera level, Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium , which were dominant genera in the human gut microbiota and were beneficial for human health, had significantly increased after FMT.

Involvement of AYAs in treatment decisions might support adherence to medical treatment. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore the involvement of AYAs, aged 15 to 20 years, in cancer treatment decision making (TDM). METHODS Using interpretive focused ethnography, we conducted interviews with 16 AYAs (total of 31 interviews) receiving cancer treatment within 1 year of diagnosis. Participants reflected on a major recent TDM experience (eg, clinical trial, surgery) and other treatment decisions. RESULTS Participants distinguished important major cancer treatment decisions from minor supportive care decisions. We identified 3 common dimensions related to AYAs' involvement in cancer TDM: (1) becoming experienced with cancer, (2) import of the decision, and (3) decision-making roles. The preferences of AYAs for participation in TDM varied over time and by type of decision. We have proposed a 3-dimensional model to illustrate how these dimensions might interact to portray TDM during the first year of cancer treatment for AYAs. CONCLUSIONS As AYAs accumulate experience in making decisions, their TDM preferences might evolve at different rates depending on whether the decisions are perceived to be minor or major. Parents played a particularly important supportive role in TDM for AYA participants. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Clinicians should consider the AYAs' preferences and the role they want to assume in making different decisions in order to support and encourage involvement in their TDM and care.","output":"3 Dimensions of Treatment Decision Making in Adolescents and Young Adults With Cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The approach of peptide-based anti-cancer vaccination has proven the ability to induce cancer-specific immune responses in multiple studies for various cancer entities.

SEARCH METHODS PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus, and Web-of-Science databases were searched with no restrictions on publication status or year. SELECTION CRITERIA Prospective and retrospective human studies about BAMP, in at least three patients, were included. Authors were contacted when necessary, and reference lists of the included studies were screened. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors undertook independent data extraction with conflict resolution by a third author. Risks of bias were assessed. A meta-analysis for estimates of changes for ANB angle, Wits appraisal, and incisor to mandibular plane angle (IMPA) angle of BAMP treatment compared to control groups was performed. RESULTS A total of 449 articles were initially retrieved; 28 full-text articles met the inclusion criteria. Sample sizes ranged from 3 to 52 patients. There was heterogeneity in cephalometric outcomes reported, which prevented the comparison of certain outcomes. ANB angle improved more with BAMP in the maxilla combined with facemask (bone-anchored facemask, BAFM) compared to traditional facemask therapy: this was statistically but not clinically significant (0.2 degrees). No data are available for BAMP with skeletal anchorage in both jaws in combination with Class III elastics (bone-anchored Class III elastics, BAC3E). Likewise, no statistically significant differences in Wits appraisal were found (less than 1 mm). Lower incisor retroclination and facial height seemed to be better controlled with BAC3E compared to BAFM. CONCLUSIONS The level of evidence available to support the maxillary advancement effect after BAMP was low. Publications reporting results based on identical samples tended to suggest overly positive results of BAMP. The differences in sagittal correction between BAMP and traditional facemask therapy were small and of questionable clinical significance. Long-term follow-up results are not available and, therefore, much needed. LIMITATIONS Most articles had a low level of evidence and some included a historical control group.

The JCR analyzed 6088 journals in 2005, a 32% increase in new listings since 1995. During the same period, there was a 39% increase in new journal listings in the infectious diseases category. The phenomenon of journal proliferation has had a profound effect on the journal impact factor. During the past decade an increased impact factor was observed in 92% of the top ranking major journals, especially in young and rapidly expanding research fields. Certain highly cited new journals published primarily review articles - not original contributions. There was no increase in impact factor among some of the best known journals, such as Journal of Experimental Medicine, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA), and Journal of Infectious Diseases. Clearly, journal impact factor is an imperfect tool for measuring the quality of articles, and its use in evaluating authors has inherent risks.

Since people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) are usually at higher risk of psychological distress than age-matched healthy controls (HC), a meta-analytic study was conducted, aimed at evaluating i) differences between pwMS and HC in the psychological variables during the pandemic, ii) differences in the levels of anxiety, depression, stress, sleep disturbances and quality of life before and during the Covid-19 pandemic in pwMS. METHODS: : The literature search on three electronic databases yielded 196 studies (113 after the duplicates removal). Seven studies compared psychological variables between pwMS and HC during the pandemic, while seven studies evaluated the pre- vs during the pandemic differences in pwMS. The following outcomes were selected: depression, anxiety, physical QoL, mental QoL, stress, sleep quality/disturbances. Mean weighted effect sizes (ES) were calculated using Hedges'g, via Prometa3 software. RESULTS: : During the pandemic, pwMS showed higher levels of depression (g=0.51, p=0.001), anxiety (g=0.41, p=0.032), and stress (g=0.51, p=0.016) compared to HC. The comparison on psychological outcomes before and during the pandemic in pwMS revealed no significant increase during the pandemic on levels of anxiety (g=0.08, p=0.380), depression (g=0.02, p=0.772), mental QoL (g= -0.14, p=0.060), physical QoL (g=0.00, p=0.986), whereas sleep quality deteriorated during the pandemic (g=0.52, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: : In agreement with pre-pandemic literature, pwMS showed higher levels of psychological distress than HC also during the Covid-19 pandemic. Contrariwise, longitudinal studies revealed that, in pwMS, the only psychological-associated variable that worsened significantly was the sleep quality, but this outcome was evaluated only in two studies. Future studies will have to assess/evaluate the long-term psychological consequences of the pandemic on pwMS.","output":"The psychological impact of Covid-19 pandemic on people with Multiple Sclerosis: a meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data regarding the safety and efficacy of COVID-10 vaccines among cancer patients are lacking.

The applicability of the proposed model is illustrated using the case study of Mexico, including the states of the country as stakeholders. We involve several parameters to guide the allocation, such as the size, risk profiles, and fraction of vulnerable groups in the population. Furthermore, different scenarios of the availability of potential COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated. The social welfare approach is the most commonly used scheme for the allocation of resources. However, we demonstrate that this scheme yields non-unique or multiple solutions (through the social welfare II approach). These social welfare approaches provide inequalities in the allocations that become critical when resources are scarce. Specifically, the social welfare scheme favors large stakeholders (greater population) in all scenarios.

This study aims to describe changes in the proportion of older adults with and without dementia dying in nursing homes, home, hospital and other locations over an 11-year period covering the reform. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This is a repeated cross-sectional, population-level study using mortality data from the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry hosted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Participants were Norwegian older adults 65 years or older with and without dementia who died from 2006 to 2017. The policy intervention was the 2012 Coordination Reform that increased care infrastructure into communities. The primary outcome was location of death listed as a nursing home, home, hospital or other location. The trend in the proportion of location of death, before and after the reform was estimated using an interrupted time-series analysis. All analyses were adjusted for sex and seasonality. Of the 417,862 older adult decedents, 61,940 (14.8%) had dementia identified on their death certificate. Nursing home deaths increased over time while hospital deaths decreased for the total population (adjusted Relative Risk Ratio (aRRR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.82C0.92) and persons with dementia (aRRR: 0.93, 95%CI 0.91C0.96) after reform implementation.

This study aimed to gain insights into the processes that influence behaviour change, contributing to improved caring, feeding and food production practices, using a program theory perspective. It also investigated perceived challenges to the sustainability of interventions and potential solutions, in the context of an NSA program in rural Vietnam. Using a participatory approach, data were gathered on impact pathways and perceived outcomes, on elements of program theory that led to behavioural change, as well as barriers and facilitators. Respondents in semi-structured interviews (n = 30) and seven focus group discussions (total n = 76) were selected purposively among program participants. Data was collected and triangulated across several stakeholder groups. RESULTS: The impact pathways (production-consumption, caring and feeding, and home-grown school feeding) envisaged in the NSA program functioned as intended; synergies were revealed. The increased supply of locally produced nutrient-rich foods not only contributed to the emergence of a promising income sub-pathway but also reinforced synergy with the home-grown school feeding pathway. Improved diets, feeding and caring practices, and school attendance were key outcomes of the program. Successful elements were pathway-specific, such as flexibility in implementing context-appropriate agricultural models. Others, such as benefit-driven motivation and improved knowledge, triggered changes in multiple pathways. Role models, increased self-confidence, and change agents were the main process facilitators. The biggest barrier to both implementation and sustainability was the poor socio-economic conditions of the most disadvantaged households. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the relevance of NSA programs in addressing undernutrition in remote areas by enhancing self-reliance in local communities. The integration of behaviour change activities proved to be a key strategy in the process to enhance the impact of agriculture on nutrition outcomes. Though outcomes and influencing factors are very context-dependent, lessons on what worked and what did not work could inform the design and implementation of effective behaviour change strategies in future NSA programs in Vietnam and elsewhere.","output":"Qualitative evidence for improved caring, feeding and food production practices after nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions in rural Vietnam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single sample pathway analysis (ssPA) transforms molecular level omics data to the pathway level, enabling the discovery of patient-specific pathway signatures. Compared to conventional pathway analysis, ssPA overcomes the limitations by enabling multi-group comparisons, alongside facilitating numerous downstream analyses such as pathway-based machine learning. While in transcriptomics ssPA is a widely used technique, there is little literature evaluating its suitability for metabolomics. Here we provide a thorough benchmark of established ssPA methods (ssGSEA, GSVA, SVD (PLAGE), and z-score) using semi-synthetic metabolomics data, alongside the evaluation of two novel methods we propose: ssClustPA and kPCA. While GSEA-based and z-score methods outperformed the others in terms of recall, clustering/dimensionality reduction-based methods provided higher precision at moderate-to-high effect sizes. A case study applying ssPA to inflammatory bowel disease demonstrates how these methods yield a much richer depth of interpretation than conventional approaches, for example by clustering pathway scores to visualise a pathway-based patient subtype-specific correlation network. We also developed the sspa python package (freely available at https://pypi.org/project/sspa/), providing implementations of all the methods benchmarked in this study. This work underscores the value ssPA methods can add to metabolomic studies and provides a useful reference for those wishing to apply ssPA methods to metabolomics data. Author summary Pathway analysis is a computational method used to draw insights from omics data by identifying groups of molecules (biological pathways) which are important in a study. Single-sample pathway analysis is based on the same principles as conventional pathway analysis but allows researchers to compute the enrichment of pathways at an individual-sample level. This enables pathway-based patient stratification and facilitates a multitude of downstream analyses based on pathways, such as machine learning, or pathway-based visualization which would not be possible using conventional approaches. In this work we investigated the application of single-sample pathway analysis to metabolomics data, a field in which it has not been widely used to date. We first evaluated the most popular methods for single-sample pathway analysis using simulated metabolomics data, as well as two novel methods we developed. Following these tests, we used metabolomics data from inflammatory bowel disease patients to demonstrate how single-sample pathway analysis methods can be used to infer novel pathway-based insights with the advantage of discriminating between disease subtypes. Overall, our analysis provides readers with information on the performance of single-sample pathway analysis methods, whilst highlighting the potential of such methods in metabolomics research.","output":"Single sample pathway analysis in metabolomics: performance evaluation and application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection leads to 5% to 16% hospitalization in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and is associated with 23% to 75% of kidney impairments, including acute kidney injury (AKI), as a major prognosis factor. The current work aims to characterize the renal impairment associated to SARS-CoV-2 in ICU patients, to evaluate its risk factors and its relationship with morbidity and mortality. Methods: Forty-two patients consecutively admitted to the ICU of a university hospital (Paris, France) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 25, 2020 and April 29, 2020 were included and classified in categories according to their renal function. Complete renal profiles and their evolution during ICU stay were fully characterized in 34 patients. Factors associated with AKI were identified through univariate analysis. Results: Thirty-two patients (94,1%) met diagnostic criteria for intrinsic renal injury with a mixed pattern of tubular and glomerular injuries within the first week of ICU admission, that lasted upon discharge. During their ICU stay, 24 patients (57.1%) presented AKI which was associated with increased mortality (p = 0.007), hemodynamic failure (p = 0.022), and more altered clearance at hospital discharge (p = 0.001). AKI occurrence was associated with lower pH (p = 0.024), higher PaCO2 (p = 0.027), PEEP (p = 0.027), procalcitonin (p = 0.015), and CRP (p = 0.045) on ICU admission. Conclusions: Critical SARS-CoV-2 is associated with persistent intrinsic renal injury and AKI, which is a risk factor of mortality.

Through practical experience and anticipated difficulties, we have discussed considerations that paediatric urology departments should ponder when integrating remote clinics into their practice as we move forward from the pandemic.","output":"Remote consultations in paediatric urology-Not just for pandemics?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is sweeping across the globe, there is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines as the most powerful strategy to end the pandemic. This study aimed to examine how factors related to vaccine characteristics, their social normative influence and convenience of vaccination can affect the public's preference for the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in China. METHODS: An online discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey was administered to a sample of China's general population. Participants were asked to make a series of hypothetical choices and estimate their preference for different attributes of the vaccine. A mixed logit regression model was used to analyse the DCE data. Willingness to pay for each attribute was also calculated. RESULTS: Data of 1236 participants who provided valid responses were included in the analysis. There was strong public preference for high effectiveness of the vaccine, followed by long protective duration, very few adverse events and being manufactured overseas. Price was the least important attribute affecting the public preference in selecting the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The strong public preferences detected in this study should be considered when developing COVID-19 vaccination programme in China. The results provide useful information for policymakers to identify the individual and social values for a good vaccination strategy. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The design of the experimental choices was fully based on interviews and focus group discussions participated by 26 Chinese people with diverse socio-economic backgrounds. Without their participation, the study would not be possible.","output":"Public preference for COVID-19 vaccines in China: A discrete choice experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) comprise numerous underwater wireless sensor nodes dispersed in the marine environment, which find applicability in several areas like data collection, navigation, resource investigation, surveillance, and disaster prediction. Because of the usage of restricted battery capacity and the difficulty in replacing or charging the inbuilt batteries, energy efficiency becomes a challenging issue in the design of UWSN. Earlier studies reported that clustering and routing are considered effective ways of attaining energy efficacy in the UWSN. Clustering and routing processes can be treated as nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard optimization problems, and they can be addressed by the use of metaheuristics. This study introduces an improved metaheuristics-based clustering with multihop routing protocol for underwater wireless sensor networks, named the IMCMR-UWSN technique. The major aim of the IMCMR-UWSN technique is to choose cluster heads (CHs) and optimal routes to a destination. The IMCMR-UWSN technique incorporates two major processes, namely the chaotic krill head algorithm (CKHA)-based clustering and self-adaptive glow worm swarm optimization algorithm (SA-GSO)-based multihop routing. The CKHA technique selects CHs and organizes clusters based on different parameters such as residual energy, intra-cluster distance, and inter-cluster distance. Similarly, the SA-GSO algorithm derives a fitness function involving four parameters, namely residual energy, delay, distance, and trust. Utilization of the IMCMR-UWSN technique helps to significantly boost the energy efficiency and lifetime of the UWSN. To ensure the improved performance of the IMCMR-UWSN technique, a series of simulations were carried out, and the comparative results reported the supremacy of the IMCMR-UWSN technique in terms of different measures.","output":"Improved Metaheuristics-Based Clustering with Multihop Routing Protocol for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food insecurity, a well-established determinant of chronic disease morbidity and mortality, is rapidly increasing due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We present a conceptual model to understand the multiple mechanisms through which the economic and public health crises sparked by COVID-19 might increase food insecurity and contribute to poor health outcomes in the short- and long-term. We hypothesize that, in the short-term, increased food insecurity, household economic disruption, household stress, and interruptions in healthcare will contribute to acute chronic disease complications. However, the impact of the pandemic on food security will linger after social-distancing policies are lifted and the health system stabilizes, resulting in increased risk for chronic disease development, morbidity, and mortality among food-insecure households in the long-term. Research is needed to examine the impact of the pandemic-related increase in food insecurity on short- and long-term chronic health outcomes, and to delineate the underlying causal mechanisms. Such research is critical to inform the development of effective programs and policies to address food insecurity and its downstream health impacts during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","output":"A conceptual model for understanding the rapid COVID-19Crelated increase in food insecurity and its impact on health and healthcare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-Cov-2 infection, a pandemic disease since March 2020, is associated with a high percentage of cardiovascular complications mainly of a thromboembolic (TE) nature. Although clinical patterns have been described for the assessment of patients with increased risk, many TE complications occur in patients with apparently moderate risk. Notably, a recent statement from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) atherosclerosis and vascular biology working group pointed out the key role of vascular endothelium for the recruitment of inflammatory and thrombotic pathways responsible for both disseminated intravascular coagulation and cardiovascular complications. Therefore, a better understanding of the pathophysiological process linking infection to increased TE risk is needed in order to understand the pathways of this dangerous liaison and possibly interrupt it with appropriate treatment. In this review, we describe the histological lesions and the related blood coagulation mechanisms involved in COVID-19, we define the laboratory parameters and clinical risk factors associated with TE events, and propose a prophylactic anticoagulation treatment in relation to the risk category. Finally, we highlight the concept that a solid risk assessment based on prospective multi-center data would be the challenge for a more precise risk stratification and more appropriate treatment.","output":"Thromboembolic Complications in Covid-19: From Clinical Scenario to Laboratory Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected more socioeconomically disadvantaged persons and areas. We sought to determine how certain sociodemographic factors were correlated to adolescents COVID-19 vaccination rates in towns and cities (communities) in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. METHODS: Data on COVID-19 vaccination rates were obtained over a 20-week period from March 30, 2021 to August 10, 2021. Communities adolescent (ages 12-19) vaccination rates were compared across quintiles of community-level income, COVID-19 case rate, and proportion of non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic individuals. Other variables included population density and earlier COVID-19 vaccination rates of adolescents and adults, averaged from March 30 to May 11 to determine their effects on vaccination rates on August 10. Linear and logistic regression was used to estimate individual effects of variables on adolescent vaccination rates. RESULTS: Higher median household income, lower proportion of Black or Hispanic individuals, higher early adolescent COVID-19 vaccination rates, and higher early adult COVID-19 vaccination rates were associated with higher later adolescent COVID-19 vaccination rates. Income per $10,000 (adjusted odds ratio=1.01 [95% confidence interval=1.01-1.02]), proportion of Hispanic individuals (1.33 [1.13-1.56]), early adolescent COVID-19 vaccination rates (5.28 [4.67-5.96]), and early adult COVID-19 vaccination rates (2.31 [2.02-2.64]) were associated with higher adolescent COVID-19 vaccination on August 10, while proportion of Black individuals approached significance (1.26 [0.98-1.61]). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination efforts for adolescents in Massachusetts should focus on boosting vaccination rates early in communities with the lowest incomes and greatest proportion of Hispanic individuals and consider targeting communities with a greater proportion of Black individuals.","output":"Inequities in COVID-19 vaccination rates among adolescents in Massachusetts: a cross-sectional study"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(D,[["render",P]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"consultation/32.md","filePath":"consultation/32.md"}'),R={name:"consultation/32.md"},z=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
