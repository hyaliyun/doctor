Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a destructive clinical syndrome of respiratory diseases. However, the potential mechanism of LncRNAs on ARDS remains largely unknown. Methods: To identify the profiles of LncRNAs and mRNAs in the LPS-induced ARDS mouse model, the microarray analyses were hired to detect the expression of LncRNAs and mRNAs in present study. Subsequently, microarray data were verified by quantitative qRT-PCR. Functional annotation on DE mRNAs and LncRNAs were carried out by bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, the role of selected DE LncRNAs on correlated genes was confirmed by si-RNA and Western blot. Results: The expression of 2110 LncRNAs and 2690 mRNAs were significantly changed, which were further confirmed by qRT-PCR. GO and KEGG analysis indicated that the up-regulated mRNAs were mainly related to a defense response and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, respectively. LncRNA-mRNA co-expression analyses showed that LncRNAs NR_003508, ENSMUST00000131638, ENSMUST00000119467, and ENSMUST00000124853 may correlate to MLKL, RIPK3, RIPK1, Caspase1, and NLRP3, respectively, or cooperatively, which were highly involved in the cell necroptosis process. Furthermore, siRNA for NR_003508 confirmed the co-expression analyses results. Conclusion: To summarize, this study implied that the DE LncRNAs could be potent regulators and target genes of ARDS and will provide a novel insight into the regulation of the pathogenesis of ARDS.","output":"Microarray Profiling and Co-Expression Network Analysis of LncRNAs and mRNAs in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Mouse Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recently, hoarseness affecting the supraglottic structure has been reported in Kawasaki Disease.

This issue has obvious important implications for critical applications, such as those in healthcare. Recent approaches are just proposing variations of the activation function within the same unresolved dying ReLU challenge. This contribution reports a different research direction by investigating the development of an innovative quantum approach to the ReLU AF that avoids the dying ReLU problem by disruptive design. The Leaky ReLU was leveraged as a baseline on which the two quantum principles of entanglement and superposition were applied to derive the proposed Quantum ReLU (QReLU) and the modified-QReLU (m-QReLU) activation functions. Both QReLU and m-QReLU are implemented and made freely available in TensorFlow and Keras. This original approach is effective and validated extensively in case studies that facilitate the detection of COVID-19 and Parkinson Disease (PD) from medical images. The two novel AFs were evaluated in a two-layered CNN against nine ReLU-based AFs on seven benchmark datasets, including images of spiral drawings taken via graphic tablets from patients with Parkinson Disease and healthy subjects, and point-of-care ultrasound images on the lungs of patients with COVID-19, those with pneumonia and healthy controls. Despite a higher computational cost, results indicated an overall higher classification accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score brought about by either quantum AFs on five of the seven bench-mark datasets, thus demonstrating its potential to be the new benchmark or gold standard AF in CNNs and aid image classification tasks involved in critical applications, such as medical diagnoses of COVID-19 and PD.","output":"QReLU and m-QReLU: Two novel quantum activation functions to aid medical diagnostics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During recent decades West Nile Virus (WNV) outbreaks have continuously occurred in the Mediterranean area.

As a consequence, the potentials of short-term and low-altitude CTSs remain unknown. Objectives: The purpose of this study is twofold. Firstly, it aims to ascertain whether LOS and MASL are related to the percentage change of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the percentage change of FEV1 Compound Daily Improvement Rate (FEV1 CDIR % Change). Secondly, it aims to provide an evidence-based positioning of CTSs by considering the same specific variables. Methods/Analysis: The study focuses on young people (age ?18) who have asthma problems. The Resource-Based Theory, postulating the valuability of natural resources generating above-average benefits, has been adopted as a conceptual lens. Primary studies carried out in eastern and western European countries and separately reviewed have been considered jointly. Spearmans rank correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between LOS and MASL of CTSs with FEV1Change (%) and FEV1Change CDIR (%) as indicators of health improvements. The descriptive statistics were implemented in calculating standardized and aggregated values. Findings: Negative and significant relationships have been highlighted between FEV1 Change (%) and MASL and between FEV1 Change CDIR % and LOS. In other words, subjects can achieve significant health improvements even by experiencing very short climate therapy stays at very low altitude mountain centres. Considering the FEV1Change (%) and the FEV1 Change CDIR (%) of climate stays by duration and elevation, the evidence-based knowledge platform has been established as a possible framework for developing an evidence-based marketing strategy for new health tourism products. Novelty/Improvement: Notwithstanding the need for further research, the metrics facilitating interdisciplinary, human health and economic studies have been devised. Further research on the effects of low altitude climate therapy stays could help define the healing potentials of macro and microclimatic conditions as potentially valuable health devices for those suffering from respiratory diseases living in the COVID-19 era. Quantifying these effects through further studies, an evidence-based approach to formulating marketing strategies may be devised, useful both for supporting public health provision and policies, and for facilitating practitioners in health tourism interested in offering nature-based activities for their clients. ? 2022 by the authors.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most common cause of IM, followed by cytomegalovirus (CMV). Given that serological testing is associated with limitations regarding its accuracy, availability, and time to receive results, clinical differentiation based on symptoms, signs, and basic tests would be useful. We evaluated whether clinical findings could be used to differentiate EBV-IM from CMV-IM. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective case-control study, we evaluated >14-year-old patients with serologically confirmed EBV-IM or CMV-IM during 2006C2017. We compared the patients symptoms, physical findings, blood counts, and serum biomarkers to create three regression models: model 1 (symptoms and signs), model 2 (model 1 plus sonographic hepatosplenomegaly and blood counts), and model 3 (model 2 plus hepatobiliary biomarkers). RESULTS: Among the 122 patients (72.6%) with EBV-IM and 46 patients (27.4%) with CMV-IM, the median age was 25 years and 82 patients (48.8%) were male. The median age was 10 years older in the CMV-IM group (p < 0.001) and the median interval from onset to visit was 5 days longer in the CMV-IM group (p < 0.001). Logistic regression revealed that EBV-IM was predicted by younger age, short onset-to-visit interval, lymphadenopathy, tonsillar white coat, hepatosplenomegaly, atypical lymphocytosis, and elevations of lactate dehydrogenase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. All regression models had areas under the curve of >0.9.

The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of Covid-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the Error Function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, i.e., to the change in sign of its second derivative (that is the change from acceleration to deceleration) as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations in the attempt to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above-mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease of the number of daily positive cases. Although, official data have been used, these predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach, since those predictions are based on statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as medical, social distancing, virologic, epidemiological, etc.) or models of contamination diffusion.","output":"Prediction of the time evolution of the Covid-19 Pandemic in Italy by a Gauss Error Function and Monte Carlo simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anti-Asian racism and violence dramatically increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We herein reported a polypropylene (PP) bag-based method for convenient detection of nucleic acids in the oil-sealed space.

With highly specific CRISPR technology, Salmonella typhimurium (St) and SARS-CoV-2 can be visually detected in these PP bags within 1 h, indicating its potential household application. To further improve the reliability of nucleic acid testing at home, a logic decision method is introduced by detecting both target and endogenous reference gene.

Introduction Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is currently the main diagnosis in intensive care units (ICU) and is related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This syndrome increases hospital stay and costs, and has high mortality. Chest radiography is essential in these patients for diagnosis and clinical follow-up, as it is inexpensive and routinely used in the ICU. The RALE score (Radiographic assessment of lung edema) allows the estimation of the extension and density of alveolar opacities in chest radiography and has been associated with different clinical outcomes such as oxygenation, mortality at 28 days, ventilator-free days, hospital stay, and severity of ARDS. The objective of this work is to establish the association of RALE with clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS in our institution. Materials and methods Ambispective, monocentric cohort study. Adults older than 18 years with a diagnosis of ARDS hospitalized in the ICUs of Hospital Santa Clara, Bogot, Colombia, from January to December 2020, were included. Results The study included 100 patients, 93% with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, an association with RALE on the first day was found with oxygenation on the first day of admission, but without finding a statistically significant relationship between RALE and the other outcomes. Conclusion The RALE score was not associated with relevant clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS. This can be explained by the different mechanisms of hypoxaemia in these patients.

Fetal brain creatine and choline were quantified using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Infant neurodevelopment at 18 months was measured using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III and Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment. The parenting stress in the parent-child dyad was measured using the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form at 18-month testing. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 97 mother-infant dyads (mean [SD] maternal age, 34.79 [5.64] years) who underwent 184 fetal MRI visits (87 participants with 2 fetal studies each) with maternal psychological distress measures between 24 and 40 gestational weeks and completed follow-up infant neurodevelopmental testing. Prenatal maternal stress was negatively associated with infant cognitive performance ( = ?0.51; 95% CI, ?0.92 to ?0.09; P = .01), and this association was mediated by fetal left hippocampal volume. In addition, prenatal maternal anxiety, stress, and depression were positively associated with all parenting stress measures at 18-month testing. Finally, fetal cortical local gyrification index and sulcal depth were negatively associated with infant social-emotional performance (local gyrification index:  = ?54.62; 95% CI, ?85.05 to ?24.19; P < .001; sulcal depth:  = ?14.22; 95% CI, ?23.59 to ?4.85; P = .002) and competence scores (local gyrification index:  = ?24.01; 95% CI, ?40.34 to ?7.69; P = .003; sulcal depth:  = ?7.53; 95% CI, ?11.73 to ?3.32; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of 97 mother-infant dyads, fetal cortical local gyrification index and sulcal depth were associated with infant 18-month social-emotional and competence outcomes, and fetal left hippocampal volume mediated the association between prenatal maternal stress and infant cognitive outcome. These findings suggest that altered prenatal brain development in the setting of elevated maternal distress has adverse infant sociocognitive outcomes, and identifying early biomarkers associated with long-term neurodevelopment may assist in early targeted interventions.","output":"Association of Elevated Maternal Psychological Distress, Altered Fetal Brain, and Offspring Cognitive and Social-Emotional Outcomes at 18 Months"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders causing pain, fatigue, and disabilities; it has several implications for patients who suffer from this disease. The major clinical manifestations of EDS include joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and generalized conjunctive tissue fragility. This research aims to explore their perceptions and experiences about the phycological and social spheres. (2) Methods: Semistructured interviews were carried out. Participants were encouraged to talk about issues related to their disease by asking open-ended questions in one to one interview. The interview guide included questions to identify the syndrome's influence on the social and psychological life of patients All interviews were audio recorded, fully transcribed, and analyzed using the phenomenological theoretical framework. The method of analysis was the thematic interpreting of perspectives and approaches. (3) Results: 31 individuals were proposed to participate in this study. Five patients refused to participate, so a total of 26 interviews were performed. Six themes ((1) Pain and its consequences on a daily basis; (2) The need to name the problem: the diagnosis; (3) Restructuring leisure and social relationships; (4) Limitations due to economic conditions; (5) Psychological impact of the disease situation; (6) Professional limitations) and four subthemes ((1) The value of partner support; (2) The weather influence on social plans; (3) Physical exercise and illness; (4) Support groups) emerged from the data.

In Peru, following confirmation of the first case in early March, the measures adopted by the government aimed to mitigate mass transmission and the impact on vulnerable populations through the imposition of an early quarantine, border closings, restriction of domestic and international travel, social distancing, a relief allowance for poor and extremely poor Peruvians, early withdrawal of deposits from private pensions, and closing of schools and universities in order to avoid the collapse of health systems, already weakened. Factors in the country's insufficient response to COVID-19 include lack of infrastructure and deficient logistics in the health systems at the national level, centralization of the response plan in hospitals in the capital Lima, low initial budgeting to deal with disease, which includes insufficient medical supplies, limited commitment by the population to comply with the containment measures imposed by the government, and precarious job security and high labor informality. The results are the consequences of decades of low investment in health, education, and labor. TB patients are at high risk of succumbing to the novel coronavirus due to their vulnerability from chronic lung damage, associated comorbidities, including HIV infection and diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and poverty. A preliminary observational study in China had already identified pulmonary TB as a risk factor for severe COVID-19, corroborating previous findings with other viral pneumonias: influenza, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1. In addition, case series of coinfection have already been reported that involve a diagnosis of TB following infection with the novel coronavirus. Meanwhile, COVID-19 survivors may run a high risk of acquiring TB, and infection with the novel coronavirus itself can increase the risk of progression of latent TB infection to the active disease. The hypothetical mechanism lies in immunodepression. A challenge for Peru's national public health system is to mitigate the pandemic's effects without failing to care for preexisting diseases. It is thus essential to anticipate the potentially destructive synergy between COVID-19, TB, and poverty.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection and pulmonary tuberculosis: an analysis of the situation in Peru"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brazil is the third country most affected by Covid-19 pandemic. In spite of this, viral evolution in municipality resolution is poorly understood in Brazil and it is crucial to understand the epidemiology of viral spread. We identified four main circulating lineages in Esteio (Southern Brazil) and their relationship with global, national and regional lineages using phylogenetics and phylodynamics inferences from 21 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We provided a comprehensive view of viral mutations from a time- and age-representative sampling from May to October 2020, in Esteio (RS, Brazil), highlighting two frequent mutations in Spike glycoprotein (D614G and V1176F), an emergent mutation (E484K) in Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) characteristic of the South African lineage B.1.351, and the adjacent replacement of 2 amino acids in Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (R203K and G204R). A significant viral diversity was evidenced with the identification of 80 different SNPs. The E484K replacement was found in two genomes (9.5%) from samples obtained in mid-October, which is to our best knowledge the earliest description of E484K harboring SARS-CoV-2 in South Brazil. This mutation identified in a small municipality from the RS state demonstrates that it was probably widely distributed in the Brazilian territory, but went unnoticed so far by the lack of genomic surveillance in Brazil. The introduction of E484K mutants shows temporal correlation with later increases in new cases in our state. Importantly, since it has been associated with immune evasion and enhanced interaction with hACE-2, lineages containing this substitution must be the subject of intense surveillance. Our date demonstrates multiple introductions of the most prevalent lineages (B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.248) and the major role of community transmission in viral spreading and the establishment of Brazilian lineages.

In addition, using a differential equation model taking into account the effects of lockdown and vaccination, we sought to study the effectiveness of one or both doses of vaccines in preventing new cases of COVID-19 in UK and Israel. These countries, where a large portion of the population is already vaccinated, have different vaccination strategies, 3 vs. 12 weeks delay between first and second dose.Findings: The first vaccine dose averted infection in 71% of participants, while the booster dose cumulatively prevented COVID-19 in 87% of participants. The pooled treatment effects in two age subgroups (<65 or 65 years) were not significantly different. No significant difference on efficacy between white and black or ethnic minorities was observed. Mortality was reduced by 56% after active treatment versus placebo. The pooled Risk-Ratio of experiencing a serious event after vaccination was 6%.Population data modelling show a dramatic reduction of the number of daily new cases in UK starting at 16 days after the first dose administration. Notably, the number of dose-1 daily administrations explains the observed reduction of daily new cases in UK and is able to predict new observations with high certainty. In Israel, the effects of the first dose of vaccine in reducing the incidence of COVID-19 was virtually immediate. Interpretation: Our RCT meta-analysis and population-based analysis show that the first dose of COVID-19 vaccines averts infection in almost 3/4 of subjects and suggest that postponing the second dose by at least 12 weeks is a suitable strategy that allows vaccinating more people, substantially increasing the benefits of vaccines.Funding Statement: There was no external funding source for this study.Declaration of Interests: All authors declare no competing interests: no support from any organisation for the submitted work;no financial relationships with any organisations that might have an interest in the submitted work;no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.","output":"Living Systematic Meta-Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccines and Dose Allocation Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ageing is associated with excessive free brain iron, which may induce oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, likely causing cognitive deficits.

Approximation of iron content was assessed using quantitative susceptibility mapping in striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Iron accumulated in both striatum and DLPFC during the follow-up period. Greater iron accumulation in DLPFC was associated with more deleterious change in working memory. Older (age 50-79) Val homozygotes (with presumably lower endogenous dopamine) accumulated more iron than older Met carriers in both striatum and DLPFC, no such differences were observed among younger adults (age 20-49). In conclusion, individual differences in genetic predisposition related to low dopamine levels increase iron accumulation, which in turn may trigger deleterious change in working memory.

We sought to develop and apply consensus definitions, incorporating clinical criteria to better understand the rate of co-infections and antibiotic use in COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 1016 adult patients admitted to 5 hospitals in the Johns Hopkins Health System between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, with COVID-19 were evaluated. Adjudication of co-infection using definitions developed by a multidisciplinary team for this study was performed. Both respiratory and common nonrespiratory co-infections were assessed. The definition of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (bCAP) included proven (clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria plus microbiologic diagnosis), probable (clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria without microbiologic diagnosis), and possible (not all clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria met) categories. Clinical characteristics and antimicrobial use were assessed in the context of the consensus definitions. RESULTS: Bacterial respiratory co-infections were infrequent (1.2%); 1 patient had proven bCAP, and 11 (1.1%) had probable bCAP. Two patients (0.2%) had viral respiratory co-infections. Although 69% of patients received antibiotics for pneumonia, the majority were stopped within 48 hours in patients with possible or no evidence of bCAP. The most common nonrespiratory infection was urinary tract infection (present in 3% of the cohort).

METHODS Fifty-four asthmatics were randomized into either the aerobic training group (AG, n = 29) or the breathing exercise group (BG, n = 25). Both interventions lasted for 24 sessions (2/week, 40 minutes/session). Asthma clinical control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]), quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire), asthma symptom-free days (ASFD), airway inflammation, exercise capacity, psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), daily-life physical activity (DLPA), and pulmonary function were evaluated before, immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention.

Post-operative assessment consists of physical measurement of uroflowmetry and post void residual volume, but health systems worldwide have experienced pressures in demand, leading to exploration of greater efficiency in organising clinic protocols. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire measurement has been identified as a tool to predict change in post-operative management. Our institution established a nurse-led follow-up virtual clinic (VC) for patients undergoing BOO surgery based on IPSS measurement. We present the clinical and economic outcomes of this new service. Materials and Methods Patients with a successful post-operative trial without catheter (TWOC) were contacted by telephone via VC, and discharged by a Urology Clinical Nurse Specialist (UCNS) if IPSS was <8. Data was analysed for IPSS; arrangement of subsequent clinic visits; and numbers discharged. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients discharged after VC consultation. Secondary outcomes were overall discharge rate following subsequent face-to-face (FTF) appointment; and the proportion of patients re-referred from Primary Care within three months of discharge from VC. Cost savings were calculated based on tariffs of 135 for first attendance with UCNS; 199 for uroflowmetry; and 47.84 for VC appointment. Results The first 50 patients to be recipients of the new VC were included. Median IPSS and Quality of Life score were 13 (interquartile range 5) and 3 (interquartile range 1) respectively. 39 (78%) patients were discharged from VC; 36 (72%) had IPSS <8. Overall discharge rate following subsequent FTF appointment was 88%. Two patients discharged from VC (5.1%) were subsequently re-referred, neither of whom required additional treatment.

Our laboratory initially used a two-step molecular assay, first reported by Corman et al., for SARS-CoV-2 identification (the T-CDC method). As rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is required to control the spread of this infectious disease, the current study evaluated three commercially available assays, including the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit, the cobas? SARS-CoV-2 test and the Rendu 2019-nCoV Assay kit, to establish diagnostic algorithms for clinical laboratories. METHODS: A total of 790 clinical specimens, including nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, saliva, stool, endotracheal aspirate and serum were obtained from patients who were suspected or already confirmed to have COVID-19 at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital from February to May 2020. These specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the different assays and the performance variance between the assays was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the assays we evaluated, the T-CDC method and the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit require lots of hands-on practical lab work, while the cobas? SARS-CoV-2 test and the Rendu 2019-nCoV Assay kit are fully automated detection systems. The T-CDC method and the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit showed similar detection sensitivity, however, the T-CDC method frequently delivered false positive signals for E and/or RdRP gene detection, thus increasing the risk of reporting false positive results. A manual test-based testing strategy combining the T-CDC method and the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit was developed, which demonstrated excellent concordance rates (>99%) with the cobas and Rendu automatic systems. There were a few cases showing discrepant results, which may be due to the varied detection sensitivities as well as targets among the different platforms. Moreover, the concordance rate between the cobas and Rendu assays was 100%. CONCLUSION: Based on our evaluation, two SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic algorithms, one focusing on the manual assays and the other on the automatic platforms, were proposed.

Inflammatory markers like lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are simple and readily available markers. In this study, we evaluated the utility of these markers in the early identification of patients with complicated AP. Patients and Methods: All patients with a diagnosis of AP admitted to the University Medical Center in Las Vegas/Nevada between August 2015 and September 2018 were identified using ICD-10 codes. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. Epidemiological measures and their associated confidence intervals were calculated using MedCalc (v. 18). Results: The LMR showed a significant difference between groups, with the non-complicated cases consistently higher than the complicated cases but without significant temporal differences. The NLR showed a significant difference with a significant temporal relation. Using the bound of the 95% confidence interval separating the two groups, LMR <2 was found to be associated with a complicated case and NLR >10.5 was suggestive of a complicated case. High specificity (85-92%) with low sensitivity (23-69%) was noted; hence, these cut points were very good at discerning non-complicated cases. Conclusion: Our data show persistently low LMR that is associated with severe AP and a value of <2.0 can be used clinically to predict severe AP on admission. It also shows that elevated NLR is associated with complicated AP and prolonged hospital stay with a value >10.5 that can be used to predict severe complicated AP and to monitor response to treatment over time.","output":"Utility of inflammatory markers to predict adverse outcome in acute pancreatitis: A retrospective study in a single academic center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proceedings contain 83 papers.

Specific information about immunity in non-survivors with COVID-19 is scarce. This study aimed to analyse the clinical characteristics and abnormal immunity of the confirmed COVID-19 non-survivors. METHODS: In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 125 patients with COVID-19 who were died between January 13 and March 4, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. A total of 414 randomly recruited patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were discharged from the same hospital during the same period served as control. The demographic, clinical characteristics and laboratory findings at admission, and treatment used in these patients were collected. The immunity-related risk factors associated with in-hospital death were tested by logistic regression models and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Non-survivors (70 years, IQR: 61.5C80) were significantly older than survivors (54 years, IQR: 37C65) (P < 0.001). 56.8% of non-survivors was male. Nearly half of the patients (44.9%) had chronic medical illness. In non-survivors, hypertension (49.6%) was the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes (20.0%) and coronary heart disease (16.0%). The common signs and symptoms at admission of non-survivors were fever (88%), followed by cough (64.8%), dyspnea (62.4%), fatigue (62.4%) and chest tightness (58.4%). Compared with survivors, non-survivors had higher white blood cell (WBC) count (7.85 vs 5.07  10(9)/L), more elevated neutrophil count (6.41 vs 3.08  10(9)/L), smaller lymphocyte count (0.69 vs 1.20  10(9)/L) and lower platelet count (172 vs 211  10(9)/L), raised concentrations of procalcitonin (0.21 vs 0.06 ng/mL) and CRP (70.5 vs 7.2 mg/L) (P < 0.001). This was accompanied with significantly decreased levels of CD3(+) T cells (277 vs 814 cells/l), CD4(+) T cells (172 vs 473 cells/l), CD8(+) T cells (84 vs 262.5 cells/l, P < 0.001), CD19(+) T cells (88 vs 141 cells/l) and CD16(+) 56(+) T cells (79 vs 128.5 cells/l) (P < 0.001). The concentrations of immunoglobulins (Ig) G (13.30 vs 11.95 g/L), IgA (2.54 vs 2.21 g/L), and IgE (71.30 vs 42.25 IU/ml) were increased, whereas the levels of complement proteins (C)3 (0.89 vs 0.99 g/L) and C4 (0.22 vs 0.24 g/L) were decreased in non-survivors when compared with survivors (all P < 0.05). The non-survivors presented lower levels of oximetry saturation (90 vs 97%) at rest and lactate (2.40 vs 1.90 mmol/L) (P < 0.001). Old age, comorbidity of malignant tumor, neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, low CD4(+) T cells, decreased C3, and low oximetry saturation were the risk factors of death in patients with confirmed COVID-19. The frequency of CD4(+) T cells positively correlated with the numbers of lymphocytes (r = 0.787) and the level of oximetry saturation (r = 0.295), Whereas CD4(+) T cells were negatively correlated with age (r =-0.323) and the numbers of neutrophils (r = ? 0.244) (all P < 0.001).

RECENT FINDINGS Adenovirus transmission is poorly understood; recent studies increasingly point to reactivation of latent infection in the immunocompromised host. Rhinovirus shedding can persist for weeks after acute viral infection, complicating hospital infection control policies. Hepatitis E is increasingly recognized as a potential pathogen in the stem cell and solid organ transplant population, and should be considered in the work-up for unexplained liver function test abnormalities. Similar to rhinovirus, norovirus shedding from the gastrointestinal tract may persist for months in the immunocompromised host; infected patients are at a higher risk for transmitting norovirus compared with infected healthcare workers.

Disease severity might be reduced under prophylaxis with the prodrug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), while the protection seems to decrease, or even to lack, when using the alternative prodrug tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF). Aiming to understand why TDF-prophylaxis might reduce COVID-19 severity upon infection we developed a multi-scale analysis framework combining in vitro susceptibility data, molecular docking, and within-host dynamics modeling, and using remdesivirCthe only antiviral approved to date against COVID-19C as a point of reference.First, our docking model predicted that intracellularly active tenofovir diphosphate binds into the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase in the same site as the antiviral remdesivir triphosphate, but presents lower binding energy, likely reducing the overall inhibition of viral replication and making the antiviral efficacy more susceptible to the drug intracellular concentration. Second, using data from in vitro viral cultures with plausible TDF therapeutic concentrations, we estimated that the drug can inhibit SARS-COV-2 replication at an efficacy ranging between 54-99% conditional to the viral cycle length. Third, assuming values approximating this range of inhibition for in vivo viral replication during human SARS-COV-2 infection, we found that prophylaxis with TDF with high penetration into viral target cells is capable of delaying viral replication, mitigating direct cell damage and allowing time for the host to mount the adaptive immunity. Last, we found that the potential antiviral effect can be substantially reduced when TDF is given after infection begins. Our work provides a potential mechanistic explanation of the observed clinical effect of TDF against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The proposed inference framework can help to optimize the evaluation of antiviral therapies for COVID-19, in particular those targeting the RNA dependent RNA polymerase.","output":"Evaluating SARS-CoV-2 infection under tenofovir-based antiviral prophylaxis: a multi-scale modeling analysis upon experimental data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bilateral pneumonia is the most common clinical manifestation of a new variant of coronavirus infection At the same time, COVID-19 has a wide range of cardiovascular complications including acute heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome and myocarditis Myocardial damage is relatively common in COVID-19 (7-23%) We report a 56-year-old patient with a confirmed coronavirus infection The peculiarity of this clinical case is systemic manifestations of COVID-19 (lesion of lung, heart, kidneys and skin) Despite the presence of viral pneumonia, the patients clinical status was determined by myocardial damage A feature of this case was also the presence of skin damage ? 2021, Media Sphera Publishing Group All rights reserved","output":"The new coronavirus infection followed by damage to the heart, lungs, skin and kidneys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"God gave life for a living, but due to our unrealistic expectations of achieving name, fame, pleasure, royalty, money and living according to a system which we ourself created for our convenience and today, we ourself got abided by it.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19-induced disruption of school feeding services on household food security in Nigeria. METHODS: We combined household-level, pre-COVID-19 in-person survey data with postpandemic phone survey data, along with local government area (LGA)Clevel information on access to school feeding services. We used a difference-in-difference approach and examined temporal trends in the food security of households with and without access to school feeding services. Of the sampled households, 83% live in LGAs with school feeding services. RESULTS: Households experienced an increase in food insecurity in the post-COVID-19 survey round. The share of households skipping a meal increased by 47 percentage points (95% CI: 44C50 percentage points). COVID-19-induced disruptions of school feeding services increased households' experiences of food insecurity, increasing the probability of skipping a meal by 9 percentage points (95% CI: 3C17 percentage points) and the likelihood of going without eating for a whole day by 3 percentage points (95% CI: 2C11 percentage points).

Due to lack of comparable incidence data and challenges with disentangling differences in susceptibility from different exposure risks, data are insufficient to determine whether pregnancy increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data support pregnancy as a risk factor for severe disease associated with COVID-19; some of the best evidence comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDCs) COVID-19 surveillance system, which reported that pregnant persons were more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), require invasive ventilation, require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and die compared with nonpregnant women of reproductive age. Although intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been documented, it appears to be rare, possibly related to low levels of SARS-CoV-2 viremia and decreased co-expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) needed for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells in the placenta.

Data does not support the change or withdrawal of any asthma or CF maintenance medications; however, does advocate for the cessation of aerosolized medications whenever possible to minimize transmission risk. It may not be necessary to adjust immunosuppressive therapy when managing COVID-19 in pediatric lung transplant patients. Mechanisms of infection in airway epithelial cells in children may differ from adults, resulting in a milder phenotype. SUMMARY: Current data about pediatric patients with chronic lung disease infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is promising but remains scarce. Additional study is needed to definitively understand the complex interplay of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the airway of children with chronic lung disease, how it differs from adults, and how best to manage the symptoms of acute infection.","output":"Management of chronic pulmonary disease in the time of coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected some communities and populations more than others. We propose that an interdisciplinary framework of One Health Disparities advances understanding of the social and systemic issues that drive COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. One Health Disparities integrates the social environment with One Health perspectives on the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. To apply this framework, we consider One Health Disparities that emerge in three key components of disease transmission: exposure, susceptibility, and disease expression. Exposure disparities arise through variation in contact with COVID-19s causative agent, SARS-CoV-2. Disparities in susceptibility and disease expression also exist; these are driven by biological and social factors, such as diabetes and obesity, and through variation in access to healthcare. We close by considering how One Health Disparities informs understanding of spillback into new animal reservoirs, and what this might mean for further human health disparities. Lay Summary One Health focuses on interconnections between human, animal, and environmental health. We propose that social environments are also important to One Health and help illuminate disparities in the coronavirus pandemic, including its origins, transmission and susceptibility among humans, and spillback to other species.

The goal was to inform whether additional guidance and QA tools were needed. METHODS: A survey focussed on clinical use, metrics used, how centres would like to use DIR in the future and challenges faced, was designed and sent to 71 radiotherapy centres in the UK. Data were gathered specifically on which centres we using DIR clinically, which applications were being used, what commissioning and QA tests were performed, and what barriers were preventing the integration of DIR into the clinical workflow. Centres that did not use DIR clinically were encouraged to fill in the survey and were asked if they have any future plans and in what timescale. RESULTS: 51 out of 71 (70%) radiotherapy centres responded. 47 centres reported access to a commercial software that could perform DIR. 20 centres already used DIR clinically, and 22 centres had plans to implement an application of DIR within 3 years of the survey. The most common clinical application of DIR was to propagate contours from one scan to another (19 centres). In each of the applications, the types of commissioning and QA tests performed varied depending on the type of application and between centres. Some of the key barriers were determining when a DIR was satisfactory including which metrics to use, and lack of resources. CONCLUSION: The survey results highlighted that there is a need for additional guidelines, training, better tools for commissioning DIR software and for the QA of registration results, which should include developing or recommending which quantitative metrics to use. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This survey has given a useful picture of the clinical use and lack of use of DIR in UK radiotherapy centres. The survey provided useful insight into how centres commission and QA DIR applications, especially the variability among centres. It was also possible to highlight key barriers to implementation and determine factors that may help overcome this which include the need for additional guidance specific to different applications, better tools and metrics.","output":"Clinical use, challenges, and barriers to implementation of deformable image registration in radiotherapy C the need for guidance and QA tools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In epidemic models, the effective reproduction number is of central importance to assess the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease and to orient health intervention strategies. Publicly shared data during an outbreak often suffers from two sources of misreporting (underreporting and delay in reporting) that should not be overlooked when estimating epidemiological parameters. The main statistical challenge in models that intrinsically account for a misreporting process lies in the joint estimation of the time-varying reproduction number and the delay/underreporting parameters. Existing Bayesian approaches typically rely on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that are extremely costly from a computational perspective. We propose a much faster alternative based on Laplacian-P-splines (LPS) that combines Bayesian penalized B-splines for flexible and smooth estimation of the time-varying reproduction number and Laplace approximations to selected posterior distributions for fast computation. Assuming a known generation interval distribution, the incidence at a given calendar time is governed by the epidemic renewal equation and the delay structure is specified through a composite link framework. Laplace approximations to the conditional posterior of the spline vector are obtained from analytical versions of the gradient and Hessian of the log-likelihood, implying a drastic speed-up in the computation of posterior estimates. Furthermore, the proposed LPS approach can be used to obtain point estimates and approximate credible intervals for the delay and reporting probabilities. Simulation of epidemics with different combinations for the underreporting rate and delay structure (one-day, two-day and weekend delays) show that the proposed LPS methodology delivers fast and accurate estimates outperforming existing methods that do not take into account underreporting and delay patterns. Finally, LPS is illustrated on two real case studies of epidemic outbreaks.","output":"An approximate Bayesian approach for estimation of the reproduction number under misreported epidemic data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Systematic reviews have identified the need for a patient-reported outcome measure for facial nerve paralysis (FNP).

Respondents reported the frequency of travel before the pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated travel when normal activities resume for walking, bicycling, personal vehicle use, and public transit. Analyses were conducted in July and August 2020. RESULTS: During the pandemic, local travel significantly decreased (-10.36%, 95% CI= -16.26, -4.02) relative to prepandemic levels. Within travel modes, significant decreases were reported for public transit, personal vehicle use, and walking. There was no change in reported bicycle use during the pandemic period relative to prepandemic levels.

Several promising drugs have been identified and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. If efficacy of these drugs is demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an affordable cost would be essential to ensuring equity and access especially amongst low- and middle-income economies. Methods Minimum costs of production were estimated from the costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology, which had good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C and HIV amongst others. Data were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of the route of chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available. Results Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone. Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10-28 days). Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US. Conclusions Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current list prices. Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 at low prices globally.","output":"Minimum costs to manufacture new treatments for COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Singapore.

The effectiveness of control measures such as contact reduction measures, closure of communities (lockdown), protective measures (social distancing, face mask wearing, and hand hygiene), and vaccination were modelled to examine possibilities for control of the disease under several protective vaccination levels in the population. Lockdown and contact reduction measures only delay the spread of the virus in the population because it resumes its previous dynamics as soon as the restrictions are lifted. Nevertheless, these measures are probably useful to avoid hospitals being overwhelmed in the short term. Our model predicted that 56% of the Spanish population would have been infected and subsequently recovered over a 130 day period if no protective measures were taken but this percentage would have been only 34% if protective measures had been put in place. Moreover, this percentage would have been further reduced to 41.7, 27.7, and 13.3% if 25, 50 and 75% of the population had been vaccinated, respectively. Finally, this percentage would have been even lower at 25.5, 12.1 and 7.9% if 25, 50 and 75% of the population had been vaccinated in combination with the application of protective measures, respectively. Therefore, a combination of protective measures and vaccination would be highly efficacious in decreasing not only the number of those who become infected and subsequently recover, but also the number of people who die from infection, which falls from 0.41% of the population over a 130 day period without protective measures to 0.15, 0.08 and 0.06% if 25, 50 and 75% of the population had been vaccinated in combination with protective measures at the same time, respectively.","output":"Modelling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak: Assessing the usefulness of protective measures to reduce the pandemic at population level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The karyotypes of seven Ilybius species are described and illustrated.

I. wasastjernae has 36 autosomes and the X chromosome is the smallest in the nucleus and its karyotype is unlike any other known karyotype in either Ilybius or Agabus. In most of the species studied no intraspecific variation has been detected. Exceptions are I. chalconatus, where there is one inversion polymorphism in one of the autosomes, and I. montanus whose autosome number has been found to vary from 29 to 34. Such variation is highly unusual among Coleoptera. The variation results from fusion\\\\fission polymorphisms involving three different pairs of autosomes. In each case the fusions may be homozygous, heterozygous or absent. All populations investigated were polymorphic for some of the fusions, but only one (La Salceda, Spain) included individuals lacking all fusions. The frequencies of fused and unfused chromosomes were analysed in three English populations. In only one case was there a departure from the values expected from the Hardy\\\\Weinberg equilibrium, and this population also showed a significant difference from the other two. Meiosis in males heterozygous for fusions involves the production of trivalents in first division, but results in the production of abundant sperm, with no evidence of chromosomal abnormalities in second metaphase, or of degenerating cells as a result of failed meiosis. The three fusions sites are consistent in all the populations studied, and it is concluded that these fusions represent unique historical events rather than current chromosomal instability.","output":"A chromosomal analysis of some water beetle species recently transferred from Agabus Leach to Ilybius Erichson, with particular reference to the variation in chromosome number shown by I. montanus Stephens (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Supplementation with antithrombin (AT) concentrates is now common in the treatment of congenital and acquired AT deficiency. However, there is no established consensus on the target and timing of supplementation. We aimed to elucidate the effects of AT deficiency on the balance between coagulation activation and inhibition using a thrombin generation assay as in vitro global assay. METHODS: Samples were prepared by admixing commercially acquired AT-deficient plasma with < 1% AT activity with pooled normal plasma. The AT activity in each sample was adjusted to 100, 90, 70, 50, 40, 30, 10, 5, and < 1%. A thrombin generation assay was performed in each sample. AT concentrate-spiked samples were also prepared by adjusting the AT activities in four types of the concentrates: one recombinant and three plasma-derived AT concentrates. The final targeted AT activities in the samples were adjusted to 100, 50, 30, and 5% by spiking each concentrate into the AT-deficient plasma. We also prepared samples with five levels of prothrombin time (PT) % in coagulation factors with the AT activity fixed at 30% by dilution by mixing AT-deficient plasma and normal plasma with Owrens veronal buffer to adjust the coagulation factor activities in several proportions. The theoretical target PT% values were 100, 66, 50, 40, and 30%. A thrombin generation assay was performed on all samples. RESULTS: The ability to generate thrombin depended on the AT activity, and the amount of thrombin generation was increased as AT was decreased. Additionally, the amount of thrombin generation was changed significantly when AT activity was  50%, indicating that AT suppressed thrombin generation. In particular, thrombin generation was remarkable when AT activity was < 30%, and it can be assumed that the prognosis is poor due to organ failure from thrombotic tendency. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented in this basic research were found to be consistent with the clinical findings to date. The mechanism by which 30C50% of AT activity is set as the clinical boundary was elucidated by the thrombin generation assay.","output":"Thrombin generation capacity is enhanced by low antithrombin activity and depends on the activity of the related coagulation factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Legionella pneumophila(L. pneumophila is a harmful pathogen often found in water systems.

Each consisted of a clinical scenario filmed using virtual reality (VR) technology, linked to an adaptive, interactive, online tutorial which explicitly discussed the relevant ethical issues and guidelines. These were embedded in clinical placements of students to encourage the transfer of knowledge from these modules to clinical skill competency. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate these modules which examined student engagement, knowledge gains (self-perceived and measured) and user experience. We also reviewed reflections to assess the incorporation of these modules and transfer of knowledge into the clinical learning and skill development of the students. RESULTS: Engagement and self-perceived knowledge gains were extremely high. Students found these modules realistic, interesting and helpful. The measured knowledge gains (module exit quiz) were moderate. User experience was positive overall, although students were intolerant of any technical glitches.

The results show that both NO2 and SO2 data from three datasets exhibit a similar tendency and seasonality.

All the results demonstrated that the TROPOMI NO2 as well as the SO2 algorithms need to be further improved. Thus, to ensure reliable analysis in NCP area, a correction method has been proposed and applied to TROPOMI Level 3 data. The revised datasets agree reasonably well with OMI observations (R > 0.95 for NO2, and R > 0.85 for SO2) over the NCP region and have smaller mean biases with MAX-DOAS.

An additional filter of age group between 0-18 years was kept in each of the searches. RESULTS: Chilblains constitute the most common cutaneous manifestation of pediatric coronavirus disease (covid-19). Other commonly reported manifestations include maculopapular rash, urticaria, erythema multiforme, and papulovesicular eruptions. Majority of children with these manifestations are asymptomatic, highlighting the need to clinically suspect and appropriately manage such patients. A subset of pediatric patients develop severe multisystem involvement termed as multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) that has varied mucocutaneous manifestations.

It is important therefore to explore factors that may buffer or accentuate the risk of mental health problems in this context. Given that compassion has numerous benefits for mental health, emotion regulation, and social relationships, this study examines the buffering effects of different flows of compassion (for self, for others, from others) against the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety, and stress, and social safeness. METHODS: The study was conducted in a sample of 4057 adult participants from the general community population, collected across 21 countries from Europe, Middle East, North America, South America, Asia, and Oceania. Participants completed self-report measures of perceived threat of COVID-19, compassion (for self, for others, from others), depression, anxiety, stress, and social safeness. RESULTS: Perceived threat of COVID-19 was associated with higher scores in depression, anxiety, and stress, and lower scores in social safeness. Self-compassion and compassion from others were associated with lower psychological distress and higher social safeness. Compassion for others was associated with lower depressive symptoms. Self-compassion moderated the relationship between perceived threat of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety, and stress, whereas compassion from others moderated the effects of fears of contracting COVID-19 on social safeness. These effects were consistent across all countries. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the universal protective role of compassion, in particular self-compassion and compassion from others, in promoting resilience by buffering against the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and social safeness.

METHODS: We identified the first employee with COVID-19 at a supermarket and screened the close contacts of this index patient. Confirmed cases were divided into two groups according to the generation (first generation comprising supermarket employees [group A] and second or third generations comprising family members or friends of the supermarket employees [group B]). The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the two groups were retrospectively compared. RESULTS: A total of 8437 people were screened, and 24 COVID-19 patients were identified. Seven patients (29.2%) were asymptomatic; three patients were responsible for six symptomatic cases. The interval from the confirmation of the first case to symptom onset in symptomatic patients was 5C11 days. The clinical manifestations of symptomatic patients upon admission were non-specific. All patients (including the seven asymptomatic patients) were admitted based on chest computed tomography features indicative of pneumonia. There were 11 cases in group A (first generation) and 13 cases in group B (second generation, 11 cases; third generation, 2 cases), with no significant differences in clinical and epidemiological characteristics between the two groups, except for sex, duration from symptom onset to hospitalization, and underlying disease (P > 0.05).

In this study, we have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to systematically evaluate the effect of 10 cardiometabolic risk factors and genetic liability to lifetime smoking on 97 circulating host proteins postulated to either interact or contribute to the maladaptive host response of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach and several robust MR methods in a two-sample setting to systemically estimate the genetically predicted effect of each risk factor in turn on levels of each circulating protein. Multivariable MR was conducted to simultaneously evaluate the effects of multiple risk factors on the same protein. We also applied MR using cis-regulatory variants at the genomic location responsible for encoding these proteins to estimate whether their circulating levels may influence SARS-CoV-2 severity. Findings: In total, we identified evidence supporting 105 effects between risk factors and circulating proteins which were robust to multiple testing corrections and sensitivity analyses. For example, body mass index provided evidence of an effect on 23 circulating proteins with a variety of functions, such as inflammatory markers c-reactive protein (IVW Beta=0.34 per standard deviation change, 95% CI=0.26 to 0.41, P=2.19x10-16) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IVW Beta=0.23, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.30, P=9.04x10-12). Further analyses using multivariable MR provided evidence that the effect of BMI on lowering immunoglobulin G, an antibody class involved in protecting the body from infection, is substantially mediated by raised triglycerides levels (IVW Beta=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.25 to -0.12, P=2.32x10-08, proportion mediated=44.1%). The strongest evidence that any of the circulating proteins highlighted by our initial analysis influence SARS-CoV-2 severity was identified for soluble glycoprotein 130 (odds ratio=1.81, 95% CI=1.25 to 2.62, P=0.002), a signal transductor for interleukin-6 type cytokines which are involved in the bodys inflammatory response. However, based on current case samples for severe SARS-CoV-2 we were unable to replicate findings in independent samples. Interpretation: Our findings highlight several key proteins which are influenced by established exposures for disease.

Previous studies of infectious diseases showed that infectious diseases not only cause physical damage to infected individuals but also damage to the mental health of the public. Therefore this study aims to analyze the factors that affected depression in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide evidence for COVID-19-related mental health policies and to emphasize the need to prepare for mental health issues related to potential infectious disease outbreaks in the future. RESULTS: This study performed the following statistical analyses to analyze the factors that influence depression in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, to confirm the level of depression in the public in each country, the participants depression was plotted on a Boxplot graph for analysis. Second, to confirm personal and national factors that influence depression in individuals, a multi-level analysis was conducted. As a result, the median Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score for all participants was 6. The median was higher than the overall median for the Philippines, Indonesia, and Paraguay, suggesting a higher level of depression. In personal variables, depression was higher in females than in males, and higher in participants who had experienced discrimination due to COVID-19 than those who had not. In contrast, depression was lower in older participants, those with good subjective health, and those who practiced personal hygiene for prevention. In national variables, depression was higher when the Government Response Stringency Index score was higher, when life expectancy was higher, and when social capital was higher. In contrast, depression was lower when literacy rates were higher. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that depression was higher in participants living in countries with higher stringency index scores than in participants living in other countries. Maintaining a high level of vigilance for safety cannot be criticized. However, in the current situation, where coexisting with COVID-19 has become inevitable, inflexible and stringent policies not only increase depression in the public, but may also decrease resilience to COVID-19 and compromise preparations for coexistence with COVID-19.

We develop a five-state model for COVID-19, taking into account the unique features of the novel coronavirus, with key parameters determined by the government reports and mathematical optimization. Tests using data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran indicate that the model is capable of generating accurate prediction of the daily accumulated number of confirmed cases and is entirely suitable for real-time prediction. The drastically disparate testing and diagnostic standards/policies among different countries lead to large variations in the estimated parameter values such as the duration of the outbreak, but such uncertainties have little effect on the occurrence time of the inflection point as predicted by the model, indicating its reliability and robustness. Model prediction for Italy suggests that insufficient government action leading to a large fraction of undocumented infection plays an important role in the abnormally high mortality in that country. With the data currently available from United Kingdom, our model predicts catastrophic epidemic scenarios in the country if the government did not impose strict travel and social distancing restrictions. A key finding is that, if the percentage of undocumented infection exceeds a threshold, a non-negligible hidden population can exist even after the the epidemic has been deemed over, implying the likelihood of future outbreaks should the currently imposed strict government actions be relaxed. This could make COVID-19 evolving into a long-term epidemic or a community disease a real possibility, suggesting the necessity to conduct universal testing and monitoring to identify the hidden individuals.","output":"Quantitative assessment of the role of undocumented infection in the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tobacco farming is considered Hazardous Child Labor in Brazil.

In this study, recombinant proteins from rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and rabbit rotavirus and whole viral lysates of Sendai virus were used as coating antigens in an xMAP assay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against these pathogens. The xMAP assay showed high specificity, with no cross-reaction with other pathogens. The coefficient of variation for intra-assay and inter-assay comparisons was less than 3% and 4%, respectively, indicating good repeatability and stability of the assay. The xMAP assay exhibited similar limits of detection for rabbit hemorrhagic virus and Sendai virus and was less sensitive for the detection of rabbit rotavirus when compared with commercial ELISA kits. A total of 52 clinical samples were tested simultaneously using both the xMAP assay and ELISA kits. The results obtained using these two methods were 100% coincident.

Here, we introduce a low-cost, high-throughput method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, dubbed Pathogen-Oriented Low-Cost Assembly & Re-Sequencing (POLAR), that enhances sensitivity by aiming to amplify the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome rather than targeting particular viral loci, as in typical RT-PCR assays. To achieve this goal, we combine a SARS-CoV-2 enrichment method developed by the ARTIC Network (https://artic.network/) with short-read DNA sequencing and de novo genome assembly. We are able to reliably (>95% accuracy) detect SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations of 84 genome equivalents per milliliter, better than the reported limits of detection of almost all diagnostic methods currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. At higher concentrations, we are able to reliably assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the sample, often with no gaps and perfect accuracy. Such genome assemblies enable the spread of the disease to be analyzed much more effectively than would be possible with an ordinary yes/no diagnostic, and can help identify vaccine and drug targets.

Effects of exposure may manifest in terms of psychological, cognitive, or musculoskeletal impairments that affect an individuals daily functioning and quality of life. There is a dearth of studies exploring anxiety states, occupational dysfunction, and mental health associated with the new standard of increased telecommunication. Accordingly, the present study aimed to identify the differences in occupational dysfunction, health literacy, positive and negative emotions, and stress response considering the anxiety states of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Another purpose is to identify relationships among the parameters such as occupational dysfunction and mental health. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 358 students (average age: 18.5 years, age range: 18C29 years). Five tools were used: the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Classification and Assessment of Occupational Dysfunction (CAOD), European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q47), Profile of Mood States 2nd Edition (POMS-2), and Stress Response Scale-18 (SRS-18). Based on the cutoff value of state and trait anxiety of the STAI, the participants were classified into four groups and compared using one-way analysis of variance and multiple comparison tests. The relationship between all parameters was analyzed using Pearsons correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The group with high trait anxiety and high state anxiety had the highest CAOD total score, Total Mood Disturbance score on the POMS-2, SRS-18 score, and scores on many sub-items of the three parameters. The prevalence of occupational dysfunction was 47% for university students, and there was a variation of from 19 to 61% in each group. The correlation coefficients of the state and trait anxiety scores of the STAI, Total Mood Disturbance score, and SRS-18 ranged from .64 to .75. Additionally, the correlation coefficient between the CAOD total score and these parameters ranged from .44 to .48. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of occupational dysfunction was highest in the group with high trait anxiety and high state anxiety, and occupational dysfunction, negative emotions, and stress responses were strongest in this group.

However, a while later, information circulated that ibuprofen should be avoided as it could worsen COVID-19 symptoms. The aim of our study was to assess the association of acute and chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with worse COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: We did a prospective cohort study between April 12 and June 1, 2020. Adults consecutively diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. Information on NSAID use was collected through a telephone questionnaire, and patients were followed up for COVID-19 infection outcomes, including death, admission, severity, time to clinical improvement, oxygen requirement and length of stay. RESULTS: Acute use of ibuprofen was not associated with a greater risk of mortality relative to non-use (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.632 [95% CI 0.073-5.441; P = 0.6758]). Chronic NSAID use was also not associated with a greater risk of mortality (adjusted HR 0.492 [95% CI 0.178-1.362; P = 0.1721]). Acute ibuprofen use was not associated with a higher risk of admission compared to non-NSAID users (adjusted odds ratio OR 1.271; 95% CI 0.548-2.953).

There is growing evidence that such patients are at higher risk for medication-induced adverse events. Furthermore, frailty seems to be more predictive of poor clinical outcomes than chronological age alone. To our knowledge, no systematic review of clinical trials examining drug therapy of AD or behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) has specifically focused on the topic of physical frailty. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy in AD patients with frailty or significant functional impairments. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of drug therapy of AD and BPSD in patients with significant functional impairments according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and Cochrane research criteria. Significant functionally impaired patient populations were identified using the recommendations of the Medication and Quality of Life in frail older persons (MedQoL) Research Group. Screening, selection of studies, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Outcomes including functional status, cognitive function, changes in BPSD symptoms, clinical global impression and quality of life were analysed. For assessing harm, we assessed adverse events, drop-outs as a proxy for treatment tolerability and death. Results were analysed according to Cochrane standards and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS Of 45,045 search results, 38,447 abstracts and 187 full texts were screened, and finally, 10 RCTs were included in the systematic review. Selected articles evaluated pharmacotherapy with acetylcholinesterase-inhibitors (AChEI), anticonvulsants, antidepressants and antipsychotics. Studies of AChEIs suggested that patients with significant functional impairments had slight but significant improvements in cognition and that AChEIs were generally well tolerated. Studies of antidepressants did not show significant improvements in depressive symptoms. Antipsychotics and anticonvulsants showed small effects on some BPSD items but also higher rates of adverse events. However, due to the very small number of identified trials, the quality of evidence for all outcomes was low to very low. Overall, the small number of eligible studies demonstrates that significantly functional impaired older patients have not been adequately taken into consideration in most clinical trials investigating drug therapy of AD and BPSD. CONCLUSION Due to lack of evidence, it is not possible to give specific recommendations for drug therapy of AD and BSPD in frail older patients or older patients with significant functional impairments. Therefore, clinical trials focussing on frail older adults are urgently required. A standardized approach to physical frailty in future clinical studies is highly desirable.","output":"Efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for Alzheimer's disease and for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in older patients with moderate and severe functional impairments: a systematic review of controlled trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study describes a genome sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sampled from a male patient with SARS-CoV-2 who was likely infected in Casablanca, Morocco.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequence from Morocco, Obtained Using Ion AmpliSeq Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spain has been one of the countries heavily stricken by COVID-19.

We analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital stroke admissions and in-hospital mortality in tertiary referral hospitals from North-West Spain. METHODS: Spanish multicenter retrospective observational study based on data from tertiary hospitals of the NORDICTUS network. We recorded the number of patients admitted for ischemic stroke between 30 December 2019 and 3 May 2020, the number of IVT and EVT procedures, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In the study period, 2737 patients were admitted with ischemic stroke. There was a decrease in the weekly mean admitted patients during the pandemic (124 vs. 173, p<0.001). In-hospital mortality of stroke patients increased significantly (9.9% vs. 6.5%, p = 0.003), but there were no differences in the proportion of IVT (17.3% vs. 16.1%, p = 0.405) or EVT (22% vs. 23%, p = 0.504).

These factors cohere to form a COVID stress syndrome, which we sought to further delineate in the present study. METHODS: A population-representative sample of 6,854 American and Canadian adults completed a self-report survey comprising questions about current mental health and COVID-19-related experiences, distress, and coping. RESULTS: Network analysis revealed that worry about the dangerousness of COVID-19 is the central feature of the syndrome. Latent class analysis indicated that the syndrome is quasi-dimensional, comprising five classes differing in syndrome severity. Sixteen percent of participants were in the most severe class and possibly needing mental health services. Syndrome severity was correlated with preexisting psychopathology and with excessive COVID-19-related avoidance, panic buying, and coping difficulties during self-isolation.

Comparison of urinary microRNA profiles from AKI patients with controls detected significant injury-specific increases in miR-21, miR-126 and miR-141 (p < 0.05) and decreases in miR-192 (p < 0.001) and miR-204 (p < 0.05). Expression of miR-141 increased in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) under oxidative stress in vitro and unilateral ischaemic reperfusion injury in vivo. Forced miR-141 expression in the presence of H(2)O(2) increased PTEC death and decreased cell viability. Of nine messenger RNA targets with two or more miR-141 3-untranslated region binding sites, we confirmed protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G (PTPRG) as a direct miR-141 target in PTECs. PTPRG-specific siRNA knockdown under oxidative stress increased PTEC death and decreased cell viability.

Identifying and quantifying relationships between drivers of zoonotic disease outbreaks and outbreak severity is critical to developing targeted zoonotic disease surveillance and outbreak prevention strategies. However, quantitative studies of outbreak drivers on a global scale are lacking. Attributes of countries such as press freedom, surveillance capabilities and latitude also bias global outbreak data. To illustrate these issues, we review the characteristics of the 100 largest outbreaks in a global dataset (n = 4463 bacterial and viral zoonotic outbreaks), and compare them with 200 randomly chosen background controls. Large outbreaks tended to have more drivers than background outbreaks and were related to large-scale environmental and demographic factors such as changes in vector abundance, human population density, unusual weather conditions and water contamination. Pathogens of large outbreaks were more likely to be viral and vector-borne than background outbreaks. Overall, our case study shows that the characteristics of large zoonotic outbreaks with thousands to millions of cases differ consistently from those of more typical outbreaks.

Severe manifestations of COVID-19 are caused by a combination of direct tissue injury by viral replication and associated cytokine storm resulting in progressive organ damage. DISCUSSION: We reviewed published literature between January 1st, 2000 and June 30th, 2020, excluding articles focusing on pediatric or obstetric population, with a focus on virus-host interactions and immunological mechanisms responsible for virus associated cytokine release syndrome (CRS). COVID-19 illness encompasses three main phases. In phase 1, SARS-CoV-2 binds with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 receptor on alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells, triggering toll like receptor (TLR) mediated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-?B) signaling. It effectively blunts an early (IFN) response allowing unchecked viral replication. Phase 2 is characterized by hypoxia and innate immunity mediated pneumocyte damage as well as capillary leak. Some patients further progress to phase 3 characterized by cytokine storm with worsening respiratory symptoms, persistent fever, and hemodynamic instability. Important cytokines involved in this phase are interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-. This is typically followed by a recovery phase with production of antibodies against the virus. We summarize published data regarding virus-host interactions, key immunological mechanisms responsible for virus-associated CRS, and potential opportunities for therapeutic interventions. CONCLUSION: Evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and pathogenesis is rapidly evolving. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and immune system dysregulation associated with CRS and acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe COVID-19 is imperative to identify novel drug targets and other therapeutic interventions.","output":"Harnessing the immune system to overcome cytokine storm and reduce viral load in COVID-19: a review of the phases of illness and therapeutic agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The respirator as one of the personal protective equipment is essential for industrial activities (e.g., mining, painting, woodcutting, manufacturing) for protection from contaminants in the air and during the Covid-19 pandemic to protect the wearer from infection.

Although the clinical efficacy of Chansu injection for COVID-19 treatment has been confirmed, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Objectives: In this study, we used network pharmacology and molecular docking technology to explore the potential material basis and mechanism of action of Chansu injection for COVID-19 treatment. Methods: The main components of Chansu injection were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The PharmMapper, SwissTargetPrediction, SEA, and TCMID databases were used to screen for the active ingredients and therapeutic targets of Chansu injection while the OMIM and GeneCards Suite databases were used to search for COVID-19-related targets. The STRING database was used for proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network construction and topological analysis while DAVID was used for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of the core targets. Molecular docking of the three Chansu injection components (i.e., cinobufagin, resibufogenin, and bufalin) to angiotensin-converting enzyme II, spike (S) protein, 3CL protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was also carried out. Results: The three Chansu injection compounds were identified using HPLC. A total of 236 drug-related targets and 16,611 disease-related targets were identified, and 77 common targets were determined through mapping. The PPI mapping results revealed 16 core targets obtained through topological analysis and screening. Further, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the PI3K and JAKCSTAT signaling pathways are the major pathways regulated by Chansu injection in COVID-19 treatment. The molecular docking results suggest that the three Chansu injection components have high binding energies to the S protein. Conclusions: This study revealed that the potential mechanism of Chansu injection for COVID-19 treatment involves multiple targets and pathways, thereby providing a scientific basis for its clinical application and further research.","output":"Material Basis and Mechanism of Chansu Injection for COVID-19 Treatment Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several research efforts have evaluated the impact of various factors including a) socio-demographics, (b) health indicators, (c) mobility trends, and (d) health care infrastructure attributes on COVID-19 transmission and mortality rate. However, earlier research focused only on a subset of variable groups (predominantly one or two) that can contribute to the COVID-19 transmission/mortality rate. The current study effort is designed to remedy this by analyzing COVID-19 transmission/mortality rates considering a comprehensive set of factors in a unified framework. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We study two per capita dependent variables: (1) daily COVID-19 transmission rates and (2) total COVID-19 mortality rates. The first variable is modeled using a linear mixed model while the later dimension is analyzed using a linear regression approach. The model results are augmented with a sensitivity analysis to predict the impact of mobility restrictions at a county level. Several county level factors including proportion of African-Americans, income inequality, health indicators associated with Asthma, Cancer, HIV and heart disease, percentage of stay at home individuals, testing infrastructure and Intensive Care Unit capacity impact transmission and/or mortality rates. From the policy analysis, we find that enforcing a stay at home order that can ensure a 50% stay at home rate can result in a potential reduction of about 33% in daily cases. CONCLUSIONS: The model framework developed can be employed by government agencies to evaluate the influence of reduced mobility on transmission rates at a county level while accommodating for various county specific factors. Based on our policy analysis, the study findings support a county level stay at home order for regions currently experiencing a surge in transmission. The model framework can also be employed to identify vulnerable counties that need to be prioritized based on health indicators for current support and/or preferential vaccination plans (when available).","output":"A comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 transmission and mortality rates at the county level in the United States considering socio-demographics, health indicators, mobility trends and health care infrastructure attributes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 shows an unexplained, strong male bias for severity and mortality.

There is a lack of awareness to maintain health in society today. Many people do not understand the importance of maintaining health to stay healthy. Recently there has been an unclear paradigm towards the transmission of the COVID -19 virus. The spread of a virus that is very mobile will definitely have a bad impact. This is exacerbated by the state of unclear issues where there is a lack of socialization of the preventive action of the COVID-19 virus especially in Indonesia. Based on these things in this study a socialization video was made about preventing the spread of the COVID -19 virus based on 2-dimensional animation using kinetic typography techniques. So, the final result of this research is in the form of an animated video as a 2-dimensional based socialization media regarding the prevention of transmission of the COVID -19 virus to the public visually in the form of an animated video.","output":"Video animasi motion graphic dan tipografi kinetik sebagai media sosialisasi pencegahan virus Corona"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged supply chains more seriously challenged than ever before. During this prolonged global health crisis, supply chain managers were forced to rely primarily on solutions developed for limited and foreseeable crises. This study aimed to understand how well existing solutions facilitated supply chain resilience in the UK perishable goods market. Consistent with this aim, we developed a research model based on the supply chain resilience literature and tested it with covariance-based structural equation modelling. Data were collected from 282 retail employees. Supply chain velocity was the preferred measure of resilience. The findings demonstrate that pandemic-related disruptions have affected resilience-building activities. While both proactive and reactive approaches have promoted resilience building during the pandemic, they have not been sufficient to ameliorate all the pandemic's negative effects. Innovation featured as the most effective factor, followed by robustness, empowerment, and risk management via reduced risk. The effect of firm size was significant only on supply chain risk management, with larger companies more efficiently applying risk management practices. The results emphasise the importance of innovation for supply chain resilience. Regardless of firm size, innovation works for every company. Empowerment is another costless and effective tool. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that innovation and empowerment can help organisations to manage their supply chains effectively during crises.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis on sixteen patients aged between 13 and 82, who were presented to Gazi Yasargil Training and Research Hospital Burn Center due to frostbite injuries. Data of each patient, including age, gender, injury time, extremity injuries, bacteriological observations, and general warming, were obtained from patients' files and computer records. RESULTS: After providing the first intervention to all the patients with trauma, a circulatory disorder of the injury area was deter-mined, and the treatment was provided accordingly. The treatment of these patients required very long and expensive operations, which often resulted in making them disabled.

One dimension of potential variation is the transmission of infectious diseases. In addition to potential differences between urban and rural local dynamics, the question of whether urban and rural areas participate equally in national dynamics remains unanswered. Specifically, urban and rural areas may diverge in local transmission as well as spatial connectivity, and thus risk for receiving imported cases. Finally, the potential confounding relationship of spatial proximity with size and urban/rural district type has not been addressed by previous research. It is rare to have sufficient data to explore these questions thoroughly. We use exhaustive weekly case reports of measles in 954 urban and 468 rural districts of the UK (1944C1965) to compare both local disease dynamics as well as regional transmission. We employ the time-series susceptibleCinfectedCrecovered model to estimate disease transmission, epidemic severity, seasonality and import dependence. Congruent with past results, we observe a clear dependence on population size for the majority of these measures. We use a matched-pair strategy to compare proximate urban and rural districts and control for possible spatial confounders. This analytical strategy reveals a modest difference between urban and rural areas. Rural areas tend to be characterized by more frequent, smaller outbreaks compared to urban counterparts. The magnitude of the difference is slight and the results primarily reinforce the importance of population size, both in terms of local and regional transmission. In sum, urban and rural areas demonstrate remarkable epidemiological similarity in this recent UK context.","output":"Structure, space and size: competing drivers of variation in urban and rural measles transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the accuracy of four machine-learning (ML) algorithms, using two classification schemes, to predict undernutrition based on individual and household risk factors. METHODS: Data on public-school children were collected from a rural province (310 children) and a highly urbanized city (308 children) in the Philippines using 24-h dietary recalls and a household socioeconomic and demographic survey. Children's nutritional risk was classified based on acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges (AMDRs) developed by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) and Philippine Dietary Reference Intakes (PDRIs). Four algorithms (random forest, support-vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, and logistic regression) predicted undernutrition in the sample, and their accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were compared. Predictions were also compared with the national school feeding program's anthropometric classifications. RESULTS: The prevalence of undernutrition was greater under NAM AMDRs (82.67%) compared with PDRI AMDRs (78.71%). Random forest was the most accurate ML algorithm (78.55%), able to predict undernutrition based on household expenditures, child and household age, food insecurity, and dietary diversity. Compared with anthropometric classification (213 children), AMDRs classified more children as at risk for inadequate dietary intake (477 children). CONCLUSIONS: The random forest algorithm performed best in predicting undernutrition among Filipino elementary schoolchildren, although results could be improved with bootstrap aggregation. The AMDR classification shows potential for targeting feeding beneficiaries. However, local dietary culture should be considered in the development of nutrition interventions. Government use of big-data techniques such as ML must also address underrepresentation in health data collected from and accessible to poor populations or risk further marginalizing them.","output":"Predicting undernutrition among elementary schoolchildren in the Philippines using machine learning algorithms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study: (a) examined the extent of caregiver burden and psychological wellbeing and (b) tested whether social connectedness moderated the association between caregiver burden and psychological symptoms in caregivers of people with cancer.

Data were collected on caregiver burden, social connectedness, and depression and anxiety. Moderation analysis was conducted to examine the effect of social connectedness on the relationship between caregiver burden and depression and anxiety. Caregiver burden was positively associated with depression and anxiety symptoms.

By contrast, social connectedness did not moderate the association between caregiver burden and anxiety. Findings have implications for the management of depression in cancer caregivers. Social connectedness appears to provide a protective buffer from the negative impacts of caregiving, providing increased psychological resources to manage the burden associated with caregiving, resulting in lower depression.

This study aims to investigate the impacts of the prevention and control measures in controlling COVID-19 epidemic in China, so as to give a clue to control its spread in the world. Methods: : We establish a two-stage dynamics transmission model with \\"lockdown of Wuhan city\\" as the time line. The first stage is the SEIR derived model that considers the contagious of the exposed. It simulates the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province before \\"lockdown of Wuhan city\\". The second stage is a novel transmission dynamics model named SEIRQH. It takes into account the influence on the COVID-19 epidemic from the series of measures such as travel restriction, contact tracing, centralized treatment, the asymptomatic infected patients, hospitalized patients and so on. It simulates the COVID-19 epidemic in China after \\"lockdown of Wuhan city\\". The least square method is used to estimate the parameters of SEIR derived model and the proposed SEIRQH model based on the collected epidemic data of COVID-19 from Hubei Province and the mainland of China. Results: : The SEIR derived model fits the actual data in Hubei province before \\"lockdown of Wuhan city\\". The basic reproduction number of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province is 3.2035 before \\"lockdown of Wuhan city\\". The SEIRQH model fits the number of the hospitalized persons of COVID-19 in Hubei Province and the mainland of China perfectly.

We compared sex differences in clinical characteristics, presentation, management strategies, and outcomes, including in-hospital mortality as the primary outcome. Results Among 585 patients with STEMI and COVID-19 infection, 154 (26.3%) were women. Compared to men, women were significantly older, had a higher prevalence of diabetes and stroke/transient ischemic attack, and were more likely to be on a statin on presentation. Men more frequently presented with chest pain, whereas women presented with dyspnea. Women more often had STEMI without an identified culprit lesion than men (33% vs 18%, P ?< ?.001). The use of percutaneous coronary intervention was significantly higher in men, whereas medical therapy was higher in women. In-hospital mortality was 33% for women and 27% for men (P ?= ?.22). There were no significant sex differences for in-hospital stroke, reinfarction, or composite endpoint.

Currently, no vaccine exists against coronavirus infections, including pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To combat these RNA virus infections, alternative antiviral strategies are needed. A key drug target is the viral RNA polymerase, which is responsible for viral RNA synthesis.

Enisamium is an isonicotinic acid derivative that is an inhibitor of multiple influenza B and A virus strains in cell culture and clinically approved in 11 countries. Here we show using in vitro assays that enisamium and its putative metabolite, VR17-04, inhibit the activity of the influenza virus and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase. VR17-04 displays similar efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase as the nucleotide analogue remdesivir triphosphate. These results suggest that enisamium is a broad-spectrum small molecule inhibitor of RNA virus RNA synthesis, and implicate it as a possible therapeutic option for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Also, todays Green New Deal policies are like dj vu of past green growth policies undertaken by major countries. The 2008 Green New Deal is considered successful locally but not much success was achieved at the global level. Since most policy objectives were focused on local economic recovery, not on global mitigation of climate change.There are three reasons why the Green New Deal in 2020 should be more global. First, it is necessary to take into account the multilateral environment agreements established to date, especially the Paris Agreement, in the Green New Deal. Since Nationally Determined Contributions(NCSs) are the heart of the Paris Agreement, as well as a minimum necessary effort to limit global warming, the Green New Deal needs to be tailored to achieving NDCs goals Second, the Green New Deal can have significant impacts on global production and trade. The EUs Green Deal relies on carbon taxes for its financial resources. In order to counter the carbon tax, domestic production processes should be decarbonized or develop new products designed with zero-emission goals. Also, major global companies declared their transition into 100% renewable energy during production and are demanding compliance from supply chain companies. Third, the Green New Deal should not violate the WTO rules in order to prevent unnecessary conflicts and disputes globally.The Green New Deal should be global, not just local. The Paris Agreement, global production and trade, and WTO rules are closely related to the Green New Deal and tremendously affected by this stimulus package. The domestic Green New Deals will create international spillover effects and international rules and regimes will assess their consequences. Therefore each countrys Green New Deal should not only engage their respective local economic and social situations under the COVID-19 pandemic but also incorporate global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change and proliferate the greener economy.

More than a half of participants (53.3%) displayed significant symptoms of PTSD. 50% consume energy drinks, 28% use tobacco; 13% use alcohol; 4.6% use marijuana; 1.7% use LSD, amphetamines, glue, tranquilizers and cocaine. Female respondents were more frequently expressing emotional difficulties (p < 0.05) while male participants were more frequent users of alcohol or substances (p < 0.01). Younger children were more frequently expressing symptoms of hyperactivity and prosocial behavior, while they were less frequently using substances. There is also a significant negative correlation between the years of education and individual proneness to substance use. Furthermore, those who resided in a greater number of refugee camps were found to experience greater levels of emotional and behavioral difficulties and face a greater risk of physical abuse. The burden of migration increases proneness to substance use, as a consequence of scarce coping resources and the stress of adjusting. Migrants are vulnerable to substance use, since some of them have commonly witnessed and/or personally experienced pre-and post-migration stress and trauma, including loss of homes and livelihoods, violence, torture and family separation. Preventive programs need to focus on the problem of alcohol and substance use among this vulnerable population.","output":"Mental Health, Alcohol and Substance Use of Refugee Youth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for two highly effective Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

In addition, high relative humidity was critical for AIV viability in PM(2.5). The results allowed a dispersion calculation of infectious AIV in aerosols assuming a worst case scenario for an AIV outbreak in poultry farms. Thus exposure to AIV associated with PM(2.5) is possible near to infected farms and may be a serious risk for fatal influenza disease in both man and animals. Airborne transmission should be effectively preventable by dispersion of water combined with disinfection into the inside air as well as the exhaust air stream of AIV infected farms.","output":"Generation of avian influenza virus (AIV) contaminated fecal fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)): genome and infectivity detection and calculation of immission."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"eHealth is promoted as a means to strengthen health systems and facilitate universal health coverage.

Approximately 50% of patients in stage ICIII develop metastases, mostly localized to the liver. All physiological conditions occurring in the organism are also reflected in the levels of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) in patients. miRNAs are a class of small, non-coding, single-stranded RNAs consisting of 18C25 nucleotides, which have important roles in various cellular processes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a panel of seven circulating miRNAs (miR-106a-5p, miR-210-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-103a-3p, miR-191-5p and miR-16-5p) as biomarkers for monitoring patients undergoing adjuvant treatment of CRC. Total RNA was extracted from the plasma of patients with CRC prior to surgery, in the early post-operative period (n=60) and 3 months after surgery (n=14). The levels of the selected circulating miRNAs were measured with the miRCURY LNA miRNA PCR system and fold changes were calculated using the standard ??Cq method. DIANA-miRPath analysis was used to evaluate the role of significantly deregulated miRNAs. The results indicated significant upregulation of miR-155-5p, miR-21-5p and miR-191-5p, and downregulation of miR-16-5p directly after the surgery. In paired follow-up samples, the most significant upregulation was detected for miR-106a-5p and miR-16-5p, and the most significant downregulation was for miR-21-5p. Pathway analysis outlined the role of the differentially expressed miRNAs in cancer development, but the same pathways are also involved in wound healing and regeneration of intestinal epithelium.

Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are acutely activated by caloric need, and this acute activation promotes increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure. On a longer timescale, AgRP neurons exhibit chronic hyperactivity under conditions of obesity and high dietary fat consumption, likely due to leptin resistance; however, the behavioral and metabolic effects of chronic AgRP neuronal hyperactivity remain unexplored. Here, we use chemogenetics to manipulate Gq signaling in AgRP neurons in mice to explore the hypothesis that chronic activation of AgRP neurons promotes obesity. Inducing chronic Gq signaling in AgRP neurons initially increased food intake and caused dramatic weight gain, in agreement with published data; however, food intake returned to baseline levels within 1 wk, and body weight returned to baseline levels within 60 d. Additionally, we found that, when mice had elevated body weight due to chronic Gq signaling in AgRP neurons, energy expenditure was not altered but adiposity and lipid metabolism were both increased, even under caloric restriction. These findings reveal that the metabolic and behavioral effects of chronic Gq signaling in AgRP neurons are distinct from the previously reported effects of acute Gq signaling and also of leptin insensitivity.","output":"Chronic Gq signaling in AgRP neurons does not cause obesity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Regularly updated data on stroke and its pathological types, including data on their incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability, risk factors, and epidemiological trends, are important for evidence-based stroke care planning and resource allocation. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) aims to provide a standardised and comprehensive measurement of these metrics at global, regional, and national levels. METHODS: We applied GBD 2019 analytical tools to calculate stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and the population attributable fraction (PAF) of DALYs (with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs]) associated with 19 risk factors, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. These estimates were provided for ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, and all strokes combined, and stratified by sex, age group, and World Bank country income level. FINDINGS: In 2019, there were 122 million (95% UI 110C136) incident cases of stroke, 101 million (932C111) prevalent cases of stroke, 143 million (133C153) DALYs due to stroke, and 655 million (600C702) deaths from stroke. Globally, stroke remained the second-leading cause of death (116% [108C122] of total deaths) and the third-leading cause of death and disability combined (57% [51C62] of total DALYs) in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the absolute number of incident strokes increased by 700% (670C730), prevalent strokes increased by 850% (830C880), deaths from stroke increased by 430% (310C550), and DALYs due to stroke increased by 320% (220C420). During the same period, age-standardised rates of stroke incidence decreased by 170% (150C180), mortality decreased by 360% (310C420), prevalence decreased by 60% (50C70), and DALYs decreased by 360% (310C420). However, among people younger than 70 years, prevalence rates increased by 220% (210C240) and incidence rates increased by 150% (120C180). In 2019, the age-standardised stroke-related mortality rate was 36 (35C38) times higher in the World Bank low-income group than in the World Bank high-income group, and the age-standardised stroke-related DALY rate was 37 (35C39) times higher in the low-income group than the high-income group. Ischaemic stroke constituted 624% of all incident strokes in 2019 (763 million [657C896]), while intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 279% (341 million [297C391]) and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 97% (118 million [101C139]). In 2019, the five leading risk factors for stroke were high systolic blood pressure (contributing to 796 million [677C908] DALYs or 555% [482C620] of total stroke DALYs), high body-mass index (349 million [223C486] DALYs or 243% [157C332]), high fasting plasma glucose (289 million [198C415] DALYs or 202% [138C291]), ambient particulate matter pollution (287 million [234C334] DALYs or 201% [166C230]), and smoking (253 million [226C282] DALYs or 176% [164C190]). INTERPRETATION: The annual number of strokes and deaths due to stroke increased substantially from 1990 to 2019, despite substantial reductions in age-standardised rates, particularly among people older than 70 years. The highest age-standardised stroke-related mortality and DALY rates were in the World Bank low-income group. The fastest-growing risk factor for stroke between 1990 and 2019 was high body-mass index. Without urgent implementation of effective primary prevention strategies, the stroke burden will probably continue to grow across the world, particularly in low-income countries.

Despite the fact that the pandemic is far from over, several countries managed at least temporarily to make their first-wave COVID-19 epidemics to subside to relatively low levels. Combining an epidemiological compartment model and a stability analysis as used in nonlinear physics and synergetics, it is shown how the first-wave epidemics in the state of New York and nationwide in the USA developed through three stages during the first half of the year 2020. These three stages are the outbreak stage, the linear stage, and the subsiding stage. Evidence is given that the COVID-19 outbreaks in these two regions were due to instabilities of the COVID-19 free states of the corresponding infection dynamical systems. It is shown that from stage 1 to stage 3, these instabilities were removed, presumably due to intervention measures, in the sense that the COVID-19 free states were stabilized in the months of May and June in both regions. In this context, stability parameters and key directions are identified that characterize the infection dynamics in the outbreak and subsiding stages. Importantly, it is shown that the directions in combination with the sign-switching of the stability parameters can explain the observed rise and decay of the epidemics in the state of New York and the USA. The nonlinear physics perspective provides a framework to obtain insights into the nature of the COVID-19 dynamics during outbreak and subsiding stages and allows to discuss possible impacts of intervention measures. For example, the directions can be used to determine how different populations (e.g., exposed versus symptomatic individuals) vary in size relative to each other during the course of an epidemic. Moreover, the timeline of the computationally obtained stages can be compared with the history of the implementation of intervention measures to discuss the effectivity of such measures.","output":"Rise and Decay of the COVID-19 Epidemics in the USA and the State of New York in the First Half of 2020: A Nonlinear Physics Perspective Yielding Novel Insights"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic could be driving more households to migrate out of cities and to the countryside, but this might result in an increased demand for access to green space which, in the long run, may cause a widening of social inequalities in rural areas.

However, there is limited research into the use of game-based digital technology applications such as Kahoot! and the associated learning theories, particularly in histology, anatomy and medical education. This scoping review explored the utilization, outcome scores and student perceptions of learning with the application of Kahoot! in histology, anatomy and medical education. Online databases were used to identify articles published between 2013 and 2021 from which 12 articles were included in the review. The majority of papers supported positive student outcomes including improved collaborative learning, improved knowledge of content, attendance, and participation. Minor negative aspects included increased time on task, overwhelming learning content and distractions due to gadgets. None of the papers included a control group. The main educational theories identified were active learning followed by social and constructivism learning theory. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic a rapid and fundamental shift in how digital applications are being used in educational institutions has evolved.

As the interaction of the underlying pathologies caused by vvECMO in COVID-19 is barely understood, we designed this study to better differentiate coagulation disorders in COVID-19 patients before, during and after vvECMO-support. METHODS Observational case series, six consecutive patients with Coronavirus acute respiratory distress syndrome supported with vvECMO treated in the anaesthesiologic ICU in a third level University ECMO-centre. We measured routine coagulation parameters and assessed coagulation factors. We also conducted advanced von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimer analysis, platelet aggregometry and immunological screening. RESULTS We identified various phases of coagulation disorders: Initially, intensely activated coagulation with highly increased VWF and factor VIII activity in acute COVID-19, then severe acquired von Willebrand syndrome and platelet dysfunction during vvECMO leading to spontaneous bleeding and finally, hypercoagulopathy after vvECMO explantation. Five of six patients developed immunological abnormalities enhancing coagulation. CONCLUSIONS Coronavirus-induced coagulopathy and bleeding disorders during vvECMO cannot be discriminated via 'routine' coagulation tests. Precise and specific analyses followed by the appropriate treatment of coagulation disorders may help us develop tailored therapeutic concepts to better manage the phases described above.","output":"Hypercoagulopathy, acquired coagulation disorders and anticoagulation before, during and after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in COVID-19: a case series."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initial efforts to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 relied on intensive social distancing measures such as school and workplace closures, shelter-in-place orders, and prohibitions on the gathering of people.

Older persons look to their primary care practitioners to assess their needs and coordinate their care. They may need care from a variety of providers and services, but often this care is not well coordinated. Older adults and their family caregivers are the experts in their own needs and preferences, but often do not have a chance to participate fully in treatment decisions or care planning. As a result, older adults may have health problems that are not properly assessed, managed or treated, resulting in poorer health outcomes and higher economic and social costs. We will be implementing enhanced primary healthcare approaches for older patients, including risk screening, patient engagement and shared decision making and care coordination. These interventions will be tailored to the needs and circumstances of the primary care study sites. In this article, we describe our study protocol for implementing and testing these approaches. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Nine primary care sites in three Canadian provinces will participate in a multi-phase mixed methods study. In phase 1, baseline information will be collected through questionnaires and interviews with patients and healthcare providers (HCPs). In phase 2, HCPs and patients will be consulted to tailor the evidence-based interventions to site-specific needs and circumstances. In phase 3, sites will implement the tailored care model. Evaluation of the care model will include measures of patient and provider experience, a quality of life measure, qualitative interviews and economic evaluation.

New or existing heart failure in the setting of COVID-19 can present a set of unique challenges that can complicate presentation, management, and prognosis. A careful understanding of the hemodynamic and diagnostic implications is essential for appropriate triage and management of these patients. Abnormal cardiac biomarkers are common in COVID-19 and can stem from a variety of mechanisms that involve the viral entry itself through the ACE2 receptors, direct cardiac injury, increased thrombotic activity, stress cardiomyopathy, and among others. The cytokine storm observed in this pandemic can be a culprit in many of the observed mechanisms and presentations. A correct understanding of the two-way interaction between heart failure medications and the infection as well as the proposed COVID-19 medications and heart failure can result in optimal management. Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure should not be interrupted for theoretical concerns but rather based on tolerance and clinical presentation. Initiating specific cardiac or heart failure medications to prevent the infection or mitigate the disease is also not an evidence-based practice at this time. Heart failure patients on advanced therapies including those with heart transplantation will particularly benefit from involving the advanced heart failure team members in the overall management if they contract the virus.","output":"Heart failure and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The time dependent SIR model is extended to simulate infection across spatial boundaries.

There is a very limited amount of data, usually obtained from a small population, regarding the effect of the underlying disease on the outcome in patients with COVID-19. The evaluation of the treatment of these comorbidities at baseline and during COVID-19 is scarce and the results are conflicting. Hypertension and CVD, after the adjustment for other clinical and demographic parameters, primarily age, did not remain independent predictors of the lethal outcome in COVID-19 patients.

Through reductions in physical activity, the COVID-19 pandemic may have worsened physical function and led to higher fall-related risks. METHODS: A nationally representative online survey of 2006 U.S. adults aged 50-80 was conducted in January 2021 to assess changes in health behaviors (worsened physical activity and less daily time spent on feet), social isolation (lack of companionship and perceived isolation), physical function (mobility and physical conditioning), and falls (falls and fear of falling) since March 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess relationships among physical activity, social isolation, physical function, falls, and fear of falling. RESULTS: Among respondents, 740 (36.9%) reported reduced physical activity levels, 704 (35.1%) reported reduced daily time spent on their feet since March 2020, 712 (37.1%) reported lack of companionship, and 914 (45.9%) social isolation. In multivariable models, decreased physical activity (adjusted risk ratio, ARR: 2.92, 95% CI: 2.38, 3.61), less time spent on one's feet (ARR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.62, 2.34), and social isolation (ARR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.74) were associated with greater risks of worsened physical conditioning. Decreased physical activity, time spent daily on one's feet, and social isolation were similarly associated with worsened mobility. Worsened mobility was associated with both greater risk of falling (ARR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.15) and worsened fear of falling (ARR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.30, 3.13). Worsened physical conditioning and social isolation were also associated with greater risk of worsened fear of falling. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with worsened physical functioning and fall outcomes, with the greatest effect on individuals with reduced physical activity and social isolation.

The integration of information communication technology (ICT) in the education system allows children with ASD to improve their learning. However, these ICT tools should meet their needs to lead a productive life. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the possibilities of re-creating and adapting digital content to improve the learning of numeracy among children with ASD in inclusive school settings. METHODS: We conducted 7 focus group discussions (FGDs) with 56 teachers from 7 schools and 14 parents from April to November 2019. Each of the FGDs took around 1 hour. Two clustered sets of questions were used: (1) general knowledge about teaching children with ASD and (2) analysis of selected online educational video content of early math (specifically, counting numbers). The researchers used video to understand current methodologies used in teaching children with ASD, possibilities of adaptation of the content in the current teaching environment, future challenges when the content is adapted, and possible solutions to overcome those challenges. All data, including audio recordings, field notes, and participants comments, were transcribed, recorded, and analyzed following the steps recommended in qualitative data analysis. RESULTS: The researchers identified ten themes from the analysis of the data: (1) awareness of the existence of ASD among children in schools and the community, (2) acceptance of children with ASD in an inclusive classroom and the community, (3) methods and models used when teaching children with ASD, (4)realia used to improve the learning of children with ASD, (5) the design of educational digital content, (6) the accessibility of online educational content, (7) quality of the content of the educational multimedia, (8) the opportunity of using the translated and re-created content inside and outside the classroom, (9) the relevance of the digital content in the Rwandan educational system, and (10) enhancement of the accessibility and quality of the digital content. We found that participants assumed that the content translation, gamification, and re-creation would help teach children with ASD. Moreover, they recommended contextualizing the content, increasing access to digital devices, and further research in the education of different subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Although many studies have identified the possibilities of using ICT to support children with ASD, few studies have documented the possibilities of integrating the existing technologies tested in the international community. This study is charting new territory to investigate online content to suit the context of schools. This study recommends further exploration of possible methodologies, such as applied behavior analysis or verbal behavior therapy, and the development of contextualized technologies that respond to the educational needs of children with ASD.","output":"Adapting the Use of Digital Content to Improve the Learning of Numeracy Among Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder in Rwanda: Thematic Content Analysis Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effectively preventing and controlling zoonotic diseases requires a One Health approach that involves collaboration across sectors responsible for human health, animal health (both domestic and wildlife), and the environment, as well as other partners.

Are disadvantaged adolescents disproportionally affected by the pandemic? Do pandemic effects vary with geographical variations in infection rates and restrictions? Multilevel models revealed higher depressive symptoms and lower optimism during the pandemic than before the pandemic, even when accounting for the measures time trends. Further, alcohol and cannabis use decreased, and screen time increased. Social relationships and conduct problems remained stable. Girls, younger adolescents, and adolescents from low socioeconomic backgrounds were disproportionally affected by the pandemic.

Carcinoembryonic cell adhesion antigen 1a (CEACAM1a) is the specific receptor for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus known to induce acute viral hepatitis in mice. The objective of this study was to understand the mechanisms responsible for the secretion of high-pathogenic MHV3-induced inflammatory cytokines. We report that the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- in peritoneal macrophages does not depend on CEACAM1a, as demonstrated in cells isolated from Ceacam1a(?/?) mice. The induction of IL-6 and TNF- production was related rather to the fixation of the spike (S) protein of MHV3 on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in regions enriched in heparan sulphate and did not rely on viral replication, as demonstrated with denatured S protein and UV-inactivated virus. High levels of IL-6 and TNF- were produced in livers from infected C57BL/6 mice but not in livers from Tlr2(?/?) mice. The histopathological observations were correlated with the levels of those inflammatory cytokines. Depending on mouse strain, the viral fixation to heparan sulfate/TLR2 stimulated differently the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-B in the induction of IL-6 and TNF-. These results suggest that TLR2 and heparan sulphate receptors can act as new viral PPRs involved in inflammatory responses.","output":"Macrophage interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor- are induced by coronavirus fixation to Toll-like receptor 2/heparan sulphate receptors but not carcinoembryonic cell adhesion antigen 1a"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted health care across the globe.

The level of neutralizing antibodies following the vaccination will evolve with time and vary between individuals. Immunoassays quantifying immunoglobulins against the viral spike (S) protein in serum/plasma have been developed, but the need for venous blood samples could limit the frequency and scale of control in populations. The use of a quantitative dried blood spot (DBS) that can be self-collected would simplify this monitoring. The objective of this study was to determine whether a quantitative DBS device (Capitainer qDBS 10 L) could be used in combination with an Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay from Roche to follow the development and persistence of anti-S antibodies. This objective was carried out through two clinical studies. The first study investigated 14 volunteers who received two doses of the Comirnaty (Pfizer) vaccine. The levels of anti-S antibodies and the progression over time post-vaccination were studied for three months. The level of produced antibodies varied between subjects, but a similar trend was observed. The anti-S antibodies were highly stimulated by the second dose (100) and peaked two weeks later. The antibody levels subsequently decreased and three months later were down to 65%. DBS proved to be sufficiently sensitive for use in evaluating the immune status against SARS-CoV-2 over a prolonged time. The second cohort was composed of 200 random patients from a clinical chemistry department in Stockholm. In this cohort, we had no information on previous COVID-19 infections or vaccination. Nevertheless, 87% of the subjects had anti-S immunoglobulins over 0.8 U/mL, and the bias between plasma and DBS proved to be variable, as was also seen in the first vaccination study.","output":"Use of Quantitative Dried Blood Spots to Evaluate the Post-Vaccination Level of Neutralizing Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to intensifying conflict with the United States and the shock of Covid-19, China reinforced its strategy to expand domestic demand. China's domestic market is an important factor affecting Korea's exports and economic growth. Accordingly, a large body of research has been conducted in Korea on China's expansion policy and changes in its domestic market. However, most studies have analyzed changes in China's consumer market, import market and imported items, limiting the overall understanding of China's domestic economy. In addition, most studies on China's regional domestic market have analyzed the market segmented by region. Recognizing this gap, this study expanded the scope of analysis of the domestic market in China to the entire domestic final demand, and analyzed inter-regional trade relations and other economic relations based on an inter-regional input-output analysis, which has rarely been attempted in analyses of the Chinese domestic market. In addition, the changes in the regional structure of the Chinese import market and Korea's competitiveness were analyzed using Chinese trade statistics. In particular, by synthesizing the changes after the global financial crisis, a turning point in China's economic structure, we project future changes in the regional economic structure of China, which emphasizes the independence of its domestic economy. In addition, in the era of US-China conflict, the study aimed to select regional markets meaningful to Korea, and to present strategic directions toward China focusing on regional cooperation and approaches into the domestic market.","output":"Changes in the Regional Structure of China's Domestic Market and Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The etiology of the majority of human cancers is associated with a myriad of environmental causes, including physical, chemical, and biological factors. DNA damage induced by such mutagens is the initial step in the process of carcinogenesis resulting in the accumulation of mutations. Mutational events are considered the major triggers for introducing genetic and epigenetic insults such as DNA crosslinks, single- and double-strand DNA breaks, formation of DNA adducts, mismatched bases, modification in histones, DNA methylation, and microRNA alterations. However, DNA repair mechanisms are devoted to protect the DNA to ensure genetic stability, any aberrations in these calibrated mechanisms provoke cancer occurrence. Comprehensive knowledge of the type of mutagens and carcinogens and the influence of these agents in DNA damage and cancer induction is crucial to develop rational anticancer strategies. This review delineated the molecular mechanism of DNA damage and the repair pathways to provide a deep understanding of the molecular basis of mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. A relationship between DNA adduct formation and cancer incidence has also been summarized. The mechanistic basis of inflammatory response and oxidative damage triggered by mutagens in tumorigenesis has also been highlighted. We elucidated the interesting interplay between DNA damage response and immune system mechanisms. We addressed the current understanding of DNA repair targeted therapies and DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment and discussed how antiviral agents, anti-inflammatory drugs, and immunotherapeutic agents combined with traditional approaches lay the foundations for future cancer therapies.

The clinical spectrum of infection with SARS-CoV-2 among the most vulnerable extremely premature patient population in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), particularly those with chronic lung disease (CLD), remains unclear. Additionally, post-COVID conditions have been described in children with limited published data among infants. Symptoms in children appear similar to those described in the adults. We report a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 24-week preterm infant with CLD acquired via horizontal transmission while still in the NICU. We also provide follow-up data on patient until one year post-discharge. Our patient developed fever prompting testing for SARS-CoV-2. Although extremely premature infants with CLD are known to be at high risk for morbidities if they acquire respiratory viral infections, infection with SARS-CoV-2 in this case report presented with relatively mild clinical symptoms. He remained clinically stable on respiratory support (nasal cannula) with eventual weaning to room air. Our patient was followed until one year post-discharge (chronological age: 20 months) and had follow-up by various subspecialties for chronic lung disease, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, and poor growth. We did not observe any specific post-COVID symptoms. This case illustrates that horizontal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection among extremely premature infants with CLD is possible in the NICU but likely presents with mild clinical symptoms during acute infection and less chances of post-COVID conditions. Additionally, this case highlights the need for adherence to infection prevention guidelines to prevent nosocomial transmission amid the ongoing pandemic.","output":"Horizontal Transmission of COVID-19 in a 24-Week Premature Infant and Post-discharge Follow-Up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: CoronaVac, an inactivated whole-virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, has been shown to be well tolerated with a good safety profile in individuals aged 18 years and older in phase 1/2 trials, and provided a good humoral response against SARS-CoV-2. We present the interim efficacy and safety results of a phase 3 clinical trial of CoronaVac in Turkey. METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial. Volunteers aged 18C59 years with no history of COVID-19 and with negative PCR and antibody test results for SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled at 24 centres in Turkey. Exclusion criteria included (but were not limited to) immunosuppressive therapy (including steroids) within the past 6 months, bleeding disorders, asplenia, and receipt of any blood products or immunoglobulins within the past 3 months. The K1 cohort consisted of health-care workers (randomised in a 1:1 ratio), and individuals other than health-care workers were also recruited into the K2 cohort (randomised in a 2:1 ratio) using an interactive web response system. The study vaccine was 3 g inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virion adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide in a 05 mL aqueous suspension. Participants received either vaccine or placebo (consisting of all vaccine components except inactivated virus) intramuscularly on days 0 and 14. The primary efficacy outcome was the prevention of PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 at least 14 days after the second dose in the per protocol population. Safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04582344) and is active but no longer recruiting. FINDINGS: Among 11 303 volunteers screened between Sept 14, 2020, and Jan 5, 2021, 10 218 were randomly allocated. After exclusion of four participants from the vaccine group because of protocol deviations, the intention-to-treat group consisted of 10 214 participants (6646 [651%] in the vaccine group and 3568 [349%] in the placebo group) and the per protocol group consisted of 10 029 participants (6559 [654%] and 3470 [346%]) who received two doses of vaccine or placebo. During a median follow-up period of 43 days (IQR 36C48), nine cases of PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 were reported in the vaccine group (317 cases [146C593] per 1000 person-years) and 32 cases were reported in the placebo group (1923 cases [1357C2611] per 1000 person-years) 14 days or more after the second dose, yielding a vaccine efficacy of 835% (95% CI 654C921; p<00001). The frequencies of any adverse events were 1259 (189%) in the vaccine group and 603 (169%) in the placebo group (p=00108) with no fatalities or grade 4 adverse events. The most common systemic adverse event was fatigue (546 [82%] participants in the vaccine group and 248 [70%] the placebo group, p=00228). Injection-site pain was the most frequent local adverse event (157 [24%] in the vaccine group and 40 [11%] in the placebo group, p<00001).

We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization to clarify their role in COVID-19 risk and specific COVID-19 phenotypes (hospitalized and severe cases). METHOD: We identified genetic instruments for fasting glucose (n = 133,010), 2 h glucose (n = 42,854), glycated hemoglobin (n = 123,665), and type 2 diabetes (74,124 cases and 824,006 controls) from genome wide association studies and applied them to COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative summary statistics (17,965 COVID-19 cases and 1,370,547 population controls). We used inverse variance weighting to obtain the causal estimates of glycemic traits and genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes in COVID-19 risk. Sensitivity analyses included MR-Egger and weighted median method. RESULTS: We found genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes was not associated with any COVID-19 phenotype (OR: 1.00 per unit increase in log odds of having diabetes, 95%CI 0.97 to 1.04 for overall COVID-19; OR: 1.02, 95%CI 0.95 to 1.09 for hospitalized COVID-19; and OR: 1.00, 95%CI 0.93 to 1.08 for severe COVID-19). There were no strong evidence for an association of glycemic traits in COVID-19 phenotypes, apart from a potential inverse association for fasting glucose albeit with wide confidence interval. CONCLUSION: We provide some genetic evidence that poorer glycemic traits and predisposition to type 2 diabetes unlikely increase the risk of COVID-19.

Previous studies have shown that the nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5, also called 3C-like protease) of alpha- and deltacoronaviruses cleaves Q231 of the NF-B essential modulator (NEMO), a key kinase in the RIG-I-like receptor pathway, to inhibit type I interferon (IFN) production. In this study, we found that both SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 and SARS-CoV nsp5 cleaved NEMO at multiple sites (E152, Q205, and Q231). Notably, SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 exhibited a stronger ability to cleave NEMO than SARS-CoV nsp5. Sequence and structural alignments suggested that an S/A polymorphism at position 46 of nsp5 in SARS-CoV versus SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for this difference. Mutagenesis experiments showed that SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 (S46A) exhibited poorer cleavage of NEMO than SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 wild type (WT), while SARS-CoV nsp5 (A46S) showed enhanced NEMO cleavage compared with the WT protein. Purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 WT and SARS-CoV nsp5 (A46S) proteins exhibited higher hydrolysis efficiencies than SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 (S46A) and SARS-CoV nsp5 WT proteins in vitro. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 exhibited stronger inhibition of Sendai virus (SEV)-induced interferon beta (IFN-) production than SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 (S46A), while introduction of the A46S substitution in SARS-CoV nsp5 enhanced suppression of SEV-induced IFN- production. Taken together, these data show that S46 is associated with the catalytic activity and IFN antagonism by SARS-CoV-2 nsp5. IMPORTANCE The nsp5-encoded 3C-like protease is the main coronavirus protease, playing a vital role in viral replication and immune evasion by cleaving viral polyproteins and host immune-related molecules. We showed that both SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 and SARS-CoV nsp5 cleave the NEMO at multiple sites (E152, Q205, and Q231). This specificity differs from NEMO cleavage by alpha- and deltacoronaviruses, demonstrating the distinct substrate recognition of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV nsp5. Compared with SARS-CoV nsp5, SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 encodes S instead of A at position 46. This substitution is associated with stronger catalytic activity, enhanced cleavage of NEMO, and increased interferon antagonism of SARS-CoV-2 nsp5. These data provide new insights into the pathogenesis and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 Exhibits Stronger Catalytic Activity and Interferon Antagonism than Its SARS-CoV Ortholog"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BPS Indonesia reported that the quantity of jobless for the August 2020 period had expanded by 2.67 million people.

For example, APOBEC3G deaminates cytosines to hypermutate reverse transcribed viral DNA; IFITM3 alters membranes to inhibit virus membrane fusion; MXA/B oligomerize on viral protein complexes to inhibit virus replication; SAMHD1 decreases dNTP intracellular concentrations to prevent reverse transcription of retrovirus genomes; tetherin prevents release of budding virions from cells; Viperin catalyzes formation of a nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral RNA polymerases; and ZAP binds virus RNAs to target them for degradation. We also discuss countermeasures employed by specific viruses against these restriction factors, and mention secondary functions of several of these factors in modulating immune responses. These important examples highlight the diverse strategies cells have evolved to combat virus infections.","output":"From APOBEC to ZAP: Diverse mechanisms used by cellular restriction factors to inhibit virus infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Co-authored by a Computer Scientist and a Digital Humanist, this article examines the challenges faced by cultural heritage institutions in the digital age, which have led to the closure of the vast majority of born-digital archival collections. It focuses particularly on cultural organizations such as libraries, museums and archives, used by historians, literary scholars and other Humanities scholars. Most born-digital records held by cultural organizations are inaccessible due to privacy, copyright, commercial and technical issues. Even when born-digital data are publicly available (as in the case of web archives), users often need to physically travel to repositories such as the British Library or the Bibliothque Nationale de France to consult web pages. Provided with enough sample data from which to learn and train their models, AI, and more specifically machine learning algorithms, offer the opportunity to improve and ease the access to digital archives by learning to perform complex human tasks. These vary from providing intelligent support for searching the archives to automate tedious and time-consuming tasks. In this article, we focus on sensitivity review as a practical solution to unlock digital archives that would allow archival institutions to make non-sensitive information available. This promise to make archives more accessible does not come free of warnings for potential pitfalls and risks: inherent errors, \\"black box\\" approaches that make the algorithm inscrutable, and risks related to bias, fake, or partial information. Our central argument is that AI can deliver its promise to make digital archival collections more accessible, but it also creates new challenges - particularly in terms of ethics. In the conclusion, we insist on the importance of fairness, accountability and transparency in the process of making digital archives more accessible.","output":"Unlocking digital archives: cross-disciplinary perspectives on AI and born-digital data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In 2017, an academic health sciences library in Utah developed a multimedia studio for students, faculty, and academic staff. Educational projects needing video, audio, and lecture capture could utilize a one-button studio for recording video sessions, microphones for audio, and various screen capture software for lectures. Since the pandemic, this service has seen rapid growth due to academic lectures going exclusively online. In response, the library launched a dedicated podcasting suite to accommodate the increase in students and faculty needing to record lectures or podcasts for others in the medical profession. DESCRIPTION: This article will outline the process of creating the podcasting suite and provide equipment rosters and methods other libraries may consider for establishing their own studio. Administrating duties of the studio will also be included, such as handling reservations and user assessment. An instructional guide for users is also included to assist patrons in accomplishing their podcast creations. CONCLUSION: Podcasts created in the space range from topics about teaching strategies in medicine to diagnoses and treatments of skin disorders. A podcasting suite is another way libraries can provide valuable services for asynchronous learning and student projects. Students, staff, and faculty have appreciated the ease of the service and the support behind it.

The clinical and research capacity across the USA is unparalleled, yet compared to other high and even some middle-income countries, the average health indicators of the population remain suboptimal in 2020, a finding at least in part explained by inequity in healthcare access. In this context, COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a major threat to the public's health. While it was initially thought that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 would be the great equaliser as it would not discriminate, it is clear that COVID-19 incidence and mortality have rapidly reinforced health disparities drawn by historical and contemporary inequities. Here, we synthesise the data highlighting specific risks among particular marginalised and under-resourced communities including those in jails, prisons and detention centers, immigrants and the undocumented, people with disabilities and people experiencing homelessness across the USA. The drivers of these disparities are pervasive structural risks including limited access to preventive services, inability to comply with physical distancing recommendations, underlying health disparities and intersecting stigmas particularly affecting racial and ethnic minorities across the country, including African Americans, Latinx Americans and Native Americans. Advancing the COVID-19 response, saving lives and restarting the economy necessitate rapidly addressing these inequities rather than ignoring and even reinforcing them.","output":"COVID-19 and the US response: accelerating health inequities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Young people who are placed in out-of-home care are amongst the most vulnerable in our community. Removed from or rejected by their families, they must learn to live with carers who may be strangers. They may have experienced the trauma of abuse or neglect. Post care, they may experience further social isolation and marginalisation due to limited social capital. These challenges are compounded for queer young people placed in out-of-home care. This study adopted a case study approach to explore the lived experience of two young adults growing up queer in and out of out-of-home care in Australia. Our investigation was framed by two complementary theoretical frameworks. The first, a model of minority stress, is informed by queer perspectives and enabled an exploration into the adverse impact of enduring stigma and prejudice associated with homophobia and transphobia on young peoples capacity to thrive. The model of social capital was then employed to inform an analysis of relationships between queer young people in out-of-home care and trustworthy adults. The findings suggest that queer young people growing up in out-of-home care experience minoritised stress, with lasting negative implications. The presence however, of trustworthy adults who challenge dominant heteronormative assumptions and work to support queer young people can be experienced as stabilising and restorative.","output":"Minority Stress for Care Experienced Young Queer People: A Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergence of novel variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) underscores the need for next-generation vaccines able to elicit broad and durable immunity. Here we report the evaluation of a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine displaying the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RFN) adjuvanted with Army Liposomal Formulation QS-21 (ALFQ). RFN vaccination of macaques using a two-dose regimen resulted in robust, predominantly Th1 CD4+ T cell responses and reciprocal peak mean neutralizing antibody titers of 14,000-21,000. Rapid control of viral replication was achieved in the upper and lower airways of animals after high-dose SARS-CoV-2 respiratory challenge, with undetectable replication within four days in 7 of 8 animals receiving 50 g RFN. Cross-neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 decreased only 2-fold relative to USA-WA1. In addition, neutralizing, effector antibody and cellular responses targeted the heterotypic SARS-CoV-1, highlighting the broad immunogenicity of RFN-ALFQ for SARS-like betacoronavirus vaccine development. Significance Statement The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) that reduce the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines is a major threat to pandemic control. We evaluate a SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain ferritin nanoparticle protein vaccine (RFN) in a nonhuman primate challenge model that addresses the need for a next-generation, efficacious vaccine with increased pan-SARS breadth of coverage. RFN, adjuvanted with a liposomal-QS21 formulation (ALFQ), elicits humoral and cellular immune responses exceeding those of current vaccines in terms of breadth and potency and protects against high-dose respiratory tract challenge. Neutralization activity against the B.1.351 VOC within two-fold of wild-type virus and against SARS-CoV-1 indicate exceptional breadth.

METHODSWe evaluated iron metabolism and immune response in 303 patients admitted to the main hospital of the northern region of Portugal with variable clinical pictures, from September to November 2020. Of these, 127 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 176 tested negative. Iron-related laboratory parameters and cytokines were determined in blood samples collected soon after admission and, in a subgroup of patients, throughout hospitalization. Demographic data, comorbidities and clinical outcomes were recorded. Patients were assigned into 5 groups according to disease severity. RESULTSSerum iron and transferrin levels at admission were lower in COVID-19-positive than in COVID-19-negative patients. Conversely, the levels of interleukin(IL)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) were increased in COVID-19-positive patients. The lowest serum iron and transferrin levels at diagnosis were associated with the worst outcomes. Iron levels negatively correlated with IL-6 and higher levels of this cytokine were associated with a worse prognosis. Serum ferritin levels at diagnosis were higher in COVID-19-positive than in COVID-19-negative patients but did not correlate with disease severity. Longitudinal determinations of iron and ferritin made in a subgroup of patients (n=23) revealed highly variable results. CONCLUSIONSSerum iron is the simplest laboratory test to be implemented as a predictor of disease progression in hospitalized acute COVID-19-positive patients. Variation of ferritin with time should be revisited in larger cohorts. Key pointsCOVID-19-positive patients have lower serum iron and higher ferritin than COVID-19-negative patients in variable clinical contexts. Lowest serum iron and highest IL-6 levels at hospital admission associate with the poorest outcomes.

A clinical case is used to illustrate how information from this article can be applied. Characteristics of ME/CFS that make addressing suicidality challenging include absence of any disease-modifying treatments, severe functional limitations, and symptoms which limit therapies. Decades-long misattribution of ME/CFS to physical deconditioning or psychiatric disorders have resulted in undereducated healthcare professionals, public stigma, and unsupportive social interactions. Consequently, some patients may be reluctant to engage with mental health care. Outpatient medical professionals play a vital role in mitigating these effects. By combining evidence-based interventions aimed at all suicidal patients with those adapted to individual patients' circumstances, suffering and suicidality can be alleviated in ME/CFS.

METHODS: Data on 2329 patients who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital were scanned. The clinical, laboratory and radiological findings relating to treatment of 154 patients who required neurological consultation were retrospectively evaluated by reviewing the clinical notes. RESULTS: The number of COVID-19 pneumonia patients who required neurological consultations while hospitalized in the ICU was 94 (61.0%). The most common symptom among these patients was hyperactive delirium. Mean age, ferritin levels and CRP values a??a??of those with delirium were higher, while the mean lymphocyte percentage were lower, than those of the patients without delirium.

NMD plays an important role in cell cycle regulation, cell viability, DNA damage response, while also serving as a barrier to virus infection. Disturbance of this control mechanism caused by genetic mutations or dys-regulation of the NMD pathway can lead to pathologies, including neurological disorders, immune diseases and cancers. The role of NMD in cancer development is complex, acting as both a promoter and a barrier to tumour progression. Cancer cells can exploit NMD for the downregulation of key tumour suppressor genes, or tumours adjust NMD activity to adapt to an aggressive immune microenvironment. The latter case might provide an avenue for therapeutic intervention as NMD inhibition has been shown to lead to the production of neoantigens that stimulate an immune system attack on tumours. For this reason, understanding the biology and co-option pathways of NMD is important for the development of novel therapeutic agents. Inhibitors, whose design can make use of the many structures available for NMD study, will play a crucial role in characterizing and providing diverse therapeutic options for this pathway in cancer and other diseases.","output":"Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay: Pathologies and the Potential for Novel Therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A mask is a simple device yet it provides high levels of protection As the virus affects mainly the respiratory tract - the nose, mouth, and lungs - it is highly contagious when people sneeze or cough, or exchange respiratory droplets with other people This exchange is also promoted when a person is performing physical exercise Although a mask provides some protection, it does not eliminate the need for social distancing Around 25% of people infected with the new coronavirus may show no symptoms, yet still transmit the virus One of the main problems with wearing a mask is that it hinders breathing, with the mask gradually becoming damp, increasing its resistance to air intake Wearing a mask while performing physical activity requires a period of adaptation, as the flow of air to the lungs is reduced, requiring a reduction in the normal rhythm until the wearer has managed to adapt to it Vigorous and intense exercise can cause inflammatory activity to increase, and should be minimized in order to protect the immune system Secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) is an antibody protein used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens, including viruses, and decreases with intense exercise Exercise is considered intense when it is necessary to breathe through the mouth to eliminate the higher concentrations of CO2, but mouth breathing is associated with infections of the upper respiratory tract Preference should be given to light to moderate exercise, around three times a week Wearing a mask, and training in nasal breathing are the best and safest ways to reduce the entry of particles, and should be encouraged during this COVID-19 pandemic","output":"During the Coronavirus (covid-19) Pandemic, Does Wearing a Mask Improve or Worsen Physical Performance?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diarrhea in piglets directly affects commercial swine production.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a mixed-methods study which includes a web-based or phone survey and in-depth phone interviews with patients who had telemedicine visits for contraception. RESULTS: A total of 169 patients had eligible telemedicine visits between April 1 and June 30, 2020. Of these, 86 (51%) responded to the survey, and 23 (14%) participated in the interviews. We found that 86% of survey respondents were very satisfied with the telemedicine visit, and 63% said it completely met their needs. A majority (73%) strongly agreed that these visits should be maintained after the COVID-19 pandemic, and half (51%) would be very likely to choose them over in-person visits. In-depth interviews highlighted the convenience of telemedicine, especially for those with work or parenting responsibilities. Although some patients had in-person visits after telehealth, many appreciated the counseling they received remotely, and found the subsequent in-person visits more efficient.

Therefore, we developed an in vitro airway epithelial-endothelial cell culture model based on Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells and human lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVECs), cultured on opposite sides of flexible porous poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) membranes. Calu-3 cells, cultured for two weeks at an air-liquid interface (ALI), showed good expression of the tight junction (TJ) protein Zonula Occludens 1 (ZO-1). LMVECs cultured submerged for three weeks were CD31-positive, but the expression was diffuse and not localized at the cell membrane. Barrier functions of the Calu-3 cell cultures and the co-cultures with LMVECs were good, as determined by electrical resistance measurements and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran) permeability assays. Importantly, the Calu-3/LMVEC co-cultures showed better cell viability and barrier function than mono-cultures. Moreover, there was no evidence for epithelial- and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT and EndoMT, respectively) based on staining for the mesenchymal markers vimentin and &#945;-SMA, respectively. These results indicate the potential of this new airway epithelial-endothelial model for lung research. In addition, since the PTMC membrane is flexible, the model can be expanded by introducing cyclic stretch for enabling mechanical stimulation of the cells. Furthermore, the model can form the basis for biomimetic airway epithelial-endothelial and alveolar-endothelial models with primary lung epithelial cells.","output":"Development of an In Vitro Airway Epithelial-Endothelial Cell Culture Model on a Flexible Porous Poly(Trimethylene Carbonate) Membrane Based on Calu-3 Airway Epithelial Cells and Lung Microvascular Endothelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wearing surgical masks is one of the best protective measures to protect humans from viral invasion during the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at examining the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic-associated regulations initiated by the German government on pain intensity and characteristics, emotional well-being, and everyday life of patients with painful polyneuropathy. METHODS: Forty-three patients (well assessed with questionnaires before the pandemic and without change of their health status between baseline and current assessment) were investigated with validated, self-reported questionnaires and COVID-19-specific items 2 weeks after the regulations came into effect. RESULTS: Pain intensity remained stable or even improved like the neuropathic pain symptom inventory total score (t0: 33.54  20.48 vs t1: 27.38  16.16, P = 0.008). Only 11.6% reported a pandemic-associated pain worsening. Rumination scores of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale were lower during t1 compared to before the pandemic regulations (t0: 7.81  4.70, t1: 6.49  4.39; P = 0.030). Interestingly, pain ratings for the last 7 days were higher in patients with a changed social life compared to those without (?1.63  1.60 vs 0.31  1.83; P = 0.01). Quality of life was decreased and helplessness increased in those with higher pain ratings. CONCLUSION: Results suggest a shift of attention from the chronic pain condition towards the imminent threat of a global pandemic. As the impacts of the pandemic are persistent and evolving, the development of the measured parameters in the forthcoming weeks will be of great interest.","output":"The early influence of COVID-19 pandemic-associated restrictions on pain, mood, and everyday life of patients with painful polyneuropathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Security of Virtual Machines (VMs) is a major concern with the virtualization environment. Virtual machines are a primary target for an adversary to acquire unethical access to the organizations virtual infrastructure.

Process or code injection is one such technique to evade the detection of malware. Various process injection techniques are employed by malware to gain more stealth and to bypass security products. Detection of process injection attack is achieved with little effort on a physical machine as compared to a virtual machine.

BACKGROUND Breastfeeding benefits mothers, infants and society yet breastfeeding rates continue to fall below recommendations in part due to inadequate tailored support after hospital discharge. Influences on breastfeeding are complex and include many physiological, psychosocial and cultural factors. AIM To better understand the experience of women who have feelings of aversion during breastfeeding by synthesising the existing literature. METHODS MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Maternity and Infant Care databases were searched for relevant literature published between 2000 to 2019. Using Covidence software, five qualitative research studies were identified. Studies were then analysed using meta-ethnographic qualitative synthesis. FINDINGS Feelings of aversion during breastfeeding were described as visceral and overwhelming; leading to feelings of shame and inadequacy. This synthesis identified five findings; a central conceptual category of \\"it's such a strong feeling of get away from me\\" with four key metaphors translated from this central conceptual category: \\"I do it because I feel it is best for my baby\\", \\"I can't control those feelings\\", \\"I should be able to breastfeed my son and enjoy it\\", and \\"I'm glad I did it\\". This phenomenon may negatively affect a women's sense of self and impact on the mother-infant relationship. CONCLUSION Some women who want to breastfeed can experience feelings of aversion while breastfeeding. The feelings of 'aversion' while breastfeeding can inhibit women from achieving their personal breastfeeding goals.","output":"Women who experience feelings of aversion while breastfeeding: A meta-ethnographic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV-2)-associated disease occurred in the southwestern United States following its first detection in New Mexico in March 2020.

In this study, we investigated the regulation of CMTM3 expression, function, and molecular mechanism in HFSCs. The re-expression of CMTM3 significantly suppressed the proliferation of HFSCs by inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis. Moreover, the downregulation of CMTM3 promoted HFSC proliferation. Treatment with sh_CMTM3 and incubation in a DHT culture medium had the most significant growth-promoting effect. It was hypothesized that transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in samples would enable the identification of unique protein-coding and non-coding genes that may help uncover the role of CMTM3. Multiple genes and pathways were involved in this process, including 168 common DEGs, such as CXCL8 and E-selectin, which is reportedly involved in multiple regulatory pathways. These results indicated that CMTM3 can function as HFSCs through the induction of a G1 cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis by mediating crosstalk between several pathways and transcription factors.

It compares English prescribing data in April C June 2019, the year before COVID19, and AprilCJune 2020, the first three months of lockdown. DESIGN & SETTING: This paper is based on retrospective analysis of the English Prescribing Dataset which reports monthly on prescribed items from English General Practices. Data on all forms of prescribed contraceptive methods were extracted using BNF codes, and total quantities tabulated by method. To reach the total number of months of contraception provided, total quantities were divided or multiplied according the frequency with which the method is taken per month or the numbers of months of contraception provided. RESULTS: Prescription of the combined oral contraceptive pill reduced by 22% during the period of lockdown compared to the same three months in 2019. Prescriptions of Progestogen-Only pills remained stable. Prescription of long-acting methods reduced, with the greatest reductions in implants (76% reduction from pre-lockdown levels), intra-uterine systems (79% reduction from pre-lockdown levels) and intrauterine devices (76% reduction from pre-lockdown levels). CONCLUSIONS: The disruption of face-to-face contraceptive consultations in General Practice during a COVID-19 lockdown has resulted in a reduction in oestrogen Ccontaining methods compared to progestogen-only methods, which require less face-to-face monitoring. Implant and intrauterine contraceptive device prescription reduced by three quarters over the first three months of lockdown, which has the potential to result in a rise in unintended pregnancies.","output":"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on contraceptive prescribing in general practice: a retrospective analysis of English prescribing data between 2019 and 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Introduccin: La pandemia por la COVID-19 ha causado ms 350 000 muertes a nivel mundial Objetivo: Caracterizar clnicamente a las pacientes obsttricas con sospecha de la COVID-19 Mtodos: Se realiz un estudio retrospectivo, descriptivo, de corte transversal Fueron incluidas todas las pacientes obsttricas que ingresaron en el Hospital Militar Central \\"Dr Luis Daz Soto\\", entre el 12 de marzo y 20 de mayo de 2020 Se dividieron en dos grupos;en el I se incluyeron las que presentaron el PCR en tiempo real para SARS-CoV-2 negativo y en el grupo II, las que resultaron positivas Las variables analizadas fueron la edad, antecedentes obsttricos, antecedentes patolgicos personales, historia epidemiolgica, cuadro clnico, complicaciones, ingreso en la unidad de terapia intensiva y mortalidad materna Resultados: Ingresaron 60 pacientes obsttricas y 6 (10 %) resultaron positivas al SARS-CoV-2, de las provincias La Habana, Mayabeque y Artemisa La edad promedio fue de 25 a?os Se encontraban en el primer trimestre del embarazo el 25,9 % del grupo I y el 66,6 % del grupo II Present comorbilidad el 38,8 % y 16,6 %, del grupo I y grupo II respectivamente Se encontraban asintomticas 50 % de las positivas Se observ leucopenia en 10 (18,5 %) del grupo I y en 5 (83,3 %) del grupo II Se present un aborto espontneo en el grupo II No hubo neumona por la COVID-19, ni muertes maternas Conclusiones: La COVID -19 se present con mayor frecuencia en las gestantes durante el primer trimestre, predomin la forma leve de la enfermedad, no existi neumona por la COVID-19 ni muertes ABSTRACT Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 350,000 deaths worldwide Objective: To clinically characterize obstetric patients with suspected COVID-19 Methods: A retrospective, descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed All obstetric patients admitted to the Hospital Militar Central \\"Dr Luis Daz Soto\\" between March 12 and May 20, 2020 They were divided into two groups;Group I included those with negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and group II with positive results The variables analyzed were age, obstetric history, personal pathological history, epidemiological history, clinical picture, complications, admission to the intensive care unit and maternal mortality Results: 60 obstetric patients were admitted and 6 (10%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, from the provinces of Havana, Mayabeque and Artemisa The average age was 25 years 25 9% of group I and 66 6% of group II were in the 1st trimester of pregnancy 38 8% and 16 6%, of group I and group II, respectively, presented comorbidity 50% of the positives were asymptomatic Leukopenia was observed in 10 (18 5%) cases in group I and in 5 (83 3%) in group II Spontaneous abortion occurred in group II There was no COVID-19 pneumonia, nor maternal death Conclusions: COVID-19 occurred more frequently in pregnant women during the first trimester, the mild form of the disease prevailed, with no COVID-19 pneumonia or deaths from this disease","output":"Clinical characterization of obstetric patients with suspected COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (AstraZeneca) causes a thromboembolic complication termed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).

Super-resolution microscopy visualized vaccine components forming antigenic complexes with platelet factor 4 (PF4) on platelet surfaces to which anti-PF4 antibodies obtained from VITT patients bound. PF4/vaccine complex formation was charge-driven and increased by addition of DNA. Proteomics identified substantial amounts of virus production-derived T-REx HEK293 proteins in the EDTA-containing vaccine. Injected vaccine increased vascular leakage in mice leading to systemic dissemination of vaccine components known to stimulate immune responses. Together, PF4/vaccine complex formation and the vaccine-stimulated proinflammatory milieu trigger a pronounced B cell response that results in the formation of high-avidity anti-PF4 antibodies in VITT patients. The resulting high-titer anti-PF4 antibodies potently activated platelets in the presence of PF4 or DNA and polyphosphate polyanions. Anti-PF4 VITT patient antibodies also stimulated neutrophils to release NETs in a platelet PF4-dependent manner. Biomarkers of procoagulant NETs were elevated in VITT patient serum, and NETs were visualized in abundance by immunohistochemistry in cerebral vein thrombi obtained from VITT patients.

The aim of the present study was to investigate its prevalence and prognosis in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study on 200 mechanically ventilated ARF patients treated in a tertiary ICU. The presence of pendelluft was determined using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) within 48 h after admission. Its amplitude was defined as the impedance difference between the sum of all regional tidal impedance variation and the global tidal impedance variation. A value above 2.5% (the 95th percentile from 30 healthy volunteers) was considered confirmative for its occurrence. RESULTS: Pendelluft was found in 61 patients (39 in 94 patients with spontaneous breathing, 22 in 106 receiving controlled ventilation), with an overall prevalence of 31%. Existence of spontaneous breathing and higher global inhomogeneity index were associated with pendelluft. Patients with pendelluft had a longer ICU length of stay [10 (6, 14) vs. 7 (4, 11) days; median (lower, upper quartile); p = 0.022] and shorter 14-day ventilator-free days [8 (1, 10) vs. 10 (6, 12) days; p = 0.015]. Subgroup survival analysis suggested the association between pendelluft and longer ventilation duration, which was significant only in patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio below 200 mmHg (log-rank p = 0.042). ICU mortality did not differ between the patients with and without pendelluft. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory pendelluft occurred often in our study group and it was associated with longer ventilation duration.

Adults aged 70 years or older who were admitted or transferred to medical or surgical services as either emergency or elective admissions were enrolled between October 20, 2015, and March 15, 2017, and were monitored for 1 year. Data analysis was performed from June 2020 to August 2021. EXPOSURES: Delirium severity, measured by scores on the delirium severity score short-form (SF; 6 items, scored 0-13, with higher scores indicating more severe delirium) and long-form (LF; 17 items, scored 0-21), considered continuously and grouped into 5 categories. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were in-hospital outcomes, including length of stay and hospital costs, and posthospital (30, 90, and 365 days) outcomes, including death, health care costs, and rehospitalization. RESULTS: The 352 participants had a median (IQR) age of 79.7 (74.6-85.5) years, 204 (58.0%) were women, and they were highly educated (median [IQR] duration of education, 14 [7-20] years). Patients in the highest delirium severity score SF group (scores 6-9) had a longer length of stay (13.3 vs 6.9 days; P for trend < .001), greater in-hospital costs ($57 700 vs $34 200), greater cumulative health care costs ($168 700 vs $106 500; P for trend = .01), and increased mortality at 1 year (50% vs 17%; P for trend = .02) compared with patients in the lowest delirium severity score SF group (score 0). Similar trends and significant findings were demonstrated for the delirium severity score LF. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that the delirium severity score provides an approach for measuring delirium severity that is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in a direct exposure-response association and that the delirium severity score may help advance patient-centered care for delirium.","output":"Psychometric Properties of a Delirium Severity Score for Older Adults and Association With Hospital and Posthospital Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1.

The study objective is to determine the effectiveness and safety of prasugrel and ticagrelor in kidney failure. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS This retrospective cohort study used United States Renal Data System data from 2012 to 2015. We identified all patients on dialysis who received a drug-eluting stent and were alive at 90 days after stent implantation. Inverse probability-weighted Cox proportional hazard models were used. Weights were estimated with propensity scores for multiple treatments. RESULTS This cohort included 6648 patients on clopidogrel, 621 on prasugrel, and 449 on ticagrelor. A total of 3279 primary composite (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) and 2120 clinically relevant bleeding events were observed. The incidence of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 12 months was similar across the three treatment groups. The absolute event rate in the unweighted cohort was 144 events per 100 patient-years for clopidogrel, 126 for prasugrel, and 161 for ticagrelor. For prasugrel versus clopidogrel, the weighted hazard ratio was 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.11; P=0.58). For ticagrelor versus clopidogrel, the hazard ratio was 1.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.20; P=0.98). A numerically higher incidence of clinically relevant bleeding was seen with prasugrel or ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel (weighted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.38 and weighted hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.40, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Prasugrel or ticagrelor does not seem to be associated with significant benefits compared with clopidogrel in patients with kidney failure treated with drug-eluting stents.

It was found that a protein recovery of about 30% could be achieved. Increases in pH (pH 10.5, 11, and 11.5) not only improved protein recovery, but also increased protein denaturation evidenced by decreased solubility, decreased &#945;-helix, increased ?-sheet, and increased random coil. The color and texture of gels made from protein isolate were greatly affected by the pH values used for protein extraction. For the gels made from fillet mince, and protein isolates extracted at pH 10.5, 11, and 11.5, the \\"L\\" values were 78.96, 60.38, 57.74, and 54.39, the breaking forces were 205, 492, 585, and 458 g, and deformation values were 10.59, 8.07, 6.73, and 5.04 mm, respectively. Electrophoresis revealed protein degradation during alkali-aided extraction with MHC, the most predominant band, showing about 50% decrease in comparison with fillet mince. It also demonstrated that gelation not only caused cross-linking, but also autolysis with 53%, 56%, 59%, and 81% decrease in MHC intensity for fillet mince, protein isolates extracted at pH 10.5, 11, and 11.5, respectively. Fillet mince and protein isolates exhibited different storage modulus patterns during temperature sweep, implying different gelation mechanisms. This study proved the protein extracted from catfish byproducts was potential to be utilized as edible food components especially in gel making. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Catfish byproducts, which account for 70% of total weight and 50% of total protein of catfish, are normally used as animal feed, fertilizer, or even waste. This study demonstrated the potential of the utilization of catfish wastes to develop edible food components. This could reduce the total processing waste being discarded into the environment and nutrient loss, therefore increasing profitability of catfish industry.","output":"Protein extraction from catfish byproducts and physicochemical properties of the protein isolates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Face coverings are recommended to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Guidelines regarding face mask use have evolved from the time when COVID-19 first emerged. Practices for face mask use in the United States vary widely. METHODS: Clinical and nonclinical staff from a pediatric health care system were invited to complete a survey regarding perceptions and practices of face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall results were analyzed, and subgroup analyses were conducted to compare clinical and nonclinical staff, and clinical staff who do and do not provide direct patient care. RESULTS: The response rate was approximately 24% (1,128 of 4,698). Most respondents were clinical staff who provide patient care. A surgical/procedure mask was most often worn for patient care by 72% (P < .001). Most respondents (70%) reported wearing a cloth mask when not in the hospital (P < .001). Cloth masks were worn for a mean of 3.4  3.9 d before washing. Frequent hand hygiene before putting on the mask, before removing, and after removing was reported as 56%, 44%, and 62%, respectively. The most common challenges reported were glasses fogging (69%), skin irritations (45%), and headaches (31%). Qualitative data revealed themes of feeling unsafe, beliefs and practices about COVID-19 and masks, mandates and enforcement of wearing masks, availability of personal protective equipment, and care delivery challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Practices and perceptions of face masks varied among staff in a pediatric health care system. Some staff did not feel that masks are effective in preventing virus spread, and others did not feel safe in performing job duties. Hand hygiene for mask handling was not practiced consistently. A large number of staff reported having experienced challenges or health issues when wearing a mask.

This study examines pandemic-related physical and mental health and (compensatory) behavioral changes, in patients with BD as compared to healthy control individuals. Method: Physical and mental health and self-reported changes in daily structure and behavior due to the pandemic were assessed using a self-constructed questionnaire and the brief symptom inventory (BSI) in Germany, Austria, and Denmark in individuals with BD and a healthy control group. Results: The present study included 118 individuals with BD and 215 healthy controls. Individuals with BD reported statistically significant higher physical risk burden, increased weight gain, more physical comorbidities, and a decrease in physical activity and they further reported higher rates of COVID-19 testing, had more worries concerning health, and experienced more anxiety but less social distancing. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have a greater impact on physical health in individuals with BD than in healthy controls. Individuals with BD appear to be having more difficulties compensating their behavior due to the pandemic which could amplify the effect of risk factors associated with poorer physical health. This highlights the necessity for optimizing and targeting the overall treatment of both mental and physical health in patients with BD during periods with far-reaching changes such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Robustness of the results was tested by one-way and multiway as well as probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Treatment with either neuraminidase inhibitor results in reduced morbidity and faster return to normal activities. However, oseltamivir dominates zanamivir in cost-utility analysis due to its lower costs. Comparing oseltamivir with usual care, the costs are 14.36 per day of normal activity gained and 5,600 per quality-adjusted life-year gained from the healthcare payer perspective.

The sepsis machine learning algorithm NAVOY? Sepsis, based on variables routinely collected at intensive care units (ICUs), has shown excellent predictive properties. However, the economic consequences of forecasting the onset of sepsis are unknown. Objectives: The potential cost and cost-effectiveness impact of a machine learning algorithm forecasting the onset of sepsis was estimated in an ICU setting. Methods: A health economic model has been developed to capture short-term and long-term consequences of sepsis. The model is based on findings from a randomized, prospective clinical evaluation of NAVOY? Sepsis and from literature sources. Modeling the relationship between time from sepsis onset to treatment and prevalence of septic shock and in-hospital mortality were of particular interest. The model base case assumes that the time to treatment coincides with the time to detection and that the algorithm predicts sepsis 3 hours prior to onset. Total costs include the costs of the prediction algorithm, days spent at the ICU and hospital ward, and long-term consequences. Costs are estimated for an average patient admitted to the ICU and for the healthcare system. The reference method is sepsis diagnosis in accordance with clinical practice. Results: In Sweden, the total cost per patient amounts to 16 436 and 16 512 for the algorithm and current practice arms, respectively, implying a potential cost saving per patient of 76. The largest cost saving is for the ICU stay, which is reduced by 0.16 days per patient (5860 ICU days for the healthcare sector) resulting in a cost saving of 1009 per ICU patient. Stochastic scenario analysis showed that NAVOY? Sepsis was a dominant treatment option in most scenarios and well below an established threshold of 20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. A 3-hour faster detection implies a reduction in in-hospital mortality, resulting in 356 lives saved per year. Conclusions: A sepsis prediction algorithm such as NAVOY? Sepsis reduces the cost per ICU patient and will potentially have a substantial cost-saving and life-saving impact for ICU departments and the healthcare system.","output":"The Potential Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Impact of Using a Machine Learning Algorithm for Early Detection of Sepsis in Intensive Care Units in Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract There has been a progressive interest on the modifications of the human defense system following insults occurring in the interface between our body and the external environment, as they may provoke or worsen disease states.

The microbiota of the skin, respiratory and urinary tracts may also be relevant in rheumatology. Evidence indicates that changes in the gut microbiome alter the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis but also of other disorders like atherosclerosis and osteoarthritis. Therapeutic strategies to modify the microbiota, including probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation, have been received with skepticism, which, in turn, has drawn attention back to previously developed interventions such as antibiotics.

PARTICIPANTS: Newly diagnosed was defined as a recorded International Classification of Primary Care code for PAD, a PAD-specific WCIA examination code or a diagnosis recorded as free text episode in the general practitioner records with no previous PAD diagnosis record and no prescription of P2Y12 inhibitors or aspirin the preceding year. The patient journey was defined by at least 1 year of database history and follow-up relative to the index date. RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2014, we identified 3677 newly diagnosed patients with PAD. Most patients (91%) were diagnosed in primary care. Almost half of all patients (49%) had no APT dispensing record. Within this group, 33% received other anticoagulant therapy (vitamin K antagonist or direct oral anticoagulant). Mono-APT was dispensed as aspirin (40% of patients) or P2Y12 inhibitors (2.5% of patients). Dual APT combining aspirin with a P2Y12 inhibitor was dispensed to 8.5% of the study population. CONCLUSION: Half of all patients with newly diagnosed PAD are not treated conforming to (international) guideline recommendations on thromboembolism prevention through APT. At least 33% of all patients with newly diagnosed PAD do not receive any antithrombotic therapy. Evaluation and improvement of APT prescription and thereby improved prevention of (secondary) cardiovascular events is warranted.","output":"Platelet aggregation inhibitor prescription for newly diagnosed peripheral arterial disease in the Netherlands: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Pediatric tuberculosis (TB) is an indicator of the recent transmission of TB in the community. However, the diagnosis of pediatric TB poses a challenge to clinicians. Aims: We aimed to evaluate and compare the clinical and laboratory profile of pulmonary TB (PTB) and extra PTB (EPTB) in children and adolescents. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, children attending the pediatric TB clinic of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, from August 2015 to July 2017 were included in the study. The medical case records of patients were reviewed for demography, clinical findings, investigations, and diagnosis. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with PTB and EPTB were compared. Results: A total of 58 children included. Out of which, 33 (56.9%) had PTB, and 25 (43.1%) had EPTB. The EPTB cases included 15 (60%) pleural TB, 9 (36%) lymph node TB, and 1 (4%) TB meningitis patient. Fever, cough, and weight loss were the most common symptoms. Hilar lymphadenopathy was the most common radiological abnormality. Microbiological confirmation was possible in 54.5% of patients with PTB. Cough (aOR 70.326; 95% CI: 5.370-921.032) and microbiological confirmation (aOR 46.011; 95% CI: 2.073-1021.201) were more in PTB as compared to EPTB. Conclusions: PTB and EPTB are common in children and adolescents. The typical clinical manifestations and positive microbiological confirmation are less common in EPTB than PTB. Relevance for patients: TB is one of the common communicable diseases in the developing world. Diagnosis of TB in children is often challenging. Our study results help in better understanding childhood TB and EPTB clinical features and have potential to increase diagnostic yield.","output":"Comparison of clinical and laboratory profile of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis in children: A single-center experience from India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: In the spring of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the question arose at Hannover Medical School as to how simulated patients (SP) could still be utilized in the communication course that is part of the module Diagnostic methods taught in the second year of the model medical curriculum known as HannibaL.

We found that amphipol delivery of S2-E to pre-formed planar bilayers results in spontaneous membrane integration and formation of viroporin cation channels. Amphipol delivery of the S2-E protein to human cells results in plasma membrane integration, followed by retrograde trafficking to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and accumulation in swollen perinuclear LAMP1-positive vesicles, likely lysosomes. Coronavirus envelope proteins have previously been proposed to manipulate the luminal pH of the TGN, which serves as an accumulation station for progeny coronavirus particles prior to cellular egress via lysosomes.

Although nonpharmaceutical interventions were implemented by federal and state governments in the United States, these efforts have failed to contain the virus. Following the Food and Drug Administration's approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, however, the hope for the return to normalcy has been renewed. This hope rests on an unprecedented nationwide vaccine campaign, which faces many logistical challenges and is also contingent on several factors whose values are currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: We study the effectiveness of a nationwide vaccine campaign in response to different vaccine efficacies, the willingness of the population to be vaccinated, and the daily vaccine capacity under two different federal plans. To characterize the possible outcomes most accurately, we also account for the interactions between nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccines through 6 scenarios that capture a range of possible impacts from nonpharmaceutical interventions. METHODS: We used large-scale, cloud-based, agent-based simulations by implementing the vaccination campaign using COVASIM, an open-source agent-based model for COVID-19 that has been used in several peer-reviewed studies and accounts for individual heterogeneity and a multiplicity of contact networks. Several modifications to the parameters and simulation logic were made to better align the model with current evidence. We chose 6 nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios and applied the vaccination intervention following both the plan proposed by Operation Warp Speed (former Trump administration) and the plan of one million vaccines per day, proposed by the Biden administration. We accounted for unknowns in vaccine efficacies and levels of population compliance by varying both parameters. For each experiment, the cumulative infection growth was fitted to a logistic growth model, and the carrying capacities and the growth rates were recorded. RESULTS: For both vaccination plans and all nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios, the presence of the vaccine intervention considerably lowers the total number of infections when life returns to normal, even when the population compliance to vaccines is as low as 20%. We noted an unintended consequence; given the vaccine availability estimates under both federal plans and the focus on vaccinating individuals by age categories, a significant reduction in nonpharmaceutical interventions results in a counterintuitive situation in which higher vaccine compliance then leads to more total infections. CONCLUSIONS: Although potent, vaccines alone cannot effectively end the pandemic given the current availability estimates and the adopted vaccination strategy. Nonpharmaceutical interventions need to continue and be enforced to ensure high compliance so that the rate of immunity established by vaccination outpaces that induced by infections.","output":"Returning to a Normal Life via COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States: A Large-scale Agent-Based Simulation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 3 million people and caused more than 240,000 death globally.

We assessed the combination of baricitinib plus remdesivir versus dexamethasone plus remdesivir in preventing progression to mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, double placebo-controlled trial, patients were enrolled at 67 trial sites in the USA (60 sites), South Korea (two sites), Mexico (two sites), Singapore (two sites), and Japan (one site). Hospitalised adults (18 years) with COVID-19 who required supplemental oxygen administered by low-flow (15 L/min), high-flow (>15 L/min), or non-invasive mechanical ventilation modalities who met the study eligibility criteria (male or non-pregnant female adults 18 years old with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection) were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either baricitinib, remdesivir, and placebo, or dexamethasone, remdesivir, and placebo using a permuted block design. Randomisation was stratified by study site and baseline ordinal score at enrolment. All patients received remdesivir (10 days) and either baricitinib (or matching oral placebo) for a maximum of 14 days or dexamethasone (or matching intravenous placebo) for a maximum of 10 days. The primary outcome was the difference in mechanical ventilation-free survival by day 29 between the two treatment groups in the modified intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses were done in the as-treated population, comprising all participants who received one dose of the study drug. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04640168. FINDINGS: Between Dec 1, 2020, and April 13, 2021, 1047 patients were assessed for eligibility. 1010 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, 516 (51%) to baricitinib plus remdesivir plus placebo and 494 (49%) to dexamethasone plus remdesivir plus placebo. The mean age of the patients was 583 years (SD 140) and 590 (58%) of 1010 patients were male. 588 (58%) of 1010 patients were White, 188 (19%) were Black, 70 (7%) were Asian, and 18 (2%) were American Indian or Alaska Native. 347 (34%) of 1010 patients were Hispanic or Latino. Mechanical ventilation-free survival by day 29 was similar between the study groups (Kaplan-Meier estimates of 870% [95% CI 837 to 896] in the baricitinib plus remdesivir plus placebo group and 876% [842 to 903] in the dexamethasone plus remdesivir plus placebo group; risk difference 06 [95% CI ?36 to 48]; p=091). The odds ratio for improved status in the dexamethasone plus remdesivir plus placebo group compared with the baricitinib plus remdesivir plus placebo group was 101 (95% CI 080 to 127). At least one adverse event occurred in 149 (30%) of 503 patients in the baricitinib plus remdesivir plus placebo group and 179 (37%) of 482 patients in the dexamethasone plus remdesivir plus placebo group (risk difference 75% [16 to 133]; p=0014). 21 (4%) of 503 patients in the baricitinib plus remdesivir plus placebo group had at least one treatment-related adverse event versus 49 (10%) of 482 patients in the dexamethasone plus remdesivir plus placebo group (risk difference 60% [28 to 93]; p=000041). Severe or life-threatening grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 143 (28%) of 503 patients in the baricitinib plus remdesivir plus placebo group and 174 (36%) of 482 patients in the dexamethasone plus remdesivir plus placebo group (risk difference 77% [18 to 134]; p=0012). INTERPRETATION: In hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen by low-flow, high-flow, or non-invasive ventilation, baricitinib plus remdesivir and dexamethasone plus remdesivir resulted in similar mechanical ventilation-free survival by day 29, but dexamethasone was associated with significantly more adverse events, treatment-related adverse events, and severe or life-threatening adverse events. A more individually tailored choice of immunomodulation now appears possible, where side-effect profile, ease of administration, cost, and patient comorbidities can all be considered.

We propose that defining the key gene regulatory networks that drive -cell dysfunction and death in T1D might enable the design of therapies that target the core disease mechanism, namely, the progressive loss of pancreatic -cells. Indeed, many successful drugs do not directly target individual disease genes but, rather, modulate the consequences of defective steps, targeting proteins located one or two steps downstream. If we transpose this to the T1D situation, it makes sense to target the pathways that modulate the -cell responses to the immune assaultin relation to signals that may stimulate the immune response (e.g., HLA class I and chemokine overexpression and/or neoantigen expression) or inhibit the invading immune cells (e.g., PDL1 and HLA-E expression)instead of targeting only the immune system, as it is usually proposed. Here we discuss the importance of a focus on -cells in T1D, lessons learned from other autoimmune diseases, the alternative splicing connection, data mining, and drug repurposing to protect -cells in T1D and then some of the initial candidates under testing for -cell protection.","output":"From Pancreatic -Cell Gene Networks to Novel Therapies for Type 1 Diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent scholarship has sought to emphasise boundaries and borders as being complex social institutions that play a vital role in mediating national and global flows.

In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate null alleles for each gene, and homozygous null (?/?) male mice were mated to wild-type females for 6 months to assess fertility. Fam170b(?/?) males were found to produce normal litter sizes and had normal sperm counts, motility, and sperm morphology.

Cryptococcus species are ubiquitous in the environment and the third most common invasive fungal infection following Solid Organ Transplant (SOT). We describe four cases of concurrent or subsequent cryptococcal infection within 90 days following COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients presenting with proven cryptococcosis either concurrently or within 90 days following COVID-19 diagnosis. Cases were identified March 2020 through May 2021. All were seen at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, a regional referral and comprehensive transplant center. Exemption for this review was approved by our IRB. RESULTS: Four cases were identified, all were SOT recipients. Case details are provided in Table 1. No patients required ICU level care at any point. COVID-19 treatment included 10 days of increased steroids for 3 patients, remdesivir for 2, and 1 received no treatment for COVID-19. In contrast to the typical time-course for cryptococcal infection post-SOT (median time approx. 500 days post-transplant), three patients were greater than 2 years post-transplant and were without rejection or recent changes in immunosuppression. Patient 1 was less than 6 months post liver-kidney transplant and was diagnosed at time of admission with concurrent COVID-19 and cryptococcal pneumonia. Infection was disseminated in the other 3 cases including positive blood cultures in 2 patients and cryptococcal meningitis (CM) in 2 patients. CM cases presented later following COVID-19 and had the longest delay between symptom onset (headache, neurologic symptoms) and CM diagnosis. One patient had CM 8 years prior, but had done extremely well off fluconazole for over 6 years prior to this recurrence. All patients are doing well at most recent follow-up evaluations. Table 1.

The awareness about the differences in the standing and sitting configuration of the spine has increased during the last years. The purpose was to provide an overview of studies related to seated imaging for spinal fusion surgery, identify knowledge gaps and evaluate future research questions. METHODS: A literature search according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMASc) was performed to identify reports related to seated imaging for spinal deformity surgery. A summary of the finding is presented for healthy individuals as well as patients with a spinal disorder and/or surgery. RESULTS: The systematic search identified 30 original studies reporting on 1) the pre- and postoperative use of seated imaging of the spine (n=12), 2) seated imaging of the spine for non C surgical evaluation (n=7) and 3) seated imaging of the spine among healthy individuals (12). The summarized evidence illuminates that sitting leads to a straightening of the spine decreasing thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), the sacral slope (SS). Further, the postural change between standing and sitting is more significant on the lower segments of the spine. Also, the adjacent segment compensates the needed postural change of the lumbar spine while sitting with hyperkyphosis. CONCLUSIONS: The spine has a different configuration in standing and sitting. This systematic review summarizes the current knowledge about such differences and reveals that there is minimal evidence about their consideration for surgical planning of spinal fusion surgery.

Here, we characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in 10 asymptomatic patients and 49 patients with other disease severity (mild, n=10, moderate, n=32, severe, n=7) and found that asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients failed to mount virus-specific germinal center (GC) B cell responses that result in robust and long-term humoral immunity, assessed by GC response indicators including follicular helper T (TFH) cell and memory B cell responses as well as serum CXCL13 levels. Alternatively, these patients mounted potent virus-specific TH1 and CD8+ T cell responses. In sharp contrast, patients of moderate or severe disease induced vigorous virus-specific GC B cell responses and associated TFH responses; however, the virus-specific TH1 and CD8+ T cells were minimally induced in these patients.

Among various hallmarks, we concentrated on those that show direct or indirect interaction with viral infections, comprising inflammation, genomic instability, impaired mitochondrial function, epigenetic modification, telomere attrition, and damaged autophagy. These hallmarks possibly contribute to the elicited pathophysiological responses to SARS-CoV-2 and may add an additive risk of accelerated aging post-recovery among aged adults.

Collectively rare conditions represent a substantial health burden, with an estimated 3.5 million affected individuals in the UK. METHOD: We explored the impact on mental health of living with a rare condition, and experiences of health service support, through an online survey. The survey assessed the impact of specific experiences commonly reported by those affected by a rare condition through multiple choice questions and Likert scale items, and open text question boxes. Through a multi-stakeholder workshop that involved facilitated discussion of our findings with patients/carers, clinicians and a government advisor, we developed recommendations for policy and practice toward a more person-centred and integrated approach. RESULTS: Eligible responses came from 1231 patients and 564 carers. Due to their rare condition, the majority of respondents (> 90%) had felt worried/anxious; stressed; and /or low/depressed. Thirty-six percent of patients and 19% of carers had had suicidal thoughts. Challenges that are particular to rare conditions and which negatively affect mental health included limited knowledge of the condition amongst healthcare professionals (88%), and not being believed or taken seriously by them. Only 23% of respondents felt healthcare professionals considered mental and physical health as equally important. Almost half reported never having been asked about mental health by healthcare professionals. Our findings indicate that access to, and appropriateness of, professional psychological support needs to be improved. Peer group support is important but signposting is inadequate. Our recommendations are for healthcare professionals to be supported to effectively and sensitively recognise and address patients and carers mental health needs; and for service level coordination of care to integrate professional psychological support with rare disease services. CONCLUSION: Living with a rare disease substantially impacts mental health. Many of the drivers of poor mental health reflect issues specific to managing rare conditions. To meet UK government commitments, there should be a focus on empowering healthcare professionals who treat rare disease patients and on integration of mental health support with rare disease services.","output":"Mental health care for rare disease in the UK C recommendations from a quantitative survey and multi-stakeholder workshop"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While a number of chelate strategies have been developed for the organometallic precursor fac-[M(I)(OH2)3(CO)3](+) (M = Re, (99m)Tc), a unique challenge has been to improve the overall function and performance of these complexes for in vivo and in vitro applications.

This study aimed to understand the state of IDSR implementation and differences between guideline and practice for future disease surveillance system strengthening. METHODS: This was a mixed-method research study. Quantitative data were to analyze completeness and timeliness of surveillance system performance from national District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) during October 2014 to September 2016. Qualitative data were collected through interviews with 29 frontline health service providers from the selected district and 7 key informants of the IDSR system implementation and administration at district and national levels. FINDINGS: The current IDSR system showed relatively good completeness (73.1%) but poor timeliness (40.2%) of total expected monthly reports nationwide and zero weekly reports during the study period. Major implementation gaps were lack of weekly report and trainings. The challenges of IDSR implementation revealed through qualitative data included case identification, compiling reports for timely submission and inadequate resources.

In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need and opportunity of internet-based wearable technology in future health care systems. Previous research has shown the feasibility of human activity recognition technologies for monitoring rehabilitation activities in home environments; however, few comprehensive studies ranging from development to clinical evaluation exist. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) develop a home-based rehabilitation (HBR) system that can recognize and record the type and frequency of rehabilitation exercises conducted by the user using a smartwatch and smartphone app equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the home-based rehabilitation system through a prospective comparative study with chronic stroke survivors. METHODS: The HBR system involves an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a smartphone, and custom-developed apps. A convolutional neural network was used to train the ML algorithm for detecting home exercises. To determine the most accurate way for detecting the type of home exercise, we compared accuracy results with the data sets of personal or total data and accelerometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer combined with gyroscope data. From March 2018 to February 2019, we conducted a clinical study with two groups of stroke survivors. In total, 17 and 6 participants were enrolled for statistical analysis in the HBR group and control group, respectively. To measure clinical outcomes, we performed the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, grip power test, Beck Depression Inventory, and range of motion (ROM) assessment of the shoulder joint at 0, 6, and 12 months, and at a follow-up assessment 6 weeks after retrieving the HBR system. RESULTS: The ML model created with personal data involving accelerometer combined with gyroscope data (5590/5601, 99.80%) was the most accurate compared with accelerometer (5496/5601, 98.13%) or gyroscope data (5381/5601, 96.07%). In the comparative study, the drop-out rates in the control and HBR groups were 40% (4/10) and 22% (5/22) at 12 weeks and 100% (10/10) and 45% (10/22) at 18 weeks, respectively. The HBR group (n=17) showed a significant improvement in the mean WMFT score (P=.02) and ROM of flexion (P=.004) and internal rotation (P=.001). The control group (n=6) showed a significant change only in shoulder internal rotation (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that a home care system using a commercial smartwatch and ML model can facilitate participation in home training and improve the functional score of the WMFT and shoulder ROM of flexion and internal rotation in the treatment of patients with chronic stroke. This strategy can possibly be a cost-effective tool for the home care treatment of stroke survivors in the future.

Patients of all ages could be affected, although there is a predilection for middle-aged people. Results?There were no significant co-morbidities or immunodeficiencies in the affected patients. COVID-19 related myelopathy started roughly within the first month after COVID-19 onset, either concomitantly with COVID-19 symptoms or within 10 days after their remission. The vast majority of cases fulfilled our criteria for postinfectious transverse myelitis. However, some cases were considered to have had parainfectious or infectious myelitis or, in one case, vascular myelopathy. Motor, sensory and bowel and/or bladder symptoms predominated the clinical presentation of myelopathies, explained mainly by centrally localized and longitudinally extensive lesions within the cervical and/or thoracic segments of the spinal cord. Occasionally lesions were complicated by necrosis and hemorrhages.

A urinary proteomic biomarker (COV50) developed by capillary-electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) technology, comprising 50 sequenced peptides and identifying the parental proteins, was evaluated in 228 patients (derivation cohort) with replication in 99 patients (validation cohort). Death and progression along the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Progression Scale were assessed up to 21 days after the initial PCR test. Statistical methods included logistic regression, receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis and comparison of the area under the curve (AUC). FINDINGS: in the derivation cohort, 23 patients died, and 48 developed worse WHO scores. The odds ratios (OR) for death per 1 standard deviation (SD) increment in COV50 were 352 (95% CI, 202C613, p <00001) unadjusted and 273 (125C595, p = 0012) adjusted for sex, age, baseline WHO score, body mass index (BMI) and comorbidities. For WHO scale progression, the corresponding OR were 263 (180C385, p<00001) and 338 (185C617, p<00001), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for COV50 as a continuously distributed variable was 080 (072C088) for mortality and 074 (066C081) for worsening WHO score. The optimised COV50 thresholds for mortality and worsening WHO score were 047 and 004 with sensitivity/specificity of 870 (746%) and 771 (639%), respectively. On top of covariates, COV50 improved the AUC, albeit borderline for death, from 078 to 082 (p = 011) and 084 (p = 0052) for mortality and from 068 to 078 (p = 00097) and 075 (p = 0021) for worsening WHO score. The validation cohort findings were confirmatory.

Diagnosis of HLH is challenging given its varied presentation and strict diagnostic criteria. DESCRIPTION: A 40 year-old female with no medical history presented with two weeks of shortness of breath and cervical lymphadenopathy. She was evaluated in the ED on two separate occasions with workup significant for CT chest findings of mediastinal and axillary lymphadenopathy, pulmonary nodules and a left pleural effusion. Within one week, she presented a third time with worsening shortness of breath, fatigue and fevers. She was febrile, tachycardic, hypoxemic, leukopenic and thrombocytopenic. A repeat CT chest revealed increased lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion. She was started on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics and admitted to the hospital. Infectious workup, pleural fluid cytology and peripheral blood flow cytometry were negative. Bone marrow biopsy had markedly increased histiocytes and hemophagocytosis, but no evidence of malignancy. She developed progressive hypoxemia requiring intubation, shock requiring vasopressors and multiorgan failure. Fevers persisted with worsening pancytopenia, DIC, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers, notably a ferritin >33000. Further workup revealed positive Covid antibodies, elevated parvovirus IgG, elevated fungal markers and Candida in respiratory cultures. Secondary HLH due to sepsis or following COVID infection in the setting of malignancy was suspected. A course of antifungals and high dose steroids was given without improvement. Etoposide was considered, but avoided given possible sepsis, multiorgan failure and pancytopenia. A lymph node biopsy was performed with evidence of hemophagocytosis and ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Despite aggressive treatment, she developed progressive multiorgan failure resulting in death. Autopsy confirmed anaplastic large cell lymphoma with metastasis to the lymph nodes, lungs, epicardium and stomach. DISCUSSION: Malignancy is a known etiology of HLH in adults, however, few cases of ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma presenting as HLH have been reported. The rapid progression of HLH in this case stresses the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of HLH while pursuing an aggressive malignancy workup.","output":"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma presenting as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To screen for additional vaccine candidate antigens of Plasmodium pre-erythrocytic stages, fourteen P. falciparum proteins were selected based on expression in sporozoites or their role in establishment of hepatocyte infection.

We previously observed that liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) using chloroformmethanol-water at a ratio (1:1:1) was superior at detecting antibacterial activities and significant quantities of antibacterial compounds. Herein, we demonstrate that antibacterial secondary metabolites are produced from G. boninense mycelia. Antibacterial compounds were monitored in concurrent biochemical and biophysical experiments. The combined methods included high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The antibacterial compounds derived from mycelia with chloroform-methanol extraction through LLE were isolated via a gradient solvent elution system using HPTLC. The antibacterial activity of the isolated compounds was observed to be the most potent against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and multidrug-resistant S. aureus NCTC 11939. GC-MS, HPLC, and FTIR analysis confirmed two antibacterial compounds, which were identified as 4,4,14-trimethylcholestane (m/z = 414.75; lanostane, C(30)H(54)) and ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3-ol (m/z = 396.65; ergosterol, C(28)H(44)O).

Cardiotocogrm (CTG) is the principal method to observe intrapartum fetal well-being. This paper aims to verify intrapartum CTG changes seen in seropositive COVID-19 mothers versus healthy controls and looks into their relation to subsequent delivery mode and neonatal outcome. METHODS: A caseCcontrol study recruited 90 pregnant women at the labor word of AL Yarmouk Teaching Hospital. All were term pregnancy admitted for delivery. They were grouped into 2: seropositive COVID-19 confirmed by real-time RT-PCR test (30/90) and healthy controls (60/90). We recorded their demographic criteria, laboratory results, CTG changes, delivery mode, and indication. RESULTS: COVID-19 cases showed significantly higher pulse rate, temperature, and leukocyte counts. Cesarian deliveries (CS) were higher in cases versus healthy controls (70 % vs. 53.3 %) and P = 0.45. Analysis of the CS indications showed that abnormal fetal heart tracing accounts for 33.3 % versus 15.6 % (P-value = 0.015) for cases versus healthy controls. 60 % of COVID-19 cases exhibited abnormal CTG changes versus 19.4 % in healthy controls. These changes were primarily fetal tachycardia and reduced variabilities. CONCLUSIONS: The higher incidence of abnormal CTG in COVID-19 cases, alongside infection signs and symptoms, underlies the exaggerated inflammatory reactions inside the pregnant mother. These inflammatory reactions are the main causes of CTG changes and higher CS rates. Therefore, obstetricians are advised to optimize the maternal condition to rectify reactive CTG changes rather than proceeding into urgent CS.

Viral replication in the respiratory tract induces the death of infected cells and the release of pathogen- associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs give rise to local inflammation, increasing the secretion of pro- inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which attract immune cells from the blood into the infected lung. In most individuals, lung-recruited cells clear the infection, and the immune response retreats. However, in some cases, a dysfunctional immune response occurs, which triggers a cytokine storm in the lung, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Severe COVID-19 is characterized by an impaired innate and adaptive immune response and by a massive expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MDSCs function as protective regulators of the immune response, protecting the host from over-immunoreactivity and hyper-inflammation. However, under certain conditions, such as chronic inflammation and cancer, MDSCs could exert a detrimental role. Accordingly, the early expansion of MDSCs in COVID-19 is able to predict the fatal outcome of the infection.

The mainly airborne pathogen has led to large numbers of deaths, principally in elderly and vulnerable segments of the population. Protective vaccines have recently become available, but it is not yet clear whether and when population-wide immunity will be achieved. The existence of evidence for the protective effect of masks covering the mouth and nose is a topic of public debate. METHODS: A selective literature search was carried out in PubMed. Data from the German Robert Koch Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also taken into account. RESULTS: When talking, as many as 20 000 droplets ranging in size from 20 to 500 M are released every second. According to PCR tests, the amount of virus exhaled is highest immediately before the onset of symptoms. No randomized trials have been conducted on the effect of masks covering the mouth and nose. A metaanalysis of 29 studies on infection with SARS-CoV-2, SARS, or MERS revealed that type N-95 masks (corresponding approximately to FFP-2), surgical masks, or similar multilayer cotton masks can greatly reduce the infection risk for the wearers (RR 0.34 [0.26; 0.45], with moderate heterogeneity [I2 = 48%]). Model experiments and case reports suggest that masks covering the mouth and nose afford considerable protection against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne diseases by reducing release of and exposure to potentially infectious droplets; in addition, infections that do occur take a milder course. A limitation of the studies analyzed is that in most cases, this effect cannot be viewed in isolation from the protective impact of other measures (distancing, hygiene precautions).

Epidemiological models and data analysis affirm that wide adoption of NPIs helps to control the pandemic. However, SARS-CoV-2 has extensively demonstrated its ability to evolve. Therefore, it is crucial to examine how NPIs may affect the evolution of the virus. Such evolution could have important effects on the spread and impact of the pandemic. We used evo-epidemiological models to examine the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions and testing on two evolutionary trajectories for SARS-CoV-2: attenuation and test evasion. Our results show that when stronger measures are taken, selection may act to reduce virulence. Additionally, the timely application of NPIs could significantly affect the competition between viral strains, favoring reduced virulence. Furthermore, a higher testing rate can select for a test-evasive viral strain, even if that strain is less infectious than the detectable competing strain. Importantly, if a less detectable strain evolves, epidemiological metrics such as confirmed daily cases may distort our assessment of the pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To objectively evaluate the effects of RPEincluding medical masks and respiratorson the skin barrier by measuring various physiological properties of the skin. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed. Twenty healthy health care workerswere included in this study. Skin parameters including skin hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), erythema, sebum secretion, pH, and skin temperature were measured in the RPE-covered and uncovered areas of the face 4 and 8 h after wearing RPE and 14 hafter not wearing RPE. RESULTS: Skin hydration, TEWL, erythema, pH, and skin temperature increased in the RPE-covered areasafter wearing RPE for 4 and 8h. On the other hand, in the RPE-uncovered areas, skin hydration decreased and TEWL, erythema, and pH showed minimal changes over time. Based on the repeated-measure analysis, the changes in skin physiological properties over time were significantly different between RPE-covered and RPE-uncovered areas.

Although the immunological mechanisms that underlie different clinical trajectories remain poorly defined, pathogen-specific antibodies often point to immunological mechanisms of protection. Here, we profiled SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses in a cohort of 22 hospitalized individuals. Despite inter-individual heterogeneity, distinct antibody signatures resolved individuals with different outcomes. Although no differences in SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG levels were observed, spike-specific humoral responses were enriched among convalescent individuals, whereas functional antibody responses to the nucleocapsid were elevated in deceased individuals. Furthermore, this enriched immunodominant spike-specific antibody profile in convalescents was confirmed in a larger validation cohort. These results demonstrate that early antigen-specific and qualitative features of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies point to differences in disease trajectory, highlighting the potential importance of functional antigen-specific humoral immunity to guide patient care and vaccine development.","output":"Distinct Early Serological Signatures Track with SARS-CoV-2 Survival"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In its 2019 report, The Skilled Technical Workforce: Crafting America's Science and Engineering Enterprise, the National Science Board recommended a national charge to create a skilled technical workforce (STW) driven by science and engineering.

This case represents an extraordinarily rare primary hyperfunctioning NET of the appendix with a clinical presentation of symptomatic hypoglycemia in an otherwise healthy man. CASE PRESENTATION A previously healthy 34-year-old man was found to be symptomatically hypoglycemic in early 2018. After the workup, the apparent explanation was a tumor in his midappendix, for which he was referred to our surgical oncology service for resection. The patient's clinical course is described in detail, including imaging, as well as surgical and pathologic descriptions of the appendiceal NET. DISCUSSION A literature review demonstrates no other case series or reports of a primary hyperfunctioning NET of the appendix presenting with hypoglycemic crisis. The symptoms of tumor-induced hypoglycemia more typically arise with islet cell tumors, such as pancreatic NETs or insulinomas. We believe this case represents a nonislet cell tumor-induced hypoglycemia. This patient's elevated serum proinsulin level preoperatively implies secretion of proinsulin by the tumor. However, tumor-induced hypoglycemia caused by proinsulin has been described previously only in pancreatic tumors. This unique case adds knowledge to the possible glycemic endocrine effects of nonpancreatic NETs, specifically those that arise primarily in the appendix.","output":"Primary Functioning Neuroendocrine Tumor of the Appendix with Hypoglycemia Syndrome: A Case Report and Review of Neuroendocrine Tumors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Finding antivirals to reduce coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) morbidity and mortality has been challenging.

AIMS: To test the hypothesis that enhancing access to mental healthcare professionals helps to improve HCWs mental health. METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed depressive symptoms in HCWs at three hospitals in Osaka prefecture between May and July, 2020. The survey obtained information on HCWs mental state and related situations/perceptions. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Of the 3291 eligible HCWs, 1269 (39%) completed the survey. Of all HCWs, 87 (7%) were physicians, and 700 (55%) were nurses. A total of 181 (14%) HCWs had moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression. Being a frontline worker was not significantly associated with depressive symptoms (odds ratio: 0.86 [95% confidence intervals: 0.54C1.37], P = 0.50). The unwillingness to consult with anyone was significantly associated with more severe depressive symptoms (1.70 [1.10C2.63], P < 0.01).

The association of these 2 drug classes with outcomes among patients with diabetes and advanced-stage CKD or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in a population with diabetes and advanced-stage CKD or ESKD is associated with better outcomes compared with use of DPP-4 inhibitors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used data on patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 5 CKD or ESKD obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. The study was conducted between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2018. Data were analyzed from June 2020 to July 2021. EXPOSURES: Treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists compared with treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause mortality, sepsis- and infection-related mortality, and mortality related to major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events were compared between patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists and patients treated with DPP-4 inhibitors. Propensity score weighting was used to mitigate the imbalance among covariates between the groups. RESULTS: Of 27 279 patients included in the study, 26 578 were in the DPP-4 inhibitor group (14 443 [54.34%] male; mean [SD] age, 65 [13] years) and 701 in the GLP-1 receptor agonist group (346 [49.36%] male; mean [SD] age, 59 [13] years). After weighting, the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63-0.98) and lower sepsis- and infection-related mortality (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40-0.91). Subgroup analysis demonstrated a lower risk of mortality associated with use of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared with DDP-4 inhibitors among patients with cerebrovascular disease (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12-0.86) than among those without cerebrovascular disease (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.71-1.12) (P = .04 for interaction).

When translating into clinical applications, oral administration of LHQWC could be more beneficial for patients with insufficient immune functions or for patients with alleviated symptoms after treatment with JHQGG.","output":"Broad Anti-Viral Capacities of Lian-Hua-Qing-Wen Capsule and Jin-Hua-Qing-Gan Granule and Rational use Against COVID-19 Based on Literature Mining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hujungtiwu village has several attractive features such as agricultural and agroforestry commodities, mountainous scenery with Gunung Sawal as the background, and location in high altitude with cool climate and cold water.

The push for telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the face-to-face rounding paradigm and creates an opportunity for reflection on the benefits of telemedicine, especially for balancing competing corporate and clinical demands. METHODS The 117-month video-based inpatient telerounding experience of a colorectal surgeon in an academic medical system was recorded, including patient characteristics, diagnoses, technology, content of telerounding encounters, and logistical considerations. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS 163 patients were seen in 201 telerounding encounters, primarily for routine postoperative care (90.5%). Most were admitted for inflammatory bowel disease (63.2%). Changes were made to plans of care during 28.9% of encounters, and discharge planning was part of 26.4%. Encounters were conducted primarily from the surgeon's administrative office (68.7%) or other work-related locations (10.9%), while 6.5% originated from the surgeon's home. Technologic issues occurred in 5.5% of encounters. 89.1% of patient feedback was positive and none was negative.

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies suggest possible protection against re-infections in prior SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this prospective observational study were to longitudinally assess the antibody response during the first 4-6 months after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to study the diagnostic performance of four different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) in symptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) with non-severe COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: HCWs in a teaching hospital were included between March 8 and June 15, 2020, when they had a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past 3 months. The performances of four ELISAs (Wantai, Bio-Rad Platelia, BioTrading Immy clarus, and Euroimmun) were evaluated in serum samples obtained at the moment of study inclusion and subsequently at 1, 2 and 3 months thereafter. Furthermore, in the last available serum sample sVNT by GenScript was performed. RESULTS: 309 samples from 80 positive HCWs were included of whom 70 (88%) were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. The detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by the different ELISAs were heterogenous ranging from 64% for the Euroimmun ELISA to 88% for the Wantai ELISA. The Wantai ELISA had the highest and almost perfect agreement with sVNT (96%, Cohen's kappa 0.83).

It has been suggested that this abrupt lockdown of populations will foster addiction-related habits such as caloric/salty food intake, screen use, and substance use. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the global changes and factors of increase in addiction-related habits during the early COVID-19 containment phase in France. METHODS: A web-based survey was provided from day 8 to day 13 of the containment and was completed by 11,391 participants. The questions explored sociodemographic features, psychiatric/addiction history, material conditions of lockdown, general stress, mental well-being, and reported changes in several addiction-related behaviors. Global changes were described and factors of increase were explored using population-weighted and adjusted logistic regression models, providing adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Overall, the respondents reported more increases in addiction-related habits than decreases, specifically 28.4% (caloric/salty food intake), 64.6% (screen use), 35.6% (tobacco use), 24.8% (alcohol use), and 31.2% (cannabis use). Reduced well-being scores and increased stress scores were general factors of increase in addiction-related habits (P<.001 for all habits). Factors of increase in caloric/salty food intake (n=10,771) were female gender (aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.48-1.77), age less than 29 years (P<.001), having a partner (aOR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.35), being locked down in a more confined space (per 1 square meter/person decrease: aOR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), being locked down alone (aOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49), and reporting current (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.62-2.31) or past (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09-1.47) psychiatric treatment. Factors of increase in screen use (n=11,267) were female gender (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.21-1.43), age less than 29 years (P<.001), having no partner (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.32), being employed (P<.001), intermediate/high education level (P<.001), being locked down with no access to an outdoor space (aOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.29), being locked down alone (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.32), living in an urban environment (P<.01), and not working (P<.001). Factors of increase in tobacco use (n=2787) were female gender (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.55), having no partner (aOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06-1.59), intermediate/low education level (P<.01), and still working in the workplace (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.17-1.86). Factors of increase in alcohol use (n=7108) were age 30-49 years (P<.05), a high level of education (P<.001), and current psychiatric treatment (aOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.10-1.88). The only significant factor of increase in cannabis use (n=620) was intermediate/low level of education (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The early phase of COVID-19 containment in France led to widespread increases in addiction-related habits in the general population. Reduced well-being and increased stress were universal factors of increase. More specific factors were associated with increases in each of the explored habits.","output":"Global Changes and Factors of Increase in Caloric/Salty Food Intake, Screen Use, and Substance Use During the Early COVID-19 Containment Phase in the General Population in France: Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic brought several challenges to the healthcare system: diagnosis, treatment and measures to prevent the spread of the disease.

Inhalation is often the most relevant transmission mode in indoor environments. For severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the risk of inhalation transmission is not yet fully understood. Here, we used an indoor aerosol model combined with a regional inhaled deposited dose model to examine the indoor transport of aerosols from an infected person with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to a susceptible person and assess the potential inhaled dose rate of particles. Two scenarios with different ventilation rates were compared, as well as adult female versus male recipients. Assuming a source strength of 10 viruses/s, in a tightly closed room with poor ventilation (0.5 h-1), the respiratory tract deposited dose rate was 140-350 and 100-260 inhaled viruses/hour for males and females; respectively. With ventilation at 3 h-1 the dose rate was only 30-90 viruses/hour. Correcting for the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 in air, these numbers are reduced by a factor of 1.2-2.2 for poorly ventilated rooms and 1.1-1.4 for well-ventilated rooms.

The novelty in this work is two-fold. First, the population is divided according to its compliance with disease control directives (lockdown, shelter-in-place, masks/face coverings, physical distancing, etc.) into those who fully comply and those who follow the directives partially, or are necessarily mobile (such as medical staff). This split, indirectly, reflects on the quality and consistency of these measures. This allows the assessment of the overall effectiveness of the control measures and the impact of their relaxing or tightening on the disease spread. Second, the adequate contact rate, which directly affects the infection rate, is one of the model unknowns, as it keeps track of the changes in the population behavior and the effectiveness of various disease treatment modalities via a differential inclusion. Existence, uniqueness and positivity results are proved using a nonstandard convex analysis-based approach. As a case study, the pandemic outbreak in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) is simulated. The model parameters were found by minimizing the deviation of the model prediction from the reported data over the first 100 days of the pandemic in South Korea.The simulations show that the model captures accurately the pandemic dynamics in the subsequent 75 days, which provides confidence in the model predictions and its future use. In particular, the model predicts that about 40% of the infections were not documented, which implies that asymptomatic infections contribute silently but substantially to the spread of the disease indicating that more widespread asymptomatic testing is necessary.","output":"A mathematical model of the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics with dependent variable infection rate: Application to the Republic of Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To determine the number of steps and identify characteristics associated with attaining a stable dose of morphine sulfate and sequestered naltrexone extended release capsules (MS-sNT). PATIENTS AND METHODS Data from an open-label, long-term multicenter study designed to assess the safety of MS-sNT for managing chronic ( 3 m), moderate-to-severe pain were analyzed post hoc. Initial MS-sNT dose was 20 mg twice daily (BID) for opioid-na?ve patients and 50% to 75% of current daily opioid dose for opioid-experienced patients. Dose adjustments upward/downward were allowed throughout the study with  3 days between increases; opioid-experienced patients could increase  24 hours after initial drug dispensing. Nonopioid analgesics were permitted as rescue medication. Stable dose was defined post hoc as one maintained for 2 consecutive study visits. RESULTS Overall, 69% of patients (n = 319/465) achieved a stable dose; 85% (n = 272) achieved a stable dose in  2 titration dose adjustments or \\"steps,\\" and 96% (n = 305) achieved a stable dose in  4 steps. The mean time to stable dose was 28.9 days (standard deviation [SD], 34.1 days); the median was 12 days. A stable dose was achieved in 70% (118/168) of opioid-na?ve patients (mean, 24.2 days [SD, 33.4 days]; median, 8 days) and 68% (201/297) of opioid-experienced patients (mean, 31.7 days [SD, 34.3 days]; median, 25 days). A stable dose was achieved by 79% (19/24) of patients who previously used morphine, 64% (27/42) who used oxycodone, 59% (47/79) who used hydrocodone, and 71% (83/117) who used multiple opioids. Baseline pain scores were similar between patients who did and did not achieve a stable dose. At the time of stable dose achievement, average, least, worst, and current pain were all decreased from baseline. CONCLUSIONS The study provides information about anticipated rates of achieving stable opioid dose in patients who received MS-sNT for up to 1 year to manage chronic, moderate-to-severe pain. Both opioid-na?ve and opioid-experienced patients achieved a stable dose of MS-sNT, generally in  2 steps.

However, detailed characterization of the host-virus interplay in infected human lung and intestinal epithelial cells is lacking. METHODS: We utilized immunofluorescence assays, flow cytometry, and RT-qPCR to delineate the virological features and the innate immune response of the host cells against SARS-CoV-2 infection in two prototype human cell lines representing the human pulmonary (Calu3) and intestinal (Caco2) epithelium when compared with SARS-CoV. RESULTS: Lung epithelial cells were significantly more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. However, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced an attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines induction and type I and type II IFN responses. A single dose of 10 U/mL IFN- (IFN) pretreatment potently protected both Calu3 and Caco2 against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 was more sensitive to the pretreatment with IFN and IFN inducer than SARS-CoV in Calu3. CONCLUSIONS: Despite robust infection efficiency in both the human lung and intestinal epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 could attenuate the virus-induced pro-inflammatory response and IFN response.

Within this environment, misinformation and disinformation have proliferated, becoming a public safety concern in most countries. Allowing the public and professionals to efficiently find reliable evidences about the factual veracity of a claim is a crucial step to mitigate this harmful spread. To this end, we propose FacTeR-Check, a multilingual architecture for semi-automated fact-checking that can be used for either applications designed for the general public and by fact-checking organisations. FacTeR-Check enables retrieving fact-checked information, unchecked claims verification and tracking dangerous information over social media. This architectures involves several modules developed to evaluate semantic similarity, to calculate natural language inference and to retrieve information from Online Social Networks. The union of all these components builds a semi-automated fact-checking tool able of verifying new claims, to extract related evidence, and to track the evolution of a hoax on a OSN. While individual modules are validated on related benchmarks (mainly MSTS and SICK), the complete architecture is validated using a new dataset called NLI19-SP that is publicly released with COVID-19 related hoaxes and tweets from Spanish social media. Our results show state-of-the-art performance on the individual benchmarks, as well as producing a useful analysis of the evolution over time of 61 different hoaxes.","output":"FacTeR-Check: Semi-automated fact-checking through Semantic Similarity and Natural Language Inference"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA is a unique bio-macromolecule that can both record genetic information and perform biological functions in a variety of molecular processes, including transcription, splicing, translation, and even regulating protein function. RNAs adopt specific three-dimensional conformations to enable their functions. Experimental determination of high-resolution RNA structures using x-ray crystallography is both laborious and demands expertise, thus, hindering our comprehension of RNA structural biology. The computational modeling of RNA structure was a milestone in the birth of bioinformatics. Although computational modeling has been greatly improved over the last decade showing many successful cases, the accuracy of such computational modeling is not only length-dependent but also varies according to the complexity of the structure. To increase credibility, various experimental data were integrated into computational modeling. In this review, we summarize the experiments that can be integrated into RNA structure modeling as well as the computational methods based on these experimental data. We also demonstrate how computational modeling can help the experimental determination of RNA structure. We highlight the recent advances in computational modeling which can offer reliable structure models using high-throughput experimental data.","output":"Advances in RNA 3D Structure Modeling Using Experimental Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Topological indices are the molecular descriptors that characterize the formation of chemical compounds and they assist us to predict certain physicalCchemical properties like molar refraction, molar volume, chromatographic behavior, boiling point, heat of vaporization and partition coefficient.

METHODS Combined nose/throat swabs from patients with ILI selected from sentinel general practices were tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory. The proportion of ILI attributed to laboratory-confirmed influenza was evaluated for five consecutive surveillance seasons, from 1998 to 2002. The seasonal patterns of ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza were compared for 2000-02. ILI surveillance from sentinel general practices between 1997 and 2000 was compared with hospital admissions for influenza extracted from the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset between 1994 and 2000. RESULTS Approximately 41% of all ILI cases from sentinel general practices were confirmed to have an influenza infection between 1998 and 2002. The seasonal pattern of ILI and confirmed influenza among patients selected from sentinel general practices was very similar over three influenza seasons. The trends for ILI rates in sentinel general practices appeared to correlate remarkably well with those of hospital admissions for influenza. Thresholds for ILI were defined as: baseline < 0.25 ILI cases/100 patients/week; normal seasonal activity 0.25-1.5; above normal seasonal activity > 1.5-3.5; and epidemic activity above 3.5.

Physical activity level was measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and injury data were collected with the Injury History Questionnaire. The countermovement jump was performed to evaluate force and power. LL tissue composition was evaluated by a bioimpedance analyzer. The symmetry indices were calculated. A comparison between injured and non-injured subjects in both sexes was conducted to determine indices associated with injuries. The symmetry indices cut-off points were calculated to establish values indicating a significant injury risk increase, and logistic regression was performed. The relative peak force asymmetry above 4.049% was associated with increased injury risk in men. The LL skeletal muscle mass asymmetry above 3.584% was associated with a higher injury risk in women. Increased asymmetry in indicated indices by 1% was associated with 19.8% higher injury risk in men and 82.6% in women. Asymmetry proved to be an injury risk factor.

This study aimed to propose a simple yet accurate risk assessment tool to help decision-making in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From Jul to Nov 2020, 5454 patients from Fars Province, Iran, diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled. A multiple logistic regression model was trained on one dataset (training set: n=4183) and its prediction performance was assessed on another dataset (testing set: n=1271). This model was utilized to develop the COVID-19 risk-score in Fars (CRSF). RESULTS: Five final independent risk factors including gender (male: OR=1.37), age (60C80: OR=2.67 and >80: OR=3.91), SpO ( 2 ) (85%: OR=7.02), underlying diseases (yes: OR=1.25), and pulse rate (<60: OR=2.01 and >120: OR=1.60) were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. The CRSF formula was obtained using the estimated regression coefficient values of the aforementioned factors. The point values for the risk factors varied from 2 to 19 and the total CRSF varied from 0 to 45. The ROC analysis showed that the CRSF values of 15 (high-risk patients) had a specificity of 73.5%, sensitivity of 76.5%, positive predictive value of 23.2%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.8% for the prediction of death (AUC=0.824, P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: This simple CRSF system, which has a high NPV, can be useful for predicting the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.

The search for useful tools and techniques to promote a layered and widespread information network capable of restoring a climate of trust and confidence towards vaccination, leads us to reflect on the possibility, already adopted in numerous countries, of enlisting community pharmacies in immunization campaigns also in Italy, positively implementing the professional role of the community pharmacist in immunization. The pharmacist is often the first point of contact with both the patients and the public, both for the relationship of trust and confidence that binds him to the citizens, and for the ease of access in relation to the widespread distribution of community pharmacies in the territory, the availability of prolonged operating hours, the absence of need for appointments and positions near/outside of healthcare facilities. Currently, in Italy the role of the community pharmacist is limited to counseling and providing advice and information regarding the benefits and/or any risks of vaccination practices, but does not imply a direct engagement in immunization programs, rather a collaboration to avoid straining and overwhelming the vaccination centers. Some recent questionnaire-based studies have shown that Italian community pharmacists have attitudes that are favorable to vaccinations, even though their knowledge is rather limited.

METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, an electronic thermohygrometer was used to obtain the required measurements. A mechanical ventilator was used as a source for high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. For active humidification, the following equipment was used: a HH with standard disposable water trap circuit, 3 servo-controlled HH, and 7 circuits with a heated wire. Data on environmental conditions (ie, temperature, RH, AH) were collected from the laboratory during each measurement; the temperature, RH, and AH resulting from the application of 8 flows (30-100 L/min) were also recorded. Variables were compared with analysis of variance for repeated measurements with Tukey post hoc tests. A value of P < .05 was assumed to be significant. RESULTS: During the study, a statistically significant difference was found in the average AH for each flow for the different devices (P < .005). The highest AH values were recorded with the Fisher & Paykel MR850 and the Medtronic-DAR circuit (AH = 40.8 mg/L with flow of 50 L/min, P < .005), and the lowest AH values were recorded with the Flexicare FL9000 HH and the Flexicare circuit (AH = 11.4 mg/L with 100 L/min flow, P < .005). For flows > 50 L/min, the best performance for all flows in terms of AH was found with the Fisher & Paykel MR850 HH, regardless of the circuit used. CONCLUSIONS: During oxygen therapy with very high gas flows, HH devices behave differently and in many cases are inefficient in delivering adequate humidification, even at conventional flows.

Using an age-stratified compartment model, we show that this age-dependent asymptomatic pattern together with the age distribution of overall cases can explain most of the geographic differences in reported asymptomatic proportions. Combined with demography and contact matrices from other countries worldwide, we estimate that a maximum of 22%-55% of SARS-CoV-2 infections would come from asymptomatic cases in an uncontrolled epidemic based on asymptomatic proportions in China.

Pregnant women were included if they were admitted to hospital between 1 March and 30 June 2020 and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test &#8804;14 days prior to admission. Cause of admission was classified as obstetric or COVID-19-related. RESULTS: In the study areas, 214 pregnant women with a positive test were admitted to hospital, of which 56 women required hospital care due to COVID-19. The risk of admission due to COVID-19 was 0.4/1000 deliveries in Denmark, Finland and Norway, and 3.8/1000 deliveries in the Swedish regions. Women hospitalized because of COVID-19 were more frequently obese (p < 0.001) and had a migrant background (p < 0.001) compared with the total population of women who delivered in 2018. Twelve women (21.4%) needed intensive care. Among the 56 women admitted due to COVID-19, 48 women delivered 51 infants. Preterm delivery (n = 12, 25%, p < 0.001) and cesarean delivery (n = 21, 43.8%, p < 0.001) were more frequent in women with COVID-19 compared with women who delivered in 2018. No maternal deaths, stillbirths or neonatal deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of admission due to COVID-19 disease in pregnancy was low in the Nordic countries. A fifth of the women required intensive care and we observed higher rates of preterm and cesarean deliveries.

Treatments following early AD detection can significantly delay institutionalisation and extend patients' independence. There has been a growing focus on early AD detection using artificial intelligence. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven revolutionary for image-based applications and have been applied to brain scans. In recent years, studies have utilised two-dimensional (2D) CNNs on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for AD detection. To apply a 2D CNN on three-dimensional (3D) MRI volumes, each MRI scan is split into 2D image slices. A CNN is trained over the image slices by calculating a loss function between each subject's label and each image slice's predicted output. Although 2D CNNs can discover spatial dependencies in an image slice, they cannot understand the temporal dependencies among 2D image slices in a 3D MRI volume. This study aims to resolve this issue by modelling the sequence of MRI features produced by a CNN with deep sequence-based networks for AD detection. METHOD The CNN utilised in this paper was ResNet-18 pre-trained on an ImageNet dataset. The employed sequence-based models were the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and different types of recurrent neural networks. Several deep sequence-based models and configurations were implemented and compared for AD detection. RESULTS Our proposed TCN model achieved the best classification performance with 91.78% accuracy, 91.56% sensitivity and 92% specificity.

The included patients were further divided into two subgroups according to the use of supplemental oxygen, mild and moderate groups. During the first 14 d of hospitalization, all patients were administered BDJDG combined with conventional Western medicine, and observed for continuous 28 d. Primary outcomes were disease progression rate and discharge rate. Secondary outcomes included negative conversion time of nucleic acid, hospitalization duration, clinical symptom subsidence time, and symptom regression rate. RESULTS: A total of 230 common COVID-19 patients were analyzed (138 in moderate group and 92 in mild group). By day 28, the disease progression rate was 4.3% and the discharge rate was 95.7%. All mild cases recovered and were discharged from hospital.

While it is rare, fungal infection is a crucial consideration for patients with pancreatic pseudocysts, especially in the context of a lack of an adequate response to antibiotics, deterioration, comorbidities, and immunocompromised states. CONCLUSION: Rapid identification of the microbe responsible for pancreatic pseudocyst infection is vital for time-sensitive treatment and a more rapid recovery, curbing associated morbidity and mortality.","output":"Candida glabrata infection of a pancreatic pseudocyst in a COVID-19 patient: A case report and review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a major global health threat with a great number of deaths worldwide Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in patients admitted to the intensive care unit We aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors and in-hospital outcomes of AKI in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit Methods: we conducted a retrospective observational study in intensive care unit of Tongji hospital, which was assigned responsibility for the treatments of severe COVID-19 patients by Wuhan government The AKI was defined and staged based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria Mild AKI was defined as stage 1, and severe AKI was defined as stage 2 or stage 3 We used logistic regression analysis to evaluate AKI risk factors and the association between AKI and in-hospital mortality Results: A total of 150 patients with COVID-19 were included in our study The median age of patients was 70 (interquartile range, 60-80) years and 62 7% were male 70 (46 7%) patients developed AKI during hospitalization, corresponding to the 17 3% in stage 1 and 9 3% in stage 2 and 20 0% in stage 3, respectively Compared to patients without AKI, patients with AKI had higher proportion of mechanical ventilation mortality and higher in-hospital mortality 95 5% patients with severe AKI received mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality was up to 79 5% Severe AKI was independently associated with high in-hospital mortality (OR: 4 30;95% CI: 1 83-10 10) Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that high serum interleukin-6 (OR: 2 54;95%CI: 1 00-6 42) and interleukin-10 (OR: 3 02;95%CI: 1 17-7 82) were risk factors for severe AKI development Conclusions: severe AKI was associated with high in-hospital mortality and inflammatory response may play a role in AKI development in critically ill patients with COVID-19","output":"Risk factors and outcomes of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This literature review described the genetic and biochemical factors that may have been overlooked in the formulation of vaccines and that most likely underlie possible issues with mass vaccination.","output":"From Genetics to Epigenetics: Top 4 Aspects for Improved SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Designs as Paradigmatic Examples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text].","output":"Exponential growth, high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, and vaccine effectiveness associated with the Delta variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Statistical laws of information avalanches in social media appear, at least according to existing empirical studies, not robust across systems.

Standard treatment consists of daily radiation for five weeks which can be challenging for patients and the healthcare system, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hypofractionated radiotherapy has been evaluated and established in other pelvic malignancies. This study aims to evaluate the acute urinary and bowel toxicities, and patient reported outcomes following stereotactic hypofractionated adjuvant radiation for endometrial cancer. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective phase I/II trial in which patients with endometrial cancer planned for adjuvant radiation received 30Gy in 5 fractions, every other day or once weekly. Treatment was delivered at two centres with volumetric arc radiation therapy with a body-vacuum immobilization, bowel enema and 3D image-guidance. Toxicity assessment, outcomes and patient reported quality of life (QOL, EORTC core QLQ-C30 and endometrial EN24) were collected at baseline, fractions (F) 3 and 5, and at regular follow-up intervals. Higher scores represent better global QOL/health status or worse symptoms (scale 0 -100). Changes in QOL over time were investigated with linear mixed-effects models. A p-value threshold of 0.05 was used for statistical significance. A change in QOL score of > 10 points was considered clinically significant. Results: The median age of the 41 enrolled patients is 66 (range: 51 - 88). Histologies included 29 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, eight serous/clear cell, one carcinosarcoma, and three dedifferentiated. Thirty patients had Stage I disease while three had Stage 2 and eight Stage 3. Seven patients received sequential chemotherapy and 3 had additional vault brachytherapy. Median follow-up is nine months, with worst toxicity (GI or GU) of Grade 1 and 2 in 63% and 24% respectively. No patients have experienced a Grade 3 or higher toxicity. Patient-reported diarrhea and gastrointestinal domain scores were statistically significantly worse than baseline at F5 (mean paired difference = 27.2;8.7, p<.005) and six weeks (mean paired difference = 7.9;5.1, p<0.05), and returned to baseline levels at 12 weeks. The only clinically significant change (>10) from baseline was in diarrhea at F5. There were no significant changes in urinary domain, overall health and quality of life scores. No loco-regional recurrences have been found;three patients recurred distantly, of which two died of metastatic disease. Conclusions: Stereotactic hypofractionated radiation is feasible and well-tolerated with short-term follow-up.

First, it is performed using only four sutures. Second, the pancreas stump is invaginated into the jejunum, mainly by two sutures that penetrate the parenchyma and are continuously purse-string sutured to the jejunum. Third, all needle holes on the surface of the pancreas are covered with the jejunal wall. RESULTS Eight patients were classified as showing no pancreatic fistula, and seven displayed a grade A fistula, according to the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula criteria. The median operating time for these 15 patients using the present procedure was about 60 min shorter than that for the previous nine patients who underwent duct-to-mucosa pancreaticogastrostomy in our hospital.

Unfortunately, it is highly probable that the oblique corpectomy (OC) will not be included in cost-benefit investigations due to its infrequent application by neurosurgeons dealing with the spine. In this cadaveric study, head and necks of 5 adult human cadavers stained with colored latex and preserved in 70% alcohol solution were dissected under a table-mounted surgical microscope using 3 to 40 magnifications. The OC approach was performed to simulate real surgery, and the neurovascular structures encountered during the procedure and their relations with each other were examined. Oblique corpectomy was performed unilaterally, although neck dissections were performed bilaterally on 10 sides in all 5 cadavers. At each stage of the dissection, multiple three-dimensional photographs were obtained from different angles and distances. For an optimal OC, both the anterior spinal cord must be sufficiently decompressed and sufficient bone must be left in place to prevent instability in the cervical spine. Oblique corpectomy is a valid and potentially low cost alternative to other anterior and posterior approaches in the surgical treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy. However, meticulous cadaver studies are essential before starting real surgical practice on patients in order to perform it effectively and to avoid the risks of the technique.","output":"Cervical Oblique Corpectomy: Revitalizing the Underused Surgical Approach With Step-By-Step Simulation in Cadavers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wheat is an important crop, used as staple food in numerous countries around the world. However, wheat productivity is low in the developing world due to several biotic and abiotic stresses, particularly drought stress. Non-availability of drought-tolerant wheat genotypes at different growth stages is the major constraint in improving wheat productivity in the developing world. Therefore, screening/developing drought-tolerant genotypes at different growth stages could improve the productivity of wheat. This study assessed seed germination and seedling growth of eight wheat genotypes under polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced stress. Two PEG-induced osmotic potentials (i.e., -0.6 and -1.2 MPa) were included in the study along with control (0 MPa). Wheat genotypes included in the study were 'KLR-16', 'B6', 'J10', '716', 'A12', 'Seher', 'KTDH-16', and 'J4'. Data relating to seed germination percentage, root and shoot length, fresh and dry weight of roots and shoot, root/shoot length ratio and chlorophyll content were recorded. The studied parameters were significantly altered by individual and interactive effects of genotypes and PEG-induced osmotic potentials. Seed germination and growth parameters were reduced by osmotic potentials; however, huge differences were noted among genotypes. A reduction of 32.83 to 53.50% was recorded in seed germination, 24.611 to 47.75% in root length, 37.83 to 53.72% in shoot length, and 53.35 to 65.16% in root fresh weight. The genotypes, 'J4', 'KLR-16' and 'KTDH-16', particularly 'J4' better tolerated increasing osmotic potentials compared to the rest of the genotypes included in the study. Principal component analysis segregated these genotypes from the rest of the genotypes included in the study indicated that these can be used in the future studies to improve the drought tolerance of wheat crop.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Health care workers from seven hospitals were enrolled and prospectively followed in a multicenter observational study. Subjects downloaded a custom smart phone app and wore Apple Watches for the duration of the study period. Daily surveys related to symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19 were answered in the app. RESULTS: We enrolled 407 participants with 49 (12%) having a positive nasal SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test during follow-up. We examined five machine-learning approaches and found that gradient-boosting machines (GBM) had the most favorable validation performance. Across all testing sets, our GBM model predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC) = 86.4% (Confidence Interval 84-89%). The model was calibrated to value sensitivity over specificity, achieving an average sensitivity of 82% (CI 4%) and specificity of 77% (CI 1%). The most important predictors included parameters describing the circadian heart rate variability mean (MESOR) and peak-timing (acrophase), and age. DISCUSSION: We show that a tree-based ML algorithm applied to physiological metrics passively collected from a wearable device can identify and predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: Applying machine learning models to the passively collected physiological metrics from wearable devices may improve SARS-CoV-2 screening methods and infection tracking. LAY SUMMARY: The goal of the study is to determine if SARS-CoV-2 infections, which cause Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), can be detected using machine learning algorithms applied to the information collected by wearable devices. Four hundred and nine health care workers were enrolled from 7 hospitals in New York City. Participants downloaded a custom smart phone application and were provided with an Apple Watch, if they did not have one of their own. Daily questions collected information from participants about how they feel and whether they were diagnosed with COVID-19. We found that a type of machine learning algorithm, called gradient boosting machines was able to reliably predict SARS-CoV-2 infections by combining various metrics collected from the Apple Watch. We found markers of heart rate variability, or the calculation of the small-time differences between each heartbeat, to be important in identifying infections. These findings demonstrate that wearable devices may improve screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections and the overall tracking of infections.","output":"Evaluation of a Machine Learning Approach Utilizing Wearable Data for Prediction of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research, the fourteen commonly used antiviral drugs were investigated through the computational tools against CoV-19 or SARS-2, as well as two small bioactive molecules from the cannabis plant, Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabinol (CBN).

However, it remains unclear whether true re-infection occurs. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was performed directly on respiratory specimens collected during two episodes of COVID-19 in a patient. Comparative genome analysis was conducted to differentiate re-infection from persistent viral shedding. Laboratory results, including RT-PCR Ct values and serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG, were analyzed. RESULTS: The second episode of asymptomatic infection occurred 142 days after the first symptomatic episode in an apparently immunocompetent patient. During the second episode, there was serological evidence of elevated C-reactive protein and SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. Viral genomes from first and second episodes belong to different clades/lineages. Compared to viral genomes in GISAID, the first virus genome has a stop codon at position 64 of orf8 leading to a truncation of 58 amino acids, and was phylogenetically closely related to strains collected in March/April 2020, while the second virus genome was closely related to strains collected in July/August 2020.

The use of an essential oil endowed with analgesic properties and devoid of toxicity would represent an important option for the management of agitation in dementia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to engineer a nanotechnology delivery system based on solid lipid nanoparticles loaded with bergamot essential oil (BEO) and devised in the pharmaceutical form of an odorless cream (NanoBEO) to confirm its analgesic efficacy for further development and application to control agitation in dementia. BEO has proven strong antinociceptive and anti-allodynic properties and, in its bergapten-free form, it is completely devoid of phototoxicity. NanoBEO has been studied in vivo confirming the previously reported analgesic activity of BEO to which is now added its anti-itching properties. Due to the nanotechnology delivery system, the stability of titrated BEO components is guaranteed. Finally, the latter invention, currently under patent consideration, is smell-devoid allowing efficacy and safety to be established in double-blind clinical trials; until now the latter studies have been impeded in aromatherapy by the strong odor of essential oils.

It has historically been deployed to streamline healthcare delivery and reach those who would previously have faced obstacles to accessing services. It has also enabled improved health education and management. Telemedicine can be employed in everything from primary care consultations to the monitoring of chronic diseases. Despite recommendation by the World Health Organization, countries have been slow to embrace such technology in the health sector. Nonetheless, it is expected to become more prevalent with increased digitization. Further, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a rush to implement forms of telemedicine where possible to prevent patients breaking social distancing rules. In this paper, I present and defend what I term the 'telemedical imperative'. The telemedical imperative represents a duty for healthcare systems to implement remote access to services where possible, thereby furthering the mission of equity in access to healthcare. It is intended as an addition to in-person services rather than a replacement. After highlighting the benefits of telemedicine, I provide four criteria that must be met for the telemedical imperative to arise. The first three-safety, effectiveness, and acceptability-are consistent and essential. The fourth adapts to the service in question and requires that there be no other obstacles specific to that service that cannot reasonably be overcome.

METHODS: We performed a multicentre retrospective cohort study in 18 tertiary hospitals in Spain from March to April 2020. Consecutive patients admitted with severe COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab were compared to patients not treated with tocilizumab, adjusting by inverse probability of the treatment weights (IPTW). Tocilizumab's effect in patients receiving steroids during the 48 h following inclusion was analysed. RESULTS: During the study period, 506 patients with severe COVID-19 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Among them, 268 were treated with tocilizumab and 238 patients were not. Median time to tocilizumab treatment from onset of symptoms was 11 days [interquartile range (IQR) 8-14]. Global mortality was 23.7%. Mortality was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab than in controls: 16.8% versus 31.5%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.514 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.355-0.744], p < 0.001; weighted HR 0.741 (95% CI 0.619-0.887), p = 0.001. Tocilizumab treatment reduced mortality by 14.7% relative to no tocilizumab treatment [relative risk reduction (RRR) 46.7%]. We calculated a number necessary to treat of 7. Among patients treated with steroids, mortality was lower in those treated with tocilizumab than in those treated with steroids alone [10.9% versus 40.2%, HR 0.511 (95% CI 0.352-0.741), p = 0.036; weighted HR 0.6 (95% CI 0.449-0.804), p < 0.001] (interaction p = 0.094). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that survival of patients with severe COVID-19 is higher in those treated with tocilizumab than in those not treated and that tocilizumab's effect adds to that of steroids administered to non-intubated patients with COVID-19 during the first 48 h of presenting with respiratory failure despite oxygen therapy.

METHODS In total, 7,706 pancreatoduodenectomies performed at 18 international institutions composing the Pancreas Fistula Study Group were examined (2003-2020). High estimated blood loss (>700 mL) was defined as twice the median. Propensity score matching (1:1 exact-match) was employed to adjust for variables associated with high estimated blood loss and clinically relevant pancreatic fistula occurrence. The study was powered to detect a 33% clinically relevant pancreatic fistula increase in the high estimated blood loss group, with  = 0.05 and  = 0.2. RESULTS The propensity score model included 966 patients with high estimated blood loss and 966 patients with lower estimated blood loss; all covariate imbalantces were solved. Patients with high estimated blood loss patients experienced higher clinically relevant pancreatic fistula rates (19.4 vs 12.6%, odds ratio 1.66; P < .001), as well as higher severe complication rates (27.8 vs 15.6%), transfusions (50.1 vs 14.3%), reoperations (9.2 vs 4.0%), intensive care unit transfers (9.9 vs 4.8%) and 90-day mortality (4.7 vs 2.0%, all P < .001). High estimated blood loss was an independent predictor for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula (odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.37-2.32), as were prophylactic Octreotide administration (odds ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval 1.46-2.61) and soft pancreatic texture (odds ratio 5.32, 95% confidence interval 3.74-5.57; all P < .001). Moreover, a second model including 1,126 pancreatoduodenectomies was derived including vascular resections as additional confounder (14.0% vascular resections performed in each group). On multivariable regression, high estimated blood loss was confirmed an independent predictor for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula reduction (odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.32-2.44; P < .001), whereas vascular resection was not (odds ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.34-1.88; P = .156). CONCLUSION This study better establishes the relationship between estimated blood loss and outcomes after pancreatoduodenectomy. Despite inherent contributions to blood loss, its minimization is an actionable opportunity for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula reduction and performance optimization in pancreatoduodenectomy.

PURPOSE To examine the effects of intensive BP-lowering treatment on OH in hypertensive adults. (PROSPERO: CRD42020153753). DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception through 7 October 2019, without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION Randomized trials of BP pharmacologic treatment (more intensive BP goal or active agent) that involved more than 500 adults with hypertension or elevated BP and that were 6 months or longer in duration. Trial comparisons were groups assigned to either less intensive BP goals or placebo, and the outcome was measured OH, defined as a decrease of 20 mm Hg or more in systolic BP or 10 mm Hg or more in diastolic BP after changing position from seated to standing. DATA EXTRACTION Two investigators independently abstracted articles and rated risk of bias. DATA SYNTHESIS Five trials examined BP treatment goals, and 4 examined active agents versus placebo. Trials examining BP treatment goals included 18 466 participants with 127 882 follow-up visits. Trials were open-label, with minimal heterogeneity of effects across trials. Intensive BP treatment lowered risk for OH (odds ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.99]). Effects did not differ by prerandomization OH (P for interaction = 0.80). In sensitivity analyses that included 4 additional placebo-controlled trials, overall and subgroup findings were unchanged. LIMITATIONS Assessments of OH were done while participants were seated (not supine) and did not include the first minute after standing. Data on falls and syncope were not available. CONCLUSION Intensive BP-lowering treatment decreases risk for OH.

In the case of HIV-1, we and others reported the existence of an additional antiviral mechanism through which IFITMs lead to the production of virions of reduced infectivity. However, whether this second mechanism of inhibition is unique to HIV or extends to other viruses is currently unknown. To address this question, we have analyzed the susceptibility of a broad spectrum of viruses to the negative imprinting of the virion particles infectivity by IFITMs. The results we have gathered indicate that this second antiviral property of IFITMs extends well beyond HIV and we were able to identify viruses susceptible to the three IFITMs altogether (HIV-1, SIV, MLV, MPMV, VSV, MeV, EBOV, WNV), as well as viruses that displayed a member-specific susceptibility (EBV, DUGV), or were resistant to all IFITMs (HCV, RVFV, MOPV, AAV). The swapping of genetic elements between resistant and susceptible viruses allowed us to point to specificities in the viral mode of assembly, rather than glycoproteins as dominant factors of susceptibility. However, we also show that, contrarily to X4-, R5-tropic HIV-1 envelopes confer resistance against IFITM3, suggesting that viral receptors add an additional layer of complexity in the IFITMs-HIV interplay. Lastly, we show that the overall antiviral effects ascribed to IFITMs during spreading infections, are the result of a bimodal inhibition in which IFITMs act both by protecting target cells from incoming viruses and in driving the production of virions of reduced infectivity. Overall, our study reports for the first time that the negative imprinting of the virion particles infectivity is a conserved antiviral property of IFITMs and establishes IFITMs as a paradigm of restriction factor capable of interfering with two distinct phases of a virus life cycle.","output":"Interference with the production of infectious viral particles and bimodal inhibition of replication are broadly conserved antiviral properties of IFITMs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a global emergency, that demands urgent solutions for detection and therapy to prevent escalating health, social, and economic impacts. The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells. The S proteins from SARS and SARS-CoV-2 are similar, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced reference Betacoronaviruses, complemented with functional and structural analyses. This analysis reveals that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant cluster shared by SARS and SARS-CoV-2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, namely an ion-channel, and a PDZ-binding motif (PBM). These features play a key role in the activation of the inflammasome causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome, the leading cause of death in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Together with functional pangenomic analysis, mutation tracking, and previous evidence, on E protein as a determinant of pathogenicity in SARS, we suggest E protein as an alternative therapeutic target to be considered for further studies to reduce complications of SARS-CoV-2 infections in COVID-19.","output":"Functional Pangenome Analysis Shows Key Features of E Protein Are Preserved in SARS and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic, a reorganization of the health care sector was needed Many questions arose concerning the specificity of psychiatric care in this unprecedented situation In Geneva, Switzerland, the department of psychiatry decided to open a new ward for its infected patients Beyond the challenge of setting it up quickly, we faced the challenges of taking care of a heterogeneous group of patients and of incorporating protection measures we were not accustomed to, which add a significant amount of time to the daily care of patients The staff recruitment on a voluntary basis, close supervision, availability of the personal protective material as well as support from the infection prevention and control unit have enabled proper functioning of the ward","output":"COVID-19 plastic surgery recovery plan: The Malaysian experience [COVID-19 and psychiatry : urgent opening of a cohort ward at Geneva's psychiatric hospital]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 has emerged as a major global health threat with a great number of deaths in China. We aimed to assess the association between Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and to compare the predictive ability of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, Age 65 (CURB65) score. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort. SETTING: Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. SUBJECTS: Confirmed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized in the ICU of Tongji hospital from January 10, 2020, to February 10, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 178 potentially eligible patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, 23 patients (12.92%) were diagnosed as suspected cases, and one patient (0.56%) suffered from cardiac arrest immediately after admission. Ultimately, 154 patients were enrolled in the analysis and 52 patients (33.77%) died. Mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (23.23  6.05) was much higher in deaths compared with the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 10.87  4.40 in survivors (p < 0.001). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was independently associated with hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.13). In predicting hospital mortality, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score demonstrated better discriminative ability (area under the curve, 0.966; 95% CI, 0.942-0.990) than Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (area under the curve, 0.867; 95% CI, 0.808-0.926) and CURB65 score (area under the curve, 0.844; 95% CI, 0.784-0.905). Based on the cut-off value of 17, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score could predict the death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with a sensitivity of 96.15% and a specificity of 86.27%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the survivor probability of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score less than 17 was notably higher than that of patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was an effective clinical tool to predict hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and CURB65 score. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 serves as an early warning indicator of death and may provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.","output":"Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II Score as a Predictor of Hospital Mortality in Patients of Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic has had unprecedented effects on individual lives and livelihoods as well as on social, health, economic and political systems and structures across the world. This article derives from a unique collaboration between researchers and museums using rapid response crowdsourcing to document contemporary life among the general public during the pandemic crisis in Sweden. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We use qualitative analysis to explore the narrative crowdsourced submissions of the same 88 individuals at two timepoints, during the 1(st) and 2(nd) pandemic waves, about what they most fear in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic, and how their descriptions changed over time. In this self-selected group, we found that aspects they most feared generally concerned responses to the pandemic on a societal level, rather than to the Covid-19 disease itself or other health-related issues. The most salient fears included a broad array of societal issues, including general societal collapse and fears about effects on social and political interactions among people with resulting impact on political order. Notably strong support for the Swedish pandemic response was expressed, despite both national and international criticism. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis fills a notable gap in research literature that lacks subjective and detailed investigation of experiences of the general public, despite recognition of the widespread effects of Covid-19 and its management strategies. Findings address controversy about the role of experts in formulating and communicating strategy, as well as implications of human responses to existential threats. Based on this analysis, we call for broader focus on societal issues related to this existential threat and the responses to it.","output":"Fearing fear itself: Crowdsourced longitudinal data on Covid-19-related fear in Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this cross\\\\sectional study was to examine factors associated with nurses' resilience during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

Ample evidence indicates that risk for OUD is heritable. As a surrogate (or proxy) for OUD, we explored the genetic basis of using prescription opioids not as prescribed. We hypothesized that misuse of opiates might be a heritable risk factor for OUD. To test this hypothesis, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of problematic opioid use (POU) in 23andMe research participants of European ancestry (N = 132,113;21% cases). We identified two genome-wide significant loci (rs3791033, an intronic variant of KDM4A;rs640561, an intergenic variant near LRRIQ3). POU showed positive genetic correlations with the two largest available GWAS of OUD and opioid dependence (rg = 0.64, 0.80, respectively). We also identified numerous additional genetic correlations with POU, including alcohol dependence (rg = 0.74), smoking initiation (rg = 0.63), pain relief medication intake (rg = 0.49), major depressive disorder (rg = 0.44), chronic pain (rg = 0.42), insomnia (rg = 0.39), and loneliness (rg = 0.28). Although POU was positively genetically correlated with risk-taking (rg = 0.38), conditioning POU on risk-taking did not substantially alter the magnitude or direction of these genetic correlations, suggesting that POU does not simply reflect a genetic tendency towards risky behavior. Lastly, we performed phenome- and lab-wide association analyses, which uncovered additional phenotypes that were associated with POU, including respiratory failure, insomnia, ischemic heart disease, and metabolic and blood-related biomarkers. We conclude that opioid misuse can be measured in population-based cohorts and provides a cost-effective complementary strategy for understanding the genetic basis of OUD.","output":"Genome-wide association study of problematic opioid prescription use in 132,113 23andMe research participants of European ancestry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection poses a major threat to the lungs and multiple other organs, occasionally causing death.

When implementing a metric, they need to promote sense-making of relevant stakeholders. (2) Sense-making shall be encouraged because it is a social process to understand a metric, align values and develop a coherent strategy. Sense-making is important to (3) cope with self-organised gaming behaviours and to (4) facilitate interdependencies between ED and other departments as well as organisations.

Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence and associated death of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Databases of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and MdeRxiv were searched. Studies that could calculate the prevalence of ventricular arrhythmia/SCD during hospital admission or associated death in patients with COVID-19 were included. The study was registered with the PROSPERO (CRD42021271328). RESULTS: A total of 21 studies with 13,790 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of ventricular arrhythmia was 5% (95% CI: 4C6%), with a relatively high-SCD prevalence (1.8% in hospitalized COVID-19 and 10% in deceased cases of COVID-19). Subgroup analysis showed that ventricular arrhythmia was more common in patients with elevated cardiac troponin T [ES (effect size): 10%, 95% CI: ?0.2 to 22%] and in European (ES: 20%, 95% CI: 11C29%) populations.

METHODS Fluid warming was evaluated at 50, 100 and 200 mL/min at a constant input temperature of 20C and 10C using a cardiopulmonary bypass roller pump and cooler. Output temperature was continuously recorded. RESULTS Performance of fluid warmers varied with flows and input temperatures. At an input temperature of 20C and flow of 50 mL/min, the Buddy Lite, enFlow, Thermal Angel and Warrior warmed 3.4, 2.4, 1 and 3.6 L to over 35C, respectively. However, at an input temperature of 10C and flow of 200 mL/min, the Buddy Lite failed to warm, the enFlow warmed 3.3 L to 25.7C, the Thermal Angel warmed 1.5 L to 20.9C and the Warrior warmed 3.4 L to 34.4C (p<0.0001).

Using a nationally representative sample of UK residents (N = 32,108), we showed that although the stay-home order during the COVID-19 pandemic lowered people's life satisfaction and increased their mental distress, this was moderated by confidence in government. Specifically, the mental health toll of movement restrictions was reliably reduced amongst citizens who had a high degree of confidence in their government, especially when the restrictions were stringent and when people were strongly adhering to this mandate. We conclude with recommendations that could help to optimize public trust in government.","output":"Stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives!

It has been shown that the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 through ACE2 can be blocked by cellular TMPRSS2 blockers. The main aim of this study was to find potential inhibitor(s) of TMPRSS2 through virtual screening against a homology model of TMPRSS2 using the library of marine natural products (MNPs). The homology modeling technique for generating a three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 was applied. Molecular docking, MM-GBSA and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) evaluations were performed to investigate the inhibitory activity of marine natural products (MNPs) against TMPRSS2 and their pharmacokinetic properties. Camostat and nafamostat mesylate were used as the standard inhibitory molecules. Seven MNPs were able to inhibit TMPRSS2 better than the standard compounds. MNP 10 with CAS number 107503-09-3, called Watasenia -D- Preluciferyl glucopyrasoiuronic acid, was found to be the best inhibitor of TMPRSS2 with acceptable pharmacokinetic properties. Herein, for the first time, a new marine natural product was introduced with potent inhibitory effects against TMPRSS2.

As multifunctional components of vascular structures, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are the promising source for potential therapeutic applications in various vascular diseases. Our laboratory has previously established an approach for differentiating porcine epiblast stem cells (pEpiSCs) into ECs, representing an alternative and potentially superior cell source. However, the condition of pEpiSCs-derived ECs growth has yet to be determined, and whether pEpiSCs differentiate into functional ECs remained unclear. Changes in morphology, proliferation and functional endothelial marker were assessed in pEpiSCs-derived ECs in vitro. pEpiSCs-derived ECs were subjected to magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) to collect CD-31+ of ECs. We found that sorted ECs showed the highest proliferation rate in differentiation media in primary culture and M199 media in the subculture. Next, sorted ECs were examined for their ability to act as typical vascular ECs through capillary-like structure formation assay, Dil-acetylated low-density lipoprotein (Dil-Ac-LDL) uptake, and three-dimensional spheroid sprouting. Consequently, pEpiSCs-derived ECs function as typical vascular ECs, indicating that pEpiSC-derived ECs might be used to develop cell therapeutics for vascular disease.","output":"Functional Characterization of Endothelial Cells Differentiated from Porcine Epiblast Stem Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A first-person account of some victims of the virus, the author puts faces and circumstances to the tragedy of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Detrimental effects of COVID-19 on retinal structure have recently been reported in adult population. However, literature data about neonatal population is very scarce. Thus, we aimed to assess possible retinal changes of neonates recovered from COVID-19 infection in this prospective, observational, descriptive study. METHODS: The neonates recovered from COVID-19 infection were included to the study between 01 September 2020 and 30 April 2021. Their initial ophthalmological examination was made after a negative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction obtained and all patients were re-examined 1 month later. All examinations were performed by same retina specialist using a binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy. RESULTS: A total of 15 neonates [9 (60%) male, 6 (40%) female, mean gestational age of 38.9  0.9 weeks (ranging from 37 to 40 week)] were evaluated in the study. The mean age at the time of hospitalization was 17.5  8.7 days (ranging from 2 to 29 days), and the mean duration of hospitalization was 12.5  6.2 days (ranging from 4 to 27 days).

Here, using microarray approach, we identified 618 lncRNAs and 1,007 mRNAs differentially expressed in JEV-infected mice brain. The functional annotation analysis revealed that differentially regulated transcripts were predominantly involved in various signaling pathways related to host immune and inflammatory responses. The lncRNAs with their potential to regulate JEV-induced inflammatory response were identified by constructing the lncRNA-mRNA coexpression network.

This study was carried out to assess the change in patient attendance and the efficacy of newly implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on services at the Lanka Hospital Blood Cancer Centre (LHBCC) in Colombo, Sri Lanka. METHODOLOGY: Telephone consultation, infection control, personal protective measures and emergency admission policy were implemented with the aim of having a Covid-19 free ward and to prevent cross-infections. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 1399 patient episodes (in-patient care or day-case review). We analysed patients treated as in-patient as well as day-case basis between 01(st) April 2020 and 31(st) December 2020. RESULTS: There were 977 day-case based episodes and 422 in-patient based episodes. There was a 14% drop in episode numbers compared to same period in 2019. There was no cross infection and no patients with Covid-19 related symptoms or positive test results entered the LHBCC during the study period.

Therefore, an in-depth study of the molecular mechanism of the development of ccRCC and exploration of new targets for the treatment of ccRCC will help to achieve precise treatment for ccRCC. With the development of molecular research, the study of long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) has given us a new understanding of tumors. Although LncRNA does not encode proteins, it directly interacts with proteins in various signaling pathways and affects cell functions. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the mechanism of LncRNA in ccRCC. The expression level of Linc00472 in ccRCC tissues is significantly lower than adjacent normal tissues, and its low expression is closely related to Furman's high grade. The low expression of Linc00472 is associated with poor prognosis in patients with ccRCC. The results of protein interaction and functional enrichment analysis indicate that genes upregulated in renal clear cell carcinoma may play a major role. Analysis of target gene prediction results showed that Linc00472 may be used as ceRNA in the miR-24-3p-HLA-DPB1 pathway, miR-24-3p-CXCL9 pathway, miR-221-3p-C3aR1-VEGFR2 pathway, miR-17-5p-HLA-DQA1/HLA-DQB1 pathway, and miR-17-5p-C3aR1/C5aR1-VEGFR2 pathway which play important functions. In addition, the regulatory relationship between miR-24-3p and TNFR2 (TNFRSF1B), CD36, and COL4A1 should also be noted. The value of Linc00472 in the diagnosis and treatment of ccRCC is worthy of further study.","output":"Comprehensive Analysis of Regulatory Network for LINC00472 in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, transit agencies experienced ridership and revenue losses alongside operating cost increases. At the same time, transit was further highlighted as an essential public good alongside essential workers who relied on transit to conduct a range of services in critical industries, thus emphasizing the role of transit in promoting accessibility, equity, and economic opportunity. In grappling with the current volatile environment, including the ongoing travel and financial uncertainties from the pandemic, transit agencies have attempted to delicately balance fares and financing. In turn, many have considered progressive fare policies such as fare capping. For transit agencies seeking innovative fare changes, fare impact and equity analyses are necessary to better understand how riders respond to fares and changes in fares, and how changes to fares and ridership affect accessibility, equity, revenue, and funding. With the increased use of mobile ticketing, small to mid-sized transit agencies now have access to detailed rider behavior data that can be used to estimate rider responses to fare structure changes. In this paper, we present a multinomial logit fare product choice model that uses rider insight from a sample of mobile ticketing data to account for switching between fare products. We apply the model to forecast the ridership response to incremental fare changes and fare capping.","output":"Fare-Capping Impact Analysis Using Mobile Ticket Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To assess non-compliance and potential changes in seasonal flu vaccination coverage before and during the Covid-19 pandemic in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs).

Current approaches mainly rely on single key gene targets, which are constrained by the information currently available in the knowledge base and make interpretation challenging as scientists need to interpret PoDs for thousands of genes or hundreds of pathways. In this work, we aimed to address these issues by developing a computational workflow to investigate the pathway concentrationCresponse relationships in a way that is not fully constrained by known biology and also facilitates interpretation. We employed the Pathway-Level Information ExtractoR (PLIER) to identify latent variables (LVs) describing biological activity and then investigated in vitro LVs concentrationCresponse relationships using the ToxCast pipeline. We applied this methodology to a published transcriptomic concentrationCresponse data set for 44 chemicals in MCF-7 cells and showed that our workflow can capture known biological activity and discriminate between estrogenic and antiestrogenic compounds as well as activity not aligning with the existing knowledge base, which may be relevant in a risk assessment scenario. Moreover, we were able to identify the known estrogen activity in compounds that are not well-established ER agonists/antagonists supporting the use of the workflow in read-across. Next, we transferred its application to chemical compounds tested in HepG2, HepaRG, and MCF-7 cells and showed that PoD estimates are in strong agreement with those estimated using a recently developed Bayesian approach (cor = 0.89) and in weak agreement with those estimated using a well-established approach such as BMDExpress2 (cor = 0.57). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using PLIER in a concentrationCresponse scenario to investigate pathway activity in a way that is not fully constrained by the knowledge base and to ease the biological interpretation and support the development of an NGRA framework with the ability to improve current risk assessment strategies for chemicals using new approach methodologies.","output":"Latent Variables Capture Pathway-Level Points of Departure in High-Throughput Toxicogenomic Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The tremendous advancements in nanotechnology have given life to the technology called Lab-on-Chip (LoC).

Those caring for critically ill patients are especially susceptible due to high patient mortality, long hours, and regular encounters with trauma and ethical issues. Interventions to prevent burnout in this population are needed. Preliminary studies suggest debriefing sessions may reduce burnout. This study aims to assess whether participation in regular debriefing can prevent burnout in intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians. Methods: : A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in two large academic medical centers. 200 ICU clinicians will be recruited with target enrollment of 100 physicians and 100 non-physicians (nurses, pharmacists, therapists). Participants must have worked in the ICU for the equivalent of at least 1 full time work week in the preceding 4 weeks. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to virtually attend biweekly debriefing sessions facilitated by a psychotherapist for 3 months or to a control arm without sessions. Our debriefs are modelled after Death Cafs, which are informal discussions focusing on death, dying, loss, grief and illness. These sessions allow for reflection on distressing events and offer community and collaboration among hospital employees outside of work. The primary outcome is clinician burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Score. Secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety, as measured by the patient health questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) and generalized anxiety disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), respectively. Questionnaires will be administered prior to the intervention, at 1 month, at 3 months, and at 6 months after enrollment. These values will be compared between groups temporally. Qualitative feedback will also be collected and analyzed. This trial was registered prospectively with clinicaltrials.gov on April 15, 2020 (NCT04347811). Discussion: With ICU clinician burnout rates exceeding 50%, Death Caf debriefing sessions may prove to be an effective tool to avert this debilitating syndrome. With COVID-19 limiting social interactions and overloading ICUs worldwide, the virtual administration of the Death Caf for ICU clinicians provides an innovative strategy to potentially mitigate burnout in this vulnerable population.","output":"Death Cafes for Prevention of Burnout in Intensive Care Unit Employees: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial (STOPTHEBURN)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates changes in persistence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the US and EA yield curves.

The motifs reconstructed by TAMGI are robust with respect to indels and point mutations and can be tried as putative therapeutic targets. We developed and tested the relevant theory and statistical criteria for TAMGI applications. The applications of TAMGI are illustrated by the study of motifs in the genomes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (the latter coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 being responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic) packaged within filament-like helical capsid. Such ribonucleocapsid is transported into spherical membrane envelope with incorporated spike glycoproteins. Two other examples concern the genomes of viruses with icosahedral capsids, satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) and bacteriophage PHIX174. A part of the quasi-periodic motifs in these viral genomes was evolved due to weakly specific cooperative interaction between genomic ssRNA/ssDNA and nucleocapsid proteins. The symmetry of the capsids leads to the natural selection of specific quasi-periodic motifs in the related genomic sequences. Generally, TAMGI provides a convenient tool for the study of numerous molecular mechanisms with participation of both quasi-periodic motifs and complete repeats, the genome organization, contextual analysis of cis/trans regulatory elements, data mining, and correlations in the genomic sequences.","output":"Combining detection and reconstruction of correlational and quasi-periodic motifs in viral genomic sequences with transitional genome mapping: Application to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the delivery of health services across the world.

Accumulating evidence underscores the importance of facemasks, as worn by the general public, in limiting the spread of infection. Accordingly, mask wearing has become increasingly mandatory in public places such as stores and on public transit. Although the public has been generally adherent to mask wearing, a small but vocal group of individuals refuse to wear masks. Anti-mask protest rallies have occurred in many places throughout the world, sometimes erupting violently. Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between anti-mask attitudes and mask non-adherence and little is known about how such attitudes relate to one another or other factors (e.g., non-adherence to social distancing, anti-vaccination attitudes). To investigate these issues, the present study surveyed 2,078 adults from the US and Canada. Consistent with other surveys, we found that most (84%) people wore masks because of COVID-19. The 16% who did not wear masks scored higher on most measures of negative attitudes towards masks. Network analyses indicated that negative attitudes about masks formed an intercorrelated network, with the central nodes in the network being (a) beliefs that masks are ineffective in preventing COVID-19, and (b) psychological reactance (PR;i.e., an aversion to being forced to wear masks). These central nodes served as links, connecting the network of anti-masks attitudes to negative attitudes toward SARSCoV2 vaccination, beliefs that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, disregard for social distancing, and political conservatism. Findings regarding PR are important because, theoretically, PR is likely to strengthen other anti-masks attitudes (e.g., beliefs that masks are ineffective) because people with strong PR react with anger and counter-arguments when their beliefs are challenged, thereby leading to a strengthening of their anti-mask beliefs. Implications for improving mask adherence are discussed.","output":"Negative attitudes about facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic: the dual importance of perceived ineffectiveness and psychological reactance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES This study examined whether outpatient haemodialysis providers changed their treatment practices with the establishment of an outpatient dialysis global budget (ODGB) through analysing the outpatient visits and medication received by those patients.

The impact of ODGB on hypertension-related outpatient utilization of HH was estimated using the difference in difference (DID) method and examined in three stages: (1) the fee for service stage, the pre-ODGB (2000), (2) the phase-in stage (2001-2002) and (3) the post-ODGB stage (2003-2005). RESULTS ODGB implementation did not affect the number of dialysis visits for HH patients. However, it did lead to a reduction in fees for antihypertension drugs used by haemodialysis facilities. There was an increase of 4.06 visits per patient per year (P < 0.001) in the number of non-dialysis outpatient with antihypertensive drugs visits for HH patients compared with the control group.

METHODS Enzyme-linked immunoassay kit for SARS coronavirus antibodies developed by HuaDa Biological Company was applied to detect specific serum IgG from SARS patients and the production of SARS specific antibodies among patients of different age groups, sex and with or without steroid treatment were statistically compared. RESULTS Out of 121 patients studied, 71.1% were SARS specific IgG positive. Patients younger than 15 years, between 15 to 59 years, older than 59 years had positive rates of 60.0%, 70.2%, and 85.7%, respectively with no statistically significance (P=0.766); patients with or without steroid treatment showed positive rates of 70.6% and 72.4%, respectively (P=0.84); patients exhibiting either severe or light syndromes showed positive rates of 78.1% and 67.4%, respectively (P=0.493); both male and female patients showed the same positive rate of 71.1%. CONCLUSION The sensitivity of the SARS specific IgG kit utilized needs to be further improved. The production of SARS IgG is not notably correlated with sex, age, seriousness of symptoms, and steroid treatment.","output":"[Studies on IgG antibodies of SARS patients]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent months, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and had a huge impact on the world. People under different conditions have very different attitudes toward the epidemic. Due to the real-time and large-scale nature of social media, we can continuously obtain a massive amount of public opinion information related to the epidemic from social media. In particular, researchers may ask questions such as \\"how is the public reacting to COVID-19 in China during different stages of the pandemic?\\", \\"what factors affect the public opinion orientation in China?\\", and so on. To answer such questions, we analyze the pandemic related public opinion information on Weibo, China's largest social media platform. Specifically, we have first collected a large amount of COVID-19-related public opinion microblogs. We then use a sentiment classifier to recognize and analyze different groups of users' opinions. In the collected sentiment orientated microblogs, we try to track the public opinion through different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we analyze more key factors that might have an impact on the public opinion of COVID-19 (e.g., users in different provinces or users with different education levels). Empirical results show that the public opinions vary along with the key factors of COVID-19. Furthermore, we analyze the public attitudes on different public-concerning topics, such as staying at home and quarantine.","output":"Tracking Public Opinion in China through Various Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) infection is frequently associated with liver tests abnormalities. AIMS: To describe the evolution of liver involvement during SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection and its effect on clinical course and mortality. METHODS: Data of 515 SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 positive patients were collected at baseline and during follow\\\\up, last evaluation or death. Stratification based on need for hospitalization, severe disease and admission to intensive care unit (ICU) was performed. The association between liver tests abnormalities (baseline and peak values) and ICU admission or death was also explored. RESULTS: Liver tests abnormalities were found in 161 (31.3%) patients. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) were increased in 20.4%, 19% and 13.6% of patients, respectively. Baseline liver tests abnormalities were associated with increased risk of ICU admission (OR 2.19 [95%CI 1.24\\\\3.89], p=0.007) but not with mortality (OR 0.84 [95%CI 0.49\\\\1.41], p=0.51). Conversely, ALP peak values were correlated with the risk of death (OR 1.007 [95%CI 1.002\\\\1.01], p=0.005) along with age, multiple comorbidities, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ICU admission, and C\\\\reactive protein. Alterations of liver tests worsened within 15 days after hospitalization; however, in patients with the longest median follow\\\\up, the prevalence of liver tests alterations decreased over time, returning similar to that of baseline. CONCLUSIONS: In SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 positive patients without pre\\\\existing severe chronic liver disease, baseline liver tests abnormalities are associated with the risk of ICU admission and tend to normalize over time. ALP peak value seems to be predictive of a worse prognosis.","output":"Liver involvement is not associated with mortality: results from a large cohort of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 positive patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a new scenario archetypes method generated by extracting a set of archetypal images of the future from a sample of 140 science fiction films set in the future using a grounded theory analytical procedure.

This improves welfare if the peak exceeds the capacity of the healthcare system and the social loss rises rapidly enough in the number infected. The individual incentive to get infected early comes from the greater likelihood of receiving treatment than at the peak when the disease has overwhelmed healthcare capacity.

This study evaluates the contribution of pre-hospital exposure to medical students' clinical and professional development. METHODS Students were asked to complete a Likert-scale based survey on self-reported exposure and confidence in various aspects of acute patient assessment, communication and interprofessional education, both before and after the programme; additional qualitative questions querying their experience were asked post-programme. Pre and post-programme Likert-scale responses were matched and statistically analysed, alongside a thematic analysis of qualitative responses. RESULTS Exposure to ambulance service clinicians, confidence assessing acutely unwell patients, and confidence making clinical handovers all increased with statistical significance. Key areas of learning identified from the thematic analysis include increased confidence communicating with patients and families, and an enriched understanding of the work done by pre-hospital clinicians. CONCLUSIONS Time spent in the pre-hospital environment shadowing ambulance service clinicians positively contributes to acute care knowledge, inter-personal skills and interprofessional understanding.

The clinical impact of coinfection is unclear and may vary depending on the viral couples involved. Using three-dimensional reconstituted human airway epithelia and clinical viral strains, we investigated the interaction between influenza virus (Flu), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV). We showed that Flu and RSV interfere with RV replication, whereas RV does not interfere with either of these viruses. We then experimentally demonstrated that, when present, the interference is not related to a block of viral entry but rather to type I and type III interferon (IFN), the front-line antiviral defense of the respiratory mucosa. Consistent with this observation, we highlighted the differential sensitivity of each virus to IFNs, with RV being the only virus significantly inhibited by IFN- and the most sensitive to IFN-. Finally, as type III IFN is of therapeutic interest due to its low proinflammatory profile, we also assessed and confirmed an inhibitory effect of IFN- in the context of persistent RV infections. The present work provides mechanistic clues concerning innate immunity involvement during respiratory virus interactions and confirms that IFN- is a promising candidate in the treatment of RV infections.","output":"Interferon-Dependent and Respiratory Virus-Specific Interference in Dual Infections of Airway Epithelia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunological memory is divided into many levels to counteract the provocations of diverse and ever-changing infections.

Early vascular remodelling and epigenetic changes occurring on key endothelial genes might precede this altered vascular function. Further, it has been proposed that oxidative stress during development may determine some of these epigenetic modifications. To address this issue, we studied the in vivo and ex vivo vascular function and Nos3 promoter DNA methylation in arteries from eight-months-old guinea pig born from control, FGR and FGR-NAC treated pregnancies. METHODS Femoral and carotid arteries in vivo vascular function was determined by Doppler, whilst ex vivo vascular function and biomechanical properties were assessed by wire-myography. Levels of eNOS mRNA and site-specific DNA methylation in Nos3 promoter in aorta endothelial cells (AEC) were determined by qPCR and pyrosequencing, respectively. RESULTS FGR-adult showed an increased femoral vascular resistance (p < 0.05), stiffness (p < 0.05) and arterial remodelling (p < 0.01), along with an impaired NO-mediated relaxation (p < 0.001). These effects were prevented by maternal treatment with NAC. Endothelial-NOS mRNA levels were decreased in FGR-adult compared to control and FGR-NAC (p < 0.05), associated with increased DNA methylation levels (p < 0.01). Comparison of Nos3 DNA methylation in AEC showed a differential methylation pattern between fetal and adult guinea pigs (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Altogether, this data suggests that adult vascular dysfunction in the FGR does not result from early changes in Nos3 promoter DNA methylation, but from an altered vessel structure established during fetal development.

According to current literature data, older adults have higher risk of severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19. It is also known that older adults often do not present typical symptoms of diseases. The aim of the study was to assess if the prevalence of typical COVID-19-related symptoms varies by age group. METHODS: Medical charts of a random sample of COVID-19 patients dying in-hospital were retrieved through an integrated national surveillance system and reviewed by a group of researchers at the Italian National Institute of Health. Detailed information on COVID-19-related symptoms were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: 3241 confirmed cases of COVID-19-related deaths were identified from 4391 reviewed medical charts. The mean number of COVID-19-related symptoms progressively declined with age, from 2.1 in patients aged < 60 years to 1.7 in those aged 90 years or older (p < 0.001). Moreover, fever, cough, and diarrhea significantly declined with increasing age. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults have atypical presentation of symptoms and may be paucisymptomatic. This may lead to a diagnostic and therapeutic delay which aggravates the prognosis of COVID-19.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Gastrointestinal involvement has been described in COVID-19; however, no clear figures of incidence, epidemiology and economic impact exist for de-novo surgical diseases in hospitalized patients. METHODS: This is a prospective study including all patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 rT-PCR, between 1 March and 15 May 2020 at two Tertiary Hospitals. Patients with known surgical disease at admission were excluded. Sub-analyses were performed with a consecutive group of COVID-19 patients admitted during the study period, who did not require surgical consultation. RESULTS: Ten out of 3089 COVID-19 positive patients (0.32%) required surgical consultation. Among those admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) incidence was 1.9%. Mortality was 40% in patients requiring immediate surgery and 20% in those suitable for conservative management. The overall median length of stay (LOS) of patients admitted to ICU was longer in those requiring surgical consultation compared with those who did not (51.5 vs 25 days, p = 0.0042). Patients requiring surgical consultation and treatment for de-novo surgical disease had longer median ICU-LOS (31.5 vs 12 days, p = 0.0004). A median of two post-surgical complications were registered for each patient undergoing surgery. Complication-associated costs were as high as 38,962 USD per patient. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of de-novo surgical diseases is low in COVID-19, but it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

METHODS: The questionnaire online was sent to 306 ART authorized centres. It consisted of 26 questions. A total of 15 were single-selection questions, 5 were multiple-choice and the remaining 6 were open-ended. RESULTS: 113 (37%) ART centres responded to the questionnaire. All the ART centres offered psychological counselling, but only in 47% of them the psychologist is a permanent staff member. In 69% of the centres, 10 to 20% of couples use the psychological counselling service. DISCUSSION: Although the Italian Guidelines under Law 40/2004 stress the need to provide couples with psychological support and counselling and the literature highlights the efficacy of such interventions, the results of our study show that psychological counselling services are not yet fully operational in Italian ART centres or integrated into their day-to-day medical practice.

RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values of SARS-CoV-2 &#8804; 34 and the first 7-9 days of symptoms are associated with enhanced infectivity. We determined Ct values and duration of symptoms of HCW with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. As HCW often assume their greatest risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 is working on a COVID-19 unit, we also determined Ct values and symptom duration of inpatients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. METHODS: From 6/24/2020-8/23/2020, Ct values and duration of symptoms from 13 HCW, 12 outpatients, and 28 inpatients who had a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. RESULTS: Among HCW with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 46.2% (6/13) were asymptomatic and requested testing due to an exposure to someone with COVID-19; 83.3% (5/6) of those exposures occurred in the community rather than in the hospital. The median Ct value of HCW was 23.2, and 84.6% (11/13) had a Ct value &#8804; 34. The median Ct value of 29.0 among outpatients with COVID-19 did not significantly differ from HCW. In contrast, inpatients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test had a median Ct value of 34.0 (p = 0.003), which translated into a median ~1,000-fold lower viral load than observed in HCW. Among those with symptoms related to COVID-19, no (0/6) HCW compared to 50% (6/12) of inpatients had symptoms for at least one week (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: At our institution, asymptomatic COVID-19 accounted for nearly half of the cases among HCW. Symptomatic HCW had high viral loads and short duration of symptoms, both of which are associated with peak infectivity. Infection prevention programs should educate HCW on these findings in an effort to increase adherence to the requirement to maintain six feet separation in workspaces and breakrooms, in addition to consistently wearing personal protection equipment.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 is associated with high viral loads in asymptomatic and recently symptomatic healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introdu??o Medidas de distanciamento social empregadas para conter a pandemia da COVID-19, o receio da popula??o em se infectar ao se deslocar para doar sangue e a exclus?o de candidatos com suspeita da doen?a ocasionou nveis crticos nos estoques de bancos de sangue.

This study aimed to identify the incidence and related factors of pneumothorax in patients with PCP and acute respiratory failure and to analyze their prognosis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the occurrence of pneumothorax, including clinical characteristics and results of other examinations, in 119 non-human immunodeficiency virus patients with PCP and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilator treatment in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) at a tertiary-care center between July 2016 and April 2019. RESULTS: During follow up duration, twenty-two patients (18.5%) developed pneumothorax during ventilator treatment, with 45 (37.8%) eventually requiring a tracheostomy due to weaning failure. Cytomegalovirus co-infection (odds ratio 13.9; p = 0.013) was related with occurrence of pneumothorax in multivariate analysis. And development of pneumothorax was not associated with need for tracheostomy and mortality. Furthermore, analysis of survivor after 28 days in ICU, patients without pneumothorax were significantly more successful in weaning from mechanical ventilator than the patients with pneumothorax (44% vs. 13.3%, p = 0.037). PCP patients without pneumothorax showed successful home discharges compared to those who without pneumothorax (p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: The development of pneumothorax increased in PCP patient with cytomegalovirus co-infection, pneumothorax might have difficulty in and prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilators, which clinicians should be aware of when planning treatment for such patients.","output":"Clinical impact of pneumothorax in patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and respiratory failure in an HIV-negative cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This retrospective cohort study compares in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD) patients' outcomes between the 1st and 2nd waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. METHODS: All people aged 18 years receiving ICHD at 31 December 2019, who were still alive and not in receipt of a kidney transplant at 1 March and who had a positive polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 March 2020 and 31 January 2021, were included. The COVID-19 infections were split into two waves: wave 1 from March to August 2020 and wave 2 from September 2020 to January 2021. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19, multivariable Cox models for risk of positivity, median, and 95% credible interval of reproduction number in dialysis units were calculated separately for wave 1 and wave 2. Survival and hazard ratios for mortality were described with age- and sex-adjusted Kaplan-Meier plots and multivariable Cox proportional models. RESULTS: 4,408 ICHD patients had COVID-19 during the study period. Unadjusted survival at 28 days was similar in both waves (wave 1 75.6% [95% confidence interval [CI]: 73.7C77.5], wave 2 76.3% [95% CI 74.3C78.2]), but death occurred more rapidly after detected infection in wave 1. Long vintage treatment and not being on the transplant waiting list were associated with higher mortality in both waves. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of death of patients on ICHD treatment with COVID-19 remained unchanged between the first and second outbreaks. This highlights that this vulnerable patient group needs to be prioritized for interventions to prevent severe COVID-19, including vaccination, and the implementation of measures to reduce the risk of transmission alone is not sufficient.","output":"Comparison of Outcomes of In-Centre Haemodialysis Patients between the 1st and 2nd COVID-19 Outbreak in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland: A UK Renal Registry Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract COVID-19 is spreading rapidly worldwide, posing great threats to public health and economy This study aims to examine how the transmission of COVID-19 is modulated by climate conditions, which is of great importance for better understanding of the seasonal feature of COVID-19 Constrained by the accurate observations we can make, the basic reproduction numbers (R0) for each country were inferred and linked to temperature and relative humidity (RH) with statistical analysis Using R0 as the measure of COVID-19 transmission potential, we find stronger transmission of COVID-19 under mildly warm (0C??60%) climate conditions, while extremely low (T ?20C) temperature or a dry climate (RH?&lt;?60%) weakens transmission The established nonlinear relationships between COVID-19 transmission and climate conditions suggest that seasonal climate variability may affect the spread and severity of COVID-19 infection, and temperate coastal regions with mildly warm and humid climate would be susceptible to large-scale outbreaks","output":"Nonlinear modulation of COVID-19 transmission by climate conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic has been emerged as a cardinal public health problem. Children have their own specific clinical features; notably, they seem to be escaping the severe respiratory adverse effects. The international scientific community is rapidly carrying out studies, driving to the need to reassess knowledge of the disease and therapeutic strategies. AIM: To assess the characteristics of COVID-19 infected children worldwide of all ages, from neonates to children and adolescents, and how they differ from their adult counterparts. SEARCH STRATEGY: An electronic search in PubMed was conducted, using combinations of the following keywords: coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, children. The search included all types of articles written in English between January 1, 2019 until August 15, 2020. RESULTS: The search identified 266 relevant articles. Children were mainly within family clusters of cases and have relatively milder clinical presentation compared with adults; children were reported to have better outcomes with a significantly lower mortality rate. Cough and fever were the most common symptoms while pneumonia was the cardinal respiratory manifestation of infected children. Laboratory results and thoracic imaging give varying results. CONCLUSIONS: Children were mainly family cluster cases and usually presented with a mild infection, although cases presented with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome are becoming more apparent. Studies determining why the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are so variable may help to gain a better understanding of the disease and accelerate the development of vaccines and therapies.","output":"Coronavirus global pandemic: An overview of current findings among pediatric patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To prospectively evaluate image quality and radiation dose using a low-dose computed tomography angiography protocol and iterative image reconstruction for high-pitch dual-source CT-angiography (DSCTA) of the supraaortic arteries.

METHODS: Aggregate data from a pediatric hospital, Princess Rahma Pediatric Teaching Hospital, and King Abdulla University Teaching Hospital were utilized between 2018 and 2020. Number of pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions were calculated by week and compared by year, lockdown status, and weeks for lockdown (weeks 13 to 19). Stringency index was correlated with number of weekly pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions for 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,207 pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions were reported; 40.3%, 35.2%, and 24.5% in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The number of weekly admissions ranged between 1 and 13 pediatric asthma cases (mean (SD) = 7.6 (2.7)). In 2018 and 2019, respectively, the mean weekly admissions was 9.2 (1.9) and 8.0 (2.0) pediatric asthma cases, while in 2020 the mean was 5.6 (2.7) cases. Significant differences in mean weekly pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions were detected by year, with mean weekly admissions for 2020 being significantly lower than that for 2018 and 2019. During the lockdown (March 22nd to May 1st 2020), mean weekly admissions (2.6 (1.4)) was significantly lower than that before the lockdown (8.6 (2.0)) and after the lockdown (5.2 (2.0)). For the lockdown weeks only, the mean admissions for year 2020 was significantly lower than that for years 2019 and 2018. Stringency index negatively correlated with number of weekly admissions.

However, evidence from real-world clinical practice is still limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of digital interventions by tracking HbA(1c) improvements over 1 year in real-world clinical settings. METHODS: Patients used the Health2Sync mobile app to track self-measured outcomes and communicate with health care professionals (HCPs). HCPs used the web-based Patient Management Platform to monitor patient data, view test results from clinical laboratories, and communicate with patients. Patients who have been onboarded for at least 13 months and have consecutive HbA(1c) findings for 5 quarters were included in the analysis. They were then stratified into 3 groups (high, mid, and low retention) based on their level of use of Health2Sync in the first 6 months of onboarding. A mixed model was built to compare the slopes of the rate of reduction in HbA(1c) among the groups. In addition, these patients retention on the app from the seventh to the 12th month was verified through multiple comparisons. RESULTS: A sample of 2036 users was included in the analysis. With the mixed model coefficient estimates, we found that app users had significant HbA(1c) percentage reductions as the passed quarter count increased (t=C9.869; P<.001), and that effectiveness increased in the high (t=C5.173) and mid retention (t=C6.620) groups as the interaction effects were significantly negative compared to that in the low retention group (P<.001) in the passed quarter count. The low retention group also had the highest average HbA(1c) value at the end of 13 months (high: 7.01%, SD 1.02%; mid: 6.99%, SD 1.00%; low: 7.17%, SD 1.14%) (Bonferroni correction: high vs low, P=.07; mid vs low, P=.02; high vs mid, P>.99).

Interventional radiologists have utilized pre-procedure CT angiography (CTA) and newer fluoroscopic systems in an attempt to reduce radiation dose and procedure time. PURPOSE To study the factors contributing to the radiation dose of AE for AAH and to compare to the reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective single-centre observational cohort study identified 154 consecutive AE procedures in 138 patients (median age 65 years; interquartile range 54-77; 103 men) performed with a C-arm fluoroscopic system (Axiom Artis DTA or Axiom Artis Q (Siemens Healthineers)), between January 2010 and December 2017. Parameters analysed included: demographics, fluoroscopy system, bleeding location, body mass index (BMI), preprocedural CT, air kerma-area product (PKA), reference air kerma (Ka,r), fluoroscopy time (FT) and the number of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) runs. Factors affecting dose were assessed using Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA and linear regression. RESULTS Patients treated with the new angiographic system (NS) had a median PKA, median Ka,r, Q3 PKA and Q3 Ka,r that were 74% (p < 0.0005), 66%(p < 0.0005), 55% and 52% lower respectively than those treated with the old system (OS). This dose reduction was consistent for each bleeding location (upper GI, Lower GI and extraluminal). There was no difference in PKA (p = 0.452), Ka,r (p = 0.974) or FT (p = 0.179), between those who did (n = 137) or did not (n = 17) undergo pre-procedure CTA. Other factors significantly influencing radiation dose were: patient BMI and number of DSA runs. A multivariate model containing these variables accounts for 15.2% of the variance in Ka,r (p < 0.005) and 45.9% of the variance of PKA (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION Radiation dose for AE in AAH is significantly reduced by new fluoroscopic technology. Higher patient body mass index is an independent key parameter affecting patient dose.

We use the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) study (2008-2012), based on a random sample of 1,003 women ages 18-19 residing in a Michigan county. Women were interviewed weekly for 2.5 years, resulting in an age range of 18-22. We test three sets of hypotheses about change over time within a relationship, using relationship-level within-between models, which compare a couple's contraceptive behaviors across different times in the relationship. First, we find that a couple is less likely to use contraception when the relationship is more intimate and/or committed and that a couple becomes less likely to use contraception over time, regardless of intimacy and commitment. Second, we find that a couple using contraception becomes increasingly likely to choose hormonal over coital methods, but this change occurs as a relationship endures and is unrelated to intimacy and/or commitment. Third, we find that a condom-using couple's consistency does not decline when there is conflict; rather, consistency of condom use declines over time regardless of the relationship's characteristics. We also demonstrate that conflict and power imbalance increase reliance on hormonal methods among those using contraception; conflict decreases consistency among withdrawal (but not condom) users; and nonmonogamy increases reliance on condoms and decreases withdrawal consistency. The strong and consistent link between duration and contraceptive behaviors-regardless of intimacy, commitment, conflict, or power imbalance-suggests that the continual vigilance required for long-term contraceptive use is difficult during early emerging adulthood.","output":"The Dynamics of Intimate Relationships and Contraceptive Use During Early Emerging Adulthood"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to train and test a deep learning classifier to support the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using chest x-ray (CXR) on a cohort of subjects from two hospitals in Lombardy, Italy.

CRF and Ucn1 activate both CRF1 and CRF2, while Ucn2 and Ucn3 activate selectively CRF2. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of CRF, Ucn1, Ucn2 and Ucn3 on the hippocampal acetylcholine release through which they may modulate cognitive functions, including attention, learning and memory. In this purpose male Wistar rats were used, their hippocampus was isolated, dissected, incubated, superfused and stimulated electrically. The hippocampal slices were first pretreated with selective CRF1 antagonist antalarmin or selective CRF2 antagonist astressin2B, and then treated with non-selective CRF1 agonists, CRF or Ucn1, and selective CRF2 agonists, Ucn2 or Ucn3. The hippocampal acetylcholine release was increased significantly by CRF and Ucn1 and decreased significantly by Ucn2 and Ucn3. The increasing effect of CRF and Ucn1 was reduced significantly by antalarmin, but not astressin2B. In contrast, the decreasing effect of Ucn2 and Ucn3 was reversed significantly by the selective CRF2, but not the selective CRF1 antagonist. Our results demonstrate that CRF and Ucn1 stimulate the hippocampal acetylcholine release through CRF1, whereas Ucn2 and Ucn3 inhibit the hippocampal acetylcholine release through CRF2. Therefore, the present study suggests the existence of two apparently opposing CRF systems in the hippocampus, through which CRF and the urocortins might modulate cholinergic activity and thereby cognitive functions.","output":"The effects of CRF and the urocortins on the hippocampal acetylcholine release in rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper considers new challenges related to public health Action is needed to improve access to healthcare while maintaining its quality The introduction of AI-based automated data analysis systems can be a solution to that The present study seeks to assess the use of AI in outpatient care to detect pathological changes in the lungs typical of a coronavirus amidst the pandemic The sample size was 600 patients The results were statistically and analytically processed The sensitivity attained 94%;the specificity, accuracy and the area under the ROC curve were 77%, 83%, and 87%, respectively The negative predictive value was 97%;the positive predictive value was 66% The data obtained show that the algorithm separates the CT scan results having no abnormalities in the lungs The authors conclude that the usage of AI technologies helped to improve diagnostic accuracy during the COVID-19 pandemic Artificial intelligence algorithms can also work with patients in non-pandemic times, thus improving healthcare access ? 2021 Russian Public Opinion Research Center, VCIOM All rights reserved","output":"Artificial intelligence in healthcare: Validating an AI algorithm in health institutions in the COVID-19 pandemic (A use case)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No disponible","output":"Epidemia por COVID-19 en Madrid: crnica de un reto"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Facial attractiveness in humans signals an individuals genetic condition, underlying physiology and health status, serving as a cue to ones mate value.

The current research investigated the effect of face masks on the perception of face attractiveness. Across four studies, we tested if below- and above-average attractive full faces are equally affected by wearing facial masks. The results reveal that for young faces (Study 1) and old faces (Study 2) a facial mask increases the perceived attractiveness of relatively unattractive faces, but there is no effect of wearing a face mask for highly attractive faces. Study 3 shows that the same pattern of ratings emerged when the bottom-half of the faces are cropped rather than masked, indicating that the effect is not mask-specific. Our final Study 4, in which information from only the lower half of the faces was made available, showed that contrary to our previous findings, highly attractive half-faces are perceived to be less attractive than their full-face counterpart; but there is no such effect for the less attractive faces. This demonstrates the importance of the eye-region in the perception of attractiveness, especially for highly attractive faces. Collectively these findings suggest that a positivity-bias enhances the perception of unattractive faces when only the upper face is visible, a finding that may not extend to attractive faces because of the perceptual weight placed on their eye-region.

The potential protective mechanism of action is believed to be via inhibition of histone deacetylase and subsequent epigenetic reprogramming. SAVER is a phase IIb open-label, randomised control trial of VPA as a chemopreventive agent in patients with high-risk oral epithelial dysplasia (OED). The aim of the trial is to gather preliminary evidence of the clinical and biological effects of VPA upon OED and assess the feasibility and acceptability of such a trial, with a view to inform a future definitive phase III study. METHODS: One hundred and ten patients with high-risk OED will be recruited from up to 10 secondary care sites in the UK and randomised into either VPA or observation only for 4 months. Women of childbearing potential will be excluded due to the teratogenic properties of VPA. Tissue and blood samples will be collected prior to randomisation and on the last day of the intervention/observation-only period (end of 4 months). Clinical measurement and additional safety bloods will be taken at multiple time points during the trial. The primary outcome will be a composite, surrogate endpoint of change in lesion size, change in grade of dysplasia and change in LOH profile at 8 key microsatellite regions. Feasibility outcomes will include recruitment targets, compliance with the study protocol and adverse effects. A qualitative sub-study will explore patient experience and perception of the trial. DISCUSSION: The current management options for patients with high-risk OED are limited and mostly include surgical resection and clinical surveillance. However, there remains little evidence whether surgery can effectively lead to a notable reduction in the risk of oral cancer development. Similarly, surveillance is associated with concerns regarding delayed diagnosis of OED progressing to malignancy. The SAVER trial provides an opportunity to investigate the effects of a repurposed, inexpensive and well-tolerated medication as a potential chemopreventive strategy for patients with high-risk OED. The clinical and biological findings of SAVER will inform the appropriateness, design and feasibility of a definitive phase III trial.

As future physicians, medical students play a critical role in the publics view of the vaccine. OBJECTIVES: To determine the attitude of U.S. medical students toward mandating the COVID-19 vaccine to healthcare workers and patients, as well as whether their knowledge of the vaccine plays a role in their view. METHODS: The authors emailed a survey link to all U.S. medical schools with request to distribute it to their medical students. The survey remained open from 02/09/2021 to 03/15/2021 and included questions to determine the attitude of the medical students toward recommending the COVID-19 vaccine, and general knowledge questions about the vaccine. Chi square, Fishers exact test, and linear regression were conducted to determine associations between willingness to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine and general knowledge of the vaccine. RESULTS: Among the 1,899 responses from medical students representing 151 U.S. medical schools, 57.82% approved of making the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory to healthcare workers, and 16.27% approved of making it mandatory to patients. Additionally, those who tested most knowledgeable of the vaccine were less likely to approve of making the vaccine mandatory for patients (66.67% vs. 72.70). Those that tested most knowledgeable were also more likely to personally receive the vaccine (72.35% vs 62.99%) as opposed to those that tested the least knowledgeable who were less willing to personally receive the vaccine (4.12% vs 14.17%). CONCLUSIONS: The data revealed that a slight majority of medical students support a vaccine mandate toward healthcare workers while a minority of medical students support a vaccine mandate toward healthcare workers. Additionally, medical students that had relatively high knowledge of the vaccine correlated with not approving of making the vaccine mandatory for patients.

But the predictive biomarkers for characterizing the variability are still lacking. Since emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) are functionally involved in a number of pathological processes, we hypothesize that these extracellular components maybe key determinants and/or predictors of COVID-19 severity. To test our hypothesis, we collected serum samples from 31 patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms at the time of their admission for discovery cohort. After symptomatic treatment without corticosteroids, 9 of the 31 patients developed severe/critical COVID-19 symptoms. We analyzed EV protein and exRNA profiles to look for correlations between these profiles and COVID-19 severity. Strikingly, we identified three distinct groups of markers (antiviral response-related EV proteins, coagulation-related markers, and liver damage-related exRNAs) with the potential to serve as early predictive biomarkers for COVID-19 severity. As the best predictive marker, EV COPB2 protein, a subunit of the Golgi coatomer complex, exhibited significantly higher abundance in patients remained mild than developed severe/critical COVID-19 and healthy controls in discovery cohort (AUC 1.00 (95% CI: 1.00-1.00)).

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was completed by 2724 participants from 67 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perceived stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms were compared between individuals with post-pandemic insomnia symptoms (n=1007), pre-existing insomnia symptoms (n=804), and no insomnia symptoms (n=913). RESULTS: Post-pandemic insomnia symptoms were associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression than pre-existing or no insomnia symptoms (p's<.001). Pre-existing insomnia symptoms were also associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression than no insomnia symptoms (p's<.001). Individuals who met likely criteria for Acute Insomnia also reported higher stress, anxiety and depression than those with Insomnia Disorder (p's<.001). Across all groups, individuals reporting a previous mental health diagnosis had worse stress, anxiety and depression than those without a previous mental health diagnosis (p's<.001). Lastly, individuals from South Africa reported higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression than other countries (p's<.01). CONCLUSIONS: Internationally, individuals with pre-existing and post-pandemic insomnia symptoms may be more susceptible to stress, anxiety, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health initiatives should include insomnia management to improve mental health during the pandemic.","output":"Pre-existing and post-pandemic insomnia symptoms are associated with high levels of stress, anxiety and depression globally during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on 1,130 listed Chinese firms charitable donation data during the COVID-19, this paper used the Event Study to examine market reactions to the epidemic and utilized OLS and Heckman two-stage models to investigate the impact of charitable donations on corporate market performance Results show that greater corporate charitable material and medical donations result in more favorable short-term market reaction but weaker in the long term Moreover, the low-leveraged, non-pharmaceutical, and non-SOEs can obtain better short-term performance through philanthropic donations Findings suggest that the negative market sentiment from the COVID-19 cannot be offset by the short-term positive effects of corporate donations","output":"How Does the Market React to Corporate Philanthropic Behavior? evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic Shock"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Residual newborn screening dried bloodspots (DBS) are a valuable resource for research but the extent, type, and nature of uses are unknown.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether lenient provisional discharge guidelines with remote monitoring after discharge resulted in safe discharges home for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 illness. DESIGN: Retrospective case series SETTING: Tertiary care medical center PATIENTS: Consecutive adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 illness between March 26, 2020, and April 8, 2020, with a subset discharged home INTERVENTIONS: COVID-19 Discharge Care Program consisting of lenient provisional inpatient discharge criteria and option for daily telephone monitoring for up to 14 days after discharge MEASUREMENTS: Fourteen-day emergency department (ED) visits and hospital readmissions RESULTS: Among 812 patients with COVID-19 illness hospitalized during the study time period, 15.5% died prior to discharge, 24.1% remained hospitalized, 10.0% were discharged to another facility, and 50.4% were discharged home. Characteristics of the 409 patients discharged home were mean (SD) age 57.3 (16.6) years; 245 (59.9%) male; 27 (6.6%) with temperature &#8805; 100.4 F; and 154 (37.7%) with oxygen saturation < 95% on day of discharge. Over 14 days of follow-up, 45 patients (11.0%) returned to the ED, of whom 31 patients (7.6%) were readmitted. Compared to patients not referred, patients referred for remote monitoring had fewer ED visits (8.3% vs 14.1%; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31-1.15, p = 0.12) and readmissions (6.9% vs 8.3%; OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.52-2.52, p = 0.73). LIMITATIONS: Single-center study; assignment to remote monitoring was not randomized. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 surge in New York City, lenient discharge criteria in conjunction with remote monitoring after discharge were associated with a rate of early readmissions after COVID-related hospitalizations that was comparable to the rate of readmissions after other reasons for hospitalization before the COVID pandemic.","output":"Hospital Readmissions After Implementation of a Discharge Care Program for Patients with COVID-19 Illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing students journalistic skills online is a big challenge in the field of journalism education.

Concern exists that possible disruptions in HIV programs due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could result in a more HIV-related mortality and new HIV infections. This study aimed to investigate the real-time burden of COVID-19 on patients with HIV attending antiretroviral therapy. Methods We conducted a facility-based, multicenter, and cross-sectional study among patients with HIV attending antiretroviral therapy in 10 healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in the COVID-19 pandemic period. Data were collected using adapted, interviewer-based questionnaires, and entered into EpiInfo version 7 and exported to SPSS version 26 for analysis. Result A total of 212 patients with HIV were included. The participants who missed visits for refill were 58 (27.4%). When the effects of other independent variables on appointments/visits for refill were controlled, the following characteristics were found to be the most important predictors of missed appointments (p< 0.05): age  55 [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 6.73, 95% CI (1.495C30.310)], fear of COVID-19 [AOR = 24.93, 95% CI (2.798C222.279)], transport disruption [AOR = 4.90, 95% CI (1.031C23.174)], reduced income for traveling to a health facility [AOR = 5.64, 95% CI (1.234-25.812)], limited access to masks [AOR = 7.67, 95% CI (1.303C45.174)], sanitizer [AOR = 0.07, 95% CI (0.007C0.729)], and non-medical support [AOR = 2.32, 95% CI (1.547C12.596)]. The participants were well aware of the COVID-19 preventive measures. The most costly COVID-19 preventive measures that cause financial burden to the patients were the costs for buying face masks (63.7%), disinfectants (55.2%), and soap for handwashing (22.2%). The participants who missed follow-up diagnostic tests were 56 (26.4%). Variables, which were found to be statistically significant, include the following: age  55 [AOR = 0.22, 95% CI (0.076C0.621)], partial lockdown [AOR = 0.10, 95% CI (0.011C0.833)], limited access to health services [AOR = 0.15, 95% CI (0.045C0.475)], reduced income for traveling to health facility [AOR = 0.18, 95% CI (0.039C0.784)], and unable to get masks [AOR = 0.12, 95% CI (0.026C0.543)]. The participants who missed counseling services were 55 (25.9%). In multivariate logistic regression, the following were statistically significant: age  55 [AOR = 0.21, 95% CI (0.078C0.570)], fear of COVID-19 [AOR = 0.11, 95% CI (0.013C0.912)], reduced income [AOR = 0.17, 95% CI (0.041C0.699)], unable to get face masks [AOR = 0.19, 95% CI (0.039C0.959)], and partial lockdown [AOR = 0.08, 95% CI (0.008C0.790)]. Conclusions The COVID-19 had a significant burden on patients with HIV to attend their routine clinical care and treatment, which may lead to treatment failure and drug resistance.

Respiratory samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 with both normal RT-PCR and droplet digital PCR. Results: : All the COVID-19 patients complicated with pneumonia. Viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs were accurately quantified, and they had no direct correspondence with the severity of lung lesions. The Cycle Threshold (Ct) value of RT-PCR was approximately consistent with the absolute quantification of digital PCR. The spearman correlation coefficient between them was -0.952 with P value < 0.001. Close contacts of patients with very low viral load or no detected virus were not infected. Conclusions: : Viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs, could not predict the severity of lung lesions revealed by CT in COVID-19 patients.

Upon infection, two antigens present on the viral surface, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase result in human immunity, but since many subtypes of these antigens exist that vary over time, immunity in the population is blunted. Vaccination is advocated in high-risk groups including patients with underlying (lung) diseases and in the elderly, and needs to be repeated annually with vaccines expected to cover the expected change in viral antigenicity.

In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students, to assess their anxiety level and their main anxiety sources related to this pandemic. METHODS: A Google Form was distributed to medical students using the virtual snowball sampling method. The form included the Beck Anxiety Inventory and additional 19 questions on sociodemographic characteristics, perceived level of knowledge about the epidemic, self-risk perceptions of COVID-19 and their anxiety levels about some other topics related to COVID-19. RESULTS: Overall, 3105 medical students with a mean age of 22.37  2.46, took the survey. Amongst the participants, only 32% of the students defined their knowledge about the precautions that should be taken during an epidemic disease as acceptable. Students reported highest anxiety level for the continuing spread of COVID-19 in Turkey and transmitting coronavirus to another person. Clinically significant anxiety prevalence was 23.2%. Regression analysis revealed that factors that increased the risk of being anxious included being female, being other than a 5th-year student, thinking that being a medical student would increase the risk of coronavirus transmission or being uncertain about it, being exposed to a patient with COVID-19 or being uncertain about it, being anxious about the continuing spread of COVID-19 in Turkey, being anxious about acquiring COVID-19, being anxious for graduating and being on active duty, being anxious about a medical training interruption. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that anxiety is prevalent amongst Turkish medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic and they have a weak preparedness for a pandemic such as COVID-19.

Similarly, genomes that encode antiviral systems have had strong selective advantages. Protein-guided immune systems, which have been well studied in mammals, are necessary for survival in our virus-laden environments. Small RNACdirected antiviral immune systems suppress invasion of cells by non-self genetic material via complementary base pairing with target sequences. These RNA silencing-dependent systems operate in diverse organisms. In mammals, there is strong evidence that microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate endogenous genes important for antiviral immunity, and emerging evidence that virus-derived nucleic acids can be directly targeted by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and transfer RNAs (tRNAs) for protection in some contexts. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the antiviral functions of each of these small RNA types and consider their conceptual and mechanistic overlap with innate and adaptive protein-guided immunity, including mammalian antiviral cytokines, as well as the prokaryotic RNA-guided immune system, CRISPR. In light of recent successes in delivery of RNA for antiviral purposes, most notably for vaccination, we discuss the potential for development of small noncoding RNACdirected antiviral therapeutics and prophylactics.","output":"Mammalian antiviral systems directed by small RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Numerous inflammatory markers may serve a role in prognostication of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. Early in the pandemic, our health system created an admission order set which included daily d-dimer, c-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ferritin. Given more available outcomes data, limiting standing order of labs that do not affect daily management could result in significant cost savings to the health system without adverse patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine ordering and utilization patterns of inflammatory markers by physicians caring for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: An anonymous 10-question survey was distributed to 125 physicians (Infectious Disease, Hospitalist, Pulmonary and Critical Care faculty). Responses were tallied and values greater than 50% were identified as the majority of the surveyed group. RESULTS: Of the 125 physicians surveyed, 77 (62%) responded. A total of 57.1% (44/77) of physicians reported ordering daily inflammatory markers for 3 C 10 days from admission. Another 31.2% (24/77) ordered markers until clinical improvement or hospital discharge. D-dimer was used for care decisions by 83.1% (64/77) of respondents; 93.8% (60/64) of those reported utilizing it in determining anticoagulation dose. CRP was used by 61% (47/77) of physicians to help identify a secondary infection or determine steroid dose or duration. LDH and ferritin were not used for management decisions by the majority of physicians. Inflammatory markers were not used routinely after isolation precautions had been discontinued, even when ongoing care required mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Of the markers studied, both d-dimer and CRP were considered useful by most respondents. LDH and ferritin were used less frequently and were not considered as useful in guiding medical decision making. Discontinuation of standing daily LDH and ferritin orders is believed to have potential to result in cost savings to the health care system with no adverse patient outcomes.","output":"Assessing Provider Utilization of COVID-19 Inflammatory Marker Trends in Hospitalized Patients and Implications in Optimizing Value-Based Care During a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is disrupting all aspects of our lives as the global spread of the virus continues.

Activity is observed in the nanomolar range in mammalian cells in vitro against the six viral families causing most human respiratory viral disease, irrespective of strain, including SARS-CoV-2 delta variant. A substantial barrier to development of viral resistance is demonstrated for influenza (FLUV). The drug target is an allosteric site on a novel host multi-protein complex (MPC) formed transiently, in an energy-dependent fashion, and composed of proteins implicated in viral lifecycles and innate immunity. The composition of this host MPC is modified in viral family-specific ways by FLUV and CoV, and substantially restored to the uninfected state with drug treatment.

However, the roles of the GI tract in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are not fully understood. We investigated how the GI tract is involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection to elucidate the pathogenesis of COVID-19. METHODS: Our previously established nonhuman primate (NHP) model of COVID-19 was modified in this study to test our hypothesis. Rhesus monkeys were infected with an intragastric or intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded after infection. Viral genomic RNA was quantified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated by examining inflammatory cytokines, macrophages, histopathology and mucin barrier integrity. RESULTS: Intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 led to infections and pathological changes not only in respiratory tissues but also in digestive tissues. Expectedly, intragastric inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in the productive infection of digestive tissues and inflammation in both the lung and digestive tissues. Inflammatory cytokines were induced by both types of inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the increased expression of CD68. Immunohistochemistry and alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) staining showed decreased Ki67, increased cleaved caspase 3 and decreased numbers of mucin-containing goblet cells, suggesting that the inflammation induced by these two types of inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 impaired the GI barrier and caused severe infections. CONCLUSIONS: Both intranasal and intragastric inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 caused pneumonia and GI dysfunction in our rhesus monkey model. Inflammatory cytokines are possible connections for the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 between the respiratory and digestive systems.","output":"The gastrointestinal tract is an alternative route for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a nonhuman primate model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Healthcare workers (HCWs) constitute a population which is significantly affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide In Mexico, the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias (INER) is the principal national reference of respiratory diseases Aim: To evaluate the efficiency of the INER-POL-TRAB-COVID19 program to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among the INER-healthcare workers (INER-HCW) Methods: Currently, the INER has 250 beds and 200 respiratory ventilators to support COVID-19 patients in critical condition On March 1st, 2020, the INER-POL-TRAB-COVID19 program was launched to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among the INER-HCW Findings: From March 1st to October 1st, 2020, 71 5% of INER-HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 77% of them were frontline workers Among the tested INER-HCWs, 10 4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection Nonetheless, nosocomial infection represented only 3 8% of the cases and the mortality was null Fifty-three of INER-HCWs positive to SARS-CoV-2 had a negative test 42-56 days post-diagnosis and were returned to service Finally, although a change in the PPE implemented on May 11th, 2020, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not affected Conclusion: INER has a lower incidence of HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the mean of the national report The implementation of the INER-POL-TRAB-COVID19 program is efficient to decrease the risk of infection among the HCWs Our findings suggest that the implementation of a similar program at a national level can be helpful to provide a safe environment to HCWs and to prevent the collapse of health institutions","output":"Low Incidence and Mortality by SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Healthcare Workers in a Health National Center in Mexico: Successful Establishment of an Occupational Medicine Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The COVID-19 crisis has caused considerable disruption to medical education and has stimulated creative and rapid changes in the way technology is adopted and utilized for education.

Chern Simons (CS) gravity is one of the most frequently studied parity-violating models of strong gravity. It is known that the Kerr black-hole is not a solution for CS gravity. At the same time, the only rotating solution available in the literature for dynamical CS (dCS) gravity is the slow-rotating case most accurately known to quadratic order in spin. In this work, for the slow-rotating case (accurate to first order in spin), we derive the linear perturbation equations governing the metric and the dCS field accurate to linear order in spin and quadratic order in the CS coupling parameter ($\\\\alpha$) and obtain the quasi-normal mode (QNM) frequencies. After confirming the recent results of Wagle et al. (2021), we find an additional contribution to the eigenfrequency correction at the leading perturbative order of $\\\\alpha^2$. Unlike Wagle et al., we also find corrections to frequencies in the polar sector. We compute these extra corrections by evaluating the expectation values of the perturbative potential on unperturbed QNM wavefunctions along a contour deformed into the complex-$r$ plane. For $\\\\alpha=0.1 M^2$, we obtain the ratio of the imaginary parts of the dCS correction to the GR correction in the first QNM frequency (in the polar sector) to be $0.263$ implying significant change. For the $(2,2)-$mode, the dCS corrections make the imaginary part of the first QNM of the fundamental mode less negative, thereby decreasing the decay rate. Our results, along with future gravitational wave observations, can be used to test for dCS gravity and further constrain the CS coupling parameters.

Traffic in these networks is growing and is increasingly dominated by a small number of large CDNs connecting at multiple locations. Simultaneously, the networks are becoming more flexible, in terms of routing, CDN user mapping, and also regarding the IP topology: emerging optical technologies allow to flexibly reconfigure the network. This paper studies the potential gains of these reconfiguration flexibilities. The idea is to make CDN-ISP infrastructure demand-aware, that is, to re-optimize it towards the changing end-user demands over time. We present an optimization framework and conduct an extensive evaluation using data from a large European ISP. We find that such a reconfigurable infrastructure has indeed a high potential: by leveraging spatial and diurnal traffic patterns, the efficiency of ISP networks and CDNs is improved significantly. Specifically, the required backbone capacity is reduced by 15% while reducing path lengths by 30%, on average and during the critical peak hour. Moreover, such infrastructures can leverage re-optimizations during specific events, like the COVID-19 pandemic, and under link failures. We optimistically assume a cooperative environment of ISPs and CDNs, and we conclude by discussing trends that foster the identified benefits in practice.

The mean body mass index was 25.84.6. Twenty data points were entered into the ACS-NSQIP surgical risk calculator (SRC), which yielded the 17 most common complications and the average LOHS. Compli-cations encountered in 30-day follow-up were categorized according to the complications predicted by SRC. The actual and observed complication rates and LOHS were compared RESULTS: Post-operative complications developed in 13.4% of the patients, surgical site infection in 11.3%, serious complications in 3.1%, and readmission in 2.1%. Serious complications included pneumonia, sepsis, cardiac complications, and renal failure. The mean LOHS was 1.911.64 days (range: 1-14 days). No thromboembolism or mortality was observed. When the comparison of compli-cations using SRC was made with the ROC curve, the predictive value of SRC was 84.2% for any complication, 86.7% for serious complication, 47.6% for surgical site infection, 95.9% for renal failure, 99.0% for resurgery, and 88.3% for sepsis.

State-level policy evaluations commonly use a difference-in-differences (DID) study design; yet within this framework, statistical model specification varies notably across studies. More guidance is needed about which set of statistical models perform best when estimating how state-level policies affect outcomes. METHODS: Motivated by applied state-level opioid policy evaluations, we implemented an extensive simulation study to compare the statistical performance of multiple variations of the two-way fixed effect models traditionally used for DID under a range of simulation conditions. We also explored the performance of autoregressive (AR) and GEE models. We simulated policy effects on annual state-level opioid mortality rates and assessed statistical performance using various metrics, including directional bias, magnitude bias, and root mean squared error. We also reported Type I error rates and the rate of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (e.g., power), given the prevalence of frequentist null hypothesis significance testing in the applied literature. RESULTS: Most linear models resulted in minimal bias. However, non-linear models and population-weighted versions of classic linear two-way fixed effect and linear GEE models yielded considerable bias (60 to 160%). Further, root mean square error was minimized by linear AR models when we examined crude mortality rates and by negative binomial models when we examined raw death counts. In the context of frequentist hypothesis testing, many models yielded high Type I error rates and very low rates of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (< 10%), raising concerns of spurious conclusions about policy effectiveness in the opioid literature. When considering performance across models, the linear AR models were optimal in terms of directional bias, root mean squared error, Type I error, and correct rejection rates. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight notable limitations of commonly used statistical models for DID designs, which are widely used in opioid policy studies and in state policy evaluations more broadly. In contrast, the optimal model we identified--the AR model--is rarely used in state policy evaluation. We urge applied researchers to move beyond the classic DID paradigm and adopt use of AR models.

We found that all adjuvants elicited robust humoral responses in comparison to placebo, with the induction of potent neutralizing antibodies observed in all adjuvanted groups against influenza and in AdQS21, alhydrogel, and ALF55 against RSV. Upon HA vaccination, we observed that none of the adjuvants were able to significantly increase the frequency of CD4(+) and CD8(+) IFN-(+) cells when compared to unadjuvanted antigen. The varying responses to antigens with each adjuvant highlights that those adjuvants most suited for pairing purposes can vary depending on the antigen used and/or the desired immune response.

RESULTS: Nine hundred- forty-eight parents completed the survey at both time points. Children from LMICs were more likely to meet the PA (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AdjOR] = 2.0, 95%Confidence Interval [CI] 1.0,3.8) and SST (AdjOR = 2.2, 95%CI 1.2,3.9) guidelines than their high-income country (HIC) counterparts. Children who could go outside during COVID-19 were more likely to meet all WHO Global guidelines (AdjOR = 3.3, 95%CI 1.1,9.8) than those who were not. Children of parents with higher compared to lower stress were less likely to meet all three guidelines (AdjOR = 0.5, 95%CI 0.3,0.9). CONCLUSION: PA and SST levels of children from LMICs have been less impacted by COVID-19 than in HICs. Ensuring children can access an outdoor space, and supporting parents' mental health are important prerequisites for enabling pre-schoolers to practice healthy movement behaviours and meet the Global guidelines.","output":"Global effect of COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep among 3- to 5-year-old children: a longitudinal study of 14 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates factors influencing the customers decision to use self-service kiosks in quick service restaurants A model incorporating Technology Acceptance Model and Satisfaction Model was developed to examine the relationships among trust, self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, perceived value, satisfaction and behavioural intention toward using these kiosks The moderating impact of age, gender and past self-service kiosks experience was also examined An online survey that measured customer perceptions and evaluations of self-service kiosks in McDonalds garnered 415 responses Data were analysed using structural equation modelling and multiple regression analyses Recommendations address the importance of clear, accessible information about kiosk operation;visible security measures;and enhanced features such as menu item nutrient profiles and promotions These findings and recommendations can be used to promote self-service kiosk usage, thereby addressing the COVID-19 induced prohibitions against direct service in restaurants","output":"The adoption of self-service kiosks in quick-service restaurants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To study the epidemiol characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Zhoushan, so as to provide reference for improving the prevention and control capability of COVID-19 Methods: All the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Zhoushan, diagnosed according to Chinas \\"COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan (fifth version) \\" and reported from Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020, were extracted from the infectious disease surveillance system Data of general information, clin characteristics, laboratory results, transmission and detection routes were collected and analyzed Results: By Feb 17, Ten confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Zhoushan had been reported, including 7 males and 3 females They were all adults, with an average age of (50 9015 00) years Five cases were discharged The incubation period ranged from 2 to 12 days, with a median of 5 days The first symptoms were fever (8 cases), cough (7 cases) and muscle pain (2 cases) Chest computed tomog (CT) scans showed ground glass opacities in the lungs of all the cases Six cases had Wuhan related exposure SARS-CoV-2 was tested pos in the sputum specimens or throat swabs of all the cases and the faeces of 4 cases The last suspicious exposure of 5 cases occurred before, and that of another 5 cases occurred after the onset of clin symptoms in the confirmed maternal cases Three cases were found in active consultation after clin symptoms, and another 7 cases were found in the monitoring of close contacts Conclusions: The 10 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in Zhoushan are all adults, and most have Wuhan related exposure SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the fecal samples, but the existence of fecal-oral transmission needs more research SARS-CoV-2 has strong infectivity, and may also have infectivity before the onset of symptoms (at the end of incubation period) Isolation and early detection of close contacts are conducive for early case-finding","output":"Epidemiological characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Zhoushan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Previous systematic review indicated the prevalence of prenatal anxiety as 14-54%.

With convenience food, the processing level increases, which consumers are sceptical of. This holds especially for organic consumers who prefer natural, healthy, and sustainable food products. In the literature, consumer preferences are investigated for processed conventional food, but rarely for organic products. Therefore, this study investigates consumers knowledge, expectations, and attitudes towards selected processing technologies for organic food. Nine focus groups with 84 organic consumers were conducted, discussing preservation technologies of organic milk and orange juice. Results showed that participants had little knowledge about processing technologies but were interested in their benefits. Organic processing technologies should include fewer processing steps, low environmental impact, while keeping the product as natural as possible. Since consumers want to know benefits but not details of processing, asking consumers for their specific preferences when developing new processing technologies remains challenging. This paper shows how consumers benefit and risk perception including their want for naturalness, and scepticism for new technologies shape their evaluation of (organic) food processing technologies. Two consumer groups with different attitudes towards processing could be identified: organic traditionalists and organic pragmatics.","output":"Consumer Perspectives on Processing Technologies for Organic Food"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of baseline use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-i)/AT1 blocker (ARB) on mortality in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) African-American patients. The secondary objectives are, to determine the effect of baseline use of ACE-i/ARB on the need for mechanical ventilation, new dialysis, ICU care, and on composite of above-mentioned outcomes in the same cohort. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed data using electronic medical records from all hospitalized Covid-19 African-American patients, who either died in the hospital or survived to discharge between 2 March and 22 May 2020. Patients were divided into two groups, those on ACE-i/ARB at baseline and those not on them. We used Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables, and Student's t test for continuous variables. We performed multiple logistic regression to test the primary and secondary objectives using SAS 9.4. RESULTS: Out of 531 patients included in the analysis, 207 (39%) were on ACE-i/ARB at baseline. Patients in ACE-i/ARB group were older (64 vs. 57 years, Pa??<a??0.001), and had higher prevalence of hypertension (96.6 vs. 69.4%, Pa??<a??0.001) and diabetes mellitus (55.6 vs. 34.9%, Pa??<a??0.001).

In the past decades, numerous viral pathogens have barged into the field of medicine, being viruses either newly appeared in the population or newly identified or exhibiting unexpected epidemiological properties. Several factors have been reported to promote such emergences, including viral traffic from animals, ongoing viral genetic evolution, host factors, environmental and social changes. As an example, HIV-1 pandemic perfectly illustrates the evolutionary success of a simian retrovirus introduced into the human population as well as its dramatic impact both on the demographic and economic status of many countries. Influenza viruses remain a classic persisting model of emerging pathogens, which is supported by the coalescence of many contributing characteristics, particularly an animal reservoir consisting of birds and mammals and a segmented RNA genome prone to point mutations and reassortments. Two recent examples, the avian flu due to A/H5N1 virus and the pandemic flu due to A/H1N1 2009, show the difficulties both for predicting the outcome of flu emergences and defining the right strategy for their control.

This paper conducts a pioneer study by analyzing the impact of regional economic growth and urbanization on the public health vulnerability in the 51 states and territories of the USA from 2011 to 2018 with a fixed-effect panel data regression model. We construct an epidemiological vulnerability index (EVI) using regional smoking, diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, collect CDC social vulnerability index (SVI) as state-level public health vulnerability status, and use COVID-19 to test the actual effect of health vulnerability. The preliminary results show that higher regional economic growth is related to lower EVI and SVI, while urbanization is positively associated with regional health vulnerability and the severity of COVID-19 from case rate and death rate. Robustness check with unemployment shows the same result. We conclude that economic growth is related to lower public health vulnerability, and urbanization has negative public health benefits. Our finding indicates an urgent need to balance the externalities generated by economic development and urbanization trends on public health vulnerability by promoting reasonable medical resource distribution, health practices and safety, improving social and environmental justice, and other health management measures.

Brief mobile phone assessments, completed daily or after sexual activity, can improve the validity and reliability of self-reported sexual behavior and allow for remote survey completion outside of the clinic setting. We conducted a qualitative study to better understand participants mobile phone use and to explore their perspectives on how to improve an existing mobile application-based sexual risk assessment. Methods: Sexually active, HIV seronegative men (n = 14) and women (n = 15) aged 18C39 years were recruited through an HIV counseling and testing clinic and community outreach in Soweto, South Africa. We conducted qualitative research through four age-stratified focus group discussions (FGDs) and analyzed a brief socio-demographics and mobile phone access questionnaire. All participants completed a sexual risk assessment before the FGD. Using a framework analytic approach, data were coded with Nvivo software. Results: All participants had access to mobile phones and internet, and 27 (93.1%) were able to download applications on their personal phones. Participants preferred mobile risk assessments to be offered in a choice of South African languages, using formal language (as opposed to emojis), with straight-forward wording and limited to five to 10 questions. Most participants found it acceptable to complete the assessment once a week, on a weekday, while a few were willing to complete it after each sexual encounter. It was suggested that a message reminder to complete the assessment should be sent at least daily until it is completed. The majority agreed that a password-protected application with a discreet logo was ideal for privacy, ease of use and flexibility for completion in any setting. A concern with this format, however, was the potential data use requirement. Participants expressed privacy concerns with using SMS, WhatsApp and other social media for risk assessments. Most agreed on an airtime incentive between ZAR5-10 (USD 0.29C0.58) per survey. Participants encouraged researchers to provide feedback to them about their sexual risk. Conclusions: Completion of mobile phone sexual risk assessments can be optimized with minimal incentives by ensuring that questionnaires are simple, brief, infrequent and have trusted privacy measures.","output":"You Are on the Right Track With the App: Qualitative Analysis of Mobile Phone Use and User Feedback Regarding Mobile Phone Sexual Risk Assessments for HIV Prevention Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background - The WINDOW-1 regimen introduced first-line ibrutinib with rituximab (IR) followed by 4 cycles of R-HCVAD for younger mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients (pts) demonstrating 90% CR on IR alone and we aimed to improve the CR rate with the addition of venetoclax. We therefore investigated the efficacy and safety of IR and venetoclax (IRV) followed by risk-stratified observation or short course R-HCVAD/MTX-ARA-C as consolidation in previously untreated young patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Our aim was to use a triplet chemotherapy-free induction to reduce the toxicity, complications and minimize chemotherapy exposure in MCL pts. Methods - We enrolled 50 previously untreated pts in this single institution, single arm, phase II clinical trial - NCT03710772. Pts received IR induction (Part-1) for initial 4 cycles. Pts were restaged at cycle 4 and received IRV for up to eight cycles (Cycle 5 to Cycle 12) starting with ramp up venetoclax dosing in Cycle 5. All pts who achieved CR prior to cycle 12 continued to receive IRV for 4 cycles (maximum 12 cycles) and then moved to part 2. Pts were stratified into three disease risk groups: high, moderate and low risk categories from the baseline data for assignment to R-HCVAD/MTX-ARA-C as consolidation in part 2 (4 cycles, 2 cycles, or no chemotherapy for high, medium and low risk pts respectively). Briefly, low risk pts were those with Ki-67 30%, largest tumor mass <3 cm, low MIPI score and no features of high risk disease (Ki-67 50%, mutations in the TP53, NSD2 or in NOTCH genes, complex karyotype or del17p, MYC positive, or largest tumor diameter >5 cm or blastoid/pleomorphic histology or if they remain in PR after 12 cycles of part 1. Medium risk are pts which did not belong to low or high-risk category. Those who experienced progression on part 1 went to part 2 and get 4 cycles of part 2. Patient were taken off protocol but not off study, if they remained in PR after 4 cycles of chemotherapy, these patients were followed up for time to next treatment and progression free survival on subsequent therapies. After part 2 consolidation, all pts received 2 years of IRV maintenance. The primary objective was to assess CR rates after IRV induction. Adverse events were coded as per CTCAE version 4. Molecular studies are being performed. Results - Among the 50 pts, the median age was 57 years (range - 35-65). There were 20 pts in high-risk group, 20 pts in intermediate-risk group and 10 pts in low-risk group. High Ki-67 (30%) in 18/50 (36%) pts. Eighteen (36%) had high and intermediate risk simplified MIPI scores. Six (12%) pts had aggressive MCL (blastoid/pleomorphic). Among the 24 TP53 evaluable pts, eight pts (33%) had TP53 aberrations (mutated and/or TP53 deletion by FISH). Forty-eight pts received IRV. Best response to IRV was 96% and CR of 92%. After part 2, the best ORR remained unaltered, 96% (92% CR and 4% PR). The median number of cycles of triplet IRV to reach best response was 8 cycles (range 2-12). Fifteen pts (30%) did not receive part 2 chemotherapy, two pts (4%) received 1 cycle, 16 pts (32%) 2 cycles and 13 pts (26%) got 4 cycles of chemotherapy. With a median follow up of 24 months, the median PFS and OS were not reached (2 year 92% and 90% respectively). The median PFS and OS was not reached and not significantly different in pts with high and low Ki-67% or with/without TP53 aberrations or among pts with low, medium or high-risk categories. The median PFS and OS was inferior in blastoid/pleomorphic MCL pts compared to classic MCL pts (p=0.01 and 0.03 respectively). Thirteen pts (26%) came off study - 5 for adverse events, 3 for on study deaths, and 2 for patient choice, 2 patients lost to follow up and one for disease progression. Overall, 5 pts died (3 on trial and 2 pts died off study, one due to progressive disease and another due to COVID pneumonia). Grade 3-4 toxicities on part 1 were 10% myelosuppression and 10% each with fatigue, myalgia and rashes and 3% mucositis. One pt developed grade 3 atrial flutter on part 1. None had grade 3-4 bleeding/bruising. Conclusions - Chemotherapy-free induction with IRV induced durable and deep responses in young MCL pts in the frontline setting. WINDOW-2 approach suggests that pts with low risk MCL do not need chemotherapy but further follow up is warranted. This combined modality treatment approach significantly improves outcomes of young MCL pts across all risk groups. Detailed molecular analyses will be reported.

Cross-sectional state-based multivariable study. Setting. USA. Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures. CVIR. Multivariable-adjusted geospatially-weighted regression models. As the American cannabis epidemic is characterized by a recent doubling of daily cannabis use it was considered important to characterize the contribution of high intensity use. Results. Significant associations of daily cannabis use quintile with CVIR were identified with the highest quintile having a prevalence ratio 5.11 (95%C.I. 4.90-5.33), an attributable fraction in the exposed (AFE) 80.45% (79.61-81.25%) and an attributable fraction in the population of 77.80% (76.88-78.68%) with Chi-squared-for-trend (14,782, df=4) significant at P<10-500. Similarly when cannabis legalization was considered decriminalization was associated with an elevated CVIR prevalence ratio 4.51 (95%C.I. 4.45-4.58), AFE 77.84% (77.50-78.17%) and Chi-squared-for-trend (56,679, df=2) significant at P<10-500. Monthly and daily use were linked with CVIR in bivariate geospatial regression models (P=0.0027, P=0.0059).

Other factors that appeared before the pandemic have also contributed to intensifying the Sino-US rivalry as well as Sino-European frictions. Nonetheless, Beijing's proactive mask and vaccine diplomacy, its strict lockdown policy as well as its more aggressive nationalist and anti-western narrative have fed rather than alleviated these tensions.

It is necessary to achieve a greater understanding of not only protein function and abundance but also their role in the development of diseases. Protein concentrations have been shown to reflect the physiological and pathologic state of an organ, tissue, or cells far more directly than DNA, and proteins can be profiled effectively with protein microarrays, which require only a small amount of sample material.

We have analyzed SARS-CoV-2 infected peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomic data through gene coexpression analysis. We identified 1520 and 1733 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the GSE152418 and CRA002390 PBMC datasets, respectively (FDR < 0.05). We found four key gene modules and hub gene signature based on module membership (MMhub) statistics and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks (PPIhub). Functional annotation by enrichment analysis of the genes of these modules demonstrated immune and inflammatory response biological processes enriched by the DEGs. The pathway analysis revealed the hub genes were enriched with the IL-17 signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways. Then, we demonstrated the classification performance of hub genes (PLK1, AURKB, AURKA, CDK1, CDC20, KIF11, CCNB1, KIF2C, DTL and CDC6) with accuracy >0.90 suggesting the biomarker potential of the hub genes.

Unfortunately, a significant proportion of infected patients have 'culture-negative' sepsis despite appropriate microbiologic assessment. RECENT FINDINGS There has been increased interest in the past decade on the treatment of culture-negative sepsis. Outcome data comparing culture-negative sepsis with culture-positive sepsis are mixed and it is unclear if culture-negative sepsis is a distinct entity. Recent recommendations promoting antibiotic de-escalation in culture-negative sepsis can be difficult to implement. A variety of strategies have been suggested for limiting antibiotic courses among patients with negative cultures, including limiting antibiotic durations, use of antibiotic stewardship programs, early consideration of narrow antibiotics, rapid diagnostic technology, and eliminating anti-MRSA therapy based on surveillance swabs. SUMMARY Owing to the difficulty inherent in studying the lack of positive data, and to the uncertainty surrounding diagnosis in patients with culture-negative sepsis, prospective data to guide antibiotic choices are lacking. However, antibiotic de-escalation in culture-negative sepsis is both recommended and feasible in patients showing clinical signs of improvement. Increased use of rapid diagnostics, careful consideration of antibiotic necessity, and antibiotic stewardship programs may result in less antibiotic days and better outcomes.","output":"Culture-negative sepsis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The higher death rate caused by COVID-19 in older people, especially those with comorbidities, is a challenge for biomedical aging research.

OBJECTIVE: (1) Identify factors predicting intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and (2) develop a simple calculator for clinicians managing patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 2,685 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a large metropolitan health system in Georgia, USA between March and July 2020 were included in the study. Seventy-five percent of patients were included in the training dataset (admitted March 1 to July 10). Through multivariable logistic regression, we developed a prediction model (probability score) for ICU transfer. Then, we validated the model by estimating its performance accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]) using data from the remaining 25% of patients (admitted July 11 to July 31). RESULTS: We included 2,014 and 671 patients in the training and validation datasets, respectively. Diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, serum C-reactive protein, and serum lactate dehydrogenase were identified as significant risk factors for ICU transfer, and a prediction model was developed. The AUC was 0.752 for the training dataset and 0.769 for the validation dataset. We developed a free, web-based calculator to facilitate use of the prediction model (https://icucovid19.shinyapps.io/ICUCOVID19/). CONCLUSION: Our validated, simple, and accessible prediction model and web-based calculator for ICU transfer may be useful in assisting healthcare providers in identifying hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk for clinical deterioration.

This approach had been used during the first wave of the pandemic, with good effect, allowing more referrals and more patients to be cared for in their place of choice. However, for a very small number of complex patients, the lack of inpatient facilities had proved problematic. To avoid this consequence during the second wave, a new plan to open a virtual ward, staffed by some of the inpatient team, was devised.AimTo ensure that dying patients with complex needs were given equitable and appropriate care whilst the inpatient unit was closed.MethodClinical staff were once more re-located to the community teams, but this time with 24-hour provision of nursing care, rather than the usual four times daily visits. Medications were administered in a more timely way, and delivery of personal care was given at the patients convenience, rather than set times, with increased support for families. Closer liaison with the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) also improved the patient experience, with daily MDT discussion.ResultsEight patients who required complex medical intervention, were admitted to other local hospices. However, 47 patients were admitted to the virtual ward, averaging 8.6 admissions per month. Identification of the last weeks of life was greatly improved by the internal referral process, reflected in an average length of stay of 7 days (range 3-13 days).ConclusionBy offering complex care to people at end of life in their own homes, this approach fulfilled the ideal criteria of providing everyone the right care, from the right person at the right time and reduced prior inequality of care provision (Thomas, 2021).","output":"Creation of a virtual ward: a response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Twelve hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Miller virulent strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were generated and characterized.

Six of these seven MAbs neutralized both attenuated and virulent TGEV, and the seventh (an unclassified MAb) neutralized only the latter virus. Two MAbs able to bind the cell membrane of infected cells had low neutralizing antibody titers (8 to 72) but were able to distinguish between virulent and attenuated TGEV (9- to 72-fold differences in neutralizing titers). Two E 2-specific MAbs had higher neutralizing antibody titers (782 to 34,117) and showed 4- to 13-fold differences in titers against the attenuated and virulent TGEV strains. Five MAbs which were specific for nucleocapsid (N) protein had cytoplasmic, particulate fluorescence in CCIF, and did not neutralize TGEV. Comparison of CCIF antibody titers of MAbs to the virulent and attenuated strains of TGEV indicated that differences existed in titers of most E 2 and all N-specific MAbs, with titers consistently higher against virulent TGEV (homologous strain).

This study examines the risks that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to equitable access to essential medicines and vaccines (EMV) for universal health coverage in Africa. METHODS: We searched medical databases and grey literature up to 2 October 2020 for studies reporting data on prospective pathways and innovative strategies relevant for the assessment and management of the emerging risks in accessibility, safety, quality, and affordability of EMV in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the resulting pool of evidence to support our analysis and to draw policy recommendations to mitigate the emerging risks and improve preparedness for future crises. RESULTS: Of the 310 records screened, 134 were included in the analysis. We found that the disruption of the international system affects more immediately the capability of low- and middle-income countries to acquire the basket of EMV. The COVID-19 pandemic may facilitate dishonesty and fraud, increasing the propensity of patients to take substandard and falsified drugs. Strategic regional cooperation in the form of joint tenders and contract awarding, joint price negotiation and supplier selection, as well as joint market research, monitoring, and evaluation could improve the supply, affordability, quality, and safety of EMV. Sustainable health financing along with international technology transfer and substantial investment in research and development are needed to minimize the vulnerability of African countries arising from their dependence on imported EMV. To ensure equitable access, community-based strategies such as mobile clinics as well as fees exemptions for vulnerable and under-served segments of society might need to be considered. Strategies such as task delegation and telephone triage could help reduce physician workload. This coupled with payments of risk allowance to frontline healthcare workers and health-literate healthcare organization might improve the appropriate use of EMV.

Secondary superimposed pulmonary infections present in these patients were also studied. We present an autopsy series of 27 COVID-19 patients with long disease duration, where pulmonary and extrapulmonary samples were obtained. In addition to histopathological analysis, viral genomic RNA (gRNA) and viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) were detected using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, and viral protein was detected using immunohistochemistry. This series includes 26 adults with a median duration of 39 days from onset of symptoms to death (ranging 9C108 days), 92% of them subjected to immunomodulatory therapy, and an infant patient. We detected gRNA in the lung of all but one patient, including those with longer disease duration. SgRNA was detected in 11 out of 17 patients (64.7%) with illness duration up to 6 weeks and in 3 out of 9 patients (33.3%) with more than 6 weeks of disease progression.

Very often there is a significant discrepancy between predicted building energy performance at the design stage and the actual one rendered during the building operation. This stems from the difference in users behavior. In spite of that, users interaction and feedback is rarely taken into account and evidence of the impact of occupants behavior on energy consumption is still scarce. Thus, the purpose of this study is to apply crowd-sensing techniques to understand how energy is consumed, define appropriate performance indicators, and provide inputs for building operations on more efficient use of resources. Methods: Monitoring strategies were implemented in an office lab with controlled variables to collect quality data on occupancy patterns, ambient factors and energy consumption. In addition, crowd-sensing techniques were applied to model user behavior at different ambient conditions over time and to contrast this behavior with energy consumption patterns combined with new inquiry tools to identify how occupants perceive their comfort level. Also, a set of energy efficiency indicators was used to compare energy performance in different periods. Results: It was found out, that there is a strong relation between users behavior and energy consumption, however, more than 50% of energy was consumed when no users activity was registered. Energy performance indicators revealed that measuring energy efficiency in terms of kWh per surface area encourages less efficient use of space and therefore including coefficient of person hours is advised. It was also found out that users do not relay fully on feedback mechanism and they rather prefer to take an action to adapt the ambient conditions instead of simply expressing their opinion. Analysis of energy usage during the covid-19 lock down revealed substantial use of energy unlike it was expected. It was because home computers were used only as terminals, while the actual tasks were performed on the lab computers with remote desktop connection turned on 24/7.

Hourly traffic, air pollutants, and meteorological data on/near a major freeway in the downtown of Seattle, Washington, were collected for five weeks before and ten weeks after the Washington Stay Home Order (SHO) was enacted, respectively (February 17-May 31, 2020). The pollutants between pre- and post-SHO periods were compared, and their differences were statistically tested. Besides, first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAR(1)) models were developed to reveal the impacts specific to the change of traffic due to the COVID-19 responses while controlling for meteorological conditions. Results indicate that compared with those in the post-SHO period, the median traffic volume and road occupancy decreased by 37% and 52%, respectively. As for pollutants, the median BC and PM2.5 levels significantly decreased by 25% and 33%, relatively, while NO, NO2, NOx, and CO decreased by 33%, 29%, 30%, and 17%, respectively. In contrast, neither size-resolved UFPs nor total UFPs showed significant changes between the two periods, although larger particles (&#8805;115.5 nm) decreased by 4-29%. Additionally, significant differences were found in meteorological conditions between the two periods. Based on the MAR(1) models, controlling for meteorological conditions, the COVID-19 responses were associated with significant decreases in median levels of traffic-related pollutants including 11.5-154.0 nm particles (ranging from -3% [95% confidence interval (CI): -1%, -4%] to -12% [95% CI: -10%, -14%]), total UFPs (-7% [95% CI: -5%, -8%]), BC (-6% [95% CI: -5%, -7%]), PM2.5 (-2% [95% CI: -1%, -3%]), NO, NO2, NOx (ranging from -3% [95% CI: -2%, -4%] to -10% [95% CI: -18%, -12%]), and CO (-4% [95% CI, -3%, -5%]).

Research objectiveTo develop and validate a mortality prediction system called C-TIME (COVID-19 Time of Intubation Mortality Evaluation) using variables available before intubation, determine its discriminant accuracy, and compare it to APACHE IVa and SOFA. MethodsA retrospective cohort was set in 18 medical-surgical ICUs, enrolling consecutive adults, positive by SARS-CoV 2 RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or positive rapid antigen test, and undergoing endotracheal intubation. All were followed until hospital discharge or death. The combined outcome was hospital mortality or terminal extubation with hospice discharge. Twenty-five clinical and laboratory variables available 48 hours prior to intubation were entered into multiple logistic regression (MLR) and the resulting model was used to predict mortality of validation cohort patients. AUROC was calculated for C-TIME, APACHE IVa and SOFA. ResultsThe median age of the 2,440 study patients was 66 years; 61.6 percent were men, and 50.5 percent were Hispanic, Native American or African American. Age, gender, COPD, minimum mean arterial pressure, Glasgow Coma scale score, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio, maximum creatinine and bilirubin, receiving factor Xa inhibitors, days receiving non-invasive respiratory support and days receiving corticosteroids prior to intubation were significantly associated with the outcome variable. The validation cohort comprised 1,179 patients. C-TIME had the highest AUROC of 0.75 (95%CI 0.72-0.79), vs 0.67 (0.64-0.71) and 0.59 (0.55-0.62) for APACHE and SOFA, respectively (Chi2 P<0.0001). ConclusionsC-TIME is the only mortality prediction score specifically developed and validated for COVID-19 patients who require mechanical ventilation. It has acceptable discriminant accuracy and goodness-of-fit to assist decision-making just prior to intubation.

Social media platforms are not now only used extensively by individuals but also by businesses, governmental agencies, educational institutions, and many other organizations to deliver information to the public and, in return, collect information from that same audience. The preliminary study presented here offers valuable insights into how social media may be used to improve food safety standards. Today, food safety is still a major health challenge in the country, which occasionally faces unsafe food supply chains, an increased number of food borne outbreaks, and poor hygiene education. Social media may be used as a very valuable tool for people to access important information and more knowledge about food safety. The limited-scope survey presented here was conducted over the western part of Saudi Arabia and included 295 individuals of both genders, among various age groups. Participants responded to an online questionnaire about their use of social media to obtain information about food safety. Results showed that social media was indeed a major outlet for individuals to access information on food safety, with the top-ranked social media platforms being WhatsApp (M = 2.99) followed by Snapchat (M = 3.72), YouTube (M = 4.08), Instagram (M = 4.46), and Facebook (M = 4.81). Additionally, we found that the most trusted sources of information was the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (72.6%) and the Saudi Ministry of Health (55.4%). Participants most frequently sought epidemiological information (52.5%), quantitative risk estimates (23.1%), and information on the various types of foodborne infections (15.3%); they preferred the information to be in video format (67.5%), articles (57.6%), infographics (55.3%).

We also recorded continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) in the beluga, bottlenose dolphin, false killer whale, killer whale (Orcinus orca), and pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) to evaluate cardiorespiratory coupling while breathing spontaneously under voluntary control. The results show that cetaceans have a strong Respiratory Sinus Arrythmia (RSA), during which both f H and SV vary within the interbreath interval, making average values dependent on the breathing frequency (f R). The RSA-corrected f H was lower for all cetaceans compared to similarly sized terrestrial mammals breathing continuously. As compared with terrestrial mammals, the RSA-corrected SV and CO were either lower or the same for the dolphin and false killer whale, while both were elevated in the beluga. When plotting f R against f H for an inactive mammal, cetaceans had a greater cardiac response to changes in f R as compared with terrestrial mammals. We propose that these data indicate an important coupling between respiration and cardiac function that enhances gas exchange, and that this RSA is important to maximize gas exchange during surface intervals, similar to that reported in the elephant seal.","output":"Cardiorespiratory coupling in cetaceans; a physiological strategy to improve gas exchange?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people suffer a disproportionate burden of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Methods: We studied a nighttime pediatric TMDS and HEM in a semi-urban and rural region of Haiti. Costs of the 2 services were enumerated to represent the financial investments of both providers and patients. DALYs averted were calculated to represent the years lives lost (YLL) and years lost to disability (YLD) from diarrheal, respiratory, and skin (bacterial and scabies etiologies) disease among children from zero to 9 years old. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated and compared to the per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) of Haiti ($1,177). Cost-effectiveness was defined as an ICER less than 3 times the per-capita GDP of Haiti ($3,531). Univariate sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate how uncertainty of individual parameter estimates (utilization rates, costs, lost wages, discounting factor) affected the ICER. Results: The total costs of the nighttime TMDS and HEM to society were $285,931.72 per year and $89,335.41 per year, respectively. The DALYs averted by the TMDS and HEM were 199.76 and 22.37, respectively. Through sensitivity analyses, the ICER of the TMDS ranged from $791.43 to $1,593.35.

Methods: Eleven human IBD microarray datasets were recruited from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and four were selected as discovery cohorts. An RNA-seq dataset from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multiomics Database was used as a validation cohort. m6A regulators were measured in volunteers colonic samples. Consensus clustering and immune scoring were used to estimate the characteristics of m6A regulation in IBD. m6A-related characteristics of different sub-phenotypes, sample sources, and biological therapeutic responses were determined using seven independent datasets. Results: m6A modification involves methyltransferases (writers), demethylases (erasers), and methylation-reading proteins (readers). A wide interaction exists between m6A regulators and IBD risk genes. The IBD risk loci can also be modified by m6A modifications in the public m6A sequencing data. Furthermore, m6A regulators displayed extensive differential expression in four independent discovery cohorts that share common differential genes (IGF2BP2, HNRNPA2B1, ZCCHC4, and EIF3I). In the validated cohort and enrolled volunteers colonic biopsy samples, the differential m6A regulators were reconfirmed. Two clusters of consensus clustering exhibit different immune phenotypes. m6A-modified positions exist in the core IBD immune cytokines. Another set of IBD datasets revealed m6A-related differences across clinical phenotypes, biological samples, and therapeutic response subgroups in IBD patients.

However, the relationship between sCoV exposure and SARS-CoV-2 correlates of protection have not been clearly identified. Here we performed a cross-sectional analysis of cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization to three SARS-CoV-2 antigens using pre-pandemic serum from four different groups: pediatrics and adolescents (<21 yrs of age), persons 21 to 70 yrs of age, persons older than 70 yrs of age, and persons living with HCV or HIV. We find that antibody cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens varied between 1.6% and 15.3% depending on the cohort and the isotype-antigen pair analyzed. We also demonstrate a broad range of neutralizing activity (0-45%) in pre-pandemic serum that interferes with SARS-CoV-2 spike attachment to ACE2. While the abundance of sCoV antibodies did not directly correlate with neutralization efficiency, by using machine learning methodologies, we show that neutralizing activity is rather dependent on the latent variables related to the pattern ratios of sCoVs antibodies presented by each person. These were independent of age or sex, and could be accurately predicted by comparing the relative ratios of IgGs in sera directed to NL63, 229E, HKU-1, and OC43 spike proteins. More specifically, we identified antibodies to NL63 and OC43 as being the two most important predictors of latent variables responsible for protection, and 229E as being the least weighted.

It is, furthermore, not known if heterogeneous tinnitus subgroups respond differently to ICBT. AIMS: This dismantling study aimed to explore the contribution of applied relaxation within ICBT for reducing tinnitus distress and comorbidities associated with tinnitus. A secondary aim was to assess whether outcomes varied for three tinnitus subgroups, namely those with significant tinnitus severity, those with low tinnitus severity, and those with significant depression. METHODS: A parallel randomized controlled trial design (n = 126) was used to compare audiologist-guided applied relaxation with the full ICBT intervention. Recruitment was online and via the intervention platform. Assessments were completed at four-time points including a 2-month follow-up period. The primary outcome was tinnitus severity as measured by the Tinnitus Functional Index. Secondary outcomes were included for anxiety, depression, insomnia, negative tinnitus cognitions, health-related quality of life, hearing disability, and hyperacusis. Treatment engagement variables including the number of logins, number of modules opened, and the number of messages sent. Both an intention-to-treat analysis and completer's only analysis were undertaken. RESULTS: Engagement was low which compromised results as the full intervention was undertaken by few participants. Both the ICBT and applied relaxation resulted in large reduction of tinnitus severity (within-group effect sizes d = 0.87 and 0.68, respectively for completers only analysis), which were maintained, or further improved at follow-up. These reductions in tinnitus distress were greater for the ICBT group, with a small effect size differences (between-group d = 0.15 in favor of ICBT for completers only analysis). Tinnitus distress decreased the most at post-intervention for those with significant depression at baseline. Both ICBT and applied relaxation contributed to significant reductions on most secondary outcome measures, with no group differences, except for a greater reduction of hyperacusis in the ICBT group. CONCLUSION: Due to poor compliance partly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic results were compromised. Further studies employing strategies to improve compliance and engagement are required. The intervention's effectiveness increased with initial level of tinnitus distress; those with the highest scores at intake experienced the most substantial changes on the outcome measures. This may suggest tailoring of interventions according to tinnitus severity. Larger samples are needed to confirm this.","output":"Dismantling internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for tinnitus.

While numerous scientific reports underscore the ubiquitous presence of MPs and NPs in aquatic environments, particularly the oceans, there are many unresolved issues involved in their sampling, identification and characterization. This paper addresses some of the main problems and suggests what needs to be undertaken to overcome these issues. An overriding problem is the lack of harmonization of the protocols used for sampling MPs at sea and identifying them in the laboratory. There are technological challenges in polymeric characterization of NPs in environmental samples. Researchers use a wide variety of net types and net mesh sizes to capture and separate MP floating in the sea which makes comparing MP concentrations from different teams and areas extremely difficult and calls for establishing inter-comparison exercises among the various research teams. Furthermore, the issue of whether chemicals in MPs and NPs leach following ingestion by biota or whether they transport and release contaminants adsorbed on MP/NP surfaces is still unresolved. In essence, these and other issues have to be addressed and resolved before society has an accurate picture of their importance as an aquatic pollutant. There are no datasets on the environmental concentration of NPs, hence their effect on biota is solely relied on laboratory experiments using extremely high concentrations. The legitimacy of these effects and interactions in the biotic system is something that warrants discussion. ABSTRACT: Microplastic research has become a buzz word. It is seen as one of the most pressing issues of Anthropocene contamination. There is certainly no doubt about the ubiquitous presence of microplastic (MP) in almost all environmental matrices. However, the validity of considering them as a vector for contaminants needs some reconsideration, there are other more potent pathways. Their effect on marine biota also calls for some realistic experiments with environmental concentrations of MP and nanoplastic (NP). It has been observed that in most published literature, polymer characterization is performed. Is it necessary to do, or will merely finding and confirming the particle as plastic suffice for environmental research? Harmonization of protocols is necessary, and there is likely a need for some inter-laboratory comparison exercises in order to produce comparable data and reliable assessments across regions. Samples collected from the same area using different techniques show an order of magnitude difference in MP concentration. The issue of nanoplastic is more contentious; are we technologically ready to identify NP in environmental samples?","output":"Micro-Nano Plastic in the Aquatic Environment: Methodological Problems and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Research has shown that acute kidney injury (AKI) has a noticeable incidence in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with prior renal insufficiency are particularly susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), due to their immune dysfunction. However, most patients with COVID-19 do not have a history of kidney dysfunction, and few studies have focused on the incidence of AKI among COVID-19 patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the occurrence of AKI in severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients, with a particular focus on those without a CKD history. METHODS: A single-center retrospective study of 96 patients with COVID-19 in China between February 7 and March 3, 2020 was conducted. All patients were diagnosed by nucleic acid test (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2. Enrolled patients were divided into the severely or critically ill group according to the defined criteria. Patients' epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics, along with their treatment information, were collected from the medical history system. The occurrence of AKI was compared between the severe and critical patients, and between patients with or without a history of CKD. The diagnostic criteria for AKI included an increase in the serum creatinine level to &#8805;1.5-fold the level at baseline within 7 days according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Renal outcomes were defined as AKI or non-AKI. RESULTS: Four patients (4.2%) developed AKI, all of whom were in the critically ill group, and 3 (75%) of whom died. Out of the 90 severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients without CKD, 3 (3.3%) patients developed AKI; out of the 6 patients with CKD, 1 (16.7%) patient developed AKI. Age, disease severity, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 were correlated with AKI onset in severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients, while lymphocyte count and estimated glomerular filtration rate at admission were inversely related to the development of AKI. CONCLUSIONS: Only 3.3% of severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients without CKD in our research cohort developed AKI. Critically ill patients may be more susceptible to AKI than severely ill patients.","output":"A survey on acute kidney injury in severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients without chronic kidney disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To confirm the presence of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in cell-free saliva (CFS) of children with asthma and describe the isolated EV population. METHODS: A pooled sample of CFS EVs isolated from 180 participants using ExoQuick-TC was examined in downstream analyses. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm the presence of EVs. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and single particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensing (SP-IRIS) with fluorescence were used for sizing, counting, and phenotyping of EVs. Capillary immunoassays were used for protein quantitation. RESULTS: TEM confirmed the presence of EVs of diverse sizes, indicating the prep contained a heterogeneous population of EVs. Capillary immunoassays confirmed the presence of EV-associated proteins (CD9, CD63, CD81, ICAM-1, and ANXA5) and indicated limited cellular contamination. As others have also reported, there were discrepancies in the EV sizing and enumeration across platforms. Fluorescent NTA detected particles with a mode diameter of ~90 nm, whereas SP-IRIS reported sizes of ~55C60 nm that more closely approximated the TEM results. Consistent with protein immunoassay results, SP-IRIS with fluorescence showed that the majority of these EVs were CD9- and CD63-positive, with little expression of CD81. CONCLUSION: EVs from CFS can be isolated using a high-throughput method that can be scaled to large epidemiological studies. To our knowledge, we are the first to characterize CFS EVs from patients with asthma. The use of CFS EVs as potential novel biomarkers in asthma warrants further investigation and opens a new avenue of research for future studies.","output":"Isolation and characterization of extracellular vesicles in saliva of children with asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, a disease name as corona (COVID-19) has become a serious problem around the globe.

We present the steps taken by the government and evaluate their effect on epidemic trends. MATERIALS: Cyprus Press and Information Office data were analysed. Using an R-based forecasting program, two models were created to predict cases up to 01/09/2020: Model 1, which utilised data up to 09/06/2020, when airports reopened to foreign travelers with COVID-19 screening; and Model 2, which utilised data until 24/06/2020, when screening for passengers from low-transmission countries was discontinued. RESULTS: PIO data revealed no significant policy changes between 24/06/2020 and 31/07/2020. Prediction models were robust and accurate (Model 1, R2 = 0.999, P < .001; Model 2, R2 = 0.998, P < .001).

It is characterized by the deposition of amyloid beta peptide, forming compact fibrillar plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. Another major and much more prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality in world is diabetes especially type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is caused by a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. Chronic wounds caused by antibiotic resistant bacterial infections that fail to heal are a common complication of diabetes mellitus and the most frequent reason for nontraumatic lower limb amputation. Holistically, these two diseases are linked at molecular level but the exact mechanism is a topic of debate. Bacteriophages are viruses infecting bacteria and lack ability to infect mammalian cells. They are neither causative agent for Alzheimer's disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus nor involved in their pathogenicity but promises for a novel divergent therapeutic approach. The great versatility of the phage system has led to the development of improved phage delivery vectors, as well as immunomodulation of anti-amyloid beta peptide response. Phages could also constitute valuable prophylaxis against bacterial infections, especially in immunocompromised patients like in the case of diabetes. Patients having diabetes have a high risk of developing foot ulcers which are difficult to be treated by antibiotics alone due to ever increasing antibiotic resistance strains. Combination therapy based on multiple phage and broad spectrum antibiotics holds great promise.

Structural and biochemical studies suggest that a conserved Gln residue at the P1 position is absolutely required for efficient cleavage. Here, we investigate the effects of amino acid substitution at the P1 position of 3CLpro cleavage sites of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) on the cleavage efficiency and viral replication by in vitro cleavage assays and reverse genetic approaches. Our results demonstrated that a P1-Asn substitution at the nsp4-5/Q2779, nsp5-6/Q3086, nsp7-8/Q3462, nsp8-9/Q3672, and nsp9-10/Q3783 sites, a P1-Glu substitution at the nsp8-9/Q3672 site, and a P1-His substitution at the nsp15-16/Q6327 site were tolerated and allowed recovery of infectious mutant viruses, albeit with variable degrees of growth defects. In contrast, a P1-Asn substitution at the nsp6-7/Q3379, nsp12-13/Q4868, nsp13-14/Q5468, and nsp14-15/Q5989 sites, as well as a P1-Pro substitution at the nsp15-16/Q6327 site, abolished 3CLpro-mediated cleavage at the corresponding position and blocked the recovery of infectious viruses. Analysis of the effects of these lethal mutations on RNA synthesis suggested that processing intermediates, such as the nsp6-7, nsp12-13, nsp13-14, nsp14-15, and nsp15-16 precursors, may function in negative-stranded genomic RNA replication, whereas mature proteins may be required for subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) transcription. More interestingly, a mutant 3CLpro with either a P166S or P166L mutation was selected when an IBV infectious cDNA clone carrying the Q6327N mutation at the nsp15-16 site was introduced into cells. Either of the two mutations was proved to enhance significantly the 3CLpro-mediated cleavage efficiency at the nsp15-16 site with a P1-Asn substitution and compensate for the detrimental effects on recovery of infectious virus.","output":"Functional and genetic studies of the substrate specificity of coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus 3C-like proteinase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of early March, 2019-nCoV has infected more than one hundred thousand people and claimed thousands of lives. 2019-nCoV is a novel form of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and has high similarity with SARS-CoV. No approved vaccine yet exists for any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine candidate. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data. Significance Statement The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has affected more than 100 countries and continues to spread. There is an immediate need for effective vaccines that contain antigens which trigger responses from human T-cells and B-cells (known as epitopes). Here we identify potential T-cell epitopes through an analysis of human antigen presentation, as well as B-cell epitopes through an analysis of protein structure.

Quantification of IgA and IgG Abs in saliva allows studies of the mucosal and systemic immune response after natural infection or vaccination. We developed and validated an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect and quantify salivary IgA and IgG Abs against the prefusion-stabilized form of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein expressed in suspension-adapted HEK-293 cells. Normalization against total Ab isotype was performed to account for specimen differences, such as collection time and sample volume. Saliva samples collected from 187 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases enrolled in 2 cohorts and 373 prepandemic saliva samples were tested. The sensitivity of both EIAs was high (IgA, 95.5%; IgG, 89.7%) without compromising specificity (IgA, 99%; IgG, 97%). No cross-reactivity with endemic coronaviruses was observed. The limit of detection for SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA and IgG assays were 1.98 ng/ml and 0.30 ng/ml, respectively. Salivary IgA and IgG Abs were detected earlier in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms than in severe cases. However, severe cases showed higher salivary Ab titers than those with a mild infection. Salivary IgA titers quickly decreased after 6 wk in mild cases but remained detectable until at least week 10 in severe cases. Salivary IgG titers remained high for all patients, regardless of disease severity. In conclusion, EIAs for both IgA and IgG had high specificity and sensitivity for the confirmation of current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infections and evaluation of the IgA and IgG immune response.","output":"Development and Validation of an Enzyme Immunoassay for Detection and Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 Salivary IgA and IgG"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG, IgM, IgA) cannot differentiate recent and past infections.

When such an outbreak occurs, an accurate estimate of the transmissibility of the responsible pathogen is essential for an appropriate response to future outbreaks. Transmissibility is usually characterised in terms of the reproduction number, R, which is the mean number of new cases of infection produced by a single infectious individual. A subcritical reproduction number (R < 1) guarantees that an outbreak will eventually die out of its own accord. By contrast, a supercritical reproduction number (R > 1) does not guarantee spread of the disease, since even with appreciable transmissibility, an outbreak may become extinct due to stochastic effects associated with a small number of infected individuals. Once the number of infectious individuals is conditioned on extinction, we show that an exact symmetry of the underlying theory ensures two distinct values of R, one larger than unity, the other smaller than unity, for which all outbreak properties are identical, with no signature of difference. Therefore a disease with a subcritical R, or its supercritical counterpart, when conditioned on extinction, have, for a given outbreak, identical individual likelihoods. In the full likelihood, this symmetry is lost, since the individual likelihood for a subcritical R is weighted by an extinction probability of unity, but the individual likelihood of a supercritical R is weighted by a sub-unity extinction probability. However, the inference can still benefit from the underlying symmetry, since it yields a mapping of all supercritical reproduction numbers onto the subcritical domain (R < 1), thereby speeding up evaluation of the likelihood profile. The symmetry holds in the standard situation, where the distribution of secondary cases is Poisson, as well as where this distribution has a negative binomial form and super-spreading can occur.","output":"Sub- or supercritical transmissibilities in a finite disease outbreak: Symmetry in outbreak properties of a disease conditioned on extinction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus belongs to the novel virulent strains of the respiratory viruses. It is an invisible enemy having significant threats to human health. The major trouble is that the spread of coronavirus is not limited to its transmission from human to human (by contact, fomites, and droplets) but also continue to transmit from contaminated surfaces to humans. These infectious viruses can survive in different non-biocidal materials for a long time. Copper holds a significant position in different biological and biochemical processes because its ions Cu+2 and Cu+ can carry out oxidation, dioxygen transportation, and electron transference. It is a redox-active metal. It can convert into Cu+2 or Cu+ state by accepting or donating electrons. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are generated on alloy surfaces. The redox reaction of copper (Cu+2 ? Cu+) along with the generation of ROS results in enhanced inactivation of the virus. In this review, the effectiveness of copper against coronaviruses has been explained. The denaturing of specific proteins of coronavirus by the interaction of copper and its ions has also been reported. Hence, the copper coated surfaces could be used in public areas.

Learning generally needs several repetitive cycles to break the complexity barrier. We make use of fruit fly and particle swarm optimization (PSO) evolutionary algorithms with the help of MATLAB programming to constantly search better fitting consecutive process modules in manufacturing chain. CODP is optimized by increasing modularity and reducing complexity through evolutionary concept. Learning-based PSO iterations are performed. The methods shown here are recommended for process flow design in a learning-oriented supply chain organization which can involve in-house and outsourced manufacturing steps. Finally, a complexity reduction model is presented which can aid in deploying this concept in design of supply chain and manufacturing flows.

The current diagnosis and treatment guidelines are still need to be improved, and more excellent clinical experience is needed to provide reference. Methods We analyzed and summarized clinical data of 97 confirmed COVID-19 adult patients (including 26 severe cases) admitted to the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 17, 2020 to March 10, 2020,included laboratory examination results, imaging findings, treatment effect, prognosis , etc, in order to put forward prediction index of severe COVID-19 patients, principles of early intervention and methylprednisolone usages in COVID-19 patients. Results 1.Hypoxemia, hyperlactic acid, hypoproteinemia, and hypokalemia were prevalent in COVID-19 patients.The significant low lymphocyte count, hypoproteinemia, hypokalemia, the persistent or worsen high CRP, high D-dimer, and high BNP, and the occurrence of hemoptysis and novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) viremia were important indicators for early diagnosis and prediction of severe disease progression. 2.Characteristic images of lung CT had a clear change in COVID - 19, Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and high-density linear combinations may indicate different pathological changes. Rapid lobular progression of GGO suggests the possibility of severe disease. 3.Basic principles of early intervention treatment of COVID-19: on the premise of no effective antiviral drugs, treatment is based on supportive and symptomatic therapy (albumin supplementation, supplement of potassium, supplement blood plasma, etc.) in order to maintain the stability of the intracellular environment and adequately reactivate body immunity to clean up SARS-CoV-2 . 4. According to severity, oxygenation index, body weight, age, underlying diseases, appropriate amount methylprednisolone application on severe/critical COVID-19 patients on demand, improved blood oxygen and reduced the utilization rate of invasive mechanical ventilation, case fatality rate and medical burden significantly. The most common indications for invasive mechanical ventilation should be strictly control in critical COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: 1.Accurate and timely identification of clinical features in severe risks, and early and appropriate intervention can block disease progression. 2.Appropriate dose of methylprednisolone can effectively avoid invasive mechanical ventilation and reduce case fatality rate in critical COVID-19 patients.","output":"Key to successful treatment of COVID-19: accurate identification of severe risks and early intervention of disease progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Acute respiratory illness (ARI) accounts for a large proportion of all visits to pediatric health facilities. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses allow sensitive detection of viral nucleic acids, but it is not clear to what extent specific viruses contribute to disease because many viruses have been detected in asymptomatic children. Better understanding of how to interpret viral findings is important to reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics. OBJECTIVE To compare viral qPCR findings from children with ARI versus asymptomatic control subjects. METHODS Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children aged 5 years with ARI and from individually matched, asymptomatic, population-based control subjects during a noninfluenza season. Samples were analyzed by using qPCR for 16 viruses. RESULTS Respiratory viruses were detected in 72.3% of the case patients (n = 151) and 35.4% of the control subjects (n = 74) (P = .001). Rhinovirus was the most common finding in both case patients and control subjects (47.9% and 21.5%, respectively), with a population-attributable proportion of 0.39 (95% confidence interval: 0.01 to 0.62). Metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus were highly overrepresented in case patients. Bocavirus was associated with ARI even after adjustment for coinfections with other viruses and was associated with severe disease. Enterovirus and coronavirus were equally common in case patients and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS qPCR detection of respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, or parainfluenza viruses in children with ARI is likely to be causative of disease; detection of several other respiratory viruses must be interpreted with caution due to high detection rates in asymptomatic children.","output":"Clinical utility of PCR for common viruses in acute respiratory illness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a major Public Health problem that is influenced by a number of factors Recently it has been hypothesized that this transmission may be reduced during the summer due to the warm temperatures On the other hand, the potential association between the high number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and air pollution is being studied This relationship was already proven during the SARS outbreak in 2002 This article reviewed the scientific evidence to date regarding the possible influence of environmental temperature and air pollution on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 It is concluded that the annual seasons and, therefore, the temperature do not seem to influence the spread of the virus In addition, air pollutants facilitate infection and mortality from the virus","output":"[Influence of environmental temperature and air pollution on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent times, there has been an increased focus on animal health and zoonotic diseases that have the potential to trigger epidemics or pandemics that disproportionately affect the poor and most vulnerable.

In this retrospective cohort review, we included all AA patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to an inner-city teaching community hospital in New York city. Demographics, clinical presentation, baseline co-morbidities, and laboratory data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The predictors of mortality were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Of the 408 (median age, 67 years) patients included, 276 (66.65%, median age 63 years) survived while 132 (33.35%, median age 71 years) died. The most common presenting symptoms were cough, myalgia, fever/chills, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain), with a prevalence of 62.50%, 43.87%, 53.68%, and 27.21%, respectively.

METHODS: Hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-COV-2 from four Atlanta hospitals were included in this observational cohort study and underwent admission testing of MOCHA parameters (plasma d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, fibrin monomer). Clinical outcomes included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, access line thrombosis, ICU admission, intubation and mortality. MAIN RESULTS: Of 276 patients (mean age 59  6.4 years, 47% female, 62% African American), 45 (16%) had a thrombotic endpoint. Each MOCHA parameter was independently associated with a thrombotic event (p<0.05) and &#8805; 2 abnormalities was associated with thrombotic endpoints (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.8) as were admission D-dimer &#8805; 2000 ng/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.6) and &#8805; 3000 ng/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9). However, only &#8805; 2 MOCHA abnormalities were associated with ICU admission (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.2) and intubation (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.4). MOCHA and D-dimer cutoffs were not associated with mortality. MOCHA with <2 abnormalities (26% of the cohort) had 89% sensitivity and 93% negative predictive value for a thrombotic endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: An admission MOCHA profile is useful to risk-stratify COVID-19 patients for thrombotic complications and more effective than isolated d-dimer for predicting risk of ICU admission and intubation.","output":"Validation of an admission coagulation panel for risk stratification of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Suicide is a growing public health issue among adolescents. While the majority of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth are healthy, many experience suicidal thoughts and behavior (STB). Due to discrimination and stigma, TGD youth attempt suicide at higher rates then heterosexual, cisgender and even cisgender, LGBQ youth. Despite this vulnerability to suicide, few treatments have been developed and tested for this population. One treatment, attachment-based family therapy (ABFT) has been adapted to work with LGBQ youth and may be promising for TGD adolescents at risk for suicide. This article provides an overview of our ABFT modifications for TGD youth with thoughts of suicide. Specifically, we illustrate how treatment outcomes, in a single case study, relate to processes within clinical treatment tasks. The case study demonstrates the application of these ABFT modifications with a self-identified, gender nonconforming adolescent (who had recently attempted suicide) and his caregivers. Treatment evaluation measures were collected over the course of 24 weeks to illustrate the youth's clinical progress. The youth's suicidal symptoms diminished markedly by the end of treatment.

Most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or ventilator support. This respiratory compromise appears to be due to a hyperimmune reaction, often called a cytokine storm. Vagus nerve stimulation has been demonstrated to block production of cytokines in sepsis and other medical conditions. We hypothesize that non\\\\invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) might provide clinical benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with COVID\\\\19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on two case reports was obtained via email correspondence and phone interviews with the patients. RESULTS: Both patients reported clinically meaningful benefits from nVNS therapy. In case 1, the patient used nVNS to expedite symptomatic recovery at home after hospital discharge and was able to discontinue use of opioid and cough suppressant medications. In case 2, the patient experienced immediate and consistent relief from symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as an improved ability to clear his lungs.

Yet the comparatively mild course of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic provoked considerable public controversy around those stockpiles, leading to questions about their costCbenefit profile and the commercial interests allegedly shaping their creation, as well as around their scientific evidence base. So, how did governments come to view pharmaceutical stockpiling as such an indispensable element of pandemic preparedness planning? What are the underlying security rationalities that rapidly rendered antivirals such a desirable option for government planners? Drawing upon an in-depth reading of Foucaults notion of a crisis of circulation, this article argues that the rise of pharmaceutical stockpiling across Europe is integral to a governmental rationality of political rule that continuously seeks to anticipate myriad circulatory threats to the welfare of populations C including to their overall levels of health. Novel antiviral medications such as Tamiflu are such an attractive policy option because they could enable governments to rapidly modulate dangerous levels of (viral) circulation during a pandemic, albeit without disrupting all the other circulatory systems crucial for maintaining population welfare.

Despite increasingly stringent containment measures enforced by the government, the health system faced an enormous pressure, and extraordinary efforts were made in order to increase overall hospital beds' availability and especially ICU capacity. Nevertheless, the hardest-hit hospitals in Northern Italy experienced a shortage of ICU beds and resources that led to hard allocating choices. At the beginning of March 2020, the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) issued recommendations aimed at supporting physicians in prioritizing patients when the number of critically ill patients overwhelm the capacity of ICUs. One motivating concern for the SIAARTI guidance was that, if no balanced and consistent allocation procedures were applied to prioritize patients, there would be a concrete risk for unfair choices, and that the prevalent \\"first come, first served\\" principle would lead to many avoidable deaths. Among the drivers of decision for admission to ICUs, age, comorbidities, and preexisting functional status were included. The recommendations were criticized as ageist and potentially discriminatory against elderly patients. Looking forward to the next steps, the Italian experience can be relevant to other parts of the world that are yet to see a significant surge of COVID-19: the need for transparent triage criteria and commonly shared values give the Italian recommendations even greater legitimacy.","output":"Rationing in a Pandemic: Lessons from Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the pathogenesis of the infectious process in the respiratory tract by SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 coronaviruses, two stages can be distinguished: early (etiotropic) and late (pathogenetic) ones.

This article considers six major chemotherapeutic classes aimed at certain viral targets: inhibitors of viral RNA polymerase, inhibitors of viral protease Mpro, inhibitors of proteolytic activation of viral protein S allowing virus entry into the target cell, inhibitors of virus uncoating in cellular endosomes, compounds of exogenous interferons, and compounds of natural and recombinant virus-neutralizing antibodies. In the second stage, when the multiplication of the virus decreases and threatening pathological processes of excessive inflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and secondary bacterial pneumonia and sepsis events develop, a pathogenetic therapeutic approach including extracorporeal blood oxygenation, detoxification, and anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial therapy seems to be the most effective way for the patients recovery.","output":"Molecular Targets in the Chemotherapy of Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TMPRSS11D (HAT) belongs to the large type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family, participating in various biological and physiological processes.

It seems that most of the researchers have recognized lock-down as one of the major impact factors in their models. As a result of this in the absence of lock-down the models formulated would not contribute much significant results.

To the date more than 13 million confirmed cases and more than half a million are dead around the world. This virus also attached Malaysia in its immature stage where 8718 cases were confirmed and 122 were declared as death. Malaysia responsibly controlled the spread by enforcing MCO. Hence, it is required to visualize the pattern of Covid-19 spread. Also, it is necessary to estimate the impact of the enforced prevention measures. In this paper, an infectious disease dynamic modeling (SEIR) is used to estimate the epidemic spread in Malaysia. The main assumption is to update the reproduction number Rt with respect to the implemented prevention measures. For a time-frame of five month, the Rt was assumed to vary between 2.9 and 0.3. Moreover, the manuscript includes two possible scenarios: the first will be the extension of the stricter measures all over the country, and the second will be the gradual lift of the lock-down. After implementing several stages of lock-down we have found that the estimated values of the Rt with respect to the strictness degree varies between 0.2 to 1.1. A continuous strict lock-down may reduce the Rt to 0.2 and accordingly the estimated active cases will be reduced to 20 by the beginning of September 2020. In contrast, the second scenario considers a gradual lift of the enforced prevention measures by the end of June 2020, here we have considered three possible outcomes according to the MCO relaxation. Thus, the estimated values of Rt = 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, which shows a rapid increase in the number of active cases.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of a 3D passive polarizing display (3DPPD) and a novel 3D head-mounted display (3DHMD; HMS-3000MT) on the performance of the first laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair by novices and compare both systems with standard high-definition 2D (HD2D) laparoscopy. METHODS Patients with symptomatic inguinal hernia underwent transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) approach hernia repair using 3DHMD, 3DPPD, or a conventional HD2D laparoscopic system. All surgeries were performed for the first time by three laparoscopically novice surgeons. Operative performance was compared in terms of the time taken for mesh placement and peritoneal suturing under standardized conditions. Additionally, visual perception parameters and adverse effects were assessed. RESULTS The use of both 3D techniques shortened the time required for mesh placement and peritoneal suturing compared with the conventional HD2D approach. Generally, 3D laparoscopy was superior to HD2D laparoscopy in terms of visual perception parameters such as depth perception, sharpness, ghosting, and contrast. However, compared with the use of HD2D laparoscopy, the use of 3DHMD significantly impaired a surgeon's comfort, with the greatest impairment caused by ear discomfort, headaches, and facial and physical discomforts. CONCLUSIONS The 3DHMD and 3DPPD systems showed clear improvement in first hernia repair laparoscopy by novice surgeons in terms of surgical performance, as well as visual perception; however, the 3DHMD system was not superior to the 3DPPD system. The reduction in training time for new surgeons is obviously advantageous.

This study identified sources of resilience that clinicians used to cope with frontline challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 frontline health professionals, across five Australian hospitals, between October 2020 and April 2021. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, and the results were analysed using thematic analysis based on a phenomenological approach. Results: Three sources of resilience were identified by respondents: personal, relational, and organisational. A positive mindset, sense of purpose, and self-care behaviours emerged as key sources of personal resilience. Teamwork, altruism, and social support from family and friends contributed to relational resilience.

The development of an effective vaccine is one of the most promising strategies for controlling CE. METHODS: The E. granulosus 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EgHCDH) gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The distribution of EgHCDH in protoscoleces (PSCs) and adult worms was analyzed using immunofluorescence. The transcript levels of EgHCDH in PSCs and adult worms were analyzed using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). The immune protective effects of the rEgHCDH were evaluated. RESULTS: The 924-bp open reading frame sequence of EgHCDH, which encodes a protein of approximately 34 kDa, was obtained. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that EgHCDH was expressed in both the PSCs and adult worms of E. granulosus. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that EgHCDH was mainly localized in the tegument of PSCs and adult worms. Western blot analysis showed that the recombinant protein was recognized by E. granulosus-infected dog sera. Animal challenge experiments demonstrated that dogs immunized with recombinant (r)EgHCDH had significantly higher serum IgG, interferon gamma and interleukin-4 concentrations than the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control group. The rEgHCDH vaccine was able to significantly reduce the number of E. granulosus and inhibit the segmental development of E. granulosus compared to the PBS control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that rEgHCDH can induce partial immune protection against infection with E. granulosus and could be an effective candidate for the development of new vaccines.

Methods Six different hand hygiene products were added separately to heparinised blood samples in varying amounts as contaminant.

Results There were significant analytical interferences caused by hand hygiene product contamination that varied depending on the combination of disinfectant and analyser. Small amounts of Microshield Antibacterial Hand Gel contamination caused large increases in measured sodium concentration. Such effect was much greater compared with the other five products tested, and started to occur at much lower levels of contamination. There was a trend towards lower sodium results in blood samples contaminated with Hexol Antiseptic Lotion (Hexol), the hand hygiene product that we used initially. Apart from AiE Hand Sanitizer, all the other hand disinfectants, especially Hexol, significantly elevated the measured potassium concentration, particularly when a direct ion-selective electrode method was used for measurement.

Human bocavirus 1 was the only respiratory virus detected by a qualitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel. For the diagnosis of acute human bocavirus 1 infection, both molecular and serological approaches were used. Human bocavirus 1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was detected simultaneously in nasopharyngeal aspirate, stool, and blood, as well as in the corresponding cell-free blood plasma by qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, revealing high DNA-copy numbers in nasopharyngeal aspirate and stool.

Quercetin was identified as the main ingredient of SQJZJN by the network pharmacological screening and Quercetin at 1.5 and 3 g/(kg.d) concentrations could effectively alleviate the CRF symptoms, reduce the levels of Cr, BUN, and UA, and markedly inhibit cell apoptosis demonstrated by the intragastric administration. Furthermore, the protein expression of p-PI3K, p-AKT, NLRP3, caspase1, AQP1, and AQP2 in all groups was detected by immunofluorescence and western blot assays, indicating that Quercetin could reduce the expression of NLRP3, caspase1, p-PI3k, and p-Akt, and increase the expression of AQP1 and AQP2 in the renal tissues of CRF rats. Being labeled with biotin and incubated with the total protein extracted from kidney tissues, Quercetin could bind to PIK3R1. Following the PIK3R1 interference lentivirus was injected into the CRF model rats by tail vein, the CRF symptoms were effectively alleviated in the PIK3R1 interference group, consistent with the effect of Quercetin. Taken together, Quercetin, a major component of SQJZJN, might minimize renal fibrosis and apoptosis in CRF rats by inhibiting the PI3k/Akt pathway through targeting PIK3R1. By regulating AQP1 and AQP2, both water retention and toxin accumulation were reduced.","output":"Quercetin alleviates chronic renal failure by targeting the PI3k/Akt pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is reeling under the crisis caused by corona virus disease (COVID-19), print, electronic and social media are flooded with numerous advisories issued by governments and other national & international agencies.

Both the virus titer and syncytial phenotype were significantly increased in S-G614 than in S-D614 isolates. We further showed increased cleavage of S at the furin substrate site, a key event that promotes syncytium, in S-G614 isolates. These functions of the D614G substitution were validated in cells expressing S protein. The effect on syncytium was abolished by furin inhibitor treatment and mutation of the furin-cleavage site, suggesting its dependence on cleavage by furin.

However, vaccine hesitancy was listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019 as one of the top ten threats to world health. AIM: To employ machine-learning strategies to assess how on-line content regarding vaccination affects vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: We collected social media posts and responses from vaccination discussion groups and forums on leading social platforms, including Facebook and Tapuz (A user content website that contains blogs and forums). We investigated 65,603 records of children aged 0C6 years who are insured in Maccabis Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). We applied three machine learning algorithms (Logistic regression, Random forest and Neural networks) to predict vaccination among Israeli children, based on demographic and social media traffic. RESULTS: Higher hesitancy was associated with more social media traffic, for most of the vaccinations. The addition of the social media traffic features improved the performances of most of the models. However, for Rota virus, Hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the performances of all algorithms (with and without the social media features) were close to random (accuracy up to 0.63 and F1 up to 0.65). We found a negative association between on-line discussions and vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between social media traffic and vaccine hesitancy. Policy makers are encouraged to perceive social media as a main channel of communication during health crises. Health officials and experts are encouraged to take part in social media discussions, and be equipped to readily provide the information, support and advice that the public is looking for, in order to optimize vaccination actions and to improve public health SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13584-021-00486-6.","output":"Prediction of vaccine hesitancy based on social media traffic among Israeli parents using machine learning strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To examine the effect of a once-a-week group physiotherapy session in addition to a once-a-month individual physiotherapy treatment, in comparison to a monthly individual physiotherapy treatment. METHODS Fifty children and adolescents aged 10-18 years with poor back posture, some of whom had LBP, met individually with a physiotherapist once a month. The intervention group received an additional once-a-week group physiotherapy session for 12 weeks. Thorax curve angle, postural behavior, and low back pain (LBP) were measured before and after intervention. RESULTS The thorax curve angle decreased from 39.2  9.3 to 28.2  6.8 (p < 0.001) in the group + individual therapy group and from 38.9  9.3 to 27.9  7.8 in the individual therapy only group (p < 0.001). LBP decreased from 5.6  2.2 to 1.6  1.9 (p < 0.001) and from 5.5  2.1 to 2.8  2.0 (p < 0.001). A significantly greater improvement in postural behavior was found in the group + individual therapy group (p = 0.04). Moreover, attrition rates were lower in the experimental group. CONCLUSION A lower-frequency individual physiotherapy treatment for 12 weeks proved as beneficial as the same program with an additional higher-frequency group physiotherapy in improving thorax curve angle and LBP.

In the present study, we established a one-step, single tube, real-time accelerated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (real-time LAMP) for quantitative detection of WSSV. MATERIALS AND METHODS A set of six specially designed primers that recognize eight distinct sequences of the target. The whole process can be completed in 1 h under isothermal conditions at 63 degrees C. Detection and quantification can be achieved by real-time monitoring in an inexpensive turbidimeter based on threshold time required for turbidity in the LAMP reaction. A standard curve was constructed by plotting viral titre against the threshold time (T(t)) using plasmid standards with high correlation coefficient (R(2) = 0.988). CONCLUSIONS Sensitivity analysis using 10-fold dilutions (equivalent to 35 ng microl(-1) to 35 ag microl(-1)) of plasmid standards revealed this method is capable of detecting upto 100 copies of template DNA. Cross-reactivity analysis with DNA/cDNA of IHHNV, TSV, YHV-infected and healthy shrimp showed this method is highly specific for quantitative detection of WSSV.

Our aim was to detect possible oedema/diffuse fibrosis using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) mapping and to study myocardial deformation of the left ventricle (LV) using feature tracking (FT). METHODS: Prospective analysis of consecutively recruited post-COVID-19 patients undergoing CMR. T1 and T2 mapping sequences were acquired and FT analysis was performed using 2D steady-state free precession cine sequences. Statistical significance was set to p < 0.05. RESULTS: Included were 57 post-COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls, mean age 59  15 years, men 80.7%. The most frequent risk factors were hypertension (33.3%) and dyslipidaemia (36.8%). The contact-to-CMR interval was 81  27 days. LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was 61  10%. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was evident in 26.3% of patients (19.3%, non-ischaemic). T2 mapping values (suggestive of oedema) were higher in the study patients than in the controls (50.9  4.3 ms vs 48  1.9 ms, p < 0.01). No between-group differences were observed for native T1 nor for circumferential strain (CS) or radial strain (RS) values (18.6  3.3% vs 19.2  2.1% (p = 0.52) and 32.3  8.1% vs 33.6  7.1% (p = 0.9), respectively).

When expressed in rice, CTB was protected from pepsin digestion in vitro. Rice-expressed CTB also remained stable and thus maintained immunogenicity at room temperature for >1.5 years, meaning that antigen-specific mucosal immune responses were induced at much lower doses than were necessary with purified recombinant CTB.

Materials and methods A retrospective study was conducted through the clinical records of patients admitted to the tertiary care hospital between August 2020 and December 2020. All the patients who were administered remdesivir intravenously as per standard protocol were included in the study. Data were analyzed for statistical association between health care modalities and patient characteristics. Results Among 166 patients included, the mean age of patient who received remdesivir was 57.51  12.98 years (95% confidence interval (CI), 30-84). The mean duration of stay and duration of oxygen requirement were 12.80  5.99 (95% CI, 5-30) and 9.41  7.47 (95% CI, 0-39) days, respectively.

Specifically, three salient region detection (SRD) methods and ten BISA models are jointly explored, during which the output saliency maps from SRD methods are re-organized as the input of BISA models. Consequently, the change in BISA metric values can be quantified and then directly related to the difference in BISA model inputs. Finally, experiments are conducted on three Gaussian blurring image databases, and the BISA prediction performance is evaluated. The comparison results indicate that salient region input can help achieve a close and sometimes superior performance to a BISA model over the whole image input. When using the center region input as the baseline, the detected salient regions from the saliency optimization from robust background detection (SORBD) method lead to consistently better score prediction, regardless of the BISA model.

Thus, obese patients tend to have a more severe course of COVID-19. Thus, this review aims to synthesize the evidence in the literature that associates COVID-19 and the severity of clinical outcomes in infected obese patients. Methods: : This protocol was designed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols Statement. Scientific and gray literature will be systematically selected from PubMed/MEDLINE, Latin American Literature in Health Sciences, Online Scientific Electronic Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane. The selection of articles will be limited to studies published in English, Portuguese, and Spanish from December 2019 onwards. The main clinical outcomes will be clinical severity in obese patients with COVID-19 as tachypnea (respiratory rate, 30 breaths per minute), hypoxemia (oxygen saturation, 93%), the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen, <300), lung infiltrate (>50% of the lung field involved within 24C48 h), diagnosis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, need of invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. Selection bias will be minimized by excluding studies published before December 2019. Conflicts will be resolved through a third reviewer and consensus-building. Moreover, findings will be reported using narrative synthesis and tabulation of the summaries.

Utility of specific component IgE testing as an alternative to the oral food challenge (OFC), the diagnostic standard, is being investigated. METHODS Patients (n=42) with suspected SFA completed an open OFC to sesame. Diagnostic testing included serum levels of Ses i 1-specific IgE, skin prick test with high-protein extract, and basophil reactivity (% induced CD63 expression) for each patient. The diagnostic utility of these tests was evaluated at a 95% sensitivity, with the outcome measure being the number of OFCs required. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients (64%) were diagnosed with SFA. Ses i 1-IgE differed significantly between allergic and tolerant patients (p=0.0001). ROC curve analysis for Ses i 1-IgE yielded an AUC of 0.88 0.05. Levels of Ses i1-IgE correlated to induced CD63+ expression on basophils (p =0.0001). Ses i1-IgE was not sufficiently robust as a single step for diagnosis. Used concurrently, BAT and Ses i 1-IgE, yielded correct positive classifications for 25 of 27 sesame allergic patients with two false positives (93% PPV). Both tests were negative in 5 nonallergic patients. Patients with divergent Ses i 1-IgE and BAT results required OFC (n=10, 24% of patients). Alternatively, sequential use of BAT, ruling in SFA followed by Ses i 1-IgE diagnosing nonallergic patients, yielded a 89% PPV, with 19% requiring OFC.

METHODS: We divided 49 TN patients into three groups (TN1CTN3) based on disease duration (TN1 = 1.1  0.7 (0C2) years, TN2 = 4.8  1.5 (3C7) years, TN3 = 15.1  5.5 (10C30) years). We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to compare the gray matter volume (GMV) across groups and between TN patients and 18 matched healthy control subjects. RESULTS: The TN1 group showed reduced GMV of pain-related regions in the cerebellum; the TN2 group showed reduced GMV in the thalamus and the motor/sensory cortex; and the TN3 group showed reduced GMV in the emotional and reward circuits compared with healthy controls. Similar brain regions, including bilateral hippocampi, caudate, left insular cortex, and medial superior frontal cortex, were affected in TN2 and TN3 compared with TN1. CONCLUSION: Disease duration can explain differences in structural alterationsespecially in pain-related brain regionsin TN. These results highlight the advanced structural neuroimaging method that are valuable tools to assess the trigeminal system in TN and may further our current understanding of TN pathology.","output":"Gray matter volume reduction with different disease duration in trigeminal neuralgia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Burnout among doctors and other healthcare workers was already a big problem before covid-19 but has vastly increased, made worse by staff shortages and failures in workforce planning (doi:10.1136/bmj.n1461).6 New NHS guidance requiring wider provision of proper personal protective equipment (doi:10.1136/bmj.n1422)7 should help morale, even while facial dermatoses (maskne) continue to need proper care (doi:10.1136/bmj.n1304).8 Trust is bolstered by good information.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated acute cardiomyopathy is common in critical care patients and is associated with a high mortality rate.

The migration of the meiosis I spindle from the oocyte center to its cortex is mediated by F-actin. Specifically, an F-actin cage surrounds the microtubule spindle and applies forces to it. To better understand how F-actin transmits forces to the spindle, we studied a potential direct link between F-actin and microtubules. For this, we tested the implication of myosin-X, a known F-actin and microtubule binder involved in spindle morphogenesis and/or positioning in somatic cells, amphibian oocytes and embryos. Using a mouse strain conditionally invalidated for myosin-X in oocytes and by live-cell imaging, we show that myosin-X is not localized on the spindle, and is dispensable for spindle and F-actin assembly. It is not required for force transmission as spindle migration and chromosome alignment occur normally. More broadly, myosin-X is dispensable for oocyte developmental potential and female fertility. We therefore exclude a role for myosin-X in transmitting F-actin-mediated forces to the spindle, opening new perspectives regarding this mechanism in mouse oocytes, which differ from most mitotic cells.","output":"Myosin-X is dispensable for spindle morphogenesis and positioning in the mouse oocyte."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM Adequate mediastinal lymphadenectomy during thoracoscopic esophagectomy (TE) requires an extensive operating field.

In June 2020, one-hundred UK adolescents (aged 16C18) recruited through social media were randomly allocated (1:1) to immediate 5-day peer support training or a wait-list, via an independently generated allocation sequence. Primary outcomes were indicators of ability to help others (motivation, perceived skills, frequency of help provided, compassion to others and connectedness to peers). Secondary outcomes included emotional symptoms, mental wellbeing, and indicators of agency (civic engagement and self-efficacy). We also collected qualitative reports of participants experience. Assessments were completed at baseline and 1 week post randomisation (primary endpoint), and up to 4 weeks post randomisation (training group only). The training increased support-giving skills, frequency of providing support, compassion and peer connectedness (mediumClarge-effect sizes), but not motivation to provide support, 1 week post randomisation, compared to controls. Gains in the training group were maintained 4 weeks post randomisation. Training also improved adolescents mental health and agency, and qualitative reports revealed further positive outcomes including increased self-care and empowerment.

The objective of this study was to identify the potential economic implications of autonomous crop equipment for arable agriculture using a grain-oilseed farm in the United Kingdom as an example. The study is possible because the Hands Free Hectare (HFH) demonstration project at Harper Adams University has produced grain with autonomous equipment since 2017. That practical experience showed the technical feasibility of autonomous grain production and provides parameters for farm-level linear programming (LP) to estimate farm management opportunities when autonomous equipment is available. The study shows that arable crop production with autonomous equipment is technically and economically feasible, allowing medium size farms to approach minimum per unit production cost levels. The ability to achieve minimum production costs at relatively modest farm size means that the pressure to get big or get out will diminish. Costs of production that are internationally competitive will mean reduced need for government subsidies and greater independence for farmers. The ability of autonomous equipment to achieve minimum production costs even on small, irregularly shaped fields will improve environmental performance of crop agriculture by reducing pressure to remove hedges, fell infield trees and enlarge fields.

The extent to which these findings are generalizable to other settings is unknown. Coronavirus disease-2019 data from large, urban settings may be particularly difficult to apply in military medicine, where practice environments are often semi-urban, rural, or austere. The purpose of this study is compare presenting characteristics and outcomes of U.S. patients with COVID-19 in a nonurban setting to similar patients in an urban setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Hershey Medical Center (HMC), a 548-bed tertiary academic medical center in central Pennsylvania serving semi-urban and rural populations, from March 23, 2020, to April 20, 2020 (the first month of COVID-19 admissions at HMC). Patients and outcomes of this cohort were compared to published data on a cohort of similar patients from the New York City (NYC) area. RESULTS: The cohorts had similar age, gender, comorbidities, need for intensive care or mechanical ventilation, and most vital sign and laboratory studies. The NYC's cohort had shorter hospital stays (4.1 versus 7.2 days, P < .001) but more African American patients (23% versus 12%, P = .02) and higher prevalence of abnormal alanine (>60U/L; 39.0% versus 5.9%, P < .001) and aspartate (>40U/L; 58.4% versus 42.4%, P = .012) aminotransferase, oxygen saturation <90% (20.4% versus 7.2%, P = .004), and mortality (21% versus 1.4%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalists in nonurban environments would be prudent to use caution when considering the generalizability of results from dissimilar regions. Further investigation is needed to explore the possibility of reproducible causative systemic elements that may help improve COVID-19-related outcomes.

Third, our analysis shows that within urban regions there are also 'pockets' of high projected death rates. Overall, the areas with high and low fatality rates tend to cluster because of the high residential separation of different population age-groups in the UK.

By the use of different valves incorporated to the circuit, the device enables the restriction of possible cross contamination and the individualization of tidal volumes, driving pressures, and positive end expiratory pressure PEEP. Possible interactions in the expiratory dynamics of different pairs of patients are evaluated in terms of the characteristic exhalatory times. These characteristic times can not be easily established using simple linear lumped element models. For this purpose, a 1D model using the Hydraulic and Mechanical libraries in Matlab Simulink was developed. In this sense, experiments accompany this study to validate the model and characterize the different valves of the circuit. Our results show that connecting two patients in parallel to a ventilator always resulted in delays of time during the exhalation. The size of this effect depends on different parameters associated with the patients, the circuit and the ventilator. The dynamics of the exhalation of both patients is determined by the ratios between patients exhalatory resistances, compliances, driving pressures and PEEPs. Adverse effects on exhalations became less noticeable when respiratory parameters of both patients were similar, flow resistances of valves added to the circuit were negligible, and when the ventilator exhalatory valve resistance was also negligible. The asymmetries of driving pressures, compliances or resistances exacerbated the possibility of auto-PEEP and the increase in relaxation times became greater in one patient than in the other.

We present a case series of COVID-19-associated IPA at a teaching hospital in Mexico City. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ABC Medical Center from March 13 to June 1, 2020. Only those with severe or critical COVID-19 were hospitalized. Patients with a diagnosis of putative IPA were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed by Real-Time PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Aspergillus antigen testing in tracheal aspirate and serum was done with Aspergillus-specific galactomannoprotein (GP) ELISA (Euroimmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika).The study was approved by the hospital ethics committee. RESULTS: Among the 47 admitted patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), we identified seven (14.9%) cases of IPA. The mean age was 59.7  17.8 years and five were male. All our patients had comorbidities, but none were under previous immunosuppressive treatment. All had critical COVID-19 pneumonia requiring IMV. All but one patient received corticosteroids, and five patients were treated with tocilizumab before IPA diagnosis. Putative IPA was diagnosed in six cases (86%) by a positive GP in tracheal aspirate, additionally in one of these, the tracheal aspirate culture also grew Aspergillus niger. The remaining one (14%) had a positive serum GP. The median time from COVID-19 to IPA diagnosis was 10 days.

The Standards for Maternity Care Report includes reference to interpreting services mandating they should be available for women where English is not their first language.1 All NHS Trusts have provisions for some degree of language interpretation but anecdotally we suspect COVID-19 has had a significant service impact. Methods: With Caldicott Guardian approval, BadgerNet records for deliveries during 2020 were reviewed. We surveyed the anaesthetists based in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital Maternity Unit during October 2020 to explore their experiences with interpretation services before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Of the 5129 deliveries in our unit during 2020, 6.9% required an interpreter. 18 obstetric anaesthetists responded to our survey: 8 consultants, 6 ST3+ and 4 core trainees. Prior to the pandemic the vast majority of anaesthetist interactions with interpreters were face-to-face (94%). In 84% of cases, the interpreter accompanied the patient into theatre to translate. Only with post-operative reviews did telephone interpretation exceed that in person (65% to 53% respectively). There was general satisfaction from the services, with 20% describing a perceived poor translation and 15% of anaesthetists describing communication difficulty. Following the pandemic, only two anaesthetists had utilised a face-to-face translator pre-theatre, with only one interpreter coming to theatre. All obstetric anaesthetists surveyed had utilised a telephone interpreter since the pandemic, with 35% continuing telephone interpretation in theatre. 65% felt that telephone translations were poor and 70% struggled to communicate. Discussion: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant reduction in face-to-face interpretation and an overall poor perception of the quality of telephone interpretation. The requirement for PPE is an added barrier to communication, arguably making access to interpreting services more important now than ever. Alarmingly the majority of patients did not have a formal translator available in theatre. Following these findings, tablet computers were commissioned to simplify contacting our interpretation service and we developed a pathway to standardise the process. We aim to re-survey to assess any impact. Whilst Glasgow has the largest ethnic minority population of all Scottish cities, the impact of global migration will undoubtedly have a far-reaching effect and we believe local departments should develop rigid protocols for ensuring effective interpretation is secured regardless of barriers.","output":"P.117 Anaesthetist experiences of interpretation services on labour ward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is a hereditary disorder that has no cure and can result in end stage kidney failure. Searching for health information online and via social media is a common phenomenon in many medical conditions. However, no recent studies have documented the information needs, online behaviours, and concerns of people with PKD. The aim of this study was to explore the information needs of individuals with PKD and their carers by documenting (i) the information needs (ii) online information health seeking behaviours (iii) the perceived challenges of living with PKD and (iv) dietary concerns. METHODS A 17-item survey was constructed by undertaking a social listening analysis. This survey was then distributed via PKD related social media groups on Facebook. Seven groups distributed the survey with permission from the group owners. Open free text survey questions were analysed thematically using content analysis. RESULTS A total of 536 respondents completed the online survey (70.9 % female, 77 % aged 35-70, 70.2 % diagnosed more than 10 years ago). The major information need expressed by participants with PKD was for dietary information. Information regarding medications, medical management and symptom control were also desired. The overarching themes arising from the free text responses to the major challenge of living with PKD included 'learning to navigate dietary ambiguities'; 'managing social, psychological and emotional needs'; and 'accepting an uncertain future'. In addition to a strong desire for practical and specific dietary information, participants expressed a need for more online information pertaining to management of fatigue, pain, complications and how to manage mental health. Online peer support was also highly regarded and desired. CONCLUSIONS This study provides contemporary insights into the type of information desired by people with PKD. The results indicated that there was a strong desire for unambiguous information and guidance from health professionals to facilitate self-management, alleviate concerns, and address the complexities of living with Polycystic Kidney Disease.

Here we report the persistence of nAb responses over 12 months after infection despite its decreasing trend noticed from 6 months. The study included sera from 358 individuals who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 between January and May 2020. Samples were collected at 6 and 12 months after onset. The titers of IgG to the viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (RBD) were measured by CLEIA. The nAb titer was determined using lentivirus-based pseudovirus or authentic virus. Antibody titers of NP-IgG, RBD-IgG, and nAbs were higher in severe and moderate cases than in mild cases at 12 months after onset. While the nAb levels were likely to confer adequate protection against wild-type viral infection, the neutralization activity to recently circulating variants in some of the mild cases ([~]30%) was undermined, implying the susceptibility of reinfection to the variants of concerns (VOCs). COVID-19 convalescent individuals have robust humoral immunity even at 12 months after infection albeit that the medical history and background of patients could affect the function and dynamics of antibody response to the VOCs.","output":"Persistence of robust humoral immune response in COVID-19 convalescent individuals over 12 months after infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: As part of infection control measures for COVID-19, individuals have been encouraged to adopt both preventive (e.g., handwashing) and avoidant behavioural changes (e.g., avoiding crowds). In this study, we examined whether demographics predicted the likelihood that a person would adopt these behaviours in Singapore. Materials and Methods: 1145 participants responded to an online survey conducted between 7 March - 21 April 2020. As part of the survey, we collected demographic information and asked participants to report which of 17 behaviour changes they had undertaken because of the outbreak. We ran regression models to predict, using demographic information: (1) the total number of behavioural changes undertaken, (2) the number of preventive changes undertaken, and (3) the number of avoidant changes undertaken. Finally, we sought to identify predictors of persons who: (4) declared that they had not undertaken any of these measures following the outbreak. Results: Females and those who were younger adopted more preventive behaviours: whereas females were more likely to increase handwashing frequency, younger individuals were more likely to wear face masks prior to legislation. Females and those who were married adopted more avoidant behaviours, with both groups avoiding crowded areas and staying home more than usual. Females also voluntarily reduced physical contact, whereas those who were married chose outdoor venues and relied on online shopping. Conclusion: Our characterisation of behavioural changes provides a baseline for public health advisories. Moving forward, local health authorities can focus their efforts to encourage segments of the population who do not readily adopt infection control measures against COVID-19.","output":"BEHAVIORAL CHANGES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: RESULTS OF A NATIONAL SURVEY IN SINGAPORE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: to describe the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on undetected cases and to evaluate different post-lockdown scenarios. DESIGN: the study introduces a SEIR compartmental model, taking into account the region-specific fraction of undetected cases, the effects of mobility restrictions, and the personal protective measures adopted, such as wearing a mask and washing hands frequently. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the model is experimentally validated with data of all the Italian regions, some European countries, and the US. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the accuracy of the model results is measured through the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Lewis criteria; fitting parameters are in good agreement with previous literature. RESULTS: the epidemic curves for different countries and the amount of undetected and asymptomatic cases are estimated, which are likely to represent the main source of infections in the near future. The model is applied to the Hubei case study, which is the first place to relax mobility restrictions. Results show different possible scenarios. Mobility and the adoption of personal protective measures greatly influence the dynamics of the infection, determining either a huge and rapid secondary epidemic peak or a more delayed and manageable one.

It is known more for its morbidity than for its mortality as the deranged kidney functioning affects almost every organ system of the body. Dyslipidemia is one of the most common complications of chronic renal failure (CRF) reflected even in the early stages of CRF and usually parallels the deterioration in renal function. As a consequence, dyslipidemia as a risk factor in CKD progression should be explored and documented more. The aim of the study was to compare the pattern of lipid profile in CKD patients on conservative management with that of CKD patients on hemodialysis. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional observational study conducted in Lucknow, India, between January 2021 to May 2021 after considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. The lipid profile of 105 eligible patients was analyzed using an autoanalyzer. After generation of the proper template, data was entered in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Washington, United States) and analysis was done through SPSS for Windows, Version 16.0 (Released 2007, SPSS Inc., Chicago, United States). Results: There was a statistically significant decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and an increase in triglycerides (TG) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels in CKD patients on hemodialysis when compared with CKD patients on conservative management. As far as total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels are concerned, they were also significantly increased in CKD patients on hemodialysis than CKD patients on conservative management. Conclusions: Dyslipidemia progresses with the stage of CKD, so early monitoring of lipid profile in CKD patients may help in decreasing the progression of the disease and, hence, mortality in CKD patients.","output":"The Study of Pattern of Lipid Profile in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients on Conservative Management and Hemodialysis: A Comparative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 79-year-old male was hospitalized for respiratory failure secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia.

In addition to analysing the textural properties of the simulated materials, we also explore their fractal properties through correlation dimension and Hurst exponent calculations. The correlation dimension shows that while fractal properties are not typically observed in scattering experiments, they are possible to achieve with sufficiently low solids content and catalyst concentration. Furthermore, fractal properties are also apparent from the analysis of the diffusion path of guest species through the gel's porous network.

METHODS: Women with a second-trimester fetus with OSB were offered intrauterine neurosurgical repair following the protocol from the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) trial. Pediatric follow-up with infants reaching 12 and 30 months of life was also reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty-eight fetuses with OSB underwent intrauterine repair at an average (SD) gestational age of 24.8  0.9 weeks. There were 3 (5.1%) intrauterine deaths. The average gestational age at delivery of the remaining 55 cases was 33.3  3.6 weeks, and the average birth weight was 2,172  751 g. Delivery before 30 weeks occurred in 11 cases (20.0%). Two (3.6%) neonatal deaths (<28 days) occurred. At 12 months, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt or an endoscopic third ventriculostomy was required in 25% of the cases. At 30 months, 72.4% of the infants were able to walk. DISCUSSION: Prenatal neurosurgical repair of OSB is a complex and challenging intervention.

There have been substantial differences in the kinds of policies implemented by political decision-makers to prevent the spread of the virus, to test the population, and to manage infected patients. Among other factors, these policies vary with politicians sex: early findings indicate that, on average, female leaders seem more focused on minimizing direct human suffering caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while male leaders implement riskier short-term decisions, possibly aiming to minimize economic disruptions. These sex differences are consistent with broader findings in psychology, reflecting womens stronger empathy, higher pathogen disgust, health concern, care-taking orientation, and dislike for the suffering of other peopleas well as mens higher risk-taking, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, and focus on financial indicators of success and status. This review article contextualizes sex differences in pandemic leadership in an evolutionary framework. Evolution by natural selection is the only known process in nature that organizes populations of organisms into higher degrees of functional order, or counteracts the unavoidable disorder that would otherwise ensue, and is therefore essential for explaining the origins of human sex differences. Differential sexual selection and parental investment between males and females, together with the sexual differentiation of the mammalian brain, drive sex differences in cognition and behavioral dispositions, underlying mens and womens leadership styles and decision-making during a global pandemic. We propose the sexually dimorphic leadership specialization hypothesis to explain how general psychobehavioral sex differences have been exapted during human evolution to create sexually dimorphic leadership styles. They may be facultatively co-opted by societies when facing different kinds of ecological and/or sociopolitical threats, such as disease outbreaks or intergroup aggression. Early evidence indicates that against the invisible viral foe that can bring nations to their knees, the strategic circumspection of empathic feminine health worriers may bring more effective and humanitarian outcomes than the devil-may-care incaution of masculine risk-taking warriors.","output":"Pandemic leadership: Sex differences and their evolutionaryCdevelopmental origins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The knot is one of the most remarkable topological features identified in an increasing number of proteins with important functions. However, little is known about how the knot is formed during protein folding, and untied or maintained in protein unfolding. By means of all-atom molecular dynamics simulation, here we employ methyltransferase YbeA as the knotted protein model to analyze changes of the knotted conformation coupled with protein unfolding under thermal and mechanical denaturing conditions. Our results show that the trefoil knot in YbeA is occasionally untied via knot loosening rather than sliding under enhanced thermal fluctuations. Through correlating protein unfolding with changes in the knot position and size, several aspects of barriers that jointly suppress knot untying are revealed. In particular, protein unfolding is always prior to knot untying and starts preferentially from separation of two -helices (1 and 5), which protect the hydrophobic core consisting of -sheets (1C4) from exposure to water. These -sheets form a loop through which 5 is threaded to form the knot. Hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions inside the core stabilize the loop against loosening. In addition, residues at N-terminal of 5 define a rigid turning to impede 5 from sliding out of the loop. Site mutations are designed to specifically eliminate these barriers, and easier knot untying is achieved under the same denaturing conditions.

GA was found to inhibit recombinant Leishmania donovani HMG-CoA reductase (LdHMGR) enzyme at the half-maximum inhibitory concentration of 24  4.3 M indicating the sensitivity and specificity of GA towards the enzyme. However, GA could cause only 30% reduction in HMGR activity when measured in Leishmania promastigotes treated with 34 M of GA.

Results indicated that 2 fold resistance was exhibited by LdHMGR overexpressing promastigotes to GA with an IC(50) value of 74 M compared to the wild type parasite. This explained the specific binding of GA to LdHMGR enzyme. There was 2 fold depletion in ergosterol levels in wild type promastigotes compared to the HMGR overexpressors. This data was further validated by exogenous supplementation of GA treated cells with ergosterol and 40% reversal of growth inhibition was observed.

Although the current state of the art involves the use of neural network language models as a post-processing step, the very large number of ontology classes to be recognized and the limited amount of gold-standard training data has impeded the creation of end-to-end systems based entirely on machine learning. Recently, Hailu et al. recast the concept recognition problem as a type of machine translation and demonstrated that sequence-to-sequence machine learning models had the potential to outperform multi-class classification approaches. Here we systematically characterize the factors that contribute to the accuracy and efficiency of several approaches to sequence-to-sequence machine learning. Results We report on our extensive studies of alternative methods and hyperparameter selections. The results not only identify the best-performing systems and parameters across a wide variety of ontologies but also illuminate about the widely varying resource requirements and hyperparameter robustness of alternative approaches. Analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of such systems suggest promising avenues for future improvements as well as design choices that can increase computational efficiency with small costs in performance. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT) for span detection (as previously found) along with the Open-source Toolkit for Neural Machine Translation (OpenNMT) for concept normalization achieve state-of-the-art performance for most ontologies in CRAFT Corpus.

The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are two countries that have witnessed mass gatherings due to the arrival of Syrian refugees and the annual Hajj season. The mass migration of people not only brings exotic diseases to these regions but also brings new diseases back to their own countries, e.g., the outbreak of MERS in South Korea. Many emerging pathogens originate in bats, and more than 30 bat species have been identified in these two countries. Some of those bat species are known to carry viruses that cause deadly diseases in other parts of the world, such as the rabies virus and coronaviruses. However, little is known about bats and the pathogens they carry in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Here, the importance of enhanced surveillance of bat-borne infections in Jordan and Saudi Arabia is emphasized, promoting the awareness of bat-borne diseases among the general public and building up infrastructure and capability to fill the gaps in public health preparedness to prevent future pandemics.","output":"Bat-Borne Coronaviruses in Jordan and Saudi Arabia: A Threat to Public Health?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"-Cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives containing an aromatic triazole ring were studied as potential carriers of the following drugs containing an anthraquinone moiety: anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid (AQ2S); anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid (AQ2CA); and a common anthracycline, daunorubicin (DNR). UV-Vis and voltammetry measurements were carried out to determine the solubilities and association constants of the complexes formed, and the results revealed the unique properties of the chosen CDs as effective pH-dependent drug complexing agents. The association constants of the drug complexes with the CDs containing a triazole and lipoic acid (CDLip) or galactosamine (CDGAL), were significantly larger than that of the native CD. The AQ2CA and AQ2S drugs were poorly soluble, and their solubilities increased as a result of complex formation with CDLip and CDGAL ligands. AQ2CA and AQ2S are negatively charged at pH 7.4. Therefore, they were less prone to form an inclusion complex with the hydrophobic CD cavity than at pH 3 (characteristic of gastric juices) when protonated. The CDTriazole and CDGAL ligands were found to form weaker inclusion complexes with the positively charged drug DNR at an acidic pH (pH 5.5) than in a neutral medium (pH 7.4) in which the drug dissociates to its neutral, uncharged form. This pH dependence is favorable for antitumor applications.","output":"Adjusting the Structure of -Cyclodextrin to Improve Complexation of Anthraquinone-Derived Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deliberate dissemination of a biological agent via several different routes presents the latest challenge to global public health security. Novel pathogens and transmission methods can easily be exploited to cause disease outbreaks. Advancements in molecular biology that make it possible to genetically modify, edit, or disrupt the genome of pathogens increase the disease risk of an accidental or intentional release of pathogens with pandemic potential. The occurrence of a disease at more than an endemic level may stimulate an investigation to determine the source of the disease, who has the disease, when it occurred, and how it spreads. When intentional release of pathogens is suspected, investigators have the additional task of attributing the outbreak not only to a pathogen but also to a human source. The deliberate nature of such dissemination may be obvious. However, some forms of bioterrorism may be more covert, requiring molecular methods to uncover. The field of microbial forensics emerged following the anthrax attack in the United States in 2001 to extend epidemiologic principles to aid in the investigation of bioterrorism incidents. Microbial forensics combines epidemiology with genomic and microbiologic methods, to identify, characterize, and ascribe the cause of an incident resulting from the intentional or unintentional release of a harmful pathogen. Unlike routine epidemiologic investigations, microbial forensic investigations are undertaken when there is a potential crime due to the release of a pathogen with disease-causing potential. The investigation is conducted to attribute cause to a source based on indisputable evidence and is used to support criminal charges against the perpetrator(s). However, because bioterrorism may be unannounced, the initial investigation will start the same as to any public health incident of concern.

To assess the impact of financial factors on oil prices, this article investigates the liquidity of Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) and that of a group of four developed economies (G4) consisting of the Eurozone, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. An application of the single-state vector autoregressive (VAR) model to monthly data from the 1999C2020 sample period reveals that a positive shock to the liquidity of the BRIC countries leads to significant increases in real oil prices. These novel findings stem from a consideration of Markov-switching vector autoregressive (MSVAR) models, which shows that an unanticipated increase in the G4 liquidity is positively linked with real oil prices. The main findings are as follows. (1) We identify three regimes that are associated with the volatility of real oil prices and the liquidity measure, including a crisis regime that characterizes the subprime crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) Impulse response function analyses show that the impact of G4 liquidity under the crisis regime is almost twice as large as that during normal periods, while the impact of BRIC liquidity during such a crisis period is almost three times larger. (3) A shock to BRIC liquidity has a greater impact on real oil prices than a shock to the liquidity of the G4 economies. This analysis helps in assessing the importance of BRIC and G4 liquidity in relation to upsurges in the real oil prices.","output":"Quantifying nonlinear effects of BRIC and G4 liquidity on oil prices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The design of effective target-specific drugs for COVID-19 treatment has become an intriguing challenge for modern science. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease, M(pro), responsible for the processing of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins and production of individual components of viral replication machinery, is an attractive candidate target for drug discovery. Specific M(pro) inhibitors have turned out to be promising anticoronaviral agents. Thus, an effective platform for quantitative screening of M(pro)-targeting molecules is urgently needed. Here, we propose a preCsteady-state kinetic analysis of the interaction of M(pro) with inhibitors as a basis for such a platform. We examined the kinetic mechanism of peptide substrate binding and cleavage by wild-type M(pro) and by its catalytically inactive mutant C145A. The enzyme induces conformational changes of the peptide during the reaction. The inhibition of M(pro) by boceprevir, telaprevir, GC-376, PF-00835231, or thimerosal was investigated. Detailed preCsteady-state kinetics of the interaction of the wild-type enzyme with the most potent inhibitor, PF-00835231, revealed a two-step binding mechanism, followed by covalent complex formation. The C145A M(pro) mutant interacts with PF-00835231 approximately 100-fold less effectively. Nevertheless, the binding constant of PF-00835231 toward C145A M(pro) is still good enough to inhibit the enzyme. Therefore, our results suggest that even noncovalent inhibitor binding due to a fine conformational fit into the active site is sufficient for efficient inhibition. A structure-based virtual screening and a subsequent detailed assessment of inhibition efficacy allowed us to select two compounds as promising noncovalent inhibitor leads of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro).","output":"Pre-Steady-State Kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease as a Powerful Tool for Antiviral Drug Discovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Application-based data regarding sexual health and sexual behavior in various sexually active populations are scarce but at the same time relevant with regards to prevention and healthcare supply strategies. Given the structure of its attendees, the Walk In Ruhr (WIR) Center for Sexual Health and Medicine is able to obtain data from diverse living environments. OBJECTIVES: Based on the online HIV/STI risk test, questionnaires, and attendee data from the WIR, this study aims to deduce population-related findings with regards to age, gender, sexual orientation, and sexual and risk behavior as well as the respective needs for prevention. The influence of the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic on sexual behavior is examined by comparing various phases. METHODS: The analyzed data sources are the online HIV/STI risk test, the COWIR, and the PrEP study as well as the immunological outpatient clinic and the public health department at the WIR. RESULTS: Notwithstanding contact restrictions, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have increased from 2019 to 2020. Apart from men having sex with men and females having sex with females, young people also have an increased risk of STIs based on sexual practices and the number of sexual contacts. A large number of bisexual and transsexual contacts was found. SARS-CoV?2 led to a decrease in sexual contacts; sexual practices continued. There was a growing proportion of STI tests and the treatment rate including partner treatment rose. DISCUSSION: Data from the WIR center show that young attendees with an active sexual life are being reached. The results from questionnaires and the online HIV/STI risk test are mirrored in increased positive STI test results. These results vary depending on sexual behavior and sexual preferences such that specific strategies for sexual education, prevention, testing, and therapy are required.","output":"Sexualverhalten und Pr?vention sexuell bertragbarer Infektionen unter Bercksichtigung der SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie.

METHODS: From January 21 to February 18, 2020, all of the patients who were suspected of novel coronavirus infection and verified by RT-PCR tests were retrospectively enrolled in our study. All of the patients underwent serial RT-PCR tests and serial CT imaging. The temporal relationship between the serial RT-PCR results (negative conversion to positive, positive to negative) and serial CT imaging was investigated, and serial CT changes were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 155 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Chest CT detection time of COVID-19 pneumonia was 2.61 days earlier than RT-PCR test (p = 0.000). The lung CT improvement time was significantly shorter than that of RT-PCR conversion to negative (p = 0.000). Three stages were identified from the onset of the initial symptoms: stage 1 (0-3 days), stage 2 (4-7 days), and stage 3 (8-14 days and later). Ground glass opacity (GGO) was predominant in stage 1, then consolidation and crazy paving signs were dramatically increased in stage 2. In stage 3, fibrotic lesions were rapidly increased. There were significant differences in the main CT features (p = 0.000), number of lobes involved (p = 0.001), and lesion distribution (p = 0.000) among the different stages. CONCLUSION: Chest CT detected COVID-19 pneumonia earlier than the RT-PCR results and can be used to monitor disease course. Combining imaging features with epidemiology history and clinical information could facilitate the early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. KEY POINTS: a? The chest CT detection time of COVID-19 pneumonia was 2.61 days earlier than that of an initial RT-PCR positive result (t = - 7.31, p = 0.000). a? The lung CT improvement time was significantly shorter than that of RT-PCR conversion to negative (t = - 4.72, p = 0.000). a? At the early stage (0-3 days), the CT features of COVID-19 were predominantly GGO and small-vessel thickening; at stage 2 (4-7 days), GGO evolved to consolidation and crazy paving signs.

A \\"V\\" trend curve for lymphopenia, monocyte numbers, and HLA-DR expression was observed with a nadir between days 11 and 14 after symptoms' onset. Intermediate CD14++CD16+ monocytes increased early with a reduction in classic CD14++CD16- monocytes. Polyfunctional SARS-Cov-2-specific CD4 T-cells were present and functional, whereas virus-specific CD8 T-cells were less frequent and not efficient. We report a temporal variation of both innate and adaptive immunity in severe COVID-19 patients, helpful in guiding therapeutic decisions (e.g. anti-inflammatory vs. immunostimulatory ones). We describe a defect in virus-specific CD8 T-cells, a potential biomarker of clinical severity. These combined data also provide helpful knowledge for vaccine design.

The current study is a double-blinded randomized clinical trial to investigate the myopia-suppressive effect of VL glasses compared to conventional eyeglasses (placebo glasses) that do not transmit VL. The subjects were children aged from 6 to 12 years old, the population in which myopia progression is generally accelerated, and the myopia suppressive effect was followed up for two years in a city in Japan. Periodical ophthalmic examinations, interviews, and measurements of reflection and axial length under mydriasis were performed at the initial visit (the baseline) and at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The mean change in axial length in the VL glasses group was significantly smaller than in the placebo glasses group when time for near-work was less than 180 min and when the subjects were limited to those who had never used eyeglasses before this trial (p < 0.01); however, this change was not significant without subgrouping.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Inpatient records with ICD-10-CM codes of G08, I629, I636, or I676 were retrieved from the claims data of all hospital branches of Chang Gung Medical Foundation. Manual review of the medical records and images was performed in order to ascertain the diagnosis. The PPV of various case definitions for CVST was estimated. RESULTS: Of the 380 hospitalizations, 166 and 214 were determined to be true-positive and false-positive episodes of acute CVST, respectively. The PPV of the ICD-10-CM codes of G08, I629, I636, and I676 was 88.2%, 2.0%, 100.0%, and 91.3%, respectively. The PPV generally increased when acute CVST was defined as a primary diagnosis or as ICD-10-CM codes plus anticoagulant use. Miscoding in other conditions, tentative diagnosis, and remote episode of CVST were determined as the main reasons for false-positive diagnosis of acute CVST.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective tolerability study in 18 critically ill patients with a high protein formula (high protein-to-energy (HP:E) formula = Fresubin? Intensive; HPG) compared to a contemporary matched conventional therapy group (CTG). The primary outcome was GI intolerance defined as 300 ml daily gastric residual volume (GRV), vomiting, or diarrhea on days 1 and 2. Secondary outcomes were the percentage of patients reaching their protein target on day 4 and overall protein intake. RESULTS: Groups were comparable regarding demographic characteristics, disease severity, organ failures, mechanical ventilation, and NUTRIC score at baseline. Eighteen patients completed the 4-day feeding period. The number of events of GRV of 300 ml/day was equal in both groups (33.3%). The incidence of diarrhea and vomiting was low in the HPG (two patients concerned). EN did not need to be discontinued due to intolerance in any group. Seventy-two percent of patients reached protein targets 1.3 g/kgBW/d within 4 days after initiation of enteral feeding, which was superior to the CTG (33%). Post-hoc testing showed group differences of protein intake between HPG and CTG were significant at t = 72 h and t = 96 h. Energy targets were met in both groups. CONCLUSION: The HP:E formula containing 33% whey protein hydrolysate is well tolerated in this tolerability study. Due to the HP:E ratio protein targets can be reached faster.

Among the drivers are the more urgent sustainability expectations, the emphasis on environmental and social responsibility, and the changing consumer needs, of which the desire for healthy and quality products, curiosity, uniqueness, and experience are the most prominent drivers. Todays customers are becoming more aware and open to culinary discoveries and exotic delights. In this study, we investigated the importance of product attributes related to local products, and the motivational factors that determine purchase intentions. The significance of our work lies in the fact that we have studied young consumers intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors. A quantitative consumer survey was conducted using a hybrid data collection method on a sample of 1756 respondents aged between 18 and 45 years. The questionnaire focused on product features, intrinsic and extrinsic motivational elements, and demographic characteristics. The results of our study provide strong evidence that the features associated with local products include but are not limited to the following: freshness, high quality, nutritional value, reliability, safety, evoking domestic flavours, naturalness, being healthy, environmentally friendly, etc. The motivational elements were grouped into four factors: hedonism, curiosity, nutritional value, and tradition. The main reasons for young respondents purchasing local food were taste and curiosity. Based on the results of the cluster analysis, we formed three groups having different features and different motivations for purchasing local products. Moreover, we had the opportunity to understand the attitudes and perceptions of young people towards buying local products.

METHODS: We conducted a search of published articles from PubMed, google scholar databases using key words such as COVID-19, healthcare worker, infection control, and dental practice. Relevant articles were identified and reviewed. Most published papers were clinical reports and case studies. We have selected some of the current published papers written in English in 2020. RESULTS: Infection control procedures to protect health workers at hospitals, and dental professionals at dental office were summurised and presented. Infection control procedures for healthcare workers at hospitals include Personal protective equipment, Korea filter (KF)94 respirator, goggles, face protector, disposable waterproof long-arm gown, and gloves, and others. Extra-protection procedures should be taken with old and vulnerable healthcare workers. Dental professionals should evaluate patients in advance before starting dental treatment. Aerosols generating procedures should be avoided and personal protective equipment should be used. Dental treatment should be restricted to emergency cases only. CONCLUSION: Old medical staff should be in safer distance to avoid infection, but young physicians and nurses should work at frontline as their immunity is better than their colleagues at old age.

Many clinical trials are now being conducted to test possible therapies. To assist this, virtual screening via molecular docking was performed on several FDA-approved drugs, previously used in epidemics, and the top ten compounds were selected. These ten well-characterized drugs, previously used to treat malaria and Ebola infections, were screened based on their interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 receptor and 3C-like protease. Compared to the other nine medicines, brincidofovir, an ether lipid ester analog of cidofovir with potent antiviral activity, showed the highest docking scores and binding interactions.

Although barriers and obstacles existed, use of telepractice to deliver such services demonstrated both feasibility and, in some studies, effective outcomes. However, prior to spring of 2020, use of telepractice to deliver speech pathology services was not mainstream. This changed when the nation was forced to shut down many of its in-person healthcare and educational delivery due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The analysis highlights the deep commercial links between the two areas, characterized by the juxtaposition between the EUs large surplus in goods trade and the UKs dominance in the exchange of services. The outcome of the 2016 referendum had a modest impact on trade between the two blocs, although on both sides of the Channel a process of adaptation to the new setting is ongoing since several years also through the research for new trading partners. The TCA represents a good result compared to the dreaded alternative of a no deal, but a reduction in business at the EU-UK border seems still inevitable. On the one hand, goods producers and traders now have to comply with product-specific rules of origin to be exempted from duties: additional costs and efforts will be therefore needed to deal with customs red tape and to re-arrange production systems and supply chains. On the other hand, the vagueness of the TCA provisions on trade in services leaves crucial issues unsettled, as in the case of equivalence determinations.

Methods: This single centre observational cohort study enrolled 142 HD patients and 35 HCW receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies to the spike protein (anti-spike), receptor binding domain (anti-RBD), and nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP) were measured in 66 HD patients receiving one vaccine dose, 76 HD patients receiving two vaccine doses, and 35 HCW receiving two vaccine doses. Results: In HD patients receiving a single BNT162b2 dose, seroconversion occurred in 53/66 (80%) for anti-spike and 35/66 (55%) for anti-RBD by 28 days post dose, but only 15/66 (23%) and 4/66 (6%), respectively attained a robust response defined as reaching the median level of anti-spike and anti-RBD in convalescent serum.

The high frequency S477N mutation is present in 6.7% of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences, co-occurs with D614G, and is currently present in 14 countries. To address RBD-antibody interactions, we take a subset of human-derived antibodies and define their interacting residues using PDBsum. Our analysis shows that RBD mutations were found in approximately 9% of our dataset, with some mutations improving RBD-ACE2 interactions. We also show that antibody-mediated immunity against SARS-CoV-2 enlists broad coverage of the RBD, with multiple antibodies targeting a variety of RBD regions.

We investigated a combination approach, using evidence-based strategies, to increase HIV testing in male partners of HIV-positive and HIV-negative pregnant women. METHODS: We did two parallel, unmasked randomised trials, enrolling pregnant women who had an HIV-positive test result documented in their antenatal record (trial 1) and women who had an HIV-negative test result documented in their antenatal record (trial 2) from an antenatal setting in Lusaka, Zambia. Women in both trials were randomly assigned (1:1) to the intervention or control groups using permuted block randomisation. The control groups received partner notification services only, including an adapted version for women who were HIV-negative; the intervention groups additionally received targeted education on the use of oral HIV self-test kits for their partners, along with up to five oral HIV self-test kits. At the 30 day follow-up we collected information from pregnant women about their primary male partners HIV testing in the previous 30 days at health-care facilities, at home, or at any other facility. Our primary outcome was reported male partner testing at a health facility within 30 days following randomisation using a complete-case approach. Women also reported male partner HIV testing of any kind (including self-testing at home) that occurred within 30 days. Randomisation groups were compared via probability difference with a corresponding Wald-based 95% CI. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04124536) and all enrolment and follow-up has been completed. FINDINGS: From Oct 28, 2019, to May 26, 2020, 116 women who were HIV-positive (trial 1) and 210 women who were HIV-negative (trial 2) were enrolled and randomly assigned to study groups. Retention at 30 days was 100 (86%) in trial 1 and 200 (95%) in trial 2. Women in the intervention group were less likely to report facility-based male partner HIV testing in trial 1 (3 [6%] of 47 vs 15 [28%] of 53, estimated probability difference ?219% [95% CI ?359 to ?79%]) and trial 2 (3 [3%] of 102 vs 33 [34%] of 98, estimated probability difference ?307% [95% CI ?406 to ?208]). However, reported male partner HIV testing of any kind was higher in the intervention group than in the control group in trial 1 (36 [77%] of 47 vs 19 [36%] of 53, estimated probability difference 407% [95% CI 230 to 584%]) and trial 2 (80 [78%] of 102 vs 54 [55%] of 98, estimated probability difference 233% [95% CI 107 to 360%]) due to increased use of HIV self-testing. Overall, 14 male partners tested HIV-positive. Across the two trials, three cases of intimate partner violence were reported (two in the control groups and one in the intervention groups). INTERPRETATION: Our combination approach increased overall HIV testing in male partners of pregnant women but reduced the proportion of men who sought follow-up facility-based testing. This combination approach might reduce linkages to health care, including for HIV prevention, and should be considered in the design of comprehensive HIV programmes.

However, little is known about the antiviral effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, the study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential effect in regulating the host's immune response. The inhibitory effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells was evaluated by using the cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay. The number of virions of SARS-CoV-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with LS. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IL-1?, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-&#954;B/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-&#954;B p65, p-I&#954;B&#945; and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of I&#954;B&#945;. These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-&#954;B/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease.","output":"Liu Shen capsule shows antiviral and anti-inflammatory abilities against novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 via suppression of NF-B signaling pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to analyse the temporal and geographic distribution of radiologists, computed tomography and magnetic resonance scanners in Croatia.

The therapeutic effect of the traditional Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen in this new coronary pneumonia epidemic has attracted attention from all walks of life, and relevant research reports continue to appear. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the clinical efficacy and safety of the traditional Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) (referred to as \\"new coronary pneumonia\\"), and evaluated the overall level of research quality. METHODS: We searched seven databases and retrieved the Chinese Journal Full-text Database (CNKI), Vip Database (VIP), China Biomedicine (SinoMed), Wanfang Database and PubMed, Cochrane Central, EMBASE from October 2019 to May 2020 Literature references. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that tested the efficacy of the traditional Chinese medicine lotus clearing plague in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia. The authors extracted data and independently assessed quality. We used Stata15.1 software to analyze the data of randomized trials. RESULTS: A total of 2 articles were identified, including 154 patients. All the participating patients were diagnosed with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). The meta-analysis results showed that the disappearance rate of the main clinical symptoms of Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia was significantly higher than that of the control group [OR = 3.34, 95% CI (2.06, 5.44), P <0.001]; the disappearance rate of other clinical secondary symptoms is significantly higher than the control group [OR = 6.54, 95% CI (3.59, 11.90), P <0.001]. The duration of fever was significantly lower than that of the control group [OR = -1.04, 95% CI (-1.60, -0.49), P <0.001]. It is confirmed that the traditional Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen treatment improves the clinical effectiveness, and also has certain advantages in relieving cough and fever. CONCLUSION: The treatment of new pneumonia with traditional Chinese medicine lotus clearing plague can be used as an effective therapy to improve the clinical symptoms of new coronary pneumonia.

Having enough doses from the most efficient vaccines in a short time is not possible for all countries. Hence, policymakers may propose using various combinations of available vaccines to control the pandemic with vaccine-induced herd immunity by vaccinating a fraction of the population. The classic vaccine-induced herd-immunity threshold suggests that we can stop spreading the disease by vaccinating a fraction of the population. However, that classic threshold is defined only for a single vaccine and may be invalid and biased when we have multi-vaccine strategies for a disease or multiple variants, potentially leading policymakers to suboptimal vaccine-allocation policies. Here, we determine which combination of multiple vaccines may lead to herd immunity. We show that simplifying the problem and considering the vaccination of the population as a single-vaccine strategy whose effectiveness is the sample mean of all effectivenesses would not be ideal, because many multi-vaccine strategies with a smaller herd-immunity threshold can be proposed. We show that the herd-immunity threshold may vary due to changes in vaccine-uptake proportions. Moreover, we propose methods to determine the optimal combination of multiple vaccines in order to achieve herd immunity and apply our results to the issue of multiple variants. In addition, we determine a condition for reaching herd immunity in the presence of new emerging variants of concern. We show by example that new variants could influence our estimation of the vaccination reproduction number. It follows that the herd-immunity threshold must be updated not only when multi-vaccine strategies are used but also when multiple variants coexist in the population.","output":"The herd-immunity threshold must be updated for multi-vaccine strategies and multiple variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is of great importance to examine the impact of the healthcare reorganization adopted to confront the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of care provided to non-COVID-19 patients.

The spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a key role in binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2. S proteins that are expressed on the cell membrane can initiate receptor-dependent syncytia formation that is associated with extensive tissue damage. Formation of syncytia have been previously observed in cells infected with various other viruses (e.g., HIV, Ebola, Influenza, and Herpesviruses). However, this phenomenon is not well documented and the mechanisms regulating the formation of these syncytia by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the possibility that cell fusion events mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interaction can occur in different human cell lines that mimic different tissue origins. These cell lines were stably transduced with either wild-type (WT-S) S protein or a mutated variant where the ER-retention motif was removed (19-S), or human ACE2 vectors. Different co-culture combinations of spike-expressing 293T, A549, K562, and SK-Hep1 cells with hACE2-expressing cells revealed cell hybrid fusion. However, only certain cells expressing S protein can form syncytial structures as this phenomenon cannot be observed in all co-culture combinations. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell-cell fusion represents a cell type-dependent process which might rely on a different set of parameters. Recently, the 19-S variant is being widely used to increase SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production for in vitro assays. Comparison of cell fusion occurring via 19-S expressing cells shows defective nuclear fusion and syncytia formation compared to WT-S. This distinction between the 19-S variant and WT-S protein may have downstream implications for studies that utilize pseudovirus-based entry assays. Additionally, this study suggest that spike protein expressed by vaccines may affect different ACE2-expressing host cells after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration. The long-term effects of these vaccines should be monitored carefully.","output":"Deletion of ER-retention Motif on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Reduces Cell Hybrid During Cell-cell Fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high numbers of critically ill and dying patients in need of expert management of dyspnea, delirium, and serious illness communication.

In response to this unprecedented need for palliative care, our program sought to create a collection of palliative care resources for non-palliative care clinicians. A workgroup of interdisciplinary palliative care clinicians developed the Palliative Care Toolkit, consisting of a detailed chapter in a COVID-19 online resource, a mobile and desktop web application, one-page guides, pocket cards, and communication skills training videos. The suite of resources provides expert and evidence-based guidance on symptom management including dyspnea, pain, and delirium, and also on serious illness communication, including conversations about goals of care, code status, and end-of-life. We also created a nurse resource hotline staffed by palliative care nurse practitioners and virtual office hours staffed by a palliative care attending physician.

Background: We focus on a core aspect of gender (in)equality in intimate relationships, namely couples division of housework and childcare, and whether this has changed during the Corona crisis. Method: Our descriptive analysis is based on pre-release data from the German Family Panel (pairfam;Wave 12) and its supplementary Corona web-survey (n=3,108). Results: We observe no fundamental changes in established aggregate-level patterns of couples division of labor, but some shift towards the extremes ('traditional' and 'role reversal') of the distribution. Regarding changes within couples, there is an almost equal split between those in which the female partners share in housework and childcare increased and those in which it decreased. Particularly in previously more egalitarian arrangements, a substantial proportion of women is now more likely to be primarily responsible for everything. If male partners increased their relative contribution to housework and childcare, they rarely moved beyond the threshold of an equal split. Changes in employment hours were associated with adaptations of men's, but not women's, relative contribution to domestic and family responsibilities. Conclusion: Our findings neither support the notion of a 'patriarchal pandemic', nor do they indicate that the Corona crisis might have fostered macro-level trends of gender convergence.

Diagnostic autopsy, although useful for cause of death identification, have limited acceptance. Minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) is an alternative to autopsy for identification of the cause of death (CoD). A formative research linked to pilot MITS implementation was conducted to document the perceptions and attitudes of the healthcare professionals and the barriers for implementation. METHODS This exploratory qualitative study conducted at a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India included the hospital staffs. In-depth interviews were conducted with the doctors, nurses and support staffs from pediatrics, neonatology, obstetrics and forensic medicine departments. Inductive data analysis was done to identify the emerging themes and codes. RESULTS A total of 26 interviews (doctors, n = 10; nurses, n = 9 and support staffs, n = 7) were conducted. Almost all professional and support staffs were positive about the MITS and its advantage for CoD identification including co-existing and underlying illnesses. Some opined conduct of MITS for the cases without clear diagnosis. All participants perceived that MITS would be acceptable for parents due to the non-disfigurement and preferred by those who had unexplained child deaths or stillbirths in past. The key factors for MITS acceptance were appropriate communication, trust building, involvement of senior doctors, and engagement of the counselor prior to deaths and training of the personnel. For implementation and sustenance of MITS, involvement of the institute authority and government stakeholders would be essential. CONCLUSIONS MITS was acceptable for the doctors, nurses and support staffs and critical for better identification of the causes of death and stillbirths. The key facilitating factors and challenges for implementing MITS at the hospital in Indian context were identified.

Conventional confirmatory testing include skin tests and, for a few drugs, quantification of drug-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. However, none of these tests are absolutely predictive for the clinical outcome, and can yield false-negative and false-positive results. We performed a proof-of-concept study to assess whether a mast cell activation test could improve diagnosis of IgE-mediated chlorhexidine hypersensitivity, a common cause of perioperative anaphylaxis. METHODS Human mast cells were generated from CD34+ progenitor cells and sensitised with patients' sera to become IgE+ human mast cells (dMCIgE+), and then incubated with chlorhexidine to assess degranulation. We compared the diagnostic performance of this mast cell activation test with serum from patients with and without positive skin test and basophil activation test to chlorhexidine. RESULTS In dMC sensitised with sera from patients with a positive skin test and basophil activation test to chlorhexidine showed drug-specific and concentration-dependent degranulation upon stimulation with chlorhexidine, determined by surface upregulation of the degranulation marker CD63. In contrast, dMC sensitised with sera from patients with a negative skin test and basophil activation test to chlorhexidine were unresponsive in the mast cell activation test. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that the mast cell activation test can be used to diagnose IgE/FcRI-dependent immediate drug hypersensitivity reactions. It also shows potential to assess the clinical relevance of drug-specific IgE antibodies in their ability to elicit mast cell degranulation, and therefore discriminate between allergy and sensitisation.

Clinical signs help guide initial diagnosis, though definitive diagnosis is made using the laboratory technique reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The chest x-ray (CXR) is used as the primary imaging investigation in the United Kingdom (UK) for patients with suspected COVID-19. In some hospitals these CXRs may be reported by a radiographer. METHODS: Retrospective review of CXR reports by radiographers for suspected COVID-19 patients attending the Emergency Department (ED) of a hospital in the UK. Interpretation and use of the British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) coding system was assessed. Report description and code use were cross-checked. Report and code usage were checked against the RT-PCR result to determine accuracy. Report availability was checked against the availability of the RT-PCR result. A confusion matrix was utilised to determine performance. The data were analysed manually using Excel. RESULTS: Sample size was 320 patients; 54.1% male patients (n = 173), 45.9% female patients (n = 147). The correct code matched report descriptions in 316 of the 320 cases (98.8%). In 299 of the 320 cases (93.4%), the reports were available before the RT-PCR swab result. CXR sensitivity for detecting COVID-19 was 85% compared to 93% for the initial RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: Reporting radiographers can adequately utilise and apply the BSTI classification system when reporting COVID-19 CXRs. They can recognise the classic CXR appearances of COVID-19 and those with normal appearances. Future best practice includes checking laboratory results when reporting CXRs with ambiguous appearances.

Comparative analyses were performed in relation to three key characteristics: management level, management education and experiences as a leader. RESULTS: Eighty-nine health care leaders completed both surveys. Significant differences were found within the entire group across the key characteristics as they felt more prepared for each stage of the situation, they had more influence on the decisions taken, and they felt more concerned about the quality of treatment and care and their own health. Further significant results related to the three key characteristics were found at 1) Management level: The heads of department experienced being better informed, having more overview of their tasks and that these were meaningful. The ward managers experienced being more able to work in consistency with own beliefs and values, though they felt more overloaded. 2) Level of management education: Leaders, without a formal management education, experienced being more supported by staff. 3) Years of experiences as leader: Leaders with more than five years of experience, experienced being more prepared and informed, had more influence on decision-making, and were more worried about their own health.

Serum samples were collected at 2, 4, and 6 months after the second injection. Interventions SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Main Outcomes and Measures Anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits up to 6 months after the receipt of 2 doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The main outcome was factors associated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels at 6 months. Results All 50 participants (mean [SD] age, 34.7 [9.4] years; 10 [20.0%] male; mean [SD] body mass index, 21.8 [5.4]) acquired anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and maintained positive antibody (cutoff 30%) up to 6 months.

The anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody level was inversely correlated with weight, body mass index, body fat amount, and body weight to height ratio in Spearman correlation analysis. A 1-SD increase in body weight, weight to height ratio, and body mass index was associated with a 4%- to 5%-decrease in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in multiple linear regression analysis for women. In multivariate analysis for categorized variables, lower serum level of antibody (ie, <81.5%) was associated with weight (weight 55 kg: odds ratio, 9.01; 95% CI, 1.44-56.40).

We ask two fundamental epistemological questions regarding each hypothesis: First, how much confirmation does a positive test lend to each hypothesis? Second, how much evidence does a positive test provide for each hypothesis against its negation? We respond to each question within a formal Bayesian framework. We construe degree of confirmation as the difference between the posterior probability of the hypothesis and its prior, and the strength of evidence for a hypothesis against its alternative in terms of their likelihood ratio. We find that test specificityand coinfection probabilities when making inferences about Cwere key determinants of confirmation and evidence.

Accordingly, low specificity tests could not provide strong evidence in favor of C in all plausible scenarios modeled.

ResultsIncreasing age, male sex and Asian ethnicity were associated with worse outcomes. Increasing severity of chest X-ray abnormalities trended with mortality. Radiological changes persisted in over 50% of cases at early follow up (6 weeks). Ongoing symptoms including hair loss, memory impairment, breathlessness, cough and fatigue were reported in 67% of survivors, with 42% of patients unable to return to work due to ongoing symptoms. ConclusionsUnderstanding the acute clinical features, course of illness and outcomes of COVID-19 will be vital in preparing for further peaks of the pandemic. Our initial follow up data suggest there are ongoing sequalae of COVID-19 including persistent symptoms and radiological abnormalities. Further data, including longer term follow up data, are necessary to improve our understanding of this novel pathogen and associated disease. Section 1: What is already known on this topicPrevious studies have reported that increasing age, male sex, Black and Asian ethnicity increased risk of death for patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is little published literature regarding the follow up of patients with COVID-19. Section 2: What this study addsOur study is one of the first with follow up data for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. We show that radiological abnormality persisted at 6 weeks in over 50% of patients, as well as significantly increased breathlessness in patients without baseline dyspnoea. Our study confirms that increasing age, male sex and Asian ethnicity increased risk of death for patients, but also in an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population in East London.","output":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 in East London: a retrospective cohort analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, SenticNet and OntoSenticNet have represented important developments in the novel interdisciplinary field of research known as sentic computing, enabling the development of a variety of Sentic applications. In this paper, we propose an extension of the OntoSenticNet ontology, named DomainSenticNet, and contribute an unsupervised methodology to support the development of domain-aware Sentic applications. We developed an unsupervised methodology that, for each concept in OntoSenticNet, mines semantically related concepts from WordNet and Probase knowledge bases and computes domain distributional information from the entire collection of Kickstarter domain-specific crowdfunding campaigns. Subsequently, we applied DomainSenticNet to a prototype tool for Kickstarter campaign authoring and success prediction, demonstrating an improvement in the interpretability of sentiment intensities. DomainSenticNet is an extension of the OntoSenticNet ontology that integrates each of the 100,000 concepts included in OntoSenticNet with a set of semantically related concepts and domain distributional information. The defined unsupervised methodology is highly replicable and can be easily adapted to build similar domain-aware resources from different domain corpora and external knowledge bases. Used in combination with OntoSenticNet, DomainSenticNet may favor the development of novel hybrid aspect-based sentiment analysis systems and support further research on sentic computing in domain-aware applications.","output":"DomainSenticNet: An Ontology and a Methodology Enabling Domain-Aware Sentic Computing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The expanding number of chronic respiratory diseases and the new Covid-19 outbreak create an increasing demand for mechanical ventilation (MV).

Emerging evidence suggests that school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic could have hastened the inactivity of youth, possibly due to a lack of structure outside of school and increased access to sedentary activities. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess changes in physical activity from preCschool closure (before the pandemic) to postCschool closure (during the pandemic) among youth in spring 2020. METHODS: This study used a natural experimental design; youth were enrolled in a physical activity study prior to the lockdown, which was enforced due to the pandemic. The number of device-assessed steps per day and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity minutes per week were measured by using a Garmin Vivofit 4 (Garmin Ltd) accelerometer over 8 weeks. Mixed effects models were used to compare physical activity variables, which were measured before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Youth were primarily Hispanic or Latinx (8/17, 47%) and female (10/17, 59%). The number of daily steps decreased by 45.4% during the school closure, from a preCschool closure mean of 8003 steps per day to a postCschool closure mean of 4366 steps per day. Daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity decreased by 42.5%, from a preCschool closure mean of 80.18 minutes per week to a postCschool closure mean of 46.13 minutes per week. CONCLUSIONS: Youth are engaging in roughly half as much physical activity during the school closure as they were prior to the school closure. If additional evidence supports these claims, interventions are needed to support youths engagement in physical activity in the Midwest.","output":"Decreased Physical Activity Among Youth Resulting From COVID-19 PandemicCRelated School Closures: Natural Experimental Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) period, the world witnessed a complete closure of all aspects of social life, and people must go for home quarantine to limit the spread of Corona virus disease.

We consider civic movements and novel forms of collaboration as a potentially transformative challenger to the predominant approach of corporatist collaboration in the mobility and energy sectors. However, while trade unions and employer organizations provide a permanent and active arena for policy-oriented collaboration, civil society groups cannot rely on an equivalently institutionalized corridor to secure policy impact and public resonance. In that sense, conventional forms of collaboration tend to hinder the transformation towards a post-carbon economy. Collaboration in the German corporatist setting is thus, from a sustainability perspective, simultaneously a problem and a solution. We argue for more institutionalized corridors between civil society and state institutions.

Applying this principle, a court considers only the proximity of the upcoming election. The underlying rationale of the Purcell principle is to avoid possible voter confusion and election chaos caused by lastminute changes. While these are legitimate concerns, the rigid Purcell principle has led courts to blindly reject any changes proposed shortly before the election--even when the changes are necessary for an orderly, effective election. This Note identifies the drawbacks of the Purcell principle and argues for its abolition. In other words, courts should cease applying the Purcell principle and return to the Winter preliminary injunction standard, which requires courts to weigh plaintiffs' likelihood of success on the merits, any irreparable harm to parties, the balance of equities, and the public interest. The Purcell principle is ambiguous in three key ways: whether it is a stand-alone rule or a subfactor;how close the election has to be for the principle to apply;and whether it applies to appellate decisions in addition to district courts' orders. The consistent failure of the judiciary to clarify the principle in the hundreds of Purcell cases generated by the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that revising Purcell is impracticable.

To address concerns over infection, we gathered and analyzed experiences with tracheostomy in the COVID-19 patient population from all over Japan. METHODS: The data for health-care workers involved in tracheostomies for COVID-19-infected patients were gathered from academic medical centers or their affiliated hospitals from all over Japan. RESULTS: Tracheostomies have been performed in 35 COVID-19 patients with a total of 91 surgeons, 49 anesthesiologists, and 49 surgical staff members involved. Twenty-eight (80%) patients underwent surgery more than 22 days after the development of COVID-19-related symptoms (11: 22-28 days and 17: &#8805;29 days). Thirty (85.7%) patients underwent surgery &#8805; 15 days after intubation (14: 15-21 days, 6: 22-28 days, and 10: &#8805;29 days). Among the total of 189 health-care workers involved in the tracheostomy procedures, 25 used a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) and 164 used a N95 mask and eye protection. As a result, no transmission to staff occurred during the 2 weeks of follow-up after surgery. CONCLUSION: No one involved in tracheostomy procedures were found to have been infected with COVID-19 in this Japanese study. The reason is thought to be that the timing of the surgery was quite late after the infections, and the surgery was performed using appropriate PPE and surgical procedure. The indications for and timing of tracheostomy for severe COVID-19 patients should be decided through multidisciplinary discussion.","output":"Management of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients: The Japanese experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the pandemic of COVID-19 remote learning has been very highlighted.

This paper proposes a robust deep Gaussian processes (DGP)-based probabilistic load forecasting method using a limited number of data. Since the proposed method only requires a limited number of training samples for load forecasting, it allows us to deal with extreme scenarios that cause short-term load behavior changes. In particular, the load forecasting at the beginning of abnormal event is cast as a regression problem with limited training samples and solved by double stochastic variational inference DGP. The mobility data are also utilized to deal with the uncertainties and pattern changes and enhance the flexibility of the forecasting model. The proposed method can quantify the uncertainties of load forecasting outcomes, which would be essential under uncertain inputs. Extensive comparison results with other state-of-the-art point and probabilistic forecasting methods show that our proposed approach can achieve high forecasting accuracies with only a limited number of data while maintaining excellent performance of capturing the forecasting uncertainties.

The present study investigated the effects of Mg++ supplementation on preventing CS-induced muscle atrophy in an animal model, which provided experimental data for potential clinical translation. METHODS: Twelve 24-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CS methylprednisolone (MPS) to induce muscle atrophy, with half of the rats also given daily 50 mg/kg Mg++ oral supplementation. Additional six rats without LPS + CS treatments were used as normal controls. After treatment for 6 weeks, serum was collected for Mg++ quantification, animal dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed for tissue composition, and the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) was collected for muscle functional test and histology including muscle fiber size, intramuscular fat infiltration and fiber typing. In vitro myotube atrophy model was used to study the in vitro effect associated with in vivo muscle atrophy. RESULTS: LPS + CS treatments induced hypomagnesemia while the serum Mg++ level was in normal range after Mg++ supplementation. DXA showed 53.0% lower fat percent and 29.7% higher lean mass in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared to LPS + CS group. Muscle functional test showed 22.2% higher specific twitch force and 40.3% higher specific tetanic force in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared to LPS + CS group. Histological analysis showed 4.1% higher proportion of muscle fibers area to total area and 63.6% lower intramuscular fat infiltration in EDL sections in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared to LPS + CS group. LPS + CS + Mg group had 33.0% higher area proportion and 29.4% higher cross-sectional area (CSA) of type IIb muscle fiber. Myoblast culture results showed that Mg++ supplementation group had larger myotube diameter. The mRNA expressions of the muscle atrophy marker genes MuRF1 and MAFbx were lower in Mg++ supplementation group both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated that Mg++ supplementation successfully alleviated CS-associated muscle atrophy in rats at both functional and morphology levels, indicating a translational potential for patients undergoing CS therapy. This study provided the evidence for the first time that Mg++ supplementation could prevent muscle atrophy-an adverse effect of CS therapy, currently also adopted for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","output":"Magnesium supplementation alleviates corticosteroid-associated muscle atrophy in rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analysis of the temporal, seasonal and demographic distribution of dengue virus (DENV) infections in Barbados was conducted using national surveillance data from a total of 3994 confirmed dengue cases. Diagnosis was confirmed either by DENVCspecific real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRTCPCR), or nonCstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests; a case fatality rate of 0.4% (10/3994) was observed. The dengue fever (DF) prevalence varied from 27.5 to 453.9 cases per 100,000 population among febrile patients who sought medical attention annually. DF cases occurred throughout the year with low level of transmission observed during the dry season (December to June), then increased transmission during rainy season (July to November) peaking in October. Three major dengue epidemics occurred in Barbados during 2010, 2013 and possibly 2016 with an emerging threeCyear interval. DF prevalence among febrile patients who sought medical attention overall was highest among the 10C19 years old age group. The highest DF hospitalisation prevalence was observed in 2013. Multiple serotypes circulated during the study period and Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENVC2) was the most prevalent serotype during 2010, whilst DENVC1 was the most prevalent serotype in 2013. Two DENVC1 strains from the 2013 DENV epidemic were genetically more closely related to South East Asian strains, than Caribbean or South American strains, and represent the first ever sequencing of DENV strains in Barbados. However, the small sample size (n = 2) limits any meaningful conclusions. DF prevalence was not significantly different between females and males. Public health planning should consider DENV interCepidemic periodicity, the current COVIDC19 pandemic and similar clinical symptomology between DF and COVIDC19.

These tests are interpreted qualitatively for diagnosis, and the relevance of the test result intensity, i.e. the number of quantification cycles (Cq), is debated because of strong potential biases. AIM: We explored the possibility to use Cq values from SARS-CoV-2 screening tests to better understand the spread of an epidemic and to better understand the biology of the infection. METHODS: We used linear regression models to analyse a large database of 793,479 Cq values from tests performed on more than 2 million samples between 21 January and 30 November 2020, i.e. the first two pandemic waves. We performed time series analysis using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to estimate whether Cq data information improves short-term predictions of epidemiological dynamics. RESULTS: Although we found that the Cq values varied depending on the testing laboratory or the assay used, we detected strong significant trends associated with patient age, number of days after symptoms onset or the state of the epidemic (the temporal reproduction number) at the time of the test. Furthermore, knowing the quartiles of the Cq distribution greatly reduced the error in predicting the temporal reproduction number of the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Cq values of screening tests performed in the general population generate testable hypotheses and help improve short-term predictions for epidemic surveillance.","output":"Epidemiological and clinical insights from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR crossing threshold values, France, January to November 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

He received the 6th cycle (part B) of the hyper-CVAD chemotherapeutic regimen followed by the initiation of neutropenic fever prophylaxis protocol which included antibiotics and G?CSF. In a course of hours, the patient became dyspneic, hypotensive, and edematous which required intensive care unit admission and was stabilized accordingly. In the following days the patients anasarca progressively increased which was associated with hypoalbuminemia, hypotension and anemia with pericardial and bilateral plural effusions. As a diagnosis of exclusion augmented by the acuity of such clinical event, observed concomitantly with the administration of the prophylaxis protocol, the suspicion of G?CSF-induced SCLS was established. Consequently, G?CSF was discontinued and treatment with dexamethasone and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) was started. The patients condition improved significantly illustrated by hemodynamic stability in addition to improvement regarding the anasarca, hypoalbuminemia, and anemia.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to describe a protocol for a study using a convergent mixed methods design to explore exposures in the household, neighborhood, school, and the journey from home to school that may influence diet and PA behaviors in adolescents from LMICs. METHODS: Male and female adolescents (n150) aged between 13 and 24 years will be recruited from selected high schools or households in project site countries to ensure the socioeconomic diversity of perspectives and experiences at the individual, home, and neighborhood levels. The project will be conducted at 5 sites in 4 countries: Kenya, Cameroon, Jamaica, and South Africa (Cape Town and Johannesburg). Data on anthropometric measures, food intake, and PA knowledge and behavior will be collected using self-report questionnaires. In addition, a small number of learners (n=30-45) from each site will be selected as citizen scientists to capture data (photographs, audio notes, text, and geolocations) on their lived experiences in relation to food and PA in their homes, the journey to and from school, and the school and neighborhood environments using a mobile app, and for objective PA measurements. In-depth interviews will be conducted with the citizen scientists and their caregivers to explore household experiences and determinants of food intake and foodways, as well as the PA of household members. RESULTS: The study described in this protocol paper was primarily funded through a UK National Institute for Health Research grant in 2017 and approved by the relevant institutional ethics review boards in the country sites (South Africa, Cameroun, and Jamaica in 2019, and Kenya in 2020).

These risks are not only linked to natural disasters and climate change, but also to poverty and inequality of access to services such as health, and personal safety. This article considers the underlying conditions that shape regional resilience in Chile, based on inter-regional and intra-regional comparisons in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago and the Region of Araucana. Instead of viewing resilience in terms of an ability to counter a single risk, the article highlights the fact that risks are multiple and overlapping over time and generated at different scales. Municipal level data on poverty, health, and public finances in the two regions reveal the contrasting underlying inequalities that point to regional mosaics of resilience rather than homogeneity. Different threats are superposed on these preexisting conditions of resilience. The article refers to three in particular: the 2010 Chilean earthquake (episodic);climate change (episodic and incremental);and the Covid-19 pandemic (episodic). The findings point to high levels of urban versus rural differentiation, and also high differentiation within the Santiago Metropolitan Area based on socio-economic conditions.

It identifies these points by adopting a rhetorical-performative approach to uncover three particular performances of control that articulated the pandemic in Aotearoa New Zealand, from the diagnosis of the first COVID-19 case in the country in February 2020 through to October 2020. This period of analysis covers the emergence, subsequent nationwide lockdown, elimination, and re-emergence of the virus. There are three distinct nodal points that unfold as key to the nations ability to control COVID-19: the hegemonic us;iwi regionalism;and the rhetoric of kindness. A mixed approach of content analysis of government data, Facebook data, and key imagery is employed to constitute these nodal points relevance and how they structured the performative control that threaded through the nations initial response as a whole. The article demonstrates how Aotearoa New Zealand, considered by popular assessment to have been successful in its response to COVID-19, managed to eliminate the virus twice in 2020, but not without aspects of the antagonisms that have beset other nations.

Systems of care have been reorganized worldwide in an effort to preserve hospital bed capacity. In France, from March 17 to May 11 2020, government imposed a complete lockdown on the whole population. Only urgent cardiac procedures have been ensured such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) revascularization. Some previously published studies suggest a reduction of admission for STEMI in many countries. Nevertheless, strong evidences and data across different French regions that have been affected variously by the outbreak are still lacking. Purpose We aimed to describe the incidence rates and characteristics of patients presenting with STEMI in order to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on STEMI care in France covering the lockdown period compared to same period one year ago. Methods We performed a retrospective multicenter registry across 60 French interventional cardiology centers including all consecutive STEMI patients referred for urgent revascularization in the heart catheterization laboratory between two periods: March 1st to May 31th 2020 compared with March 1st to May 31th 2019. Comprehensive data, including clinical, biological, COVID status and angiographic variables including time taken for care were recorded at admission. The primary outcome was a composite of invasive mechanical ventilation support or in-hospital death. The secondary outcome was the occurrence of myocardial infarction related complications during hospitalization. Enrollement is not complete at the time of the abstract submission. Conclusion This data collection between two periods with and without COVID19 will gave insights for a complete descriptive cartography of STEMI patients among different French regions which have been

Surgical management now needs to consider the risks of malignant disease progression by delaying surgery, and those of COVID-19 transmission to patients and operating room staff. The goal of our study was to describe our experience in providing both emergent and elective surgical procedures for patients with NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, and to present our point of view regarding the safety of performing lung cancer surgery. Methods: This observational cross-sectional study included all consecutive patients with NSCLC who operated at Tel Aviv Medical Center, a large university-affiliated hospital, from February 2020 through December 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. The patients demographics, COVID-19 preoperative screening results, type and side of surgery, pathology results, morbidity and mortality rates, postoperative complications, including pulmonary complications management, and hospital stay were evaluated. Results: Included in the study were 113 patients, 68 males (60.2%) and 45 females (39.8%), with a median age of 68.2 years (range, 41C89). Of these 113 patients, 83 (73.5%) underwent video-assisted thoracic surgeries (VATS), and 30 (26.5%) underwent thoracotomies. Fifty-five patients (48.7%) were preoperatively screened for COVID-19 and received negative results. Fifty-six postoperative complications were reported in 35 patients (30.9%). A prolonged air leak was detected in 11 patients (9.7%), atrial fibrillation in 11 patients (9.7%), empyema in 5 patients (4.4%), pneumonia in 9 patients (7.9%) and lobar atelectasis in 7 patients (6.2%). Three patients (2.7%) with postoperative pulmonary complications required mechanical ventilation, and two of them (1.6%) underwent tracheostomy. Two patients (1.6%) were postoperatively diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of implementing precautionary strategies to ensure the safety of lung cancer patients undergoing pulmonary resection during the COVID-19 pandemic. The strategy was equally effective in protecting the surgical staff and healthcare providers, and we recommend performing lung cancer surgery during the pandemic era.","output":"Major Pulmonary Resection for Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma during the COVID-19 PandemicSingle Israeli Center Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has coincided with an increase in depressive symptoms as well as a growing awareness of health disparities and discrimination against racial and ethnic minority communities in the United States. Here, we examine the mental health impact of perceived discrimination during the pandemic in a large and diverse cohort of the All of Us Research Program. Methods: Using repeated assessments of 62,651 participants in May to July of 2020, we fitted mixed-effects models to assess the effect of perceived discrimination on moderate to severe depression (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 [] 10) and suicidal ideation (PHQ-9 item 9 > 0), and applied inverse probability weights to account for non-random probabilities of completing the voluntary survey. Results: Perceived discrimination was associated with an increased odds of depression (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.21 [1.20 -1.22]) and suicidal ideation (1.17 [1.16-1.18]). For depression, the effects were larger in earlier phases of the pandemic (interaction p=8.2x10-5), which varied by main reason for discrimination and self-reported race. Among those who identified race or ancestry as a primary reason for discrimination, Asian and Black participants had 24% and 17% increase in the odds of depression in May of 2020 (1.24 [1.17-1.31] and 1.17 [1.12-1.22]), respectively, versus a 3% and 7% increase in July (1.03 [0.96-1.10] and 1.07 [1.02-1.12]).

Among cutting edge methods, frontier analysis is a successful approach that has been widely used to assess the efficiency and productivity of entities with multiple resources and multiple outputs. This study first develops a unique framework based upon data envelopment analysis (DEA) to measure efficiency and productivity in the way that it tackles the uncertainty in data and undesirable outputs and, in turn, provides useful information to decision-makers. An adaptive robust optimisation is utilised to combat uncertain data whose distributions are unknown and consider the nexus between the level of conservatism and decision-makers risk preference. The key advantage of the proposed robust DEA approach is that the results remain relatively unchanged when uncertain conditions exist in the problem. An empirical study on the oil refinery is presented in situations of data uncertainty along with considering CO(2) emissions as the undesirable output to conduct environmental efficiency and productivity analysis of the 25 countries over the period 2000C2018. The empirical results obtained from the proposed approach give some imperative implications. First, results show that the price of robustness does not affect identically for varying technologies when assessing productivity in a global oil market, and the USA oil industry is observed as the highest productivity growth in all cases confirming its efforts for the rapid rise in oil extraction and production at low costs. There may be practical lessons for other nations to learn from the USA oil industry to improve productivity. Findings also support a considerable regress during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis in the oil industry compared to the rest of the periods in question, and due to monetary and fiscal stimulus, there is a sharp productivity growth from 2009 to 2011. The other implication that can be drawn is that the GDP growth rate and technology innovation can more effectively improve the productivity of the oil industry across the globe.

This study aimed to assess whether the operational changes put in place to reduce infection risks were effective in engaging and supporting staff. METHODS: Our service's response saw staff and patients split into morning or afternoon shifts without overlap. Changes included extended clinic hours, modified treatment regimens, expanded online/electronic communication and remote working. Staff were invited to respond to an electronic questionnaire in September 2020, just after the peak of the second COVID-19 wave in Victoria. Responses captured demographic data, parental status, profession, happiness levels, fear of COVID-19 and e-communication efficacy. RESULTS: A 57% response rate was achieved. 69% of respondents were female; 40% were aged 45+ and 35% had school-aged children. Staff aged 45+ showed a significantly greater fear of COVID-19 than younger staff. 36% of respondents reported feeling nervous or anxious watching news reports about COVID-19. 92% of staff were happy with their work arrangements; staff with children were happier than staff without children with their shifts. Online chat/channels were reported as the preferred e-communication method between colleagues. CONCLUSION: Staff provided predominantly positive feedback to the changes made in response to the pandemic, reporting high levels of happiness and willingness to continue with the changes implemented during COVID-19.

Minimizing the spread of coronavirus and its economic consequences, and creating a new and safe lifestyle has now become the common goals of governments all over the world. Although governments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing various rules while interacting with relevant organizations to provide health service, vaccine research, and production of essential items, the complexities in the interactions between various stakeholders have proved to be challenging to have efficient and timely outputs. When different stakeholders (i.e. governments, organizations, and the public) are interacting with each other, a systems thinking process needs to be applied to capture the nuances of the interactions and the subsequent emergent behavior to effectively contribute to the system output (i.e. a safer way of life). This paper applied a system-thinking-inspired process called System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to analyze the current response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis treated various stakeholders as a part of the system, and it focused on the interactions among different stakeholders (i.e. functional blocks) within the system - i.e. 'Government', 'Foreign Governments', 'Organizations', and 'General Public', as well as the interactions with 'W.H.O'. The STPA analysis found 236 potential Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) (or unsafe interactions) among the stakeholder interactions, each of the UCAs was then further analyzed. In total 1440 causal factors of the UCAs were identified, and 2880 requirements were proposed to avoid such unsafe interactions.","output":"Analyzing national responses to COVID-19 Pandemic using STPA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the state-level differences in government and community responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to different growth trajectories of COVID-19 cases and their connectedness across the U.S. states.

Moving to the analysis of spillovers/connectedness of COVID-19 cases across the states, we apply the Diebold-Yilmaz connectedness methodology to the growth rates of COVID-19 cases. Using the total directional connectedness measures, we find that the states with lax government and community response generated connectedness of COVID-19 cases to others. These findings are also supported by the secondary regression analysis of pairwise connectedness measures over time. Finally, the travel intensity between the pairs of states, indirectly measured by the data on smartphone location exposure, contributes significantly to the pairwise directional connectedness of COVID-19 across the states.","output":"Polarized Politics of Pandemic Response and the COVID-19 Connectedness Across the U.S. States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper wants to present the data of infection of the Health Care Workers of a research and teaching hospital in Milan, Italy.

In this systematic review, we synthesise the published literature to determine the nature of the relationship between parent mental health and wellbeing and the intergenerational transmission of attachment and to provide recommendations for future research, clinical practice and intervention. METHOD Using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach, five electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed empirical studies, published in English. Articles were considered for inclusion if data was collected on adult attachment, child attachment, and a domain of parent mental health/wellbeing. No date parameters were applied to the search strategy. The review was registered with PROPSERO (registration number: CRD42020157247). RESULTS Eleven studies examining the impact on parent mental health and wellbeing on the intergenerational transmission of attachment were identified for inclusion in this review. Our review found preliminary evidence that parent mental health and wellbeing play a role in the intergenerational transmission of attachment. Other key findings from the review were: evidence quality is mixed due to variable measurement of attachment and mental health; studies have mostly included correlational analysis or do not utilise contemporary methodological approaches to testing mediating or moderating relationships; and literature is largely focused on psychopathology and negative factors of mental health. CONCLUSIONS The limited scope of parent mental health and wellbeing constructs examined in the literature, the sparse use of robust statistical analyses, and the lack of literature in general makes it difficult to draw conclusions on how and why parent mental health impacts attachment transmission.

ISG15 expression and protein ISGylation modulate viral infection; however, the viral mechanisms regulating the function of ISG15 and ISGylation are not well understood. We recently showed that ISGylation suppresses the growth of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) at multiple steps of the virus life cycle and that the virus-encoded pUL26 protein inhibits protein ISGylation. In this study, we demonstrate that the HCMV UL50-encoded transmembrane protein, a component of the nuclear egress complex, also inhibits ISGylation. pUL50 interacted with UBE1L, an E1-activating enzyme for ISGylation, and (to a lesser extent) with ISG15, as did pUL26. However, unlike pUL26, pUL50 caused proteasomal degradation of UBE1L. The UBE1L level induced in human fibroblast cells by interferon beta treatment or virus infection was reduced by pUL50 expression. This activity of pUL50 involved the transmembrane (TM) domain within its C-terminal region, although pUL50 could interact with UBE1L in a manner independent of the TM domain. Consistently, colocalization of pUL50 with UBE1L was observed in cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor. Furthermore, we found that RNF170, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated ubiquitin E3 ligase, interacted with pUL50 and promoted pUL50-mediated UBE1L degradation via ubiquitination. Our results demonstrate a novel role for the pUL50 transmembrane protein of HCMV in the regulation of protein ISGylation.IMPORTANCE Proteins can be conjugated covalently by ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins, such as SUMO and ISG15. ISG15 is highly induced in viral infection, and ISG15 conjugation, termed ISGylation, plays important regulatory roles in viral growth. Although ISGylation has been shown to negatively affect many viruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), viral countermeasures that might modulate ISGylation are not well understood. In the present study, we show that the transmembrane protein encoded by HCMV UL50 inhibits ISGylation by causing proteasomal degradation of UBE1L, an E1-activating enzyme for ISGylation. This pUL50 activity requires membrane targeting. In support of this finding, RNF170, an ER-associated ubiquitin E3 ligase, interacts with pUL50 and promotes UL50-mediated UBE1L ubiquitination and degradation. Our results provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that viruses can regulate ISGylation by directly targeting the ISGylation E1 enzyme.","output":"Transmembrane Protein pUL50 of Human Cytomegalovirus Inhibits ISGylation by Downregulating UBE1L."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poly(N-acryloyl glycinamide) is a well-known thermoresponsive polymer possessing an upper critical solution temperature (UCST) in water.

To effectively battle COVID-19, categorized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), materials scientists and biotechnologists need to combine their knowledge to develop efficient antiviral nanomaterials. By design, nanostructured materials (spherical, two-dimensional, hybrid) can express a diverse bioactivity and unique combination of specific, nonspecific, and mixed mechanisms of antiviral action. It can be related to the materials specific features and their multiple functionalization strategies. This is a complex guiding approach in which an interaction target is constantly moving and quickly changing. On the other hand, in such a rush, sustainability may be put aside. Therefore, to elucidate the most promising nanotechnological solutions, we critically review available data within the frame of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other types of viruses. We highlight solutions that are, or could be, more sustainable and less toxic. In this regard, reduction of the number of synthetic routes, organic solvents, byproducts, and residues is highly recommended. Such efficient, green solutions may be further used for the prevention of virionChost interactions, treatment of the already developed infection, reducing inflammation, and finally, protecting healthcare professionals with masks, fabrics, equipment, and in other associated areas.

METHODS: We performed unsupervised clustering on data from 1,526 patients (684 labeled MIS-C by clinicians) <21 years old hospitalized with COVID-19-related illness admitted between 15 March 2020 and 31 December 2020. We compared prevalence of assigned MIS-C labels and clinical features among clusters, followed by recursive feature elimination to identify characteristics of potentially misclassified MIS-C-labeled patients. FINDINGS: Of 94 clinical features tested, 46 were retained for clustering. Cluster 1 patients (N = 498; 92% labeled MIS-C) were mostly previously healthy (71%), with mean age 72  04 years, predominant cardiovascular (77%) and/or mucocutaneous (82%) involvement, high inflammatory biomarkers, and mostly SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative (60%). Cluster 2 patients (N = 445; 27% labeled MIS-C) frequently had pre-existing conditions (79%, with 39% respiratory), were similarly 74  21 years old, and commonly had chest radiograph infiltrates (79%) and positive PCR testing (90%). Cluster 3 patients (N = 583; 19% labeled MIS-C) were younger (28  20 y), PCR positive (86%), with less inflammation. Radiographic findings of pulmonary infiltrates and positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR accurately distinguished cluster 2 MIS-C labeled patients from cluster 1 patients. INTERPRETATION: Using a data driven, unsupervised approach, we identified features that cluster patients into a group with high likelihood of having MIS-C. Other features identified a cluster of patients more likely to have acute severe COVID-19 pulmonary disease, and patients in this cluster labeled by clinicians as MIS-C may be misclassified. These data driven phenotypes may help refine the diagnosis of MIS-C.","output":"Data-driven clustering identifies features distinguishing multisystem inflammatory syndrome from acute COVID-19 in children and adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The international financial system is currently not yet prepared to face a foreseeable crisis mainly motivated by the dichotomy between the real economy and the virtual economy.

The benevolent sentences of the courts to some of the fraudsters do not contribute to dispelling the ghost of fraud nor to the disappearance of tax havens. From the diachronic perspective, it is observed that economic crises are increasingly frequent and incidents always in the financial field; which forces us to rethink an economic model on an international scale in which there is a greater weight of the economic policy of governments over the power of multinational companies in the context of globalization. In the context of Corporate Social Responsibility, Corporate Governance is listed as one of the fundamental levers to curb large business fraud, but its efficiency seems insufficient due to the lack of international regulations and the ignorance of hidden forces in what has been known as fiscal and financial engineering.

Furthermore, how this overuse injury impacts other components of the glenohumeral joint, including nearby articular cartilage, is also unclear. Therefore, this study sought to better understand the time course of tendon protease activity in a rat model of supraspinatus overuse, as well as determine effects of 10 weeks of overuse on humeral head articular cartilage. For these studies, multiplex gelatin zymography was used to characterize protease activity profiles in tendon and cartilage, while histological scoring/mechanical testing and micro-computed tomography (CT) imaging were used to quantify structural damage in the supraspinatus tendon insertion and humeral articular cartilage, respectively. Histological scoring of supraspinatus tendon insertions revealed tendinopathic cellular and collagen fiber changes after 10 weeks of overuse when compared to controls, while mechanical testing revealed no significant differences between tensile moduli (overuse: 24.5  11.5 MPa; control: 16.3  8.7 MPa). EPIC-CT imaging on humeral articular cartilage demonstrated significant cartilage thinning (overuse: 119.6  6.34 m; control: 195.4  13.4m), decreased proteoglycan content (overuse: 2.1  0.18 cm-1 ; control: 1.65  0.14 cm-1 ), and increased subchondral bone thickness (overuse: 216.2  10.9 m; control: 192  17.8m) in the overuse animals. Zymography results showed no significant upregulation of cathepsins or matrix metalloproteinases in tendon or cartilage at 2 or 10 weeks of overuse compared to controls.

Using Taiwan as an example, this report describes the sources of potential medication shortages, discusses the preparedness and contingency strategies to address medication shortages, and outlines the evidence-based recommendations on ensuring a stable medication supply and improving the quality and security of medicines. Many drug shortages have focused on shortfalls of overseas manufacturing, but the effect of the COVID-19 crisis on misallocation of medications within the nation's internal supply chains is also a great concern. A wide range of stakeholders are involved in pharmaceutical supply chains, including government regulators, health care insurers, pharmaceutical companies, frontline physicians and pharmacists, patients and families, professional and patient associations or unions, and even individuals who acquire medications from abroad. Collaborative inputs and efforts from all these interdependent stakeholders are critical for establishing transparent preparedness and contingency plans to address drug shortages affected by disruptions of overseas manufacturing or stockouts in pharmacies owing to medication misallocation. Strategies have been documented and recommended in Taiwan and the United States to mitigate drug shortages and ensure the long-term quality and security of medicines. Barriers to accessing medicines are nothing new, but the COVID-19 pandemic poses urgent and even novel challenges to the stability and integrity of medication supply, which urges for a need to reconsider and reinforce effective management strategies for pharmaceuticals.

METHODS Evaluation of the pilot program was guided by a widely used validity framework. Data were collected that addressed the five categories of validity evidence: content, response process, internal structure, relation to other variables, and consequences. RESULTS Enrollment ranged from 66.7% for psychiatrists to 75.3% for child neurologists. For the 2019 cohort, the pass rates ranged from 92.6% for child and adolescent psychiatry to 98.7% for neurology, and very small numbers of diplomates failed or did not complete the process.

White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), the predominant cervid in North America, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and experimentally infected fawns can transmit the virus. To test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 may be circulating in deer, we tested 283 retropharyngeal lymph node (RPLN) samples collected from 151 free-living and 132 captive deer in Iowa from April 2020 through December of 2020 for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Ninety-four of the 283 deer (33.2%; 95% CI: 28, 38.9) samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as assessed by RT-PCR.

There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established.

Many lncRNAs can be related to immunity and the host response to viral infection, but their specific functions remain largely elusive. The vast majority of lncRNAs are annotated with extremely limited knowledge and tend to be expressed at low levels, making ad hoc experimentation difficult. Changes to lncRNA expression during infection can be systematically profiled using deep sequencing; however, this often produces an intractable number of candidate lncRNAs, leaving no clear path forward. For these reasons, it is especially important to prioritize lncRNAs into high-confidence hits by utilizing multiple methodologies. Large scale perturbation studies may be used to screen lncRNAs involved in phenotypes of interest, such as resistance to viral infection. Single cell transcriptome sequencing quantifies cell-type specific lncRNAs that are less abundant in a mixture. When coupled with iterative experimental validations, new computational strategies for efficiently integrating orthogonal high-throughput data will likely be the driver for elucidating the functional role of lncRNAs during viral infection.

In the particular case of the broadcasting business, this potential threat combines with the drastic changes brought by the advent of digital platforms and on-line contents, setting a new scenario of uncertainty. The traditional engagement of the audience and the TVs and society relationship is at stake, and the 70 years old business model we know may be coming to an end. Indeed, the TV business has already evolved to be more economically resilient. The lessons learnt with the past crisis in 2008C2011, were harsh for all and fatal for some. The case for regional broadcasting appears to be especially interesting to study since it gathers two different managerial approaches, public (classic) and private (outsourced), with their corresponding views and actions to endure the crisis. Even though the whole sector was strongly hit by the crisis, the management model adopted by the companies had a notable influence in how they reacted to the crisis, and how they found themselves in the aftermath, bringing precious information on how to confront the incoming COVID-19 crisis. This paper looks to extract the lessons learnt by Spanish regional TVs managing finance and credibility, in order to determine which strategy could be the most advisable to adopt in face of the coming challenges for the sector from both the managerial and stakeholders perspective.

METHODS We conducted a search of electronic databases and gray literature and evaluated the methodological quality and risk of bias of included studies. RESULTS A total of 30 studies met the inclusion criteria. Interventions that support girls' schooling through cash or in-kind transfers show the clearest pattern of success in preventing child marriage, with 8 of 10 medium-high quality studies showing positive results. Although limited in number, five studies on favorable job markets and targeted life skills and livelihoods training show consistent positive results. Comparatively, asset or cash transfers conditional on delaying marriage show success only among two of four evaluations, and the three studies on unconditional cash transfers for poverty mitigation show no effect. Findings also show a low success rate for multicomponent interventions with positive results in only one of eight medium-high quality studies. Further, single component interventions were much more likely to be at scale and sustainable than multicomponent interventions. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that enhancement of girls' own human capital and opportunities is the most compelling pathway to delaying marriage.

A history of termination of pregnancy was associated with greater acceptance of all posited contraceptive mechanisms. There was a very low degree of agreement between the declared acceptance of the various contraceptive mechanisms and the ever use of a method with the respective mechanism of action (Cohen's kappa coefficient range 0.017-0.162). CONCLUSIONS In this population the acceptability of contraceptive methods that act by preventing fertilisation ranked highest, followed by those that inhibit ovulation, disrupt implantation and dislodge an implanted embryo. Women who had ever had a termination of pregnancy were more likely to accept all the posited contraceptive mechanisms.","output":"Acceptability of different mechanisms of action of contraception in women: a questionnaire survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High-dimensional cellular and molecular profiling of biological samples highlights the need for analytical approaches that can integrate multi-omic datasets to generate prioritized causal inferences.

The research focuses on the double-edged sword impact of relational embeddedness on dynamic capabilities via ambidextrous learning, that is moderate embeddedness facilitates dynamic capabilities while overembeddedness inhibits them. Furthermore, this study investigates whether human capital moderates the relationships between relational embeddedness and ambidextrous learning. Selecting 264 samples for empirical research, firstly, the results show that the relational embeddedness in the BOP cooperation network has an inverted U-shaped influence on ambidextrous learning and dynamic capabilities. Secondly, exploratory learning and exploitative learning play a mediating role in relational embeddedness and dynamic capabilities. Thirdly, prior experience plays a positive moderating role in relational embeddedness and exploitative learning. The conclusions facilitate understanding the antecedents of dynamic capabilities and the black box of embeddedness paradox, and provide empirical evidence for adjusting the human capital of enterprises, enhancing the exploratory learning capability and exploitative learning capability, and coping with the overembeddedness effects.","output":"The Curvilinear Relationships Between Relational Embeddedness and Dynamic Capabilities: The Mediating Effect of Ambidextrous Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Survivor guilt is a common experience following traumatic events in which others have died.

METHODS: To evaluate the reactogenicity and humoral as well as cellular immune responses towards most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants after a heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination, we analysed a cohort of 26 clinic employees aged 25-46 (median 30.5) years who received a ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime followed by a BNT162b2 boost after an 8-week interval. Serological data were compared to a cohort which received homologous BNT162b2 vaccination with a 3-week interval (14 individuals aged 25-65, median 42). FINDINGS: Self-reported solicited symptoms after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime were in line with previous reports and more severe than after the BNT162b2 boost. Antibody titres increased significantly over time resulting in strong neutralization titres two weeks after the BNT162b2 boost and subsequently slightly decreased over the course of 17 weeks. At the latest time point measured, all analysed sera retained neutralizing activity against the currently dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. Two weeks post boost, neutralizing activity against the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and immune-evading Beta (B.1.351) variant was 4-fold higher than in individuals receiving homologous BNT162b2 vaccination. No difference was observed in neutralization of Kappa (B.1.617.1). In addition, heterologous vaccination induced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides of all analysed variants; Wuhan-Hu-1, Alpha, Beta, Gamma (P.1), and Delta. INTERPRETATION: In conclusion, heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination is not associated with serious adverse events and induces potent humoral and cellular immune responses. The Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Kappa variants of spike are potently neutralized by sera from all participants and reactive T cells recognize spike peptides of all tested variants. These results suggest that this heterologous vaccination regimen is at least as immunogenic and protective as homologous vaccinations and also offers protection against current variants of concern.

Even if the disease manifests fever-like symptoms mostly, the disease may progress to the pulmonary-hyper inflammatory phase, with severe pneumonia, hypoxia and subsequent multiple organ infection. This subsequently creates a huge burden to the health care systems across the globe for an immediate arrangement of ventilator facilities, oxygen supply and advanced health care. We evaluated the pathological similarity of COVID-19 with other airway obstructive disorders such as COPD and asthma and found typical mucus hypersecretion and mucus plugging in COVID-19 subjects. From several bronchoscopy and clinical autopsy carried out in COVID 19 patients, the overexpression of mucin gene was evident which play a significant role in mucus hypersecretion and accumulation, leading to airway obstruction and further to respiratory distress. In the present work, we highlight the need for intense research inputs to elucidate the exact role the mucus plays in worsening COVID-19 symptoms. This will further help to find a proper approach to quantify the airway mucus plugging in each patient and to develop an appropriate therapy either to inhibit mucus secretion or to improve mucus clearance through well-designed clinical trials.","output":"Mucus targeting as a plausible approach to improve lung function in covid-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a common and life-threatening complication in sepsis.

A confirmed case was a probable case with serum positivity of measles-specific IgM. We conducted a neighborhood- and age-matched case-control study to identified exposure factors, and used conditional logistic regression to analyze the data. We estimated vaccine effectiveness and vaccination coverage. RESULTS: We identified 81 cases (75 probable, 6 confirmed); 4 patients (4.9%) died.

However, safeguarding academic integrity is of particular importance for high-stakes medical exams. We utilised remote proctoring to administer safely and reliably a proficiency-test for admission to the Advanced Master of General Practice (AMGP). We compared exam results of the remote proctored exam group to those of the on-site proctored exam group. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was adopted with candidates applying for admission to the AMGP. We developed and applied a proctoring software operating on three levels to register suspicious events: recording actions, analysing behaviour, and live supervision. We performed a Mann-Whitney U test to compare exam results from the remote proctored to the on-site proctored group. To get more insight into candidates perceptions about proctoring, a post-test questionnaire was administered. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to explore quantitative data, while qualitative data were thematically analysed. RESULTS: In total, 472 (79%) candidates took the proficiency-test using the proctoring software, while 121 (20%) were on-site with live supervision. The results indicated that the proctoring type does not influence exam results. Out of 472 candidates, 304 filled in the post-test questionnaire. Two factors were extracted from the analysis and identified as candidates appreciation of proctoring and as emotional distress because of proctoring. Four themes were identified in the thematic analysis providing more insight on candidates emotional well-being. CONCLUSIONS: A comparison of exam results revealed that remote proctoring could be a viable solution for administering high-stakes medical exams. With regards to candidates educational experience, remote proctoring was met with mixed feelings.

Besides, in order to take the governments control and peoples awareness into consideration, we change our e-ISHR model into a 3-staged model which effectively shows the impact of these factors on the spread of the disease. By using this e-ISHR model, we fit and predict the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and China except Hubei. We also change some of parameters in our model.

Although the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not entirely understood, there is emerging evidence that it causes a severe systemic inflammatory response associated with vascular alterations that could be of special interest considering some physiological changes in pregnancy. Additionally, these alterations may affect the physiology of the placenta and are associated with pregnancy complications and abnormal histologic findings.

In latently infected resting CD4(+) T cells HIV\\\\1 transcription seems to be repressed by deacetylation events mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Upon reactivation of HIV\\\\1 from latency, HDACs are displaced in response to the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) by NF\\\\B or the viral transcriptional activator Tat and result in multiple acetylation events. Following chromatin remodeling of the viral promoter region, transcription is initiated and leads to the formation of the TAR element. The complex of Tat with p\\\\TEFb then binds the loop structures of TAR RNA thereby positioning CDK9 to phosphorylate the cellular RNA polymerase II. The Tat\\\\TAR\\\\dependent phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II plays an important role in transcriptional elongation as well as in other post\\\\transcriptional events. As such, targeting of Tat protein (and/or cellular cofactors) provide an interesting perspective for therapeutic intervention in the HIV replicative cycle and may afford lifetime control of the HIV infection. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study aimed to evaluate the presence of cardiac involvement in patients recovering from Delta Variant of COVID-19 based on multi-parametric cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively assessed patients recovering from Delta Variant of COVID-19 using multi-parametric cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between June 2021 and July 2021. Comparison was made with 25 healthy controls. Forty-four patients (median age 51 years, 28 women) recovering from Delta Variant were recruited and had a median time of 35 days between diagnosis and cardiac MRI. There were no patients with chest pain (0/44, 0%) and high sensitivity cardiac troponin T troponin elevation (median levels 2.20 pg/mL, IQR levels 0.85-4.40 pg/mL). Regarding the cardiac imaging findings, a total of 14 (32%) patients presented cardiac tissue feature abnormalities, and a total of 9 (20%) patients had a myocarditis-like injury based on cardiac MRI 2018 Lake Louise criteria. When we further assessed the T1 and T2 mapping values for of patients' individual, abnormal raised global native T1, T2, and extracellular volume were seen in 6 (14%), 6 (14%), and 4 (9%) patients, respectively. Comparing with controls, the patients had lower LV global longitudinal strain and (-22.2  2.8% vs. -24.6  2.0%, P < 0.001) and global circumferential strain (-20.7  6.8% vs. -24.3  2.9%, P = 0.014), but higher global native T1 (1318.8  55.5 ms vs. 1282.9  38.1 ms, P = 0.006). Four (9%) patients presented myocardial late gadolinium enhancement with subepicardial pattern mostly common seen, and two (5%) patients presented pericardial enhancement. CONCLUSIONS: The cardiac MRI could detect subclinical functional and myocardial tissue characteristic abnormalities in individuals who were recovering from Delta Variant without cardiac-related clinical findings.

Our aim was to find out the concerns of HCPs working in non-COVID areas. Subjects and Methods: After obtaining institutional ethics approval, a descriptive cross-sectional study was planned. An online Google-based questionnaire was rolled out to all doctors through various social media platforms who were dealing with COVID-negative patients. Results: We received a total of 110 responses. 84.5% of participants were concerned about the risk of infection to self and family, 67.3% were concerned by the disruption of their daily activities. 56.4% of HCPs were disturbed by the lack of any concrete protocol for patient management. Less staff availability, delay in discharging duties toward their patients, and increased workload were other concerns. More than half of the doctors received N-95 masks whenever required and were trained in donning and doffing of Personal protective equipment.

Although it is now well established that leukocyte extravasation elicits the inflammation typically associated with FIP lesions, relatively few studies have aimed at elucidating this key pathogenic event. The upregulation of adhesion molecules on the endothelium is a prerequisite for stable leukocyte-endothelial cell (EC) adhesion that necessarily precedes leukocyte diapedesis. Therefore, the present work focused on the expression of the EC adhesion molecules and possible triggers of EC activation during the development of FIP. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the endothelial expression of P-selectin, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) was elevated in veins close to granulomatous infiltrates in the renal cortex of FIP patients compared to non-infiltrated regions and specimens from healthy cats. Next, we showed that feline venous ECs become activated when exposed to supernatant from feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV)-infected monocytes, as indicated by increased adhesion molecule expression. Active viral replication seemed to be required to induce the EC-stimulating activity in monocytes. Finally, adhesion assays revealed an increased adhesion of naive monocytes to ECs treated with supernatant from FIPV-infected monocytes. Taken together, our results strongly indicate that FIPV activates ECs to increase monocyte adhesion by an indirect route, in which proinflammatory factors released from virus-infected monocytes act as key intermediates.","output":"Upregulation of endothelial cell adhesion molecules characterizes veins close to granulomatous infiltrates in the renal cortex of cats with feline infectious peritonitis and is indirectly triggered by feline infectious peritonitis virus-infected monocytes in vitro."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn the attention of many researchers to the interaction between pathogen and host genomes. Over the last two years, numerous studies have been conducted to identify the genetic risk factors that predict COVID-19 severity and outcome. However, such an analysis might be complicated in cohorts of limited size and/or in case of limited breadth of genome coverage. In this work, we tried to circumvent these challenges by searching for candidate genes and genetic variants associated with a variety of quantitative and binary traits in a cohort of 840 COVID-19 patients from Russia. While we found no gene- or pathway-level associations with the disease severity and outcome, we discovered eleven independent candidate loci associated with quantitative traits in COVID-19 patients. Out of these, the most significant associations correspond to rs1651553 in MYH14 p = 1.4  10(?7)), rs11243705 in SETX (p = 8.2  10(?6)), and rs16885 in ATXN1 (p = 1.3  10(?5)).

Moreover, we show that a risk score based on these variants can predict the severity and outcome of hospitalization in our cohort of patients. Given these findings, we believe that our work may serve as proof-of-concept study demonstrating the utility of quantitative traits and extensive phenotyping for identification of genetic risk factors of severe COVID-19.","output":"Identification of Genetic Risk Factors of Severe COVID-19 Using Extensive Phenotypic Data: A Proof-of-Concept Study in a Cohort of Russian Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Higher education has a number of key roles to play in accelerating progress toward sustainability goals.

This data-driven process allowed the identification of required soft and hard skills contained in job descriptions. However, it was found that some important concepts of green supply chain management, such as repair and refurbishment, were only marginally mentioned in the job advertisements. Therefore, in addition to labor market expectations, a business process model from relevant green supply chain management literature was developed to complement the required competences.

Methods: Twenty-five children with spastic cerebral palsy were enrolled in a single-blind and randomized controlled trial. The control group received 20 sessions of 5-Hz rTMS over the affected hemisphere with 1,000 pulses. The experimental group was given wrist-ankle acupuncture on the basis of the control group. Gross motor function measure (GMFM-66), muscle tension, and electrophysiological parameters of the two groups were assessed at baseline and after intervention. Results: After treatment, the GMFM-66 scores in the same groups were significantly improved (p < 0.001). Besides, the R-value of soleus, gastrocnemius, and hamstring muscle decreased (p < 0.05), and the results showed a trend of shortening MEP latency, increasing amplitude and duration (p < 0.05). Compared to the controlled group, the experimental group displayed more excellent changes in the GMFM-66 scores and motor evoked potential (MEP) latency. The statistical results showed that the increase of GMFM-66 score and the shortening of MEP latency in the experimental group were greater than that in the control group (p < 0.05). However, no significant differences were found in the assessment of muscle tension, amplitude, and duration of MEPs between two groups (p > 0.05).

A major concern is reduced vaccine-induced immune protection to emerging variants, and therefore booster vaccinations to broaden and strengthen the immune response might be required. Currently, all registered COVID-19 vaccines and the majority of COVID-19 vaccines in development are intramuscularly administered, targeting the induction of systemic immunity. Intranasal vaccines have the capacity to induce local mucosal immunity as well, thereby targeting the primary route of viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 with the potential of blocking transmission. Furthermore, intranasal vaccines offer greater practicality in terms of cost and ease of administration. Currently, only eight out of 112 vaccines in clinical development are administered intranasally. We developed an intranasal COVID-19 subunit vaccine, based on a recombinant, six proline stabilized, D614G spike protein (mC-Spike) of SARS-CoV-2 linked via the LPS-binding peptide sequence mCramp (mC) to Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) from Neisseria meningitidis. The spike protein was produced in CHO cells and after linking to the OMVs, the OMV-mC-Spike vaccine was administered to mice and Syrian hamsters via intranasal or intramuscular prime-boost vaccinations. In all animals that received OMV-mC-Spike, serum neutralizing antibodies were induced upon vaccination. Importantly, high levels of spike-binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) and A (IgA) antibodies in the nose and lungs were only detected in intranasally vaccinated animals, whereas intramuscular vaccination only induced an IgG response in the serum. Two weeks after their second vaccination hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs compared to the control groups vaccinated with OMV or spike alone. Histopathology showed no lesions in lungs seven days after challenge in OMV-mC-Spike vaccinated hamsters, whereas the control groups did show pathological lesions in the lung. The OMV-mC-Spike candidate vaccine data are very promising and support further development of this novel non-replicating, needle-free, subunit vaccine concept for clinical testing.","output":"An Intranasal OMV-based vaccine induces high mucosal and systemic protecting immunity against a SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mirrors are used in optical sensors and measurement setups.

Here, we investigated the roles of angulin-1 and tricellulin in tTJ formation in MDCK II cells by genome editing. Angulin-1-deficient cells lost the plasma membrane contact at TCs with impaired epithelial barrier function. The C terminus of angulin-1 bound to the TJ scaffold protein ZO-1, and disruption of their interaction influenced the localization of claudins at TCs, but not the tricellular sealing. Strikingly, the plasma membrane contact at TCs was formed in tricellulin- or claudin-deficient cells.

Thus, there is an urgent need to identify early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to determine the risk of developing serious illness. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 114 patients with COVID-19 at the Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan based on their clinical and laboratory data. Patients were categorized into severe and mild to moderate disease groups. We analyzed the potential of serological inflammation indicators in predicting the severity of COVID-19 in patients using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic curves, and nomogram analysis. The Spearman method was used to understand the correlation between the serological biomarkers and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS: Patients with severe disease had reduced neutrophils and lymphocytes; severe coagulation dysfunction; altered content of biochemical factors (such as urea, lactate dehydrogenase); elevated high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, neutrophil-lymphocyte, platelet-lymphocyte, and derived neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios, high sensitivity C-reactive protein-prealbumin ratio (HsCPAR), systemic immune-inflammation index, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein-albumin ratio (HsCAR); and low lymphocyte-monocyte ratio, prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and albumin-to-fibrinogen ratio. PNI, HsCAR, and HsCPAR correlated with the risk of severe disease. The nomogram combining the three parameters showed good discrimination with a C-index of 0.873 and reliable calibration. Moreover, HsCAR and HsCPAR correlated with duration of hospital stay.

The decision to choose specific equipment should be based on the protection factors and also on the overall analysis of given conditions. International scientific databases, such as Web of Science, PubMed and MedLine, were searched on May 5, 2020, with the following key words: COVID-19, respiratory protection, surgical masks, filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and disposable respirators. The differences between various respiratory protective equipment, i.e., surgical masks, respirators such as FFRs, elastomeric half-facepiece respirators, elastomeric full-facepiece respirators and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), were compared. Reusable elastomeric respirators (RERs) may provide a better adaptation to the face and may be more stable when used by healthcare providers (HCPs). Protection factors were found to be higher in FFRs compared to surgical masks. While FFRs provide a one-tenth decrease in the inhaled aerosol concentration, PAPRs diminish the inhaled aerosol up to one-twenty-fifth. Even with some full-face PAPRs and helmets, the protection factor assigned by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration can reach a value up to 1000. For HCPs, the evidence shown in this article provides an additional support for the utilization of RERs. Such equipment might be less prone to leakages, can provide a better fit, and indicates a better stability compared to disposable FFRs (N95 and similar).

Furthermore, we identified, for the first time, inhibitors of PL(pro)CoV2 showing potency in the nanomolar range.

Here, we show that the TYMV 98K replication protein can counteract this degradation process thanks to its proteinase domain. In-vitro assays revealed that the recombinant proteinase domain is a functional ovarian tumour (OTU)-like deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB), as is the 98K produced during viral infection.

The purpose of the present study is to compare interviewee perceptions regarding in-person vs virtual interview formats from that application cycle at a single institution. METHODS: A 17-question survey was sent to all 26 interviewees (13 in-person and 13 virtual) shortly after the rank-list submission deadline. Interviewees were asked to what extent they agreed or disagreed with several statements, ranging from whether the interview was enjoyable to whether interviewees felt they were being adequately evaluated. In this Likert scale rating system, strongly agree was given 5 points (more positive outlook), and strongly disagree was given 1 point (more negative outlook). Chi-square analyses were performed. RESULTS: Seventeen interviewees (8 in-person and 9 virtual) returned questionnaires (response rate: 65%). Both in-person and virtual interview ratings were similar when averaged across all statements (4.5 vs 4.4, P = .67).

Several pharmacological agents are available to lower fracture risk, either by reducing bone resorption or by stimulating bone formation. Bisphosphonates are the most widely used anti-resorptives, reducing bone turnover markers to low premenopausal concentrations and reducing fracture rates (vertebral by 50-70%, non-vertebral by 20-30%, and hip by ~40%). Bisphosphonates bind avidly to bone mineral and have an offset of effect measured in months to years. Long term, continuous use of oral bisphosphonates is usually interspersed with drug holidays of 1-2 years, to minimise the risk of atypical femoral fractures. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody against RANKL that potently inhibits osteoclast development and activity. Denosumab is administered by subcutaneous injection every 6 months. Anti-fracture effects of denosumab are similar to those of the bisphosphonates, but there is a pronounced loss of anti-resorptive effect from 7 months after the last injection, which can result in clusters of rebound vertebral fractures. Two classes of anabolic drugs are now available to stimulate bone formation. Teriparatide and abaloparatide both target the parathyroid hormone-1 receptor, and are given by daily subcutaneous injection for up to 2 years. Romosozumab is an anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody that stimulates bone formation and inhibits resorption. Romosozumab is given as monthly subcutaneous injections for 1 year. Head-to-head studies suggest that anabolic agents have greater anti-fracture efficacy and produce larger increases in bone density than anti-resorptive drugs. The effects of anabolic agents are transient, so transition to anti-resorptive drugs is required.

Dexamethasone has been shown to be effective in reducing mortality. It has been hypothesized that combination of these two drugs can improve mortality. We evaluated the effect of combination on mortality of COVID-19 patients requiring O(2) therapy. METHODS: A prospective quasi-experimental study, including two independent, sequential controlled cohorts, one received remdesivir-dexamethasone and the other dexamethasone alone, was designed. All COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental O(2) therapy were enrolled consecutively. The sample size to power mortality was a priori calculated. The primary endpoints were 30-day mortality and viral clearance differences. Secondary endpoints were differences in hospitalization times, improvement in respiratory failure (PO(2)/FiO(2)) and inflammatory indices (fibrinogen, CRP, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, D-Dimer). Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test were used to evaluate significant differences in mortality between groups. RESULTS: 151 COVID-19 patients were enrolled (remdesivir/dexamethasone group, 76 and dexamethasone alone,75). No differences in demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were observed between the two groups at baseline. Faster viral clearance occurred in the remdesivir/dexamethasone group compared to dexamethasone alone (median 6 vs 16 days; p<0.001). 30-days mortality in the remdesivir/dexamethasone group was 1.3%, while in dexamethasone alone was 16% (p<0.005). In the remdesivir/dexamethasone group compared to dexamethasone alone there was a reduction in hospitalization days (p<0.0001) and a faster improvement in both respiratory function and inflammatory markers.

Few studies have comparatively characterized these two conditions in relation to the presence of comorbidities, pre-hospitalization treatments, symptoms at admission, and laboratory variables associated with COVID-19 severity. Our study generated several interesting findings. Patients with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia had significantly less comorbidities, increased levels of inflammatory markers, and indicators of multi-organ injury than those with pre-existing diabetes, while islet autoimmunity prevalence and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were similar. COVID-associated hyperglycaemia was associated with a poorer clinical outcome and a longer viral clearance time compared to pre-existing diabetes. This strongly supports the need to screen all COVID-19 patients for hyperglycaemia at the time of admission despite a mute personal or family history of diabetes and to treat them in order to reach and maintain good glycemic control during hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia. ABSTRACT: Aim. The aim of the current study was to compare clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and major outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia or pre-existing diabetes. Methods. A cohort of 176 adult patients with a diagnosis of pre-existing diabetes (n = 112) or COVID-associated hyperglycaemia (n = 55) was studied. Results. Patients with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia had lower BMI, significantly less comorbidities, and higher levels of inflammatory markers and indicators of multi-organ injury than those with pre-existing diabetes. No differences between pre-existing diabetes and COVID-associated hyperglycaemia were evident for symptoms at admission, the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2, or autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase or interferon alpha-4. COVID-associated hyperglycaemia was independently associated with the risk of adverse clinical outcome, which was defined as ICU admission or death (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.34C3.31; p = 0.001), even after adjustment for age, sex, and other selected variables associated with COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, at the same time, we documented a negative association (HR 0.661, 95% CI 0.43C1.02; p = 0.063) between COVID-associated hyperglycaemia to swab negativization. Conclusions.

However, due to the great variability in published results regarding COVID-19-induced chemosensory impairments and their follow-up, prognosis for chemosensory functions in patients with such complaints remains unclear. ObjectiveTo describe the various chemosensory alterations associated with COVID-19 and their prevalence and evolution at 3 to 7 months after infection. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA follow-up study of 704 health care workers with a RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 28/2/2020 and 14/6/2020 was conducted 3 to 7 months after onset of symptoms. Data were collected with an online questionnaire. Participant had to be []18 years old without respiratory illness in the 2 weeks prior to questionnaire completion. Main outcomes and measuresOutcomes included differences in reported chemosensory self-assessment of olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal functions across time points and Chemosensory Perception Test scores from an easy-to-use at-home self-administered chemosensory test. ResultsAmong the 704 health care worker participants, 593 (84.2%) were women, the mean (SD) age was 42 (12) years and the questionnaire was answered on average 4.8 (0.8) months after COVID-19. During COVID-19, a decrease in olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal sensitivities were reported by 81.3%, 81.5% and 48.0% respectively. Three to seven months later, reduced sensitivity was still reported by 52.0%, 41.9% and 23.3% respectively. Chemosensory Perception Test scores indicate that 19.5% of participants had objective olfactory impairment. Conclusions and relevanceA significant proportion of COVID-19 cases have persistent chemosensory impairments at 3 to 7 months after their infection but the majority of those who had completely lost their olfactory, gustatory and trigeminal sensitivity have improved.

Comparison to previous Spike-antibody structures explains how Omicron escapes these therapeutics. Secondly, we report structures of Omicron, Delta and WT Spikes bound to a patient-derived Fab antibody fragment (510A5), which provides direct evidence where antibody binding was greatly attenuated by the Omicron mutations, freeing Spike to bind ACE2. Together with biochemical binding and 510A5 neutralization assays, our work establishes principles of binding required for neutralization and clearly illustrates how the mutations lead to antibody evasion, yet retain strong ACE2 interactions.

CL is commonly diagnosed by directly detecting the parasites or their DNA in tissue samples. New diagnostic methodologies target specific proteins (biomarkers) secreted by the parasite during the infection process. However, specific bioreceptors for the in vivo or in vitro detection of these novel biomarkers are rather limited in terms of sensitivity and specificity. For this reason, we here introduce three novel peptides as bioreceptors for the highly sensitive and selective identification of acid phosphatase (sAP) and proteophosphoglycan (PPG), which have a crucial role in leishmaniasis infection. These high-affinity peptides have been designed from the conservative domains of the lectin family, holding the ability to interact with the biological target and produce the same effect than the original protein. The synthetic peptides have been characterized and the affinity and kinetic constants for their interaction with the targets (sAP and PPG) have been determined by a surface plasmon resonance biosensor. Values obtained for K(D) are in the nanomolar range, which is comparable to high-affinity antibodies, with the additional advantage of a high biochemical stability and simpler production. Pep2854 exhibited a high affinity for sAP (K(D) = 1.48 nM) while Pep2856 had a good affinity for PPG (K(D) 1.76 nM).

Accuracy in assigning the cause of death is of vital importance to define the impact of the agent, monitor its evolution, and compare its threat with those of other agents. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been widespread reporting of aggregate death data with little attention paid to the accuracy of the assignment of causation. We aimed to analyse public authorities understanding of the assignment of cause of deaths during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the UK by accessing Freedom of Information requests posed in three periods in 2020-21. By public authorities, we mean NHS Health Trusts, laboratories, and government agencies such as Public Health England and the Department of Health and Social Care. We searched WhatDoTheyKnow using the terms \\"covid and death\\". We excluded those requests to bodies that cannot provide an answer (e.g. Councils) and those dealing with the effects of vaccines. We grouped questions into themes addressing the definitions and causes of death relevant to the pandemic. We looked at the responses to the questions of the definition of cause of death, the accuracy of the attribution, the role of other pre-existing pathologies and how these were reported and quantified. We found 800 requests from over 90 individuals. There was no consistency in the definition of cause of death or contributory cause of death across national bodies and in different bodies within the same nation. Nursing home providers, as well as medical practitioners, can assign a cause of death according to the Care Quality Commission. Post-mortem examinations were uncommon, the ONS did not incorporate their results in the summary of deaths by cause during the pandemic period. The meaning of the words \\"test\\" or \\"swab\\" was never clarified by any of the respondents. In care homes in England 1,304 out of 17,264 COVID-19 (7.6%, range 0% to 63%) mentioned COVID-19 in the absence of contributory or other factors in the death certificate, making it impossible to ascertain a chain of causality. The inconsistencies already noted hinder the ascertainment of the role of each factor leading to death and the quantification of the importance of infection. Some responses indicate that SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals or those whose death was not caused by COVID-19 were classified as \\"COVID-19 deaths\\". We found 14 different ways of attributing the causes of death mentioned by respondents. The overall lack of consistency has confused the public and likely led to erroneous conclusions. We are unable to separate the effects on deaths of SARS-CoV-2 from those of human interventions. A coherent process based on consistent definitions across the devolved nations is required. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy of causation in pandemics a subset of deaths should be verified using autopsies with full medical documentation.","output":"Understanding Definitions and Reporting of Deaths Attributed to COVID-19 in the UK - Evidence from FOI Requests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An immediate political geographic consequence of the global pandemic is the rapid imposition of national and subnational borders, particularly where cross-boundary openness and integration was prevalent.

Methods: From 24 January to 31 July 2020, the following information was collected from individuals with positive SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2\\\\specific immunofluorescence antibody tests: history of contact with COVID\\\\19 cases; recent travel; symptoms consistent with COVID\\\\19; and SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 nucleic acid testing (NAT) results. Individuals were classified as confirmed or probable by CDNA criteria or additionally as possible (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2\\\\specific IgG positive with compatible symptoms or epidemiologic risk) or indeterminate (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2\\\\specific IgA/IgM positive only) cases. Results: A total of 10,595 individuals were tested in the six\\\\month period. Of these, 9.8% (1,037) individuals had positive SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2\\\\specific serology of which 566 (53.6%) were NAT\\\\confirmed COVID\\\\19 cases and 286 (27.6%) were part of a cruise ship outbreak sero\\\\survey.

These challenges have been enormous and debilitating, as the infrastructure of many countries, including developing ones, had little or no resources to deal with the crisis. Even in developed countries, such as Italy, health systems have been so inundated by cases that health care facilities became oversaturated and could not accommodate the unexpected influx of patients to be tested. Initially, resources were focused on testing to identify those who were infected. When it became clear that the virus mainly attacks the lungs by causing parenchymal changes in the form of multifocal pneumonia of different levels of severity, imaging became paramount in the assessment of disease severity, progression, and even response to treatment. As a result, there was a need to establish protocols for imaging of the lungs in these patients. In North America, the focus was on chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) as these are widely available and accessible at most health facilities. However, in Europe and China, this was not the case, and a cost-effective and relatively fast imaging modality was needed to scan a large number of sick patients promptly. Hence, ultrasound (US) found its way into the hands of Chinese and European physicians and has since become an important imaging modality in those locations. US is a highly versatile, portable, and inexpensive imaging modality that has application across a broad spectrum of conditions and, in this way, is ideally suited to assess the lungs of COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). This bedside test can be done with little to no movement of the patients from the unit that keeps them in their isolated rooms, thereby limiting further exposure to other health personnel. This article presents a basic introduction to COVID-19 and the use of the US for lung imaging. It further provides a high-level overview of the existing US technologies that are driving development in current and potential future US imaging systems for lung, with a specific emphasis on portable and 3-D systems.","output":"Current Ultrasound Technologies and Instrumentation in the Assessment and Monitoring of COVID-19 Positive Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) pandemic impacts the health of women at reproductive age in different ways, starting from pregnancy planning to post-delivery.

Machine learning was adept in discovering intricate structures from CT images and achieved expert-level performance in medical image analysis. METHODS: An integrated machine learning framework on chest CT images for differentiating COVID-19 from general pneumonia (GP) was developed and validated. Seventy-three confirmed COVID-19 cases were consecutively enrolled together with 27 confirmed general pneumonia patients from Ruian Peoples Hospital, from January 2020 to March 2020. To accurately classify COVID-19, region of interest (ROI) delineation was implemented based on ground-glass opacities (GGOs) before feature extraction. Then, 34 statistical texture features of COVID-19 and GP ROI images were extracted, including 13 gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features, 15 gray-level-gradient co-occurrence matrix (GLGCM) features and 6 histogram features. High-dimensional features impact the classification performance. Thus, ReliefF algorithm was leveraged to select features. The relevance of each feature was the average weights calculated by ReliefF in n times. Features with relevance larger than the empirically set threshold T were selected. After feature selection, the optimal feature set along with 4 other selected feature combinations for comparison were applied to the ensemble of bagged tree (EBT) and four other machine learning classifiers including support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), and K-nearest neighbor with Minkowski distance equal weight (KNN) using tenfold cross-validation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The classification accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) of our proposed method yield 94.16%, 88.62% and 100.00%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.99. The experimental results indicate that the EBT algorithm with statistical textural features based on GGOs for differentiating COVID-19 from general pneumonia achieved high transferability, efficiency, specificity, sensitivity, and impressive accuracy, which is beneficial for inexperienced doctors to more accurately diagnose COVID-19 and essential for controlling the spread of the disease.","output":"Differentiating novel coronavirus pneumonia from general pneumonia based on machine learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asymmetrically substituted 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin derivatives such as 5-(4-aminophenyl)10,15,20-triphenylporphine, 5-[4-(tyrosinylamino)phenyl]-10,15,20-triphenylporphine and 5-{4-[(N-tert-butoxycarbonyltyrosinyl)amino]phenyl}-10,15,20-triphenylporphine were synthesized.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to rapidly investigate the clinical characteristics, population structure and mechanisms of resistance of CPE causing secondary infections in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively identified CPE clinical isolates collected from patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and April 2020 at our medical centre in New York City. Available isolates underwent nanopore sequencing for rapid genotyping, antibiotic resistance gene detection and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: We identified 31 CPE isolates from 13 patients, including 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 4 Enterobacter cloacae complex isolates. Most patients (11/13) had a positive respiratory culture and 7/13 developed bacteraemia; treatment failure was common. Twenty isolates were available for WGS. Most K. pneumoniae (16/17) belonged to ST258 and encoded KPC (15 KPC-2; 1 KPC-3); one ST70 isolate encoded KPC-2. E. cloacae isolates belonged to ST270 and encoded NDM-1. Nanopore sequencing enabled identification of at least four distinct ST258 lineages in COVID-19 patients, which were validated by Illumina sequencing data. CONCLUSIONS: While CPE prevalence has declined substantially in New York City in recent years, increased detection in patients with COVID-19 may signal a re-emergence of these highly resistant pathogens in the wake of the global pandemic.

Several population projections were prepared for the period 2019C41. We formulated three scenarios in which the pandemic has a short-lived impact of 2C3 years, a moderate impact lasting about 5 years, or a severe impact lasting up to a decade. We also created two hypothetical scenarios, one of which illustrates Australias demographic future in the absence of a pandemic for comparative purposes, and another which demonstrates the demographic consequences if Australia had experienced excess mortality equivalent to that recorded in the first half of 2020 in England & Wales. Our projections show that the pandemic will probably have little impact on numerical population ageing but a moderate effect on structural ageing. Had Australia experienced the high mortality observed in England & Wales there would have been 19,400 excess deaths. We caution that considerable uncertainty surrounds the future trajectory of COVID-19 and therefore the demographic responses to it.

Sensitivity and specificity of self-testing were compared to qRT-PCR with a Ct-value below the Ct value cut-off. Determinants independently associated with a false-negative self-test result were determined. Results: A total of 3,215 participants were included (BD RDT n=1604; Roche RDT n=1611).

Thus, it is desirable to learn a robust and transferable representation in an unsupervised manner to benefit tasks that lack labeled data. Unlike natural images, medical images have their own domain prior; e.g., we observe that many pulmonary diseases, such as the COVID-19, manifest as changes in the lung tissue texture rather than the anatomical structure. Therefore, we hypothesize that studying only the texture without the influence of structure variations would be advantageous for downstream prognostic and predictive modeling tasks. In this paper, we propose a generative framework, the Lung Swapping Autoencoder (LSAE), that learns factorized representations of a CXR to disentangle the texture factor from the structure factor. Specifically, by adversarial training, the LSAE is optimized to generate a hybrid image that preserves the lung shape in one image but inherits the lung texture of another. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the disentangled texture representation, we evaluate the texture encoder $Enc^t$ in LSAE on ChestX-ray14 (N=112,120), and our own multi-institutional COVID-19 outcome prediction dataset, COVOC (N=340 (Subset-1) + 53 (Subset-2)). On both datasets, we reach or surpass the state-of-the-art by finetuning $Enc^t$ in LSAE that is 77% smaller than a baseline Inception v3. Additionally, in semi-and-self supervised settings with a similar model budget, $Enc^t$ in LSAE is also competitive with the state-of-the-art MoCo.

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of clinical and subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD), as assessed by coronary artery calcium score (CAC), in a large, unselected population of hospitalized COVID-19 patients undergoing non-gated chest computed tomography (CT) for clinical practice. METHODS: SARS-CoV 2 positive patients from the multicenter (16 Italian hospitals), retrospective observational SCORE COVID-19 (calcium score for COVID-19 Risk Evaluation) registry were stratified in three groups: (a) \\"clinical CAD\\" (prior revascularization history), (b) \\"subclinical CAD\\" (CAC >0), (c) \\"No CAD\\" (CAC = 0). Primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality and the secondary endpoint was a composite of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident (MI/CVA). RESULTS: Amongst 1625 patients (male 67.2%, median age 69 [interquartile range 58-77] years), 31%, 57.8% and 11.1% had no, subclinical and clinical CAD, respectively. Increasing rates of in-hospital mortality (11.3% vs. 27.3% vs. 39.8%, p < 0.001) and MI/CVA events (2.3% vs. 3.8% vs. 11.9%, p < 0.001) were observed for patients with no CAD vs. subclinical CAD vs clinical CAD, respectively. The association with in-hospital mortality was independent of in-study outcome predictors (age, peripheral artery disease, active cancer, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, LDH, aerated lung volume): subclinical CAD vs. No CAD: adjusted hazard ratio (adj-HR) 2.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-7.17, p=0.025); clinical CAD vs. No CAD: adj-HR 3.74 (95% CI 1.21-11.60, p=0.022). Among patients with subclinical CAD, increasing CAC burden was associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality (20.5% vs. 27.9% vs. 38.7% for patients with CAC score thresholds&#8804;100, 101-400 and > 400, respectively, p < 0.001). The adj-HR per 50 points increase in CAC score 1.007 (95%CI 1.001-1.013, p=0.016). Cardiovascular risk factors were not independent predictors of in-hospital mortality when CAD presence and extent were taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: The presence and extent of CAD are associated with in-hospital mortality and MI/CVA among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 disease and they appear to be a better prognostic gauge as compared to a clinical cardiovascular risk assessment.","output":"Impact of clinical and subclinical coronary artery disease as assessed by coronary artery calcium in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the pandemic context several specificities should be underlined for the case of vaccine trials, in addition to all ethical concerns raised for research related to pharmacological treatments which are also valid for vaccine research.

Methods The study was conducted between February 10 and 15, 2020, in a non-probabilistic way. The survey included questions regarding the risk of exposure, sociodemographics, perceived stress [10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)], resilience [10-item ConnorCDavidson Psychological Resilience (CD-RISC-10)], social support [Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)], and psychological distress [12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12)]. We applied the PROCESS macro for SPSS to test the hypotheses that resilience and social support moderated the stress response. In addition, a simple slope analysis was conducted when the interaction effect was statistically significant. Results Some 33.6% of participants suffered from psychological distress (GHQ-12  12). Perceived stress was positively related to psychological distress (r = 0.42, p < 0.001). In addition, resilience (R2 = 0.03, p for interaction < 0.001) and social support (R2 = 0.01, p for interaction <0.01) moderated the stress response. The impact of perceived stress on psychological distress was attenuated when subjects who were resilient (high  = 0.15, p < 0.001;low  = 0.36, p < 0.001), and perceived stress had less impact on psychological distress when social support was high ( = 0.24, p < 0.001) rather than low ( = 0.34, p < 0.001). Limitations The cross-sectional design led to a lack of causal relationships between variables. Conclusions Our data showed that resilience and social support moderated the stress response among HCWs in the pandemic, suggesting that improving resilience and social support could be appropriate targets to improve HCWs' mental health in the pandemic.","output":"Perceived Stress and Psychological Impact Among Healthcare Workers at a Tertiaty Hospital in China During the COVID-19 Outbreak: The Moderating Role of Resilience and Social Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Hurricanes and flooding can interrupt health care utilization. Understanding the magnitude and duration of interruptions, as well as how they vary according to hazard exposure, race, and income, are important for identifying populations in need of greater retention in care. OBJECTIVE: To determine how the differential exposure to Hurricane Harvey in August 2017 is associated with changes in utilization of Veterans Health Administration health care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a retrospective cohort analysis of primary care practitioner (PCP) visits, emergency department visits, and inpatient admissions in the Veterans Health Administration among Texas veterans residing in counties impacted by Hurricane Harvey from 2016 to 2018. Data analysis was performed from September 2020 to May 2021. EXPOSURES: Residential flooding after Hurricane Harvey. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Interrupted time series analysis measured changes in health care utilization over time, stratified by residential flood exposure, race, and income. RESULTS: Of the 99 858 patients in the cohort, 89 931 (90.06%) were male, and their median (range) age was 58 (21 to 102) years. Compared with veterans in nonflooded areas, veterans living in flooded areas were more likely to be Black (24 715 veterans [33.80%] vs 4237 veterans [15.85%]) and low-income (14 895 veterans [20.37%] vs 4853 veterans [18.15%]). Rates of PCP visits decreased by 49.78% (95% CI, ?64.52% to ?35.15%) for veterans in flooded areas and by 45.89% (95% CI, ?61.93% to ?29.91%) for veterans in nonflooded areas and did not rebound until more than 8 weeks after the hurricane. Rates of PCP visits in flooded areas remained lower than expected for 11 weeks among White veterans (?6.99%; 95% CI, ?14.36% to 0.81%) and for 13 weeks among racial minority veterans (?7.22%; 95% CI, ?14.11% to 0.30%). Low-income veterans, regardless of flood status, experienced greater suppression of PCP visits in the 8 weeks following the hurricane (?13.72%; 95% CI, ?20.51% to ?6.68%) compared with their wealthier counterparts (?9.63%; 95% CI, ?16.74% to ?2.26%).

This paper reports a modification of the 3I tool for use in initial detection and management of patients under investigation for MERS. Following an assessment of epidemiologic risk factors, including travel to countries with current MERS transmission and contact with patients with confirmed MERS within 14 days, patients are risk stratified by type of exposure coupled with symptoms of fever and respiratory illness. If criteria are met, patients must be immediately placed into airborne infection isolation (or a private room until this type of isolation is available) and the emergency practitioner must alert the hospital infection prevention and control team and the local public health department.

To date, 530,000 people died of this disease worldwide. Presently, researchers/clinicians are adopting the drug repurposing strategy to combat this disease. It has also been observed that some repurposed anti-viral drugs may serve as potent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 Mpro, a key component of viral replication. Apart from these anti-viral drugs, recently dexamethasone (an important corticosteroid) is effectively used to treat COVID-19 patients. However, the mechanism behind the mode of its action is not so clear. Additionally, the effect of other well-known corticosteroids to control this disease by inhibiting the proteolytic activity of Mpro is ambiguous. In this study, we have adopted computational approaches to understand these aspects. Six well-known corticosteroids (cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, betamethasone and dexamethasone) and two repurposed drugs (darunavir and lopinavir) against COVID-19 were subjected for molecular docking studies. Two of them (betamethasone and dexamethasone) were selected by comparing their binding affinities with selected repurposed drugs toward Mpro. Betamethasone and dexamethasone interacted with both the catalytic residues of Mpro (His41 and Cys145). Molecular dynamics studies further revealed that these two Mpro-corticosteroid complexes are more stable, experience less conformational fluctuations and more compact than Mpro-darunavir/lopinavir complexes. These findings were additionally validated by MM-GBSA analysis. This study provides corroboration for execution of anti-COVID-19 activity of dexamethasone.

The GI inhibitors were found to be active in high titers against RNA and DNA viruses, resistant to proteolysis, glycolysis, lipid extraction and possessed differing mechanisms of action. The mouse intestinal inhibitor prevented virus attachment to cells, and neuramide acted at an early post-attachment stage of virus multiplication. The porcine mucosal inhibitor acted as late as 6 h after initiation of the multiplication cycle. These broadly active GI inhibitors differed from the previously described serum inhibitor (UTI) high density lipoproteins (HDL) and the nervous system (NS) inhibitor by being smaller (600400 kDa) and resistant to proteinase K, glycosidases and organic solvents. The mouse intestinal inhibitor acts similarly to UTI and NS inhibitor by preventing attachment of virus to the cells. In comparison, the neuramide and the porcine mucosal inhibitor, like HDL, acted after attachment to the target cells.

The most frequently tested Chinese patent medicine, Chinese herbal medicine injection or prescribed herbal decoction were: Lianhua Qingwen granule/capsule, Xuebijing injection and Maxing Shigan Tang. In terms of aggravation rate, pooled analyses showed that there had statistical differences between the intervention group and the comparator group (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.82, 6 RCTs;RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.64, 4 retrospective studies with control group), that is, CHM plus conventional western therapy appeared better than conventional western therapy in reducing aggravation rate. In addition, compared with conventional western therapy, CHM plus conventional western therapy had potential advantages in increasing the resolution rate and shortening the duration of fever, cough and fatigue, improving the negative conversion rate of nucleic acid test, and increasing the number of patients with inflammatory disappearance or shortening the time from receiving treatment to beginning of inflammation disappearance. For adverse events, pooled data showed that there was no statistical difference between the CHM and the control groups. Conclusion: Current low certainty evidence suggests that there may be a tendency that CHM plus conventional western therapy is superior to conventional western therapy alone. The use of CHM did not increase the risk of adverse events.","output":"Chinese herbal medicine used with or without conventional western therapy for COVID-19: An evidence review of clinical studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mental health issues are alarmingly on the rise among undergraduates, which have gradually become the focus of social attention.

To identify possible antibody binding sites not shielded by glycans, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of a 4.1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length, fully glycosylated and palmitoylated S proteins.

OBJECTIVE We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the safety and accuracy of percutaneous RTB for the diagnosis of malignancy, histologic tumour subtype, and grade. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies providing data on diagnostic accuracy and complications of percutaneous core biopsy (CB) or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of renal tumours. A meta-analysis was performed to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of malignancy. The Cohen kappa coefficient () was estimated for the analysis of histotype/grade concordance between diagnosis on RTB and surgical specimen. Risk of bias assessment was performed (QUADAS-2). EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS A total of 57 studies recruiting 5228 patients were included. The overall median diagnostic rate of RTB was 92%. The sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic CBs and FNAs were 99.1% and 99.7%, and 93.2% and 89.8%, respectively. A good ( = 0.683) and a fair ( = 0.34) agreement were observed between histologic subtype and Fuhrman grade on RTB and surgical specimen, respectively. A very low rate of Clavien  2 complications was reported. Study limitations included selection and differential-verification bias. CONCLUSIONS RTB is safe and has a high diagnostic yield in experienced centres. Both CB and FNA have good accuracy for the diagnosis of malignancy and histologic subtype, with better performance for CB. The accuracy for Fuhrman grade is fair. Overall, the quality of the evidence was moderate. Prospective cohort studies recruiting consecutive patients and using homogeneous reference standards are required. PATIENT SUMMARY We systematically reviewed the literature to assess the safety and diagnostic performance of renal tumour biopsy (RTB). The results suggest that RTB has good accuracy in diagnosing renal cancer and its subtypes, and it appears to be safe. However, the quality of evidence was moderate, and better quality studies are required to provide a more definitive answer.","output":"Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Accuracy of Percutaneous Renal Tumour Biopsy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can exponentially replicate a target DNA sequence, has formed the basis for the sensitive and direct examination of clinical samples for evidence of infection. During the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, PCR not only offered a rapid way to diagnose SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, but also made the molecular analysis of its genomic sequence possible. Sequence variations were observed in the SAR-CoV obtained from different patients in this epidemic. These unique viral genetic signatures can be applied as a powerful molecular tool in tracing the route of transmission and in studying the genome evolution of SARS-CoV. To extract this wealth of information from the limited primary clinical specimens of SARS patients, we were presented with the challenge of efficiently amplifying fragments of the SARS-CoV genome for analysis. In this chapter, we will discuss how we managed to accomplish this task with our optimized protocols on reversetranscription, nested PCR amplification, and DNA cycle sequencing. We will also discuss the sequence variations that typified some strains of SARS-CoV in the different phases during this epidemic.

Several studies have highlighted its strong inverse relationship with life expectancy during periods of steady mortality decline, but this association weakens, and even reverses, when mortality does not improve equally over age. To date no study has comprehensively explored the behaviour of lifespan variation when mortality increases significantly. OBJECTIVE We investigate lifespan variation trends around various mortality crises, focusing on age-specific contributions and sex differences. METHODS Drawing data from the Human Mortality Database and Mesle and Vallin's Ukrainian lifetables, we analyse five European epidemics and famines across three centuries. We use six measures of lifespan variation and adopt the linear integral method of decomposition. RESULTS During these crises, relative lifespan variation increases, while absolute variation declines, and subsequently both quickly revert to pre-crisis levels. We show that mortality at older ages leads to a temporary increase in absolute - but not relative - variation. The lifespan variation of females is less affected than that of males, because of differences in the impact of infant and child mortality. CONCLUSIONS Even when infant mortality is high, mortality at older ages can influence lifespan variation. Our results also underscore the sex differences in the vulnerability of young individuals in periods of extreme mortality. CONTRIBUTION By underlining different trends of lifespan variation by sex and indicator, we offer new insight into the consequences of mortality crises. Contrary to what is often asserted, we show that the choice of lifespan variation indicator is not always inconsequential.","output":"Divergent trends in lifespan variation during mortality crises"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Currently three hospital and tuberculosis (TB) collaboration models exist in China: the dispensary model where TB has to be diagnosed and treated in TB dispensaries, the specialist model where TB specialist hospital also treat TB patients, and the integrated model where TB diagnosis and treatment is integrated into a general hospital. The study compared effects of the three models through exploring patient experience in TB diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: We selected two sites in each model of TB service in four provinces of China. In each site, 50 patients were selected from TB patient registries for a structured questionnaire survey, with a total of 293 patients recruited. All participants were newly registered uncomplicated TB cases without any major complications or resistance to first-line anti-TB drugs, and having successfully completed treatment. Diagnostic and treatment procedures were reviewed from medical charts of the surveyed patients to compare with national guidelines. RESULTS: Specialist sites had the highest patient expenditure, hospitalization rates and mostly used second-line anti-TB drugs, while the integrated model reported the opposite. The median health expenditure was USD 1,499 for the specialist sites and USD 306 for the integrated sites, with 83% and 15% patients respectively having unnecessary hospitalization. 74% of the specialist sites and 19% of the integrated sites used second-line anti-TB drugs. Mixed results were identified in the two dispensary sites. One site had median health expenditure of USD 138 with 12% of patients hospitalized, while the other had USD 912 and 65% respectively. CONCLUSION: The study observed prohibitive financial expenditure and a high level of deviation from national guidelines in all sites, which may be related to the profit-seeking behavior of public hospitals.

In this prospective observational study, we investigated whether muscle strength or muscle mass are predictive of hospital length of stay (LOS) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. Methods We evaluated prospectively 196 patients at hospital admission for muscle mass and strength. Ten patients did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2 during hospitalization and were excluded from the analyses. Results The sample comprised patients of both sexes (50% male) with a mean age (SD) of 59 (15) years, body mass index of 29.5 (6.9) kg/m2. The prevalence of current smoking patients was 24.7%, and more prevalent coexisting conditions were hypertension (67.7%), obesity (40.9%), and type 2 diabetes (36.0%). Mean (SD) LOS was 8.6 days (7.7);17.0% of the patients required intensive care;3.8% used invasive mechanical ventilation;and 6.6% died during the hospitalization period. The crude hazard ratio (HR) for LOS was greatest for handgrip strength comparing the strongest versus other patients (1.47 [95% CI: 1.07?2.03;P = 0.019]). Evidence of an association between increased handgrip strength and shorter hospital stay was also identified when handgrip strength was standardized according to the sex-specific mean and standard deviation (1.23 [95% CI: 1.06?1.43;P = 0.007]). Mean LOS was shorter for the strongest patients (7.5  6.1 days) versus others (9.2  8.4 days). Evidence of associations were also present for vastus lateralis cross-sectional area. The crude HR identified shorter hospital stay for patients with greater sex-specific standardized values (1.20 [95% CI: 1.03?1.39;P = 0.016]). Evidence was also obtained associating longer hospital stays for patients with the lowest values for vastus lateralis cross-sectional area (0.63 [95% CI: 0.46?0.88;P = 0.006). Mean LOS for the patients with the lowest muscle cross-sectional area was longer (10.8  8.8 days) versus others (7.7  7.2 days). The magnitude of associations for handgrip strength and vastus lateralis cross-sectional area remained consistent and statistically significant after adjusting for other covariates. Conclusions Muscle strength and mass assessed upon hospital admission are predictors of LOS in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, which stresses the value of muscle health in prognosis of this disease.","output":"Muscle strength and muscle mass as predictors of hospital length of stay in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19: a prospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines have been incredibly successful at stemming the morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases worldwide.

Hence, there is a need to assess the possible association between chronic periodontitis and coronary artery disease. Materials and Methods: A study included 100 subjects divided into four groups. Group I: stable coronary artery disease with chronic periodontitis, Group II: stable coronary artery disease without chronic periodontitis, Group III: chronic periodontitis without coronary artery disease, and Group IV: healthy controls. Gingival index, Russell's periodontal index, pocket depth, and clinical attachment level were recorded. Venous blood was collected from the patients, and serum fibrinogen, CRP, and lipid profile levels were estimated. Results: The intragroup comparison of biochemical and periodontal parameters showed statistically significant results with P < 0.05.

Viruses can also spread through fusion of infected with uninfected cells. We compared the requirements of ACE2 expression, proteolytic activation, and sensitivity to inhibitors for SARS2-S-mediated and SARS-CoV-S (SARS1-S)-mediated cell-cell fusion. SARS2-S-driven fusion was moderately increased by TMPRSS2 and strongly by ACE2, while SARS1-S-driven fusion was strongly increased by TMPRSS2 and less so by ACE2 expression. In contrast to that of SARS1-S, SARS2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion was efficiently activated by batimastat-sensitive metalloproteases. Mutation of the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site reduced effector cell-target cell fusion when ACE2 or TMPRSS2 was limiting and rendered SARS2-S-driven cell-cell fusion more dependent on TMPRSS2. When both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundant, initial target cell-effector cell fusion was unaltered compared to that of wild-type (wt) SARS2-S, but syncytia remained smaller. Mutation of the S2 cleavage (S2) site specifically abrogated activation by TMPRSS2 for both cell-cell fusion and SARS2-S-driven pseudoparticle entry but still allowed for activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion and by cathepsins for particle entry. Finally, we found that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor bromhexine, unlike the inhibitor camostat, was unable to reduce TMPRSS2-activated cell-cell fusion by SARS1-S and SARS2-S. Paradoxically, bromhexine enhanced cell-cell fusion in the presence of TMPRSS2, while its metabolite ambroxol exhibited inhibitory activity under some conditions. On Calu-3 lung cells, ambroxol weakly inhibited SARS2-S-driven lentiviral pseudoparticle entry, and both substances exhibited a dose-dependent trend toward weak inhibition of authentic SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE Cell-cell fusion allows viruses to infect neighboring cells without the need to produce free virus and contributes to tissue damage by creating virus-infected syncytia. Our results demonstrate that the S2 cleavage site is essential for activation by TMPRSS2 and unravel important differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, among those, greater dependence of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2 expression and activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion. Bromhexine, reportedly an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, is currently being tested in clinical trials against coronavirus disease 2019. Our results indicate that bromhexine enhances fusion under some conditions. We therefore caution against the use of bromhexine in high dosages until its effects on SARS-CoV-2 spike activation are better understood. The related compound ambroxol, which similarly to bromhexine is clinically used as an expectorant, did not exhibit activating effects on cell-cell fusion. Both compounds exhibited weak inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection at high concentrations, which might be clinically attainable for ambroxol.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Spike-Mediated Cell-Cell Fusion Differ in Their Requirements for Receptor Expression and Proteolytic Activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, several mass gathering events were related to the Falles festival in Borriana (Spain), resulting in a 536 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases outbreak among participants.

The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for entry. Herein, we describe glycomic and glycoproteomic analysis of hACE2 expressed in HEK293 cells. We observed high glycan occupancy (73.2 to 100%) at all seven possible N-glycosylation sites and surprisingly detected one novel O-glycosylation site.

This has been primarily managed by dramatically reducing in- and outpatient services for other diseases and implementing infection prevention and control measures. The impact of the pandemic on nuclear medicine departments and their services has not yet been established. The aim of this online survey was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on nuclear medicine departments. Methods: A web-based questionnaire, made available from April 16 to May 3, 2020, was designed to determine the impact of the pandemic on in- and outpatient nuclear medicine departments, including the number of procedures, employee health, availability of radiotracers and other essential supplies, and availability of personal protective equipment. The survey also inquired about operational aspects and types of facilities as well as other challenges. Results: A total of 434 responses from 72 countries were registered and analyzed. Respondents reported an average decline of 54% in diagnostic procedures. PET/CT scans decreased by an average of 36%, whereas sentinel lymph-node procedures decreased by 45%, lung scans by 56%, bone scans by 60%, myocardial studies by 66%, and thyroid studies by 67%. Of all participating centers, 81% performed radionuclide therapies, and they reported a reduction of 45% on average in the last 4 wk, ranging from over 76% in Latin America and South East Asia to 16% in South Korea and Singapore. Survey results showed that 52% of participating sites limited their 99mTc/99Mo generator purchases, and 12% of them temporarily cancelled orders. Insufficient supplies of essential materials (radioisotopes, generators, and kits) were reported, especially for 99mTc/99Mo generators and 131I, particularly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Conclusion: Both diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures declined precipitously, with countries worldwide being affected by the pandemic to a similar degree. Countries that were in the postpeak phase of the pandemic when they responded to the survey, such as South Korea and Singapore, reported a less pronounced impact on nuclear medicine services; however, the overall results of the survey showed that nuclear medicine services worldwide had been significantly impacted. In relation to staff health, 15% of respondents experienced COVID-19 infections within their own departments.","output":"Global Impact of COVID-19 on Nuclear Medicine Departments: An International Survey in April 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Aim of the study is to assess the occurrence of early stage coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in patients with mild to moderate respiratory distress secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and methods: Data of patients hospitalized from 18 March 2020 to 20 April 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Two scores for the screening of coagulopathy (SIC and non-overt DIC scores) were calculated. The occurrence of thrombotic complication, death, and worsening respiratory function requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or admission to ICU were recorded, and these outcomes were correlated with the results of each score. Chi-square test, receiver-operating characteristic curve, and logistic regression analysis were used as appropriate. p Values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Data of 32 patients were analyzed. Overt-DIC was diagnosed in two patients (6.2%), while 26 (81.2%) met the criteria for non-overt DIC. Non-overt DIC score values 4 significantly correlated with the need of NIV/ICU (p = 0.02) and with the occurrence of thrombotic complications (p = 0.04). A score 4 was the optimal cut-off value, performing better than SIC score (p = 0.0018). Values 4 in patients with thrombotic complications were predictive of death (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Overt DIC occurred in 6.2% of non-ICU patients hospitalized for a mild to moderate COVID-19 respiratory distress, while 81.2% fulfilled the criteria for non-overt DIC. The non-overt DIC score performed better than the SIC score in predicting the need of NIV/ICU and the occurrence of thrombotic complications, as well as in predicting mortality in patients with thrombotic complications, with a score 4 being detected as the optimal cut-off.","output":"Non-Overt Coagulopathy in Non-ICU Patients with Mild to Moderate COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, laboratorial parameters of hospitalized novel coronavirus (COVID\\\\19) patients, who were complicated with severe pneumonia, were compared with the findings of cytokine storm developing in macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)/secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). Severe pneumonia occurred as a result of cytokine storm in some patients who needed intensive care unit (ICU), and it is aimed to determine the precursive parameters in this situation. Also in this study, the aim is to identify laboratory criteria that predict worsening disease and ICU intensification, as well as the development of cytokine storm.

This study includes 150 confirmed COVID\\\\19 patients with severe pneumonia. When they were considered as severe pneumonia patients, the clinic and laboratory parameters of this group are compared with H\\\\score criteria. Patients are divided into two subgroups; patients with worsened symptoms who were transferred into tertiary ICU, and patients with stable symptoms followed in the clinic. For the patients with confirmed COVID\\\\19 infection, after they become complicated with severe pneumonia, lymphocytopenia (55.3%), anemia (12.0%), thrombocytopenia (19.3%), hyperferritinemia (72.5%), hyperfibrinogenemia (63.7%) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (90.8%), aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) (31.3%), alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) (20.7%) are detected. There were no significant changes in other parameters. Blood parameters between the pre\\\\ICU period and the ICU period (in which their situation had been worsened and acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] was developed) were also compared. In the latter group lymphocyte levels were found significantly reduced (p = 0.01), and LDH, highly sensitive troponin (hs\\\\troponin), procalcitonin, and triglyceride levels were significantly increased (p < 0.05). In addition, there was no change in hemoglobin, leukocyte, platelet, ferritin, and liver function test levels, including patients who developed ARDS, similar to the cytokine storm developed in MAS/sHLH.

In the severe patient group who has started to develop ARDS signs, a decrease in lymphocyte level in addition to the elevated LDH, hs\\\\troponin, procalcitonin, and triglyceride levels can be a predictor in progression to ICU admission and could help in the planning of anti\\\\cytokine therapy.","output":"Cytokine storm in severe COVID\\\\19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ring pessaries under continuous use for > 2 years. Our starting hypothesis was that their use without periodic removal, cleaning or replacement for between 24 to 48 months after insertion is safe and effective. METHODS: This was a prospective observational and descriptive study. One hundred one women who successfully completed the 24 first months of continuous use of a ring pessary were included and monitored for another 24 months. The objectives were to establish the percentage of patients maintaining its use 48 months after insertion, the reasons for discontinuation and the adverse events. Another purpose of this study was to determine the timing of replacement of the vaginal pessary in long-term users. RESULTS: Of the women, 92.1% (93/101) had successful pessary use, and it was discontinued by three patients (2.9%, 3/101); 76.2% (77/101) of the women continued pessary use after the end of the study, and in 16 (15.8%, 16/101) patients, after pessary removal, the prolapse disappeared and did not recur. Forty-five women (48.4%, 45/93) presented some adverse events that required temporary pessary removal. The most common one was an increase in vaginal discharge (73.3%, 33/45). In four women (8.9%, 4/45), the ring pessary was detected embedded in the vaginal epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous use of a ring pessary can be recommended for 2 years in hysterectomized women and for 4 years in non-hysterectomized women if there are no complications.","output":"How often should ring pessaries be removed or changed in women with advanced POP?

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3?) is a prominent mediator of the inflammatory response, and high GSK-3 activity is associated with various heart diseases. We investigated the regulatory mechanisms of GSK-3? in activation of the nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in a rat model with successful induction of MI on days 2-28. An in vitro investigation was performed using newborn rat/human cardiomyocytes and fibroblast cultures under typical inflammasome stimulation and hypoxia treatment. GSK-3? inhibition markedly improved myocardial dysfunction and prevented remodeling, with parallel reduction in the parameters of NLRP3 inflammasome activation after MI. GSK-3? inhibition reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in cardiac fibroblasts, but not in cardiomyocytes. GSK-3?'s interaction with activating signal cointegrator (ASC) as well as GSK-3? inhibition reduced ASC phosphorylation and oligomerization at the tissues and cellular levels.

Higher levels of stress were observed in children during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the level of their life satisfaction remained unchanged when compared with data from the pre-COVID-19 surveys. The pandemic also affected peer relationship quality and susceptibility to smartphone addiction, but not perceived parenting style nor academic engagement. Interestingly, peer relationship quality no longer predicted life satisfaction during the pandemic; perceived parenting styles and parent-child conversation time predicted life satisfaction.

PD and applicant survey responses regarding the two interview cycles were compared. RESULTS: The response rate was 56% (53/95) for PDs, 19% (23/123) for in-person applicants, and 38% (49/129) for virtual applicants. PDs reported significantly lower cost for virtual compared to in-person interviews (P < 0.001). They reported no significant difference in number of applications received, number of applicants interviewed, applicant pool geographic regions, number of interview days offered, or format of interviews. Most PDs (31/53, 58%) felt the virtual format still allowed them to get to know the applicants well. Cost was significantly higher for in-person compared to virtual applicants (P < 0.001). More in-person applicants (11/23, 48%) listed cost as a barrier compared to virtual applicants (7/49, 14%) (P = 0.002). Virtual and in-person applicants reported a similar number of program applications, but virtual applicants completed more interviews (P = 0.012). Both groups preferred scheduled time to speak with the current fellows and a one-on-one interview format with two to four faculty members.

This study aims to evaluate the direct medical costs of patients with PD using a large sample from an entire city and to identity the potential factors correlating with their inpatient costs in Guangzhou City, Southern China. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study uses data obtained from the Urban Employee-based Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) and the Urban Resident-based Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) administrative claims databases in Guangzhou City from 2008 to 2012. The total sample was comprised of 2660 patients with PD. Costs were evaluated for the total sample and by types of insurance. The composition of costs was compared between the UEBMI and URBMI subgroups. The extended estimating-equations model was applied to identify the potential impact factors influencing the inpatient costs. Results: The direct medical costs per patient with PD were CNY 14,514.9 (USD 2299.4) in 2012, consisting of inpatient costs of CNY 13,551.4 and outpatient costs of CNY 963.5. The medication costs accounted for the largest part (50.3%). The inpatient costs of PD patients under the UEBMI scheme (CNY 13,651.0) were significantly higher than those of patients in the URBMI subgroup (CNY 12,402.2) (p < 0.05). The proportion of out-of-pocket spending out of inpatient and outpatient costs for UEBMI beneficiaries (24.3% and 56.1%) was much lower than that for patients under the URBMI scheme (47.9% and 76.2%). The regression analysis suggested that types of insurance, age, hospital levels, length of stay (LOS) and comorbidities were significantly correlated with the inpatient costs of patients with PD. Conclusions: The direct medical costs of patients with PD in China were high compared to the GDP per capita in Guangzhou City and different between the two evaluated types of insurance. Patients with the UEBMI scheme, of older age, with comorbidities, staying in tertiary hospitals and with longer LOS had significantly higher inpatient costs. Thus, policymakers need to reduce the gaps between the two urban insurance schemes in benefit levels, provide support for the development of a comprehensive long-term care insurance system and promote the use of telemedicine in China.","output":"Direct Medical Costs of Parkinsons Disease in Southern China: A Cross-Sectional Study Based on Health Insurance Claims Data in Guangzhou City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This multicenter study presents prevalence data and associated risk factors of post-COVID-19 cough one year after hospital discharge in COVID-19 survivors.

METHODS: We conducted an in-depth review of the current global psychiatric literature and describe the wide range of psychopathological presentations reported among past COVID-19 patients worldwide and those that are expected to emerge. RESULTS: Current discussions in the psychiatric literature on COVID-19 report anxiety and anxiety disorders as a predominant set of clinical presentations during the pandemic. The impacts of direct COVID-19 infection, associated psychopathological sequelae, and drastic lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa, are associated with a broad range of psychopathologies and other neuropsychiatric presentations. Pre-existing societal conditions and burdens on the health system in South Africa prompt healthcare providers and public health planners to accordingly prepare for the expected rise in new psychiatric presentations.

It seems reasonable to argue that the risk patterns for COVID-19 have to be usefully studied in quantitative terms too, whenever possible applying the same approach to the relationship 'dose of the exposure vs pathological response' commonly used for chemicals and already followed for several biological agents to SARS-CoV-2, too. Such an approach is of particular relevance in the fields of both occupational epidemiology and occupational medicine, where the identification of the sources of a dangerous exposure and of the web of causation of a disease is often questionable and questioned: it is relevant when evaluating the population risk, too. Specific occupational scenarios, basically involving health workers, exhibit important proportions of both subjects simply infected by SARS-CoV-2 and of ill subjects with, respectively, mild, moderate, and severe disease. Similar patterns have been described referring to various circumstances of community exposure, e.g., standing in crowded public places, travelling on crowded means of transport, living in accommodation or care homes, living in the same household as a COVID-19 case. The hypothesis that these findings are a consequence not only of high probabilities of exposure, but also of high doses (as a product of both intensity and duration, with possible autonomous effects of peaks of exposure) deserves to be systematically tested, in order to reconstruct the web of causation of COVID-19 individual and clustered cases and to cope with situations at critical risk for SARS-CoV-2, needing to be identified, mapped, and dealt with at the right time. A limited but consistent set of papers supporting these assumptions has been traced in the literature. Under these premises, the creation of a structured inventory of both values of viral concentrations in the air (in case and if possible, of surface contaminations too) and of viral loads in biological matrixes is proposed, with the subsequent construction of a scenario-exposure matrix. A scenario-exposure matrix for SARS-CoV-2 may represent a useful tool for research and practical risk management purposes, helping to understand the possibly critical circumstances for which no direct exposure measure is available (this is an especially frequent case, in contexts of low socio-economic level) and providing guidance to determine evidence-based public health strategies.","output":"SARS-CoV-2: exposure to high external doses as determinants of higher viral loads and of increased risk for COVID-19.

Particularly, the context variables examined in this paper include total population, number of people over 65 years old, poverty index, morbidity rates, average age, and population density. For the construction of the SEIRD predictive models, this study encompasses a deep analysis of the dependence of these variables and also, their relationship with the context variables. Hence, before the development of predictive models using machine learning techniques, a methodology to analyze the interdependence of the SEIRD variables has been proposed. The dependence with the context variables is also discussed; to avoid the curse of dimensionality and multicollinearity problems, leading to better results and the reduction of the computational cost. Finally, several prediction models based on varied machine learning techniques and inputs are considered, these include temporal interdependence, temporal intra-dependence, and dependence with context variables. Each of the predictive models has been studied, as well as their quality of prediction.

The features that were selected by each of these models covered all three sectors of the economy. Using the charge-off data for the top 100 US banks ranked by assets from the first quarter of 1985 to the second quarter of 2019, we achieve mean squared error values of 1.15E?03 and 1.04E?03 using the model with optimal lags and the model with all lags, respectively.

We then performed two-sample MR to ascertain their effects on severe COVID-19 (cases: 4,792; controls: 1,054,664) from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative.

The TT are composed of TT cells with dark secretory granules and proacinar cells with lighter secretory granules, the latter being considered the immediate precursor of mature acinar cells. TT cells contain a specific secretory protein, submandibular gland protein C (SMGC) and they decrease in number postnatally at a higher rate in males than in females. In the present study, in order to clarify the biological roles of TT cells and their secretory product SMGC, we generated a knockout (KO) mouse strain deficient in SMGC. The KO mice of both sexes grew normally, had normal reproductive capacity and had normal acinar and duct systems in the SMG in adult ages. However, through the neonatal and early postnatal stages, the KO mice were deficient not only in the production of SMGC but also in TT cells. With electron microscopy of the SMG of newborn KO mice, TT cells with characteristic granules were absent and replaced by undifferentiated ductal cells, whereas proacinar cells were normal. These results suggested that the absence of SMGC inhibits the development of TT cells and that the absence of SMGC and TT cells has no notable influence on the postnatal development of the acinar and duct systems in the SMG.","output":"The lack of terminal tubule cells in the submandibular gland of mice deficient in submandibular gland protein C."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe critical condition with a high mortality that is currently in focus given that it is associated with mortality caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of a large population of pediatric patients with severe COVID-19 and compare them with patients with severe cases of influenza and other respiratory viruses (ORV). METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of Brazilian data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Information System, gathered from January 1st to July 14th, 2020. The sample included 4,784 patients (2,570 with confirmed COVID-19, 659 with influenza, 1,555 with ORV). Outcome measures included clinical features, preexisting comorbidities, pediatric intensive care unit admissions, need for ventilatory support, and death. RESULTS: Compared with the influenza and ORV groups, the COVID-19 group had a higher proportion of newborns and adolescents, as well as lower frequencies of fever, cough, dyspnea, respiratory distress, and desaturation. Although use of invasive ventilatory support was similar among groups, death rate was highest for COVID-19 (15.2% vs. 4.5% vs. 3.2%, p<0.001), with death risk more than three times the other groups (adjusted OR=3.7 [95% CI 2.5-5.6]). The presence of two or more comorbidities further increased this risk (OR=4.8 [95% CI 3.5-6.6]). Preexisting comorbidities were reported in 986 patients with severe COVID-19 (38%). Mortality rate among COVID-19 patients was significantly higher for almost all comorbidities reported. CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 had a higher mortality rate than other viral respiratory illnesses, despite the lower frequency of fever, cough, dyspnea, respiratory distress, and desaturation.

Confirmatory testing reduces overdiagnosis and nosocomial infection and enables real-world estimates of test specificity and positive predictive value. This study estimates these parameters to evaluate the impact of confirmatory testing, and to improve clinical diagnosis, epidemiological estimation and interpretation of vaccine trials. METHODS: Over one month, we took all respiratory samples from our laboratory with a patients first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay or in-house RT-PCR platform), and repeated testing using two platforms. Samples were categorised by source, and by whether clinical details suggested COVID-19 or corroborative testing from another laboratory. We estimated specificity and positive predictive value using maximum likelihood-based approaches. RESULTS: Of 19,597 samples, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 107. 52 corresponded to first-time detection (0.27% of tests on samples without previous detection); further testing detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA 1 time (confirmed) in 29 (56%), and failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA (not confirmed) in 23 (44%). Depending upon assumed parameters, point estimates for specificity and positive predictive value were 99.91%C99.98% and 61.8%C89.8% respectively using the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay, and 97.4%C99.1% and 20.1%C73.8% respectively using an in-house assay. CONCLUSIONS: Nucleic acid amplification testing for SARS-CoV-2 is highly specific. Nevertheless, when prevalence is low a significant proportion of initially positive results fail to confirm and confirmatory testing substantially reduces false positive detections.

The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to several countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel estimation approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the spread of the disease through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predicted the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study revealed that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We found a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship was confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence revealed that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by ~0.10%C~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirmed the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases.

The just-world hypothesis suggests that people need to believe in a just world in which they get what they deserve and deserve what they get. Studies have shown that believing in a just world has an adaptive function for individuals. Samples from six countries completed an online questionnaire. A total of 1,250 people participated (934 female) and ages ranged from 16 to 84 years old (M = 36.3, SD = 15.5). The results showed that, when controlling for gender, age, country of residence, and being in a risk group for COVID-19 (e.g., smoker, old age, chronic disease etc.), a stronger personal and general BJW and higher perceived control over the COVID-19 pandemic predicted lower levels of hopelessness. How at-risk participants perceived themselves to be for COVID-19 positively predicted hopelessness, but how risky participants perceived the disease to be for others negatively predicted hopelessness. This study highlights how the distinction between self and others influences hopelessness and how BJW, especially personal BJW, can serve as a psychological resource during times of historic uncertainty.

It is important to demonstrate how these technologies were implemented during the early stages of this pandemic to identify their application and barriers to adoption, particularly among vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this knowledge synthesis was to present the range of RMTs used in delivering care to patients with COVID-19 and to identify perceived benefits of and barriers to their use. The review placed a special emphasis on health equity considerations. METHODS: A rapid review of published research was conducted using Embase, MEDLINE, and QxMD for records published from the inception of COVID-19 (December 2019) to July 6, 2020. Synthesis involved content analysis of reported benefits of and barriers to the use of RMTs when delivering health care to patients with COVID-19, in addition to health equity considerations. RESULTS: Of 491 records identified, 48 publications that described 35 distinct RMTs were included in this review. RMTs included use of existing technologies (eg, videoconferencing) and development of new ones that have COVID-19Cspecific applications. Content analysis of perceived benefits generated 34 distinct codes describing advantages of RMTs, mapped to 10 themes overall. Further, 52 distinct codes describing barriers to use of RMTs were mapped to 18 themes. Prominent themes associated with perceived benefits included a lower burden of care (eg, for hospitals, health care practitioners; 28 records), reduced infection risk (n=33), and support for vulnerable populations (n=14). Prominent themes reflecting barriers to use of RMTs included equity-related barriers (eg, affordability of technology for users, poor internet connectivity, poor health literacy; n=16), the need for quality best practice guidelines for use of RMTs in clinical care (n=12), and the need for additional resources to develop and support new technologies (n=11).

STUDY DESIGN A retrospective review (April 2006 to October 2011) of databases at 2 institutions identified 136 patients who had undergone LS. In 34 patients with massive splenomegaly, primary splenic pedicle dissection technique (PSPD) had been used in 19 patients and secondary splenic pedicle dissection technique (SSPD) had been used in 15 patients. In 102 patients with normal-sized spleen or moderate splenomegaly, PSPD had been used in 56 patients and SSPD in 46 patients. We compared perioperative and follow-up data. RESULTS Laparoscopic splenectomy was completed in 128 patients. In the massive splenomegaly group, the conversion rate was 5.3% for PSPD and 33.3% for SSPD, the complication rate was 42.1% vs 20%, hospital stay was 3.2  2.0 days vs 7.5  3.5 days, and transfusion requirement was 1.1  1.2 U vs 3.2  0.9 U, respectively. However, in the normal or moderate splenomegaly group, except for complications, there were no significant differences between PSPD and SSPD techniques in perioperative findings. In the 2 groups, there were significant differences between the PSPD and SSPD techniques in pancreatic leakage (15.8% vs 0 and 8.9% vs 0, respectively) and postoperative fever (15.8% vs 6.7% and 10.7% vs 2.2%, respectively).

Otolaryngologists are at increased occupational risk to COVID19 infection due to the exposure to respiratory droplets and aerosols, especially during the routine nose and mouth examinations where coughing and sneezing happen regularly (Rna et al., 2017 [2]; Tysome and Bhutta, 2020 [3]). The use of a headlight is essential during these examinations. However, to our knowledge, none of the commercially available or 3D-printable face shields are compatible with a headlight. Hence, using a face shield and a headlight at the same time can be very uncomfortable and sometimes impossible. To solve this problem, we have designed a 3D-printable adapter for medical headlights, which can hold a transparent sheet to create a face shield as an effective barrier protection that can be used comfortably with the headlight. The adapter can be printed in different materials with the most commonly used nowadays being the cost-efficient PLA (Polylactic Acid) used for this prototype. The resulting piece weighs only 7 g and has an estimated cost of $0.15 USD. The transparent sheets, typically made from polyester and used for laser printing, can be purchased in any office material store with a standard price of 0.4 USD per unit. After use, the transparent sheet can be easily removed. We trialed the adapter in 7 different headlights. All of these headlights accommodated the printed blocks extremely well. The headlights were used in many different settings, including the ENT clinic, the operating room, the emergency room, the ENT ward and the COVID19 intensive care unit (ICU) for a two weeks period. All doctors using the headlight felt they were fully protected from respiratory droplets, blood, sputum and other fluids. The face shield with the headlight has been found very useful for treating epistaxis, changing tracheostomy cannulas and during routine nasal and oral examinations. The headlight face shield adapter was designed to solve a specific problem among the ENT community; however other specialist can find it useful as well. Nonetheless, manufacturers should take care of specifics problems like this and provide commercially available products to protect the ENT workforce in this new era.","output":"3D-printable headlight face shield adapter.

METHODS: We compared eyes with active disease despite &#8804;6 weekly injections whose next injection was extended to &#8805;7 weeks and those whose intervals were not extended. We identified 1559 (16%) of 9602 eyes from the Fight Retinal Blindness! (FRB!) registry (2013 and 2018) that fit this criteria. Eyes were further stratified into four groups by the mean interval over the following 6 months: (1) &#8804;6 weeks (81%), (2) 7-9 weeks (9%), (3) 10-12 weeks (5%) and (4) >12 weeks (5%). RESULTS: There was a significant loss in VA in eyes extended to >12 weeks compared to the non-extended group (adjusted VA change, mean (95% CI): &#8804;6 weeks, 0.4 (-1.5 to 2.2), versus >12 weeks, -4.7 (-7.4 to -2.1), letters, p = 0.03 and a threefold increase in relative risk of losing &#8805;15 letters (absolute risk (14% versus 4%, p < 0.01)).

Pathways activated in patients with KD included those involved in anti-viral and anti-bacterial responses. Unsupervised clustering showed that the majority of KD patients clustered with bacterial patients on both omic levels, whilst application of diagnostic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infections revealed that many transcriptomic KD samples had low probabilities of having bacterial or viral infections, suggesting that KD may be triggered by a different process not typical of either common bacterial or viral infections. Clustering based on the transcriptomic and proteomic responses during KD revealed three clusters of KD patients on both omic levels, suggesting heterogeneity within the inflammatory response during KD.

Our aim was to examine the association of stressors (illegitimate tasks) and health related resources (work-related sense of coherence; recovery experience) with life satisfaction, happiness, job satisfaction and burnout among German general practitioners (GPs). We conducted a cross-sectional survey among general medical practices in Germany. Main outcome measures were life satisfaction, happiness (Subjective Happiness Scale), job satisfaction (Work Satisfaction Scale) and burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory). 548 GPs from across Germany participated (53.6% males, 45.6% females; mostly representative of German GPs). One third (35.2%) of the participants reported a high prevalence of personal, and one quarter (26.5%) indicated a high prevalence of work-related burnout symptoms. Illegitimate tasks are negatively associated with life and job satisfaction and are positively associated with personal, work-related and patient-related burnout among GPs. Work-SoC and recovery experience are positively associated with life satisfaction, happiness, and job satisfaction and are negatively associated with personal, work-related and patient-related burnout. Female physicians have a higher job satisfaction than male physicians. Being female and working as an employed physician is associated with a higher prevalence of personal burnout symptoms. GPs working in a group practice are happier and more satisfied with their job than GPs in single practices. Personal, work-related and patient-related burnout symptoms are stronger in GPs working in a single practice than in GPs in group practices. Our results highlight that Work-SoC, recovery experience and illegitimate tasks are important for creating work-related well-being among GPs. Introducing health promotion activities which aim to strengthen recovery experience and Work-SoC, as well as interventions to restructure tasks, may increase life satisfaction, happiness, and job satisfaction and reduce burnout symptoms in this health care profession.","output":"Burnout, satisfaction and happiness among German general practitioners (GPs): A cross-sectional survey on health resources and stressors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several important aspects related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission are not well known due to a lack of appropriate data. However, mathematical and computational tools can be used to extract part of this information from the available data, like some hidden age-related characteristics. In this paper, we investigate age-specific differences in susceptibility to and infectiousness upon contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. More specifically, we use panel-based social contact data from diary-based surveys conducted in Belgium combined with the next generation principle to infer the relative incidence and we compare this to real-life incidence data. Comparing these two allows for the estimation of age-specific transmission parameters. Our analysis implies the susceptibility in children to be around half of the susceptibility in adults, and even lower for very young children (preschooler). However, the probability of adults and the elderly to contract the infection is decreasing throughout the vaccination campaign, thereby modifying the picture over time.","output":"Inferring age-specific differences in susceptibility to and infectiousness upon SARS-CoV-2 infection based on Belgian social contact data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to its high lethality amongst the elderly, the safety of nursing homes has been of central importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. With test procedures becoming available at scale, such as antigen or RT-LAMP tests, and increasing availability of vaccinations, nursing homes might be able to safely relax prohibitory measures while controlling the spread of infections (meaning an average of one or less secondary infections per index case). Here, we develop a detailed agent-based epidemiological model for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes to identify optimal prevention strategies. The model is microscopically calibrated to high-resolution data from nursing homes in Austria, including detailed social contact networks and information on past outbreaks. We find that the effectiveness of mitigation testing depends critically on the timespan between test and test result, the detection threshold of the viral load for the test to give a positive result, and the screening frequencies of residents and employees. Under realistic conditions and in absence of an effective vaccine, we find that preventive screening of employees only might be sufficient to control outbreaks in nursing homes, provided that turnover times and detection thresholds of the tests are low enough. If vaccines that are moderately effective against infection and transmission are available, control is achieved if 80% or more of the inhabitants are vaccinated, even if no preventive testing is in place and residents are allowed to have visitors. Since these results strongly depend on vaccine efficacy against infection, retention of testing infrastructures, regular voluntary screening and sequencing of virus genomes is advised to enable early identification of new variants of concern.","output":"Agent-based simulations for protecting nursing homes with prevention and vaccination strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We apply the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag method to examine the relationships between seven leading currency exchange rates and gold prices using daily data from January 2017 to April 2021.

METHODS: Twenty-one telephone interviews, semi-structured around the capabilities, opportunities and motivations model of behaviour change (COM-B), were conducted with GPs in the United Kingdom. The Theoretical Domains Framework was employed as an analytical framework. Using the Behaviour Change Wheel, Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs), intervention functions and exemplar interventions were identified. RESULTS: GPs valued additional knowledge about self-harm risk assessments (knowledge), and communication skills were considered to be fundamental to high-pressure consultations (cognitive and interpersonal skills). GPs did not engage with the guidelines due to concerns that they would be a distraction from patient cues about risk during consultations (memory, attention and decision processes), and perceptions that following the guidance is difficult due to time pressures and lack of access to mental health referrals (environmental context and resources). Clinical uncertainty surrounding longer term care for people that self-harm, particularly patients that are waiting for or cannot access a referral, drives GPs to rely on their professional judgement over the guidance (beliefs about capabilities).

Rehabilitation during CHRT might prevent an often-observed reduction in physical fitness and deterioration in nutritional status. In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated whether a multimodal program for rehabilitation during CHRT, constructed in collaboration with patients and healthcare professionals, was feasible with respect to program adherence during CHRT, patient motivation, patient preferences and experiences, dropout rate, adverse events, and logistic planning. Results demonstrate that supervised and personalized rehabilitation in patients with stage III NSCLC undergoing CHRT seems feasible when the intensity of the physical exercise training program and nutritional advice are adjusted to the possibilities and preferences of the patients. It is recommended to design a supervised and personalized rehabilitation program with a low-to-moderate training intensity and a longer training session duration. ABSTRACT: Rehabilitation during chemoradiotherapy (CHRT) might (partly) prevent reduction in physical fitness and nutritional status and could improve treatment tolerance in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to investigate the feasibility of a multimodal program for rehabilitation during CHRT. A home-based multimodal rehabilitation program (partly supervised moderate-intensity physical exercise training and nutritional support) during CHRT was developed in collaboration with patients with stage III NSCLC and specialized healthcare professionals. A predetermined number of six patients with stage III NSCLC (aged > 50 years) who underwent CHRT and participated in this program were monitored in detail to assess its feasibility for further development and optimization of the program. The patients level of physical functioning (e.g., cardiopulmonary exercise test, six-minute walking test, handgrip strength, body mass index, fat free mass index, energy and protein intake) was evaluated in order to provide personalized advice regarding physical exercise training and nutrition. The program appeared feasible and well-tolerated. All six included patients managed to perform the assessments. Exercise session adherence was high in five patients and low in one patient. The performed exercise intensity was lower than prescribed for all patients. Patients were motivated to complete the home-based rehabilitation program during CHRT. Preliminary effects on physical and nutritional parameters revealed relatively stable values throughout CHRT, with inter-individual variation. Supervised and personalized rehabilitation in patients with stage III NSCLC undergoing CHRT seems feasible when the intensity of the physical exercise training was adjusted to the possibilities and preferences of the patients. Future research should investigate the feasibility of a supervised and personalized rehabilitation program during CHRT with a low-to-moderate exercise intensity with the aim to prevent physical decline during CHRT.","output":"Feasibility of Rehabilitation during Chemoradiotherapy among Patients with Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Proof-of-Concept Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major cause of respiratory infection and institutional outbreaks, yet the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of these viruses is poorly described among the elderly residing in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of LTCF residents with positive nasopharyngeal or mid-turbinate swabs for CoVs (OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1) between January 2013 and December 2018. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from resident charts including clinical presentation, treatment, outcome, and transmission to other residents. Variables were compared using univariate analysis. RESULTS: 3268 residents met inclusion criteria (median age 93 years, 90% male) comprising 7.5% (246/3268) of all positive respiratory virus specimens detected during the study period. 97(39%) of cases were associated with a respiratory outbreak while 149(61%) were sporadic cases that did not result in transmission. OC43 (52%) was the most commonly identified CoV and was more commonly associated with outbreak cases (76% vs. 37%; P < 0.001). In total, 87% of all cases had two or more of runny nose/congestion, cough, sore throat/hoarse voice or fever. The most common symptoms among residents were cough (85%), runny nose/congestion (79%), and sore throat/hoarse voice (59%) and only 17% of residents had a measured temperature of  37.8C. Only 6% of residents received antibiotic treatment for suspected secondary bacterial pneumonia. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.7% with 67% of deaths attributable to the CoV infection. There was no statistically significant difference in symptoms, treatment or outcomes associated with outbreaks or seasonality. CONCLUSION: CoVs make up an important proportion of respiratory viral infections among LTCF residents and may result in frequent outbreaks. Most residents remain afebrile and have self-limited illness while only a small minority develop secondary bacterial pneumonia and death. Given these findings the benefits of control measures should be weighed against the impact on resident quality of life. DISCLOSURES: All authors: No reported disclosures.","output":"2448.

Cough is found to be one of the prime sources of airborne diseases as it has high velocity and large quantity of droplets. To understand and characterize the flow dynamics of a cough can help to control the airborne disease transmission. This study has measured flow dynamics of coughs with human subjects. The flow rate variation of a cough with time can be represented as a combination of gamma-probability-distribution functions. The variables needed to define the gamma-probability-distribution functions can be represented by some medical parameters. A robust multiple linear regression analysis indicated that these medical parameters can be obtained from the physiological details of a person. However, the jet direction and mouth opening area during a cough seemed not related to the physiological parameters of the human subjects. Combining the flow characteristics reported in this study with appropriate virus and droplet distribution information, the infectious source strength by coughing can be evaluated. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS There is a clear need for the scientific community to accurately predict and control the transmission of airborne diseases. Transportation of airborne viruses is often predicted using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. CFD simulations are inexpensive but need accurate source boundary conditions for the precise prediction of disease transmission. Cough is found to be the prime source for generating infectious viruses. The present study was designed to develop an accurate source model to define thermo-fluid boundary conditions for a cough.

We highlight a Cochrane rapid review, published in April 2020, on the effectiveness of quarantine in limiting the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: the authors of the Cochrane rapid review searched multiple electronic databases for studies of any design, which assessed the effects of quarantine compared to no intervention. Eligible participants for the review included contacts of confirmed or suspected cases and people returning from countries with a declared outbreak of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The authors used the evidence from SARS and MERS studies to provide indirect evidence on COVID-19. RESULTS: the authors included 29 observational and mathematical modelling studies and found that quarantine may lead to substantial reductions in new COVID-19 cases and deaths. The review also shows that combining school closures, travel bans and social distancing to quarantine may lead to larger reductions in cases and deaths.

METHODS Camelid blood (n = 124) was analyzed using the EPOC (pH, pCO2 , pO2 , HCO3 , base excess, SO2 , sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, TCO2 , anion gap, HCT, HGB, glucose, lactate, and creatinine); plasma was analyzed using a Roche Cobas c501 (sodium, potassium, chloride, TCO2 , anion gap, glucose, and creatinine). Method comparison data were assessed using Pearson's correlation, Passing-Bablok regression, and Bland-Altman plots. EPOC precision was evaluated using QCM and camelid blood. RESULTS For all measurands except anion gap, the EPOC vs Cobas instrument correlation was r > .85. Except for pO2 and pCO2 , EPOC precision (QCM and blood) ranged from a repeatability CV <1%-6.3%. Mild constant bias for chloride, glucose, TCO2 , anion gap, and creatinine, and mild proportional bias for chloride, glucose, and anion gap were present.

However, persisting viruses may have a role as resident commensals and confer protective immunity during inflammation. On the other hand, the dysregulation of gut mucosal immune responses to viruses can trigger excessive, pathogenic inflammation. The purpose of this review is to discuss virus-induced innate immune responses that are at play in ulcerative colitis.","output":"HostCViral Interactions in the Pathogenesis of Ulcerative Colitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While cognizant of the routine, necessary, and often challenging [1] laboratory activities related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection pandemic, we at the Journal of Clinical Microbiology are pleased to recognize three clinical microbiologists who have been bestowed with honors that validate high level of achievement in and/or significant contributions to the field.

We performed a systematic search for studies that reported HF and critical care-related outcomes in COVID-19 patients in the PubMed and Medline databases. From a total of 1050 papers, we identified 26 that satisfied the eligibility criteria for our review. Data such as patient demographics, HF, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, management, and outcome were extracted from these studies and analyzed. We reported outcomes in heart-transplant patients with COVID-19 separately. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the prevalence of HF varied between 4% and 21%. The requirement for ICU admission was between 8% and 33%. HF patients with COVID-19 had an overall mortality rate between 20% and 40%. We identified that HF is an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and patients with HF were more likely to require ventilation, ICU admission and develop complications. Patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction did worse than those with HF with midrange ejection fraction, and HF with preserved ejection fraction.

Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions have implemented to mitigate the outbreak and prevent the persistence of the COVID-19 in human-to-human transmission in India and worldwide. Hence, the mathematical study of the disease transmission becomes essential to illuminate the real nature of the transmission behavior and control of the diseases. We proposed a compartmental model that stratify into nine stages of infection. The incidence data of the SRAS-CoV-2 outbreak in India was analyzed for the best fit to the epidemic curve and we estimated the parameters from the best fitted curve. Based on the estimated model parameters, we performed a short-term prediction of our model. We performed sensitivity analysis with respect to [Formula: see text] and obtained that the disease transmission rate has an impact in reducing the spread of diseases. Furthermore, considering the non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical intervention policies as control functions, an optimal control problem is implemented to reduce the disease fatality. To mitigate the infected individuals and to minimize the cost of the controls, an objective functional has been formulated and solved with the aid of Pontryagins maximum principle. This study suggest that the implementation of optimal control strategy at the start of a pandemic tends to decrease the intensity of epidemic peaks, spreading the maximal impact of an epidemic over an extended time period. Our numerical simulations exhibit that the combination of two controls is more effective when compared with the combination of single control as well as no control.","output":"Modeling the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic with implementation of intervention strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From late December 2019 COVID-19 (Coronavirus infectious disease 19) epidemics spread from Wuhan, China, to all over the world, including Italy.

This syndrome characterizes by the onset of clinical signs and symptoms and delivery before (early-onset preeclampsia, eoPE) or after (late-onset preeclampsia, loPE) the 34 weeks of gestation. Preeclampsia is a mitochondrial disorder where differential involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in eoPE and loPE is unclear. Mitochondria regulate cell metabolism and are a significant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The syncytiotrophoblast in eoPE and loPE show with altered mitochondria structure and function resulting in ROS overproduction, oxidative stress, and cell damage and death. Mitochondria dysfunction may result from different alterations in eoPE where an altered expression of several molecules, including dynamin-related protein 1 and mitofusins, compared with loPE where these factors are either reduced or unaltered. Equally, mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics seem differentially modulated in eoPE and loPE. However, it is unclear whether the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation are differentially altered in these two subgroups of preeclampsia. However, the activity of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) and expression of essential proteins involved in the electron transport chain is reduced, leading to lower oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial respiration in the placenta in preeclampsia. Interventional studies in patients with preeclampsia using the coenzyme Q10, a key molecule in the electron transport chain, suggest that agents increasing the antioxidant capacity of the placenta may be protective of developing preeclampsia. In this review, the mitochondrial dysfunction in both eoPE and loPE is summarized.

The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is targeting the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mostly causes a respiratory illness. Although acquired and resistance immunity is one of the most important aspects of alleviating the trend of the current pandemic; however, there is still a big gap of knowledge regarding the infection process, immunopathogenesis, recovery, and reinfection. Aim of Review: To answer the questions regarding \\"the potential and probability of reinfection in COVID-19 infected cases\\" or \\"the efficiency and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced immunity against reinfection\\" we critically evaluated the current reports on SARS-CoV-2 immunity and reinfection with special emphasis on comparative studies using animal models that generalize their finding about protection and reinfection. Also, the contribution of humoral immunity in the process of COVID-19 recovery and the role of ACE2 in virus infectivity and pathogenesis has been discussed. Furthermore, innate and cellular immunity and inflammatory responses in the disease and recovery conditions are reviewed and an overall outline of immunologic aspects of COVID-19 progression and recovery in three different stages are presented. Finally, we categorized the infected cases into four different groups based on the acquired immunity and the potential for reinfection. Key Scientific Concepts of Review: In this review paper, we proposed a new strategy to predict the potential of reinfection in each identified category. This classification may help to distribute resources more meticulously to determine: who needs to be serologically tested for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, what percentage of the population is immune to the virus, and who needs to be vaccinated.","output":"Recovery scenario and immunity in COVID-19 disease: A new strategy to predict the potential of reinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contact networks are convenient models to investigate epidemics, with nodes and links representing potential hosts and infection pathways, respectively. The outcomes of outbreak simulations on networks are driven both by the underlying epidemic model, and by the networks structural properties, so that the same pathogen can generate different epidemic dynamics on different networks. Here we ask whether there are general properties that make a contact network intrinsically vulnerable to epidemics (that is, regardless of specific epidemiological parameters). By conducting simulations on a large set of modelled networks, we show that, when a broad range of network topologies is taken into account, the effect of specific network properties on outbreak magnitude is stronger than that of fundamental pathogen features such as transmission rate, infection duration, and immunization ability. Then, by focusing on a large set of real world networks of the same type (potential contacts between field voles, Microtus agrestis), we showed how network structure can be used to accurately assess the relative, intrinsic vulnerability of networks towards a specific pathogen, even when those have limited topological variability. These results have profound implications for how we prevent disease outbreaks; in many real world situations, the topology of host contact networks can be described and used to infer intrinsic vulnerability. Such an approach can increase preparedness and inform preventive measures against emerging diseases for which limited epidemiological information is available, enabling the identification of priority targets before an epidemic event.","output":"The intrinsic vulnerability of networks to epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines and therapeutics will depend on understanding viral immunity.

Patients were included if they tested positive on SARS-CoV-2 by PCR test and if IL-6, PCT, suPAR was measured during any of the ICU admission days. There were no exclusion criteria for this study. We used joint models to predict ICU-mortality. This analysis was done using the framework of joint models for longitudinal and survival data. The reported hazard ratios express the relative change in the risk of death resulting from a doubling or 20% increase of the biomarkers value in a day compared to no change in the same period. Results: A total of 107 patients were included, of which 26 died during ICU admission. Adjusted for sex and age, a doubling in the next day in either levels of PCT, IL-6 and suPAR was significantly predictive of in-hospital mortality with and an HR of 1.523 (1.012 C 6.540), 75.25 (1.116 C 6247) and 24.45 (1.696 C 1057) respectively. With a 20% increase in biomarker value in a subsequent day, the HR of PCT, IL-6 and suPAR were 1.117 (1.03 C 1.639), 3.116 (1.029 C 9.963) and 2.319 (1.149 C 6.243) respectively. Conclusion: Joint models for the analysis of repeated measurements of PCT, suPAR and IL-6 are a useful method for predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients in the ICU. Patients with an increasing trend of biomarker levels in consecutive days are at increased risk for mortality.","output":"Joint Modeling of Repeated Measurements of Different Biomarkers Predicts Mortality in COVID-19 Patients in the Intensive Care Unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular process by which bulk cytoplasm is enveloped inside a double-membraned vesicle and shuttled to lysosomes for degradation. Within the last 15 years, the genes necessary for the execution of autophagy have been identified and the number of tools for studying this process has grown. Autophagy is essential for tissue homeostasis and development and defective autophagy is associated with a number of diseases. As intracellular parasites, during the course of an infection, viruses encounter autophagy and interact with the proteins that execute this process. Autophagy and/or autophagy genes likely play both anti-viral and pro-viral roles in the life cycles and pathogenesis of many different virus families. With respect to anti-viral roles, the autophagy proteins function in targeting viral components or virions for lysosomal degradation in a process termed xenophagy, and they also play a role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune system responses to viral infections. Consistent with this anti-viral role of host autophagy, some viruses encode virulence factors that interact with the host autophagy machinery and block the execution of autophagy. In contrast, other viruses appear to utilise components of the autophagic machinery to foster their own intracellular growth or non-lytic cellular egress. As the details of the role (s) of autophagy in viral pathogenesis become clearer, new anti-viral therapies could be developed to inhibit the beneficial and enhance the destructive aspects of autophagy on the viral life cycle.","output":"Viruses and autophagy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The FDA Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) is a leader within the agency in scientific outreach activities and regulatory science research.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the onset of hand eczema during the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare workers (HCWs) directly involved in intensive care of COVID-19 patients and HCWs without direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Hereby, we aim at increasing awareness about occupational hand eczema and preventive measures that can be adopted. METHOD: A survey was distributed amongst 114 HCWs at a single surgical centre and at a COVID-19 intensive care unit of the university hospital Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, Germany. Participants were questioned about the daily frequency of hand hygiene prior to and during the pandemic. Participants self-reported the onset of hand eczema and associated symptoms. RESULTS: Our study revealed a significant increase in hand washing, disinfection, and use of hand cream across all participants (P-value <.001), regardless of having direct contact with COVID-19 patients. A high prevalence of symptoms associated with acute hand dermatitis of 90.4% was found across all HCWs, whereas hand eczema itself was underreported (14.9%). CONCLUSION: The increase in hand sanitation during the COVID-19 pandemic impairs the skin of the hands across all HCWs, independent of direct intensive care of affected patients.","output":"Onset of occupational hand eczema among healthcare workers during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Comparing a single surgical site with a COVID-19 intensive care unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increase in subway travelers, the air quality of underground enclosed spaces at subway stations has attracted much more attention. The study of pollutants exposure assessment, especially fine particulate matter, is important in both pollutant control and metro station design. In this paper, combining pedestrian flow analysis (PFA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, a novel surrogate-assisted particulate matter exposure assessment method is proposed, in which PFA is used to analyze the spatial-temporal movement characteristics of pedestrians to simultaneously consider the location and value of the pedestrian particulate generation source and their exposure streamline to particulate matter; the CFD model is used to analyze the airflow field and particulate matter concentration field in detail. To comprehensively consider the differences in the spatial concentration distribution of particulate matter caused by the time-varying characteristics of the airflow organization state in subway stations, surrogate models reflecting the nonlinear relationship between simulated and measured data are trained to perform accurate pedestrian exposure calculations. The actual measurement data proves the validity of the simulation and calculation methods, and the difference between the calculated and experimental values of the exposure is only about 5%.","output":"Surrogate-Assisted Fine Particulate Matter Exposure Assessment in an Underground Subway Station"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Vaccine-induced population immunity is a key global strategy to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We have previously reported that hepatitis B viral RNAs are m6A modified, displaying a dual functional role in the viral life cycle. Here, we show that cellular m6A machinery regulates host innate immunity against hepatitis B and C viral (HBV/HCV) infections by inducing m6A modification of viral transcripts. The depletion of the m6A writer enzymes (METTL3 and METTL14) leads to an increase in viral RNA recognition by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), thereby stimulating type-I interferon production. This is reversed in cells, in which m6A METTL3 and METTL14 are overexpressed. The m6A modification of viral RNAs renders RIG-I signaling less effective, and while single nucleotide mutation of m6A consensus motif of viral RNAs, enhances RIG-I sensing activity. Importantly, m6A reader proteins (YTHDF2 and YTHDF3) inhibit RIG-I transduced signaling activated by viral RNAs by occupying m6A modified RNAs and inhibiting RIG-I recognition. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the mechanism of immune evasion via m6A modification of viral RNAs.","output":"N6-Methyladenosine Modification of Hepatitis B and C Viral RNAs Attenuates Host Innate Immunity via RIG-I Signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sudden increase in the COVID-19 epidemic affected by novel coronavirus 2019 has jeopardized public health worldwide Hence the necessities of a drug or therapeutic agent that heal SARS-CoV-2 infections are essential requirements The viral genome encodes a large Polyprotein, further processed by the main protease/ 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like proteases (PLpro) into 16 nonstructural proteins to form a viral replication complex These essential functions of 3CLpro and PLpro in virus duplication make these proteases a promising target for discovering potential therapeutic candidates and possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection This study aimed to screen a unique set of protease inhibitors library against 3CLpro and PLpro of the SARS-CoV-2 A molecular docking study was performed using PyRx to reveal the binding affinity of the selected ligands and molecular dynamic simulations were executed to assess the three-dimensional stability of protein-ligand complexes The pharmacodynamics parameters of the inhibitors were predicted using admetSAR The top two ligands (Nafamostat and VR23) based on docking scores were selected for further studies Selected ligands showed excellent pharmacokinetic properties with proper absorption, bioavailability and minimal toxicity Due to the emerging and efficiency of remdesivir and dexamethasone in healing COVID-19 patients, ADMET properties of the selected ligands were thus compared with it MD Simulation studies up to 100ns revealed the ligands' stability at the target proteins' binding site residues Therefore, Nafamostat and VR23 may provide potential treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 infections by potentially inhibiting virus duplication though more research is warranted","output":"Identification of Nafamostat and VR23 as COVID-19 drug candidates by targeting 3CLpro and PLpro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Real-world evidence (RWE) is derived from real-world data (RWD) sources including electronic health records, claims data, registries (disease, product) and pragmatic clinical trials.

Due to it being a highly contagious disease, the recommended measures adopted by most nations to prevent infection include social distancing and quarantine. How did these measures affect people's relationship with alcohol consumption in cultures where alcohol plays an important social role? A questionnaire-based study, designed to follow the drinking behaviour of people before and during lockdown was applied to two different cultural groups impacted by the pandemic during the strict phase of lockdown. These are the British and Spanish populations (179 participants from each country were interviewed). Considering the frequency of consumption of the alcoholic beverages evaluated (wine, beer, cider, whisky and spirits), the results showed that a significant lockdown*country interaction was observed. Overall, Spanish participants consumed alcoholic beverages less frequently during lockdown than before, while British participants reported no change in their consumption habits. Spaniards decrease in alcohol consumption is related to the absence of a social contexts while Britons seems to have adapted their consumption to the modified context. Results suggest that, alcohol consumption is a central core of the British culture, while for the Spanish, socialization is more a cultural characteristic than the alcohol itself.","output":"How has COVID-19, lockdown and social distancing changed alcohol drinking patterns?

BACKGROUND: Nurses, who make up the majority of healthcare professionals, are struggling with COVID-19, a silent war, on the front lines at the cost of their lives. The pandemic has deeply affected nurses' lives, and hundreds of nurses around the world have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and died. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative approach was used in this study. Data were collected from 18 nurses who experienced COVID-19 symptoms, with a semistructured interview form prepared based on Meleis' Transitions Theory concepts. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis technique. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist was used in the study. RESULTS: The six themes that emerged in the data analysis were emotions experienced when nurses tested positive for COVID-19, emotions experienced during the quarantine process, posttraumatic growth, methods of coping with COVID-19, nursing care after COVID-19 treatment, and metaphors about COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study showed that being diagnosed with COVID-19 caused nurses to have both positive (posttraumatic growth, empathic and psychosocial nursing care) and negative experiences (fear of death, stigma, etc.). They tried to cope with adverse situations due to COVID-19 by obtaining social support, thinking positively, and engaging in domestic activities. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: To reduce COVID-19-related physical and psychological symptoms, appropriate policies should be developed for effective and rapid nursing workforce planning, extending the time allocated for postdiagnosis treatment, updating infection control and prevention guides, training nurses, and providing ongoing psychosocial counseling services that nurses can access.","output":"Experiences of nurses diagnosed with COVID-19 in Turkey: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A polysaccharide microarray platform was prepared by immobilizing Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei polysaccharides.

We aimed to compare the efficacy of non-invasive ventilation against invasive mechanical ventilation treating respiratory failure in this disease. METHODS Retrospective analysis was conducted on all respiratory failure patients identified from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Database. Intubation rate, mortality and secondary outcome of a hospital utilizing non-invasive ventilation under standard infection control conditions (NIV Hospital) were compared against 13 hospitals using solely invasive ventilation (IMV Hospitals). Multiple logistic regression analyses with adjustments for confounding variables were performed to test for association between outcomes and hospital groups. RESULTS Both hospital groups had comparable demographics and clinical profiles, but NIV Hospital (42 patients) had higher lactate dehydrogenase ratio and worse radiographic score on admission and ribavirin-corticosteroid commencement. Compared to IMV Hospitals (451 patients), NIV Hospital had lower adjusted odds ratios for intubation (0.36, 95% CI 0.164 - 0.791, P = 0.011) and death (0.235, 95% CI 0.077 - 0.716, P = 0.011), and improved earlier after pulsed steroid rescue. There were no instances of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome among health care workers due to the use of non-invasive ventilation.

Several mechanisms, many of which still are poorly understood, are at the basis of this phenomenon. Vaccine development for lentivirus infections in general, and for HIV/AIDS in particular, has been little successful. Certain experimental lentiviral vaccines even proved to be counterproductive: they rendered vaccinated subjects more susceptible to infection rather than protecting them. For vaccine-induced enhanced susceptibility to infection with certain viruses like feline coronavirus, Dengue virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus, it has been shown that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) plays an important role. Other mechanisms may, either in the absence of or in combination with ADE, be involved. Consequently, vaccine-induced enhancement has been a major stumble block in the development of certain flavi-, corona-, paramyxo-, and lentivirus vaccines. Also recent failures in the development of a vaccine against HIV may at least in part be attributed to induction of enhanced susceptibility to infection. There may well be a delicate balance between the induction of protective immunity on the one hand and the induction of enhanced susceptibility on the other.

The coupons were placed at two controlled absolute humidity (AH) levels: a low AH of 3.0 g/m3 and a high AH of 14.4 g/m3 Phi 6 declined at a lower rate on all materials under low-AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.06-log10 PFU/day to 0.11-log10 PFU/day, than under the higher AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.65-log10 PFU/h to 1.42-log10 PFU/day. There was a significant difference in decay rates between porous and nonporous surfaces at both low AH (P < 0.0001) and high AH (P < 0.0001). Under these laboratory-simulated conditions, phi 6 was found to be a conservative surrogate for EBOV under low-AH conditions in that it persisted longer than Ebola virus in similar AH conditions. Additionally, some coronaviruses persist longer than phi 6 under similar conditions; therefore, phi 6 may not be a suitable surrogate for coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE Understanding the persistence of enveloped viruses helps inform infection control practices and procedures in health care facilities and community settings. These data convey to public health investigators that enveloped viruses can persist and remain infective on surfaces, thus demonstrating a potential risk for transmission. Under these laboratory-simulated Western indoor hospital conditions, we assessed the suitability of phi 6 as a surrogate for environmental persistence research related to enveloped viruses, including EBOV and coronaviruses.","output":"Persistence of Bacteriophage Phi 6 on Porous and Nonporous Surfaces and the Potential for Its Use as an Ebola Virus or Coronavirus Surrogate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article discussed air quality changes in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan (BTT) region. The air quality index (AQI) values, and the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, and O-3 in the BTT region during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 were, respectively, 79.4, 47.2 mu g m(-3), 73.4 mu g m(-3), 10.3 mu g m(-3), 0.87 mg m(-3), 33.6 mu g m(-3), and 90.7 mu g m(-3). However, they were, respectively, 102.7, 61.4 mu g m(-3), 121.0 mu g m(-3), 9.0 mu g m(-3), 0.88 mg m(-3), 40.1 mu g m(-3), and 84.0 mu g m(-3) during the same period in 2021, which is an increase of 29.2%, 30.1%, 64.8%, -12.9%, 1.94 %, 19.5%, and -7.4% compared with the values in 2020. The combined proportions of grade I and grade II during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 were 16.7% higher than those in the same period in 2021, so the air quality has deteriorated rapidly from 2020 to the post-COVID era in 2021. The possible reasons for poorer air quality are that the frequency of dusty weather and air pollutant discharge has increased, and meteorological conditions have been relatively unfavorable. The average AQI values, and concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, and O-3 during the post-COVID period in 2021 respectively decreased by 14.8%, 29.0%, 14.6%, 22.5%, 37.4%, 14.8%, and 8.7%, compared with those in 2020. It is also worth noting that all the changes in air pollution during the post-COVID era have been consistent. The combined proportions of grade I and grade II during post-COVID period in 2021 were 18.4% higher than those during the same period of 2020, which indicates that the air quality during post-COVID 2021 has obviously improved compared with those in the same period of 2020. The possible reasons are a series of clean air policies and clean air actions, as well as favorable atmospheric diffusion conditions.

As social distancing measures continue during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts encourage individuals with underlying conditions to engage in telehealth appointments to maintain continuity of care while minimizing risk exposure. To date, however, little information has been provided regarding telehealth uptake among this high-risk population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the telehealth use, resource needs, and information sources of individuals with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives include exploring differences in telehealth use by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Data for this study were collected through an electronic survey distributed between May 12-14, 2020, to members of 26 online health communities for individuals with chronic disease. Descriptive statistics were run to explore telehealth use, support needs, and information sources, and z tests were run to assess differences in sociodemographic factors and information and support needs among those who did and did not use telehealth services. RESULTS: Among the 2210 respondents, 1073 (49%) reported engaging in telehealth in the past 4 months. Higher proportions of women engaged in telehealth than men (890/1781, 50% vs 181/424, 43%; P=.007), and a higher proportion of those earning household incomes of more than US $100,000 engaged in telehealth than those earning less than US $30,000 (195/370, 53% vs 241/530 45%; P=.003). Although 59% (133/244) of those younger than 40 years and 54% (263/486) of those aged 40-55 years used telehealth, aging populations were less likely to do so, with only 45% (677/1500) of individuals 56 years or older reporting telehealth use (P<.001 and P=.001, respectively). Patients with cystic fibrosis, lupus, and ankylosing spondylitis recorded the highest proportions of individuals using telehealth when compared to those with other diagnoses. Of the 2210 participants, 1333 (60%) participants either looked up information about the virus online or planned to in the future, and when asked what information or support would be most helpful right now, over half (1151/2210, 52%) responded \\"understanding how COVID-19 affects people with my health condition.\\" CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of the study sample reported participating in telehealth in the past 4 months. Future efforts to engage individuals with underlying medical conditions in telehealth should focus on outreach to men, members of lower-income households, and aging populations. These results may help inform and refine future health communications to further engage this at-risk population in telehealth as the pandemic continues.","output":"Telemedicine Use and Health-Related Concerns of Patients With Chronic Conditions During COVID-19: Survey of Members of Online Health Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobial textiles are helpful tools to fight against multidrug-resistant pathogens and nosocomial infections. The deposition of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) onto textiles has been studied to achieve antimicrobial properties. Yet, due to health and environmental safety concerns associated with such formulations, processing optimizations have been introduced: biocompatible materials, environmentally friendly agents, and delivery platforms that ensure a controlled release. In particular, the functionalization of polyester (PES) fabric with antimicrobial agents is a formulation in high demand in medical textiles. However, the lack of functional groups on PES fabric hinders the development of cost-effective, durable systems that allow a controlled release of antimicrobial agents. In this work, PES fabric was functionalized with AgNPs using one or two biocompatible layers of chitosan or hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO). The addition of organo-matrices stabilized the AgNPs onto the fabrics, protected AgNPs from further oxidation, and controlled their release. In addition, the layered samples were efficient against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The sample with two layers of chitosan showed the highest efficacy against S. aureus (log reduction of 2.15  1.08 after 3 h of contact). Against E. coli, the sample with two layers of chitosan showed the best properties. Chitosan allowed to control the antimicrobial activity of AgNPs, avoid the complete loss of AgNPs after washings and act in synergy with AgNPs. After 3 h of incubation, this sample presented a log reduction of 4.81, and 7.27 of log reduction after 5 h of incubation. The antimicrobial results after washing showed a log reduction of 3.47 and 4.88 after 3 h and 5 h of contact, respectively. Furthermore, the sample with a final layer of HMDSO also presented a controlled antimicrobial effect. The antimicrobial effect was slower than the sample with just an initial layer of HMDSO, with a log reduction of 4.40 after 3 h of incubation (instead of 7.22) and 7.27 after 5 h. The biocompatibility of the composites was confirmed through the evaluation of their cytotoxicity towards HaCaT cells (cells viability > 96% in all samples). Therefore, the produced nanocomposites could have interesting applications in medical textiles once they present controlled antimicrobial properties, high biocompatibility and avoid the complete release of AgNPs to the environment.","output":"Stabilization of Silver Nanoparticles on Polyester Fabric Using Organo-Matrices for Controlled Antimicrobial Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is the biggest public health challenge in the last 100 years. No successful pharmaceutical treatment is yet available, thus effective public health interventions to contain COVID-19 include social distancing, isolation and quarantine measures. However the efficiency of these containment measures varied among countries and even within states in the same country. Despite Brazil being deeply affected by coronavirus, the federal government never proposed a coordinated action to control COVID-19 and Brazilian states, which are autonomous, each imposed different containment measures. The state of Goias declared strict social distancing measures in March 13, but gradually relaxed many of its first measures due specially to public pressure. Here we use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model combined with Bayesian inference and a time-dependent spreading rate to assess how past state-level interventions affected the spread of COVID-19 in Goias. The interventions succeeded in decreasing the transmission rate in the state, however, after the third intervention the rate remained positive and exponential. Thus, other stricter interventions were made necessary to avoid the growth of new cases and a collapse in the health system. Governmental interventions need to be taken seriously by the population in order for them have the proposed outcome.

This study elaborates Taiwan's epidemiological characteristics from the 2020 to 2021 COVID-19 pandemic from human, temporal, and geographical dimensions. Big data for cases were obtained from a public database from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in April 2021. The data were analyzed and used to compare differences, correlations, and trends for human, temporal, and geographical characteristics for imported and domestic COVID-19 cases. During the study period, 1030 cases were confirmed and the mortality rate of 1.0%. The epidemiological features indicated that most cases (953/1030, 92.5%) were imported. A comparison of the domestic confirmed and imported cases revealed the following findings: No significant difference of COVID-19 between males and females for sex was observed; For age, the risk of domestic transmission was significantly lower for 20 to 29 years old, higher for 50 to 59 years old, and >60 years old with odds ratios (ORs) (P value < .05) of 0.36, 3.37, and 2.50, respectively; For the month of infection, the ORs (P value < .05) of domestic confirmed cases during January and February 2020 were 22.428; and in terms of area of residence, the ORs (P value < .05) for domestic confirmed cases in northern and southern Taiwan were 4.473 and 0.033, respectively. Thus, the increase in domestic cases may have been caused by international travelers transmitting the virus in March 2020 and December 2020, respectively. Taiwan has been implementing effective screening and quarantine measures at airports. Moreover, Taiwan has implemented and maintained stringent interventions such as large-scale epidemiological investigation, rapid diagnosis, wearing masks, washing hands frequently, safe social distancing, and prompt clinical classifications for severe patients who were given appropriate medical measures. This is the first report comparing imported and domestic cases of COVID-19 from surveillance data from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control during January 2020 and March 2021. It illustrates that individuals infected during overseas travel are the main risk factors for the spread of COVID-19 in Taiwan.

The kinetic parameters of the SEIR-AQ model were obtained by fitting, and the parameters of the SEIR-AQ model were solved through the Euler method. Furthermore, the effects of different countries prevention and control strategies on the number of infections, the proportion of isolation, the number of deaths, and the number of recoveries were also simulated. The theoretical analysis showed that measures such as isolation for prevention and control and medical tracking isolation had a significant inhibitory effect on the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, among which stratified treatment and enhanced awareness played a key role in the rapid regression of the peak of COVID-19-infected patients.

We examine the implications of this framework for fluid flow systems, within an Eulerian position-velocity (phase space) description. The analysis invokes a hierarchy of five probability density functions, which by convolution are used to define five fluid densities and generalized densities appropriate for different spaces. We obtain 11 formulations of the generalized Reynolds transport theorem for different choices of the coordinate space, parameter space and density, only the first of which is known. These are used to generate 11 tables of integral and differential conservation laws applicable to these systems, for eight important conserved quantities (fluid mass, species mass, linear momentum, angular momentum, energy, charge, entropy and probability).

This study among MSM in the Netherlands assesses COVID-19-induced changes in numbers of sex partners, condomless anal intercourse (CAI), PrEP use, and HIV/STI testing.MethodsFrom July 20th to September 11th 2020, MSM were recruited via social media to complete an online survey. 2182 respondents (Mage=40 years) provided data on their sexual activity in 3 bimesters before the first lockdown (T1 Jan.CFeb.), during the lockdown (T2 mid-March-mid-May) and after the lockdown (T3 JuneCJuly). PrEP use and HIV/STI testing were reported per semester.ResultsThe mean number of sex partners decreased by 39% between T1 and T2 and remained 12% lower at T3 than at T1. The number of CAI partners decreased by 36% between T1 and T2, and at T3 was similar to T1. A majority (62%) of PrEP users stopped using PrEP at some point because of COVID-19, of which 73% subsequently resumed PrEP. A fifth (20%) of respondents postponed/missed appointments for STI testing and 16% postponed/missed appointments for HIV testing. Only 39% of these respondents caught up on missed testing. Self-sampling/testing accounted for 1% of HIV testing and 1.2% of STI testing in the last semester before COVID-19 (past 7C12 months), and 5.5% and 2.7% respectively in the first semester with COVID-19 (past 0C6 months).ConclusionSexual behaviours that put MSM at risk of STI or HIV acquisition were significantly reduced during the first lockdown. However, reengagement in sexual activity and CAI was rapid in the two months after the lockdown. Resumption of PrEP use after an interruption was more frequent than catching up on HIV/STI testing. Further promoting self-sampling/testing may contribute to mitigating the adverse impact of a succession of lockdowns and periods of easing of restrictions.","output":"O05.4 Changes in MSMs sexual activity, PrEP use, and access to HIV/STI testing during and after the first Dutch COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to COVID-19, educational stakeholders are transferring traditional, face-to-face instruction to the online learning environment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A Markov cohort-based (1000 patients in each study arm) model was developed and adopted a 10-year time horizon with 12-month time cycles. Cost and outcome data collected from the three-month study of 240 patients (160 in BPTM group and 80 controls, 48 y.o.). All patients started at a non-complicated HTN well state with a certain possibility of disease progression in a number of health states over a discrete time period. BPTM was compared with usual care in terms of 10-year healthcare costs, quality adjusted life years (QALY) using a Ministry of Health of Russian Federation perspective. RESULTS In the long-term run when compared with usual care BPTM was more effective in terms mortality (67 versus 91 patients lost and 9.6 versus 9.71 life years gained) and costs (cost of illness 102 508 000 RUR versus 145 237 700 RUR).

Here, we developed a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) cell culture system for production of transcription and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles (trVLP). This trVLP expresses a reporter gene (GFP) replacing viral nucleocapsid gene (N), which is required for viral genome packaging and virion assembly (SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N trVLP). The complete viral life cycle can be achieved and exclusively confined in the cells ectopically expressing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, but not MERS-CoV N. Genetic recombination of N supplied in trans into viral genome was not detected, as evidenced by sequence analysis after one-month serial passages in the N-expressing cells.

To account for potential confounding, I assemble a dataset that includes 50 county-level factors that are potentially related to residential segregation and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. These factors are grouped into eight categories: demographics, density and potential for public interaction, social capital, health risk factors, capacity of the health care system, air pollution, employment in essential businesses, and political views.

Counties that are 1 SD above the racial segregation mean have experienced mortality and infection rates that are 8% and 5% higher than the mean. These differences represent an average of four additional deaths and 105 additional infections for each 100,000 residents in the county.

Little is known regarding North American patterns of practice or the limiting factors and strategies for adoption among surgeons. METHODS We sent a 28-item questionnaire to all general surgeon members of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. We derived descriptive and correlative information using chi(2), Wilcoxon rank sum and Student t tests and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS The return rate was 55% (694/1266). A total of 67% (462/694; 95% confidence interval 63%-70%) of respondents perform colorectal surgery. Of these, 54% perform laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Multivariate logistic regression identified 5 factors related to performing laparoscopic colorectal surgery: fewer years in practice (p < 0.001), male sex (p = 0.015), practising in the province of Quebec (p = 0.005), university-hospital affiliation (p = 0.034) and minimally invasive surgery fellowship training (p = 0.023). Lack of adequate operating time and formal training were the main reasons cited by surgeons not offering laparoscopic colon resections. Most surgeons (67%) felt that site visits from a minimally invasive surgeon would represent the most effective training method for acquiring advanced laparoscopic skills. CONCLUSION About half of Canadian general surgeons offer laparoscopic colorectal resections. Recent graduation, male sex, practice location, university-hospital affiliation and minimally invasive surgery training are significant predictors for offering a laparoscopic approach. Lack of operative time and formal training are the main barriers to adoption of the technique. Site visits by trained laparoscopic surgeons is the preferred method of acquiring advanced skills.","output":"The adoption of laparoscopic colorectal surgery: a national survey of general surgeons."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Federal data underestimate the impact of COVID-19 on US nursing homes because federal reporting guidelines did not require facilities to report case and death data until the week ending May 24, 2020. OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of unreported cases and deaths in the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) and provide national estimates of cases and deaths adjusted for nonreporting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a cross-sectional study comparing COVID-19 cases and deaths reported by US nursing homes to the NHSN with those reported to state departments of health in late May 2020. The sample includes nursing homes from 20 states, with 4598 facilities in 12 states that required facilities to report cases and 7401 facilities in 19 states that required facilities to report deaths. Estimates of nonreporting were extrapolated to infer the national (15 397 facilities) unreported cases and deaths in both May and December 2020. Data were analyzed from December 2020 to May 2021. EXPOSURES: Nursing home ownership (for-profit or not-for-profit), chain affiliation, size, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services star rating, and state. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the difference between the COVID-19 cases and deaths reported by each facility to their state department of health vs those reported to the NHSN. RESULTS: Among 15 415 US nursing homes, including 4599 with state case data and 7405 with state death data, a mean (SE) of 43.7% (1.4%) of COVID-19 cases and 40.0% (1.1%) of COVID-19 deaths prior to May 24 were not reported in the first NHSN submission in sample states, suggesting that 68 613 cases and 16 623 deaths were omitted nationwide, representing 11.6% of COVID-19 cases and 14.0% of COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents in 2020. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that federal NHSN data understated total cases and deaths in nursing homes. Failure to account for this issue may lead to misleading conclusions about the role of different facility characteristics and state or federal policies in explaining COVID outbreaks.","output":"Estimates of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Among Nursing Home Residents Not Reported in Federal Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic ravages the globe causing unprecedented health and economic challenges As the world prospects for a cure, scientists are looking critically at strategic protein targets within the SARS-CoV-2 that have therapeutic significance The Helicase is one of such targets and it is an enzyme that affects all facets of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA metabolism This study is aimed at identifying small molecules from natural products that have strong binding affinity with and exhibit inhibitory activity against an allosteric site (Pocket 26) on the SARS-CoV-2 Helicase The molecular docking simulations of SARS-CoV-2 Helicase (QHD43415-12 pdb) against a library of small molecules obtained from edible African plants was executed using PyRx Triphenylmethane, which had a docking score of-7 4 kcal/mol on SARS CoV-2 Helicase was chosen as a reference compound Based on the molecular descriptors of the compounds as provided by PubChem, a virtual screening for oral bioavailability was performed Further screening for molar refractivity, pharmacokinetic properties, and bioactivity were performed using SwissADME, pkCSM, and Molinspiration webservers respectively Molecular dynamic simulation and analyses were performed using the Galaxy webserver which uses the GROMACS software The lead compounds are Gibberellin A12, A20, and A51 obtained from Green peas and the Okra plant Gibberellin A20 and A51 were predicted to perform better than the standard and Gibberellin A51 showed the greatest inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 Helicase ? 2021 Rowaiye et al and the authors","output":"In silico identification of potential allosteric inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 helicase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Facing COVID-19 epidemic, many countries have recently strengthened epidemic prevention and control measures The reliability of safety management is of great significance to personnel management and control during the COVID-19 epidemic period The focus of security management of early warning is to monitor and identify the moving target The current optical flow method is vulnerable to the influence of light changes and background movement, and it is not very accurate for moving target detection in dynamic complex background In this paper, aiming at the traditional Lucas Kanade optical flow method, the inter frame difference method, mean shift clustering algorithm and morphological processing are combined to optimize and improve on the original basis, so that the moving target detection effect in both simple and complex environments is significantly improved At the same time, the improved algorithm also reduces the execution time to a certain extent, and has a certain resistance to noise interference such as light changes This has a certain ability test value for personnel control during the epidemic ? 2020 - IOS Press and the authors All rights reserved","output":"A method of security management of early warning based on mean shift algorithm and data mining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To document the outcome and determine prognostic factors for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome who require admission to an intensive care unit. DESIGN: Observational cohort study involving retrospective analysis of demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data. SETTING: Adult intensive care unit in a tertiary referral university hospital involved in a major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). PATIENTS: The first 54 patients admitted with SARS to an intensive care unit (ICU). All were treated with corticosteroids, ribavirin, broad spectrum antimicrobials and supportive therapy. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: All patients were admitted for respiratory failure. The median APACHE II score was 11 (interquartile range 8C13). At 28 days 34 patients (63%; 95% CI 49.6C74.6) were alive and not mechanically ventilated. Six patients were alive but ventilated (11.3%; 95% confidence interval 5.3C22.6) and 14 had died (25.9%; CI 16.1C38.9). Seven of 27 ventilated patients developed evidence of barotrauma (25.9%; 95% CI 13.2C44.7). Median maximal multiple-organ dysfunction score was 5 (interquartile range 3.3C9). Median maximal respiratory dysfunction score was 3 (interquartile range 3C4). Increased age, severity of illness, lymphocyte count, decreased steroid dose, positive fluid balance, chronic disease or immunosuppression and nosocomial sepsis were associated with poor outcome on univariate analysis. Poor outcome was defined as death or need for mechanical ventilation at 28 days after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality amongst critically ill patients with SARS is high. It causes predominantly severe respiratory failure, with little other organ failure, and a high incidence of barotrauma amongst those requiring mechanical ventilation.

A review was performed in relation to the psychosocial vulnerabilities of the older adults during the pandemic, with insights from the similar biological disasters in the past. Besides the physiological risk, morbidities, polypharmacy and increased case fatality rates, various social factors like lack of security, loneliness, isolation, ageism, sexism, dependency, stigma, abuse and restriction to health care access were identified as crucial in pandemic situation.

However, in recent years, there has been a decline in the number of Australians choosing to purchase private health insurance (PHI), particularly within the young adult age group with the proportion of insurance customers aged 20 to 29 falling from 10.3 to 9.4% between 2012 and 2017 (Sivey, The Conversation, 2017). Young adults are critical to private health insurance funding models as their involvement offsets the drawdown by older adults (Dalzell and Borys, ABC News, 2019). While this issue is widely reported in the Australian media, few empirical studies have explored the factors that enable or constrain young adults' enrolment in PHI. METHODS To address the scarcity of research about the motivational factors behind young adult decision-making, this study conducted a survey of 594 Australian young adults aged between 18 and 30 years. Within this age group, the survey sought an equal split of participants who were members and non-members of PHI schemes. CONCLUSION The findings identified perceived value and trust in insurers as additional motivational factors alongside traditional measures of recognition of the problem and involvement in the problem. Differences between the insured and uninsured groups were identified which help to shape a more holistic understanding of the key motivational factors and barriers in relation to Australian young adults' enrolment in PHI.","output":"Determinants of attitude and intention towards private health insurance: a comparison of insured and uninsured young adults in Australia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flagellar beating drives sperm through the female reproductive tract and is vital for reproduction. Flagellar waves are generated by thousands of asymmetric molecular components; yet, paradoxically, forward swimming arises via symmetric side-to-side flagellar movement. This led to the preponderance of symmetric flagellar control hypotheses. However, molecular asymmetries must still dictate the flagellum and be manifested in the beat. Here, we reconcile molecular and microscopic observations, reconnecting structure to function, by showing that human sperm uses asymmetric and anisotropic controls to swim. High-speed three-dimensional (3D) microscopy revealed two coactive transversal controls: An asymmetric traveling wave creates a one-sided stroke, and a pulsating standing wave rotates the sperm to move equally on all sides. Symmetry is thus achieved through asymmetry, creating the optical illusion of bilateral symmetry in 2D microscopy. This shows that the sperm flagellum is asymmetrically controlled and anisotropically regularized by fast-signal transduction. This enables the sperm to swim forward.","output":"Human sperm uses asymmetric and anisotropic flagellar controls to regulate swimming symmetry and cell steering."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa despite widely available preventive therapies such as prophylactic benzathine penicillin G (BPG). In this study, we sought to characterize facilitators and barriers to optimal RHD treatment with BPG in Sudan. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study, collecting survey data from 397 patients who were enrolled in a national RHD registry between July and November 2017. The cross-sectional surveys included information on demographics, healthcare access, and patient perspectives on treatment barriers and facilitators. Factors associated with increased likelihood of RHD treatment adherence to prophylactic BPG were assessed by using adjusted logistic regression. These data were enhanced by focus group discussions with 20 participants, to further explore health system factors impacting RHD care. RESULTS: Our quantitative analysis revealed that only 32% of the study cohort reported optimal prophylaxis adherence. Younger age, reduced primary RHD healthcare facility wait time, perception of adequate health facility staffing, increased treatment costs, and high patient knowledge about RHD were significantly associated with increased odds of treatment adherence. Qualitative data revealed significant barriers to RHD treatment arising from health services factors at the health system level, including lack of access due to inadequate healthcare staffing, lack of faith in local healthcare systems, poor ancillary services, and patient lack of understanding of disease. Facilitators of RHD treatment included strong interpersonal support. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple patient and system-level barriers to RHD prophylaxis adherence were identified in Khartoum, Sudan. These included patient self-efficacy and participant perception of healthcare facility quality.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the presence of COVID-19 symptoms and adherence to CMS in Latin American adults. METHODS: We carried out a secondary analysis of a database developed by the University of Maryland and Facebook social network during the COVID-19 pandemic. We included Latin American adults that used the Facebook platform and participated in a survey conducted from April 23 to May 23, 2020. The principal outcome variable was reported compliance with the three main CMS (physical distancing, use of face masks, and hand washing). The exposure variable included symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 defined as the presence of three or more symptoms of an acute clinical case of COVID-19. We performed generalized linear models of the Poisson family with a logarithmic link function to evaluate the association between the presence of COVID-19 symptoms and reported compliance with CMS. We calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: We analyzed 1,310,690 adults from Latin America; 48.1% were male and 42.9% were under 35 years of age. The prevalence of suspicious symptoms of COVID-19 was 18.5% and reported compliance with the three CMS was 45.3%. The countries with the highest proportion of reported compliance with the three CMS were Peru, Bolivia and Panama, while those with the lowest reported compliance were Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras. In the adjusted model, people with suspicious symptoms for COVID-19 had a 15% lower compliance with the three CMS (aPR=0.86; 95%CI: 0.85-0.87; p<0.001).

However, the associations of body composition and fat distribution with psoriasis have not been fully defined. Objectives. To identify whether patients with psoriatic disease, including psoriatic arthritis, have altered body composition compared with the general population, and to review existing modalities for the assessment of body composition. Methods. Electronic searches of the literature were conducted in PubMed, Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register and Google Scholar. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by two authors independently against a set of prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results. Twenty-five full text articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final narrative analysis. The studies were of heterogeneous design and used a range of objective measures to assess body composition, including simple anthropometric measures, bioimpedance analysis (BIA), dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT). Few studies met all the quality assessment criteria. Conclusions. Patients with psoriatic disease reveal defined body composition changes that are independent of obesity and the customary metabolic syndrome, including higher overall body fat, visceral fat and sarcopenia. These findings emphasize that patients with psoriatic disease should be screened for abnormal adipose effects beyond their weight and body mass index (BMI). Our findings show that the last decade has seen an exciting expansion of research interest in the development and validation of new modalities for the assessment of body composition.

Procedure-related mortality is extremely rare. However, the presence of an ostomy may be associated with significant morbidity. Complications negatively affect the quality of life of ostomates. Preoperative stoma site marking can reduce stoma-related complications and is recommended by several guidelines. However, there is no consensus on the procedure and recommendations are based on low-quality evidence. The objective of the systematic review will be to investigate if preoperative stoma site marking compared to no preoperative marking in patients undergoing intestinal stoma surgery reduces or prevents the rate of stoma-related complications. METHODS: We will include (cluster-) randomised controlled trials and cohort studies that involve patients with intestinal ostomies comparing preoperative stoma site marking to no preoperative marking and report at least one patient-relevant outcome. For study identification, we will systematically search MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL and CINHAL as well as Google Scholar, trial registries, conference proceedings and reference lists. Additionally, we will contact experts in the field. Two reviewers will independently perform study selection and data extraction. Outcomes will be prioritised based on findings from telephone interviews with five ostomates and five ostomy and wound nurses prior to conducting the review. Outcomes may include but are not limited to stoma-related complications (infection, parastomal abscess, hernia, mucocutaneous separation, dermatological complications, stoma necrosis, stenosis, retraction and prolapse) or other patient-relevant postoperative endpoints (quality of life, revision rate, dependence on professional care, mortality, length of stay and readmission). We will use the ROBINS-I or the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. We will perform a meta-analysis and assess the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. DISCUSSION: With the results of the systematic review, we aim to provide information for future clinical guidelines and influence clinical routine with regard to preoperative stoma site marking in patients undergoing ostomy surgery.

However, the influence of anti-IL-17A on the composition of the immune system is not apparent. Our prospective study was to explore the changes in immune imbalance regarding T cell, B cell and natural killer (NK) cell subsets after secukinumab treatment in AS patients. Methods: Immune cell distribution of 43 AS patients treated with secukinumab for 12 weeks and 47 healthy controls (HC) were evaluated. Flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies against 25 surface markers was accomplished to explore the frequencies of lineage subsets. The differences between HC, AS pre-treatment, and post-treatment were compared using the paired Wilcoxon test, Mann-Whitney U test, and ANOVA. Results: AS patients had altered immune cell distribution regarding T cell and B cell subsets. Apart from activated differentiation of CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell and B cell, higher levels of cytotoxic T (Tc) two cells and Tc17 cells were noted in AS patients. We confirmed that helper T (Th) one cell became decreased; however, Th17 cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) 17 cells went increased in AS. After 12 weeks of secukinumab therapy, CRP and ASDAS became significantly decreased, and meanwhile, the proportions of Th1 cells, Tfh17 cells and classic switched B cells were changed towards those of HC. A decreased CRP was positively correlated with a decrease in the frequency of na?ve CD8+ T cells (p = 0.039) and B cells (p = 0.007) after secukinumab treatment. An elevated level of T cells at baseline was detected in patients who had a good response to secukinumab (p = 0.005). Conclusion: Our study confirmed that AS patients had significant multiple immune cell dysregulation.

This review surveys the current telemedicine landscape and discusses associated limitations and opportunities. RECENT FINDINGS Logistic considerations and regulatory changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic have spurred a proliferation of tele-neuro-ophthalmic practice. One significant benefit of telemedicine is increased access to the limited number of neuro-ophthalmologists in the country. Certain elements of the neuro-ophthalmic examination can be ascertained during a video visit or through the use of mobile applications. However, data quality can be limited and more direct evaluation of the fundus currently requires the implementation of imaging techniques, such as fundus photography and/or optical coherence tomography. For cases that require it, a 'hybrid' model can be adopted in which patients physically present to designated locations for testing and subsequently participate in televisit with the physician to discuss the assessment and plan.

The theoretical axiom C mental health as a development priority C is today expected to drive the focus of research efforts and orient the future policies and funds expenditures, at global and local level. According to these premises, it becomes central to track the international trajectories of mental health research and how the different countries are progressively defining their role in the global mental health effort. In this paper we have focused on China. In light of heavy burden of mental and substance use disorders affecting this country, and considering the impact of this burden at a global level, a basic research was conducted with the main aim of offering a preliminary view on the Chinese scientific activity within the context of global mental health research. This study is not intended to assess the quality of Chinese research, but merely to retrieve and measure a specific output of this research: the articles in mental-health produced by Chinese institutions based in mainland China, published in international journals. Although the publication of articles in internationally indexed journals in not exhaustive of China's scientific activity in global mental health, it is nevertheless informative of the production of new knowledge, it allows an assessment of the impact of this knowledge at the global scientific community level and it could partially reflect the Chinese capacity to benefit from research conducted globally. OBJECTIVE: In consideration of the very limited number of studies assessing the collective evidence of Chinese research in mental health, we developed our analysis with the purpose of providing a preliminary picture of the Chinese contribution, in terms of scientific publications, in this field of knowledge. Our research performs a bibliometric analysis on the articles in mental-health produced by Chinese institutions based in mainland China and published in English-language SCI-E and SSCI journals from 1990 to 2019, providing a measure of the impact of this research at the global scientific community level. METHODS: We performed a search on the Web of Science (WoS) using seven mental and substance use disorders according to their global prevalence, as per estimates of the Global Burden of Disease 2019. A dataset including the overall number of publications for seven diseases was created and exported in InCites. The dataset was analysed on the basis of 11 research areas (WoS categories) to which mental health topic is associated in SCI-E and SSCI journals in WoS. We further extracted publications that originated in mainland China. The citational trends over time are calculated with nonparametric test for trends across ordered groups. An evaluation of the impact of the Chinese scientific production is provided by the number of citations received at the global scientific community level, both as average and percentile. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2020 the overall Chinese scientific production in mental health has been generally increasing, reaching the highest growth in the last decade. A statistically significant increase (p < 0.001) is reported for articles produced by Chinese institutions in mainland China regarding depression*, bipolar disorders* and schizophrenia*. Published Chinese research is mostly included in SCI-E journals. There is a substantial overlap regarding the average number of citations for articles in mental-health produced by Chinese institutions and the rest of the world. Despite the increasing trend, the percentage of articles in mental health produced by Chinese institutions in mainland China on the overall scientific production worldwide is below 10%. CONCLUSION: Notwithstanding a substantial increase in the last decade, the volume of Chinese publications appears to be very limited, thus resulting in a relatively low impact at a global level.

The article proposes new definitional statements of proportionate and disproportionate policy designs that vary according to the extent to which the main design properties are adjusted to low-quality information. It also explores distinct variations in a few policy characteristics resulting from over- and under-design. The policy characteristics examined here include economic efficiency, policy effectiveness, policy robustness; the space for making significant changes at a later stage when high-quality information becomes available; the potential consequences in terms of policy over- and under-reaction; and the political ramifications of these suboptimal designs for elected executives. With regard to the interaction between technical and political logics, the article posits that deliberate policy over- and under-design can be viewed as solutions to serious political problems faced by elected executives, especially in politically sensitive times. Therefore, it facilitates a more realistic understanding of the conditions under which a policy is under- or over-designed to respond to some objectives but entirely proportionate with regard to others.","output":"Policy over- and under-design: an information quality perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The development of rigorous, high-quality clinical guidelines increases the need for resources and skilled personnel within guideline-producing organizations. While collaboration between organizations provides a unique opportunity to pool resources and save time and effort, the collaboration presents its own unique challenges. OBJECTIVE To assess the perceived needs and current challenges of guideline producers worldwide related to guideline development and collaboration efforts. DESIGN Survey questions were developed by the Guidelines International Network and the US GRADE Network, pilot-tested among attendees of a guideline development workshop, and disseminated electronically using convenience and snowball sampling methods. PARTICIPANTS A total of 171 respondents representing 30 countries and more than 112 unique organizations were included in this analysis. MAIN MEASURES The survey included free-response, multiple-choice, and seven-point Likert-scale questions. Questions assessed respondents' perceived value of guidelines, resource availability and needs, guideline development processes, and collaboration efforts of their organization. KEY RESULTS Time required to develop high-quality systematic reviews and guidelines was the most relevant need (median=7; IQR=5.5-7). In-house resources to conduct literature searches (median=4; IQR=3-6) and the resources to develop rigorous guidelines rapidly (median=4; IQR=2-5) were perceived as the least available resources. Difficulties reconciling differences in guideline methodology (median=6; IQR=4-7) and the time required to establish collaborative agreements (median=6; IQR=5-6) were the most relevant barriers to collaboration between organizations. Results also indicated a general need for improvement in conflict of interest (COI) disclosure policies. CONCLUSION The survey identified organizational challenges in supporting rigorous guideline development, including the time, resources, and personnel required. Connecting guideline developers to existing databases of high-quality systematic reviews and the use of freely available online platforms may facilitate guideline development. Guideline-producing organizations may also consider allocating resources to hiring or training personnel with expertise in systematic review methodologies or utilizing resources more effectively by establishing collaborations with other organizations.","output":"An International Needs Assessment Survey of Guideline Developers Demonstrates Variability in Resources and Challenges to Collaboration between Organizations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Given the magnitude and speed of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, achieving timely and effective manual contact tracing has been a challenging task. Early in the pandemic, contact tracing apps generated substantial enthusiasm due to their potential for automating tracing and reducing transmission rates while enabling targeted confinement strategies. However, although surveys demonstrate public interest in using such apps, their actual uptake remains limited. Their social acceptability is challenged by issues around privacy, fairness, and effectiveness, among other concerns. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the extent to which design and implementation considerations for contact tracing apps are detailed in the available literature, focusing on aspects related to participatory and responsible eHealth innovation, and synthesize recommendations that support the development of successful COVID-19 contact tracing apps and related eHealth technologies. METHODS: Searches were performed on five databases, and articles were selected based on eligibility criteria. Papers pertaining to the design, implementation, or acceptability of contact tracing apps were included. Articles published since 2019, written in English or French, and for which the full articles were available were considered eligible for analysis. To assess the scope of the knowledge found in the current literature, we used three complementary frameworks: (1) the Holistic Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies, (2) the Montreal model, and (3) the Responsible Innovation in Health Assessment Tool. RESULTS: A total of 63 articles qualified for the final analysis. Less than half of the selected articles cited the need for a participatory process (n=25, 40%), which nonetheless was the most frequently referenced item of the Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies. Regarding the Montreal model, stakeholder consultation was the most frequently described level of engagement in the development of contact tracing apps (n=24, 38%), while collaboration and partnership were cited the least (n=2, 3%). As for the Responsible Innovation in Health framework, all the articles (n=63, 100%) addressed population health, whereas only 2% (n=1) covered environmental considerations. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies lacked fundamental aspects of eHealth development and implementation. Our results demonstrate that stakeholders of COVID-19 contact tracing apps lack important information to be able to critically appraise this eHealth innovation. This may have contributed to the modest uptake of contact tracing apps worldwide. We make evidence-informed recommendations regarding data management, communication, stakeholder engagement, user experience, and implementation strategies for the successful and responsible development of contact tracing apps.","output":"Considerations for the Design and Implementation of COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is largely driven by community transmission, after 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) crosses the borders. To stop the spread, rapid testing is required at community clinics and hospitals. These rapid tests should be comparable with the standard PCR technology. Isothermal amplification technology provides an excellent alternative that is highly amenable to resource limited settings, where expertise and infrastructure to support PCR are not available. In this review, we provide a brief description of isothermal amplification technology, its potential and the gaps that need to be considered for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Among this emerging technology, loop-mediated amplification (LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and Nicking enzyme-assisted reaction (NEAR) technologies have been identified as potential platforms that could be implemented at community level, without samples referral to a centralized laboratory and prolonged turnaround time associated with the standard COVID-19 RT-PCR test. LAMP, for example, has recently been shown to be comparable with PCR and could be performed in less than 30 min by non-laboratory staff, without RNA extractions commonly associated with PCR. Interestingly, NEAR (ID NOW? COVID-19 (Abbott, IL, USA) was able to detect the virus in 5 min.

However, infection control policies were developed in the face of uncertainty about duration of infectivity, routes of transmission, and safety of shared admission spaces. We retrospectively reviewed all hospital admissions to the University Hospitals of Leicester (UHL) respiratory department, which managed more than 30% of UHL patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 2020 and March 2021to determine the proportion of cases with laboratory evidence of healthcare associated infection (HCAI) and mortality within 28 days of PCR conversionMethodsThis was a retrospective cohort study performed using a bespoke database collating COVID-19 throat swab (TS) PCR results for UHL (COVTRACK). Nosocomial transmission was identified by demonstrating PCR conversions during admission and categorized into definite (conversion time > 14 days) or probable (conversion time 8C14 days). In depth records based analysis was undertaken for patients admitted to respiratory medicine (RM) and deceased within 28 days after conversion.ResultsOut of 10485 patients admitted to the Respiratory Department at UHL, 2054 (19.6%) were COVID-19 spell positive, including 57 with probable (41) or definite HCAI (16). 23 patients (7 with definite HCAI) died within 28 days of PCR conversion (0.22%, of total admitted, 1.1% of COVID19 positive), with 21 (91%) deaths in the 2nd wave. Compared with non-COVID admissions not acquiring nosocomial infection, HCAI was significantly associated with older age (mean difference (95%CI) 11.5 (7.5C15.5) years), length of stay (median LOS 18 Vs 1 day) and multiple ward occupancy (median 3 vs 1 ward);all analyses p<0.001.DiscussionOur analysis suggests HCAI with SARS-COV-2 contributed a very small fraction of COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality at our department and in the majority the trajectory of care was not changed. Despite the high numbers of highly infectious cases during the 1st and 2nd wave, we successfully implemented a suite of infection control measures that effectively mitigated risk.

ESBL-producing bacteria are typically resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and result in a sizeable economic and public health burden. AmpC-producing Enterobacterales may develop third-generation cephalosporin resistance through enzyme hyper-expression. In no observational study has the outcome of treatment of these infections been surpassed by carbapenems. Widespread use of carbapenems may drive the development of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. METHODS: This study will use a multicentre, parallel group open-label non-inferiority trial design comparing ceftolozane-tazobactam and meropenem in adult patients with bloodstream infection caused by ESBL or AmpC-producing Enterobacterales. Trial recruitment will occur in up to 40 sites in six countries (Australia, Singapore, Italy, Spain, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon). The sample size is determined by a predefined quantity of ceftolozane-tazobactam to be supplied by Merck, Sharpe and Dohme (MSD). We anticipate that a trial with 600 patients contributing to the primary outcome analysis would have 80% power to declare non-inferiority with a 5% non-inferiority margin, assuming a 30-day mortality of 5% in both randomised groups. Once randomised, definitive treatment will be for a minimum of 5 days and a maximum of 14 days with the total duration determined by treating clinicians. Data describing demographic information, risk factors, concomitant antibiotics, illness scores, microbiology, multidrug-resistant organism screening, discharge and mortality will be collected. DISCUSSION: Participants will have bloodstream infection due to third-generation cephalosporin non-susceptible E. coli and Klebsiella spp. or Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. or Serratia marcescens. They will be randomised 1:1 to ceftolozane-tazobactam 3 g versus meropenem 1 g, both every 8 h.

METHODS: Analysis of Englands Hospital Episode Statistics from the Health and Social Care Information Centre and population data from the United Kingdoms Office for National Statistics. RESULTS: Episodes of retinal detachments with breaks increased year on year from 3447 (7.0/100 M) in 2000 to 10,971 (19.7/100 M) in 2018 (p < 0.001), whereas records of tractional retinal detachment increased from 290 (0.6/100 M) to 910 (1.6/100 M) in the same period (p < 0.0001). The number of reported pars plana vitrectomies irrespective of indication increased over fourfold from 5761 to 26,900 (p < 0.0001), while the number of scleral buckling records decreased by two thirds from 2897 to 780 (p < 0.0001).

CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of admissions to hospital for surgically treated retinal detachment seems to have been increasing significantly since 2000. This effect is more marked in cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. This may be explained by increased incidence of disease (due to increased rates of cataract surgery, increasing longevity and increasing rates of myopia) as well as repeat surgery in cases of recurrent retinal detachment.

Data on the mobility level of patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) are needed. OBJECTIVE: To describe the mobility level of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU and to address factors associated with mobility level at the time of ICU discharge. METHODS: Single center, retrospective cohort study. Consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with confirmed COVID-19 infection were analyzed. The mobility status was assessed by the Perme Score at admission and discharge from ICU with higher scores indicating higher mobility level. The Perme Mobility Index (PMI) was calculated [PMI = &#916;Perme Score (ICU discharge-ICU admission)/ICU length of stay]. Based on the PMI, patients were divided into two groups: \\"Improved\\" (PMI > 0) and \\"Not improved\\" (PMI &#8804; 0). RESULTS: A total of 136 patients were included in this analysis. The hospital mortality rate was 16.2%. The Perme Score improved significantly when comparing ICU discharge with ICU admission [20.0 (7-28) points versus 7.0 (0-16) points; P < 0.001]. A total of 88 patients (64.7%) improved their mobility level during ICU stay, and the median PMI of these patients was 1.5 (0.6-3.4). Patients in the improved group had a lower duration of mechanical ventilation [10 (5-14) days versus 15 (8-24) days; P = 0.021], lower hospital length of stay [25 (12-37) days versus 30 (11-48) days; P < 0.001], and lower ICU and hospital mortality rate. Independent predictors for mobility level were lower age, lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, and not having received renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: Patients' mobility level was low at ICU admission; however, most patients improved their mobility level during ICU stay.

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-strand RNA virus and its genomic characterization has played a vital role in the design of appropriate diagnostics tests. The current RT-PCR protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detects two regions of the viral genome, requiring RNA extraction and several hours. There is a need for fast, simple, and cost-effective detection strategies. Methods: we optimized a protocol for direct RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for nucleic acid extraction. Nasopharyngeal samples were diluted to 1:3 using diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. The diluted samples were incubated at 95 C for 5 min in a thermal cycler, followed by a cooling step at 4 C for 5 min. Samples then underwent reverse transcription real-time RT-PCR in the E and RdRp genes. Results: our direct detection protocol showed 100% concordance with the standard protocol with an average Ct value difference of 4.38 for the E region and 3.85 for the RdRp region. Conclusion: the direct PCR technique was found to be a reliable and sensitive method that can be used to reduce the time and cost of the assay by removing the need for RNA extraction.

Forty-six dual caregivers in rural southwest Virginia participated in one semi-structured telephone interview pre-pandemic. Of these caregivers, nine dual caregivers of multiple older adults (MOA) and six caregivers of multiple generations (MG) participated in two telephone interviews during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-pandemic health, stress, and support data were used to compare dual caregivers of MOA and MG;differences were minimal. Responses to interviews conducted during the pandemic highlighted the effects of social restrictions on MOA and MG caregivers, revealing five themes (1) Increased isolation, (2) Increased need for vigilance, (3) Negative impact on mental health, (4) Tendency to do it all, and (5) Increased informal help. MOA and MG caregivers differed on managing care responsibilities and ensuring the health of care recipients. In general, dual caregivers experienced decreased mental health, increased social isolation, and increased caregiving responsibilities. Antecedents of the pandemic experiences differentiated MOA and MG caregiver. Findings suggest that programs and services should target dual caregivers unique needs.","output":"Dual Caregivers of Persons living with Dementia: The Added Stress of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This randomized clinical trial aimed to determine feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of brief Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills videos in reducing psychological distress among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over six weeks, 153 undergraduates at a large, public American university completed pre-assessment, intervention, and post-assessment periods. During the intervention, participants were randomized to receive animated DBT skills videos for 14 successive days (n = 99) or continue assessment (n = 54). All participants received 4x daily ecological momentary assessments on affect, self-efficacy of managing emotions, and unbearableness of emotions. The study was feasible and the intervention was acceptable, as demonstrated by moderate to high compliance rates and video ratings. There were significant pre-post video reductions in negative affect and increases in positive affect. There was a significant time  condition interaction on unbearableness of emotions; control participants rated their emotions as more unbearable in the last four vs. first two weeks, whereas the intervention participants did not rate their emotions as any more unbearable. Main effects of condition on negative affect and self-efficacy were not significant. DBT skills videos may help college students avoid worsening mental health.

The mental health effects of this pandemic can be severe considering that each year close to 800.000 people die by suicide. This pandemic could increase those numbers, although this is not inevitable.ObjectivesThis work reviewed the current available data on possible causes for a suicide rate increase and to try to understand if suicide is already increasing worldwide.MethodsNon-systematic review of the literature with selection of scientific articles published in the past 6 months;by searching Pubmed and Medscape databases using the combination of MeSH descriptors. The following MeSH terms were used: Covid-19;suicide;SARS-Cov2;pandemic.ResultsMultiple factors can account for an increase in suicide rates such as isolation with a sense of decreased belongingness and increased burdensomeness. A synergy with known suicide precipitants can also occur such as domestic violence, intra-familiar conflicts, alcohol consumption and access to means. Media communication can represent a danger with constant reports about the crisis. And lastly the loss of employment and financial stressors can produce an important impact.ConclusionsIn conclusion, Covid-19 will produce an important impact in many spheres of society, one of which will be mental health. If at the start of this crisis a widespread sense of solidarity was present with the maintenance of precipitant factors for suicide we expect to see an increase in suicide rates.","output":"Suicide: The pandemic inside the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate and rank the e-shops of the top Greek coffee chains, based on their electronic service quality.

In this context, genomic databases will constitute an important source of information. Consequently, it is important to identify and characterize the States role and authority on matters related to public health, in order to verify whether it has access to such databases while engaging in public health genomic research. We first consider the evolution of the concept of public health, as well as its core functions, using a comparative approach (e.g. WHO, PAHO, CDC and the Canadian province of Quebec). Following an analysis of relevant Quebec legislation, the precautionary principle is examined as a possible avenue to justify State access to and use of genomic databases for research purposes. Finally, we consider the Influenza pandemic plans developed by WHO, Canada, and Quebec, as examples of key tools framing public health decision-making process. We observed that State powers in public health, are not, in Quebec, well adapted to the expansion of genomics research. We propose that the scope of the concept of research in public health should be clear and include the following characteristics: a commitment to the health and well-being of the population and to their determinants; the inclusion of both applied research and basic research; and, an appropriate model of governance (authorization, follow-up, consent, etc.).

The frequency of these impairments and their specificity as a potential central nervous system function biomarker are of great interest as a diagnostic clue for CoViD-19 infection as opposed to other similar symptomatologic diseases and because of their implication in viral pathogenesis. Here severe CoViD-19 was investigated by comparing self-report vs. testing of smell and taste, thus the objective severity of olfactory impairment and their possible correlation with other symptoms. Because a significant discrepancy between smell and taste testing vs. self-report results (p < 0.001) emerges in our result, we performed a statistical analysis highlighting disagreement among normosmia (p < 0.05), hyposmia, severe hyposmia, and anosmia (p < 0.001) and, in hypogeusia and severe hypogeusia, while no differences are observed in normogeusia and ageusia. Therefore, we analyzed the olfactory threshold by an objective test revealing the distribution of hyposmic (34%), severe hyposmic (48%), and anosmic (13%) patients in severe CoViD-19. In severe CoViD-19 patients, taste is lost in 4.3% of normosmic individuals, 31.9% of hyposmic individuals, 46.8% of severe hyposmic individuals, and 17% of anosmic individuals. Moreover, 95% of 100 CoViD-19 patients objectively tested were affected by smell dysfunction, while 47% were affected by taste dysfunction. Furthermore, analysis by objective testing also highlighted that the severity of smell dysfunction in CoViD-19 subjects did not correlate with age and sex. In conclusion, we report by objective testing that the majority of CoViD-19 patients report severe anosmia, that most of the subjects have olfactory impairment rather than taste impairment, and, finally, that the olfactory impairment correlate with symptom onset and hospitalization (p < 0.05). Patients who exhibit severe olfactory impairment had been hospitalized for about a week from symptom onset; double time has taken place in subjects with normosmia. Our results may be limited by the relatively small number of study participants, but these suggest by objective testing that hyposmia, severe hyposmia, and anosmia may relate directly to infection severity and neurological damage. The smell test assessment could be a potential screening symptom that might contribute to the decision to test suspected cases or guide quarantine instructions, further therapeutic approach, and evaluation of neurological damage.","output":"Smell and Taste in Severe CoViD-19: Self-Reported vs. Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extension of the Standard model by assuming $U(1)_{\\\\rm B-L}$ gauge symmetry is very well-motivated since it naturally explains the presence of heavy right-handed neutrinos required to account for the small active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and thermal leptogenesis. Traditionally, we introduce three right handed neutrinos to cancel the $[U(1)_{\\\\rm B-L}]^3$ anomaly. However, it suffices to introduce two heavy right-handed neutrinos for these purposes and therefore we can replace one right-handed neutrino by new chiral fermions to cancel the $U(1)_{\\\\rm B-L}$ gauge anomaly.

Cementoblasts, the cells that produce the mineralised tissue, cementum, that is responsible for connecting the soft periodontal tissue to the tooth, are a key cell type for maintaining/restoring tissue attachment following disease. Here we identify two distinct stem cell populations that contribute to cementoblast differentiation at different times. During postnatal development, cementoblasts are formed from perivascular-derived cells expressing CD90 and perivascular-associated cells that express Axin2. During adult homeostasis, only Wnt-responsive Axin2+ cells form cementoblasts but following experimental induction of periodontal disease, CD90+ cells become the main source of cementoblasts. We thus show that different populations resident stem cells are mobilised at different times and during disease to generate precursors for cementoblast differentiation and thus provide an insight into the targeting cells resident cells for novel therapeutic approaches. The differentiation of these stem cells into cementoblasts is however inhibited by bacterial products such as Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), emphasising that regeneration of periodontal ligament (PDL) soft tissue and restoration of attachment will require a multi-pronged approach. ? AlphaMed Press 2020 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In this manuscript, we identified two different stem cell populations that are able to differentiate to cementoblasts in the periodontium. At development stages, both Axin2+ and CD90+ cell populations can give rise to cementoblasts whereas in adult homeostasis, only Axin2+ cell population continue to form cementoblasts. However, the CD90+ cells that normally remain in a quiescent state in adults, can respond during periodontal disease and form cementoblasts, but this stem cell regenerative ability is inhibited by bacterial metabolites. These results have profound implications for the both the use of exogenous cells and mobilization of resident cells as therapies to restore tissue following periodontal disease.","output":"Stem cell contributions to cementoblast differentiation in healthy periodontal ligament and periodontitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite concerns about mental health problems among those aged 16C24 in England, which social groups have been most at risk, both over the past decade and during the COVID-19 pandemic, remains unclear. METHODS: We examined trends in psychological distress among young adults 16C24 years old in England using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Using longitudinal data as repeated cross-sectional waves, we examined differences over time in mean General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) scores from wave 1 (2009C2010) to wave 10 (2018C2019) and six COVID-19 waves collected between April and November 2020, by economic activity, cohabitation with parents, parental education, area deprivation, ethnicity, age and sex. RESULTS: Compared with 2009C2010, increases in GHQ scores in 2018C2019 were higher in women than men (2.1 vs 1.3), those aged 16C18 than aged 22C24 (2.6 vs 0.9), those from white UK group versus other ethnic minorities, and those out of the labour force (3.6) or employed part time (2.2) than those employed full time (0.8). Compared with 2018C2019, psychological distress in 2020 also further increased among young adults residing in the most deprived areas (4.1 vs 1.2 in the least deprived areas). In 2020, losing ones job or most of ones work hours was associated with higher psychological distress and attenuated the differences between deprivation quartiles by 17%.

Here we sought to identify the proteins that control the folding of this region of proviral genome by inducing/stabilizing G-quadruplex structures. The implementation of electrophorethic mobility shift assay and pull-down experiments coupled with mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the cellular protein nucleolin is able to specifically recognize G-quadruplex structures present in the LTR promoter. Nucleolin recognized with high affinity and specificity the majority, but not all the possible G-quadruplexes folded by this sequence. In addition, it displayed greater binding preference towards DNA than RNA G-quadruplexes, thus indicating two levels of selectivity based on the sequence and nature of the target. The interaction translated into stabilization of the LTR G-quadruplexes and increased promoter silencing activity; in contrast, disruption of nucleolin binding in cells by both siRNAs and a nucleolin binding aptamer greatly increased LTR promoter activity. These data indicate that nucleolin possesses a specific and regulated activity toward the HIV-1 LTR promoter, which is mediated by G-quadruplexes.

Our hospital in Gwangju metropolitan city experienced a healthcare-associated COVID-19 outbreak early in the third wave. The first confirmed COVID-19 patient was a symptomatic neurosurgery resident with high mobility throughout the hospital. We analyzed the transmission routes of nosocomial COVID-19 and discussed infection control strategies. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing results according to time point and evaluated transmission routes. RESULTS: Since COVID-19 was first confirmed in a healthcare worker (HCW) on 11/13/2020, we performed RT-PCR tests for all patients and caregivers and four complete enumeration surveys for all HCWs. We detected three clusters of nosocomial spread and several sporadic cases. The first cluster originated from the community outbreak spot, where an asymptomatic HCW visited, which led to a total of 22 cases. The second cluster, which included patient-to-patient transmission, originated from a COVID-19 positive caregiver before diagnosis and the third cluster involved a radiologist and a banker. We took measures to isolate Building 1 of the hospital for 17 days and controlled the outbreak during a period of increasing community COVID-19 prevalence. Universal screening of all inpatients upon admission and resident caregivers was made mandatory and hospital-related employees are now screened monthly.

Design: We used a cross sectional online survey study design. The survey was implemented between Dec 13 and 23, 2020. Setting: The survey was limited to respondents over 18 years of age residing in the USA. Participants: Respondents were individuals belonging to priority groups for vaccine distribution. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Respondents were asked how likely they would be to take a COVID 19 vaccine if offered at no cost within two months. Vaccine hesitancy was measured using a scale ranging from 1 (low hesitancy) to 6 (high hesitancy). Results: Responses were received from 2,650 respondents (response rate 84%) from all 50 states and Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and Guam.

This implies that studies measure the effects of care based on parameters that are relevant to patients. In a previous scoping review, we found a wide variety of supposedly patient-relevant parameters that equally addressed processes and outcomes of care. We were unable to identify a consistent understanding of patient relevance and therefore aimed to develop an empirically based concept including a generic set of patient-relevant parameters. As a first step we evaluated the process and outcome parameters identified in the scoping review from the patients perspective. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among German general practice patients. Ten research practices of Witten/Herdecke University supported the study. During a two-week period in the fall of 2020, patients willing to participate self-administered a short questionnaire. It evaluated the relevance of the 32 parameters identified in the scoping review on a 5-point Likert scale and offered a free-text field for additional parameters. These free-text answers were inductively categorized by two researchers. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Bivariate analyses were performed to determine whether there are any correlations between rating a parameter as highly relevant and patients characteristics. RESULTS: Data from 299 patients were eligible for analysis. All outcomes except sexuality and frequency of healthcare service utilization were rated important. Confidence in therapy was rated most important, followed by prevention of comorbidity and mobility. Relevance ratings of five parameters were associated with patients age and gender, but not with their chronic status. The free-text analysis revealed 15 additional parameters, 12 of which addressed processes of care, i.e., enough time in physician consultation. CONCLUSION: Patients attach great value to parameters addressing processes of care. It appears as though the way in which patients experience the care process is not less relevant than what comes of it. Relevance ratings were not associated with chronic status, but few parameters were gender- and age-related.

Ordinal (Likert-scale) variables were summarized using mean  standard deviation, or median and interquartile range (IQR) as needed. Results The majority of current users of CLs had no sight problem (P < 0.001). Using CLs was thought to be harmful in non-users (12.4%) versus CL users (2.93%) (P < 0.001). The main reason for using CLs in all groups was the emulation of others. Dryness was a well-known complication in current users (P < 0.05) and evening discomfort was a well-known one in previous users (P < 0.05). Social circle was the main source of information in 40% of users. High monthly income has a significant association with knowledge regarding the complications of CLs compared with low income (B = 0.94, P < 0.05). Education has a major effect on the users knowledge regarding the increase of refractive error and infection by CLs (P < 0.05). Conclusions Knowledge and practice were less than desired among CLs users. Many use CLs without prescription and solely for cosmetic purposes. More education is needed to lessen eye complications among CLs users.","output":"Contact Lens Practices and Knowledge of Complications and its Association With Refractive Error in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA is central to the COVID-19 pandemic-it shapes how the SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) behaves, and how researchers investigate and fight it.

Although glycyrrhizin which exhibited in vivo efficacy against HSV-1 replication showed moderate in vitro anti-HSV-1 activity, its sapogenol, glycyrrhetic acid, showed 10 times greater action than glycyrrhizin. Therefore, the in vivo anti-HSV-1 activity of glycyrrhizin administered orally could be reasonably attributed to glycyrrhetic acid generated by hydrolysis by intestinal bacteria. Since the activity of soyasapogenol A was less than 1/20 of that of soyasapogenol B, the hydroxylation at C-21 seemed to reduce anti-HSV-1 activity. Since kudzusapogenol A, abrisapogenols B and C lacked the activity, the C-29 hydroxy group would eliminate anti-HSV-1 activity. On the other hand, since the methylesters of kudzusapogenol B and glycyrrhetic acid exhibited greater action, a methoxy carboxy group at C-20 might enhance activity.","output":"Anti-herpes virus type 1 activity of oleanane-type triterpenoids."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Few diet and physical activity evidence-based interventions have been routinely used in community settings to achieve population health outcomes.

Although in 2016 the GPEI expected to globally coordinate cessation of the remaining OPV serotypes (1 and 3) by 2021, continuing transmission of serotype 1 wild polioviruses to date makes those plans obsolete.

This patient population is often immunocompromised and potentially more susceptible to viral complications. Government guidelines highlight the need to minimize patient exposure to unnecessary hospital visits. However, those guidelines lack practical recommendations on ways to manage triage and diagnosis expressly for new cancer patients. Furthermore, there are no reports on the efficiency of the guidelines. One of the main issues in treating musculoskeletal tumours is the complexity and variability of presentation. We offer a triage model, used in a quaternary-referral musculoskeletal oncology centre, that allows us to maintain an open pathway for referral of new patients while minimizing exposure risks. A multidisciplinary approach and analysis of existing investigations allow for a pre-clinic evaluation. The model identifies 3 groups of patients: (1) Patients with suspected high-grade malignancy, or benign cases with aggressive features, both in need of further evaluation in the clinic and prompt treatment; (2) Patients with low-grade malignancy, and benign cases whose treatment is not urgent, that are managed during the pandemic by telemedicine, with reassurance and information about their illness; (3) Patients who can be managed by their local medical professionals. In comparison to a pre-pandemic period, that approach resulted in a higher ratio of malignant-to-benign conditions for new patients seen in the clinic (3:4 vs. 1:3 respectively), thus using available resources more efficiently and prioritizing patients with suspected high-grade malignancy.

METHODS: Simulated closed-loop extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuits (1/4 and 3/8 inch) were prepared with a Quadrox-i pediatric and Quadrox-i adult oxygenator and blood primed. In addition, 1/4- and 3/8-inch circuits were also prepared without an oxygenator in series. A one-time dose of voriconazole was administered into the circuits, and serial pre- and post-oxygenator concentrations were obtained at 5 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 24 hour time points. Voriconazole was also maintained in a glass vial and samples were taken from the vial at the same time periods for control purposes to assess for spontaneous drug degradation. RESULTS: For the 1/4-inch circuit, there was an approximate mean of 64-67% voriconazole loss with the oxygenator in series and mean of 15-20% voriconazole loss without an oxygenator in series at 24 hours. For the 3/8-inch circuit, there was an approximate mean of 44-51% voriconazole loss with the oxygenator in series and a mean of 8-12% voriconazole loss without an oxygenator in series at 24 hours. The reference voriconazole concentrations remained relatively constant during the entire study period demonstrating that the drug loss in each size of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit with or without an oxygenator was not a result of spontaneous drug degradation. CONCLUSION: This ex vivo investigation demonstrated substantial voriconazole loss within an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit with an oxygenator in series with both sizes of the Quadrox-i oxygenator at 24 hours and no significant voriconazole loss in the absence of an oxygenator. Further evaluations with multiple dose in vitro and in vivo investigations are needed before specific voriconazole dosing recommendations can be made for clinical application with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","output":"Oxygenator impact on voriconazole in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The C30 endopeptidase (3C-like protease; 3CL(pro)) is essential for the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2) since it plays a pivotal role in viral replication and transcription and, hence, is a promising drug target.

We aimed to examine whether patients with rheumatological conditions receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy are at less risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection than those not receiving hydroxychloroquine. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included de-identified information of all veterans in the US Veterans Health Administration clinical administrative database aged 18 years or older with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or associated rheumatological conditions (based on International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, diagnostic codes) who were alive on March 1, 2020. A propensity score was calculated for each patient, and each patient who was receiving hydroxychloroquine was matched to two patients who were not receiving hydroxychloroquine (controls). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among those receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine versus the propensity-matched patients not receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine between March 1 and June 30, 2020. Secondary outcomes were hospital admission associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; intensive care requirement associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; and overall rates of any hospital admission and mortality (ie, all cause). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine independent variables for the development of active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings: Between March 1 and June 30, 2020, 10a??703 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and 21a??406 patients not receiving hydroxychloroquine were included in the primary analysis. The incidence of active SARS-CoV-2 infections during the study period did not differ between patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and patients not receiving hydroxychloroquine (31 [03%] of 10a??703 vs 78 [04%] of 21a??406; odds ratio 079, 95% CI 052-120, p=027). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes between the two groups in patients who developed active SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In addition to vaccination, one of the main ways to control the disease and prevent it from spreading is to detect and cull infected animals, especially those with persistent infection (PI). We developed and compared two colorimetric biosensor assays based on probe-modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to detect BVDV. Specific probes were designed to detect the 5 untranslated region of BVDV-RNA. The thiolated probes were immobilized on the surface of the AuNPs. Two methods of cross-linking (CL) and non-crosslinking (NCL) probe-AuNPs hybridization were developed and compared. RESULTS: The hybridization of positive targets with the two probe-AuNPs formed a polymeric network between the AuNPs which led to the aggregation of nanoparticles and color change from red to blue. Alternatively, in the NCL mode, the hybridization of complementary targets with the probe-AuNPs resulted in the increased electrostatic repulsion in nanoparticles and the increased stabilization against salt-induced aggregation. The CL and NCL assays had detection limits of 6.83 and 44.36 ng/reaction, respectively. CONCLUSION: The CL assay showed a higher sensitivity and specificity; in contrast, the NCL assay did not require optimizing and controlling of hybridization temperature and showed a higher response speed. However, both the developed methods are cost-effective and easy to perform and also could be implemented on-site or in local laboratories in low-resource countries.

We evaluated clinical features, treatment response and outcomes of liver injury following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in a large case series. APPROACH& RESULTS: We collected data from cases in 18 countries. The type of liver injury was assessed with the R-value. The study population was categorized according to features of immune-mediated hepatitis (positive autoantibodies and elevated immunoglobulin-G levels) and corticosteroid therapy for the liver injury. We identified 87 patients (63%, female), median age 48 (range:18-79) years at presentation. Liver injury was diagnosed a median 15 (range:3-65) days after vaccination. Fifty-one cases (59%) were attributed to the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccine, 20 (23%) cases to the Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOX1 nCoV-19) vaccine and 16 (18%) cases to the Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccine. The liver injury was predominantly hepatocellular (84%) and 57% of patients showed features of immune-mediated hepatitis. Corticosteroids were given to 46 (53%) patients, more often for grade 3-4 liver injury than for grade 1-2 liver injury (88.9% vs 43.5%, p=0.001) and more often for patients with than without immune mediated-hepatitis (71.1% vs 38.2%, p=0.003). All patients showed resolution of liver injury except for one man (1.1%) who developed liver failure and underwent liver transplantation. Steroid therapy was withdrawn during the observation period in 12 (26%) patients after complete biochemical resolution. None had a relapse during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can be associated with liver injury. Corticosteroid therapy may be beneficial in those with immune-mediated features or severe hepatitis. Outcome was generally favorable, but vaccine associated liver injury led to fulminant liver failure in one patient.","output":"Liver injury after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: Features of immune-mediated hepatitis, role of corticosteroid therapy and outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Actualmente no existe vacuna disponible ni medicacin especfica contra la enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).

In this field, the emergence of pandemic COVID-19 has caused the worst-case scenario considering that pregnant women are more susceptible to viral infections, and preexisting cardiac disease is the most prevalent co-morbidity among COVID-19 deaths. PURPOSE: To assess the maternal and fetal outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy of women with heart diseases. METHODS: During the year 2020, among 82 pregnant women with heart disease followed consecutively at the Instituto do Cora??o-InCor, seven of them with an average age of 33.2 years had COVID-19 during their pregnancies. The underlying heart diseases were rheumatic valve disease (5 pt), congenital heart disease (1 pt) and one case with acute myocarditis, without preexisting cardiopathy. The prescription (antibiotics, inotropes, corticosteroids and others) used was according to the clinical conditions required for each patient, however subcutaneous or intravenous heparin was used in all patients. RESULTS: Only one case had an uneventful maternal-fetal course, the other six women required hospitalization / ICU for an average of 25.3 days, including the need for mechanical ventilation in two of them. Serious complications were related to respiratory failure (ADRS), recurrent atrial flutter with hemodynamic instability, acute pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock associated with sepsis which caused two maternal deaths. There were two emergency mitral valve interventional, percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty and valve bioprosthesis replacement, respectively. There were five premature births with an average gestational age of 34.2 weeks of gestation, which resulted in one stillbirth. Pathological findings of three placental and the six-months follow-up of the babies did not confirm vertical transmission of COVID-19.

The impact of COVID-19 on the health practices is well-documented but there are no studies assessing its impact on anesthesiologists in India. This study aims at assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on the practices followed, the preparedness, and mindset of anesthesiologists in India. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using Google forms, a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey was conducted between the 5(th) and 22(nd) of May, 2020, among trainees and practicing anesthesiologists, in India. The anesthesiologists were invited to participate, using their e-mail addresses and through the social media platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp. The responses that were generated, were analyzed using SPSS version 23 (IBM, Armonk, NY). RESULTS: Of the 707 anesthesiologists who participated, 68.3% had already worked in a COVID-19 specialty unit. Only 41.7% of the anesthesiologists felt confident that they had sufficient knowledge to deal with COVID-19 infected patients. Fear of catching the infection and infecting loved ones were important causes of anxiety, which was seen in 95% of the participants. Majority of the participants, (64.5%) did not think that elective surgical procedures could be restarted at this point. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had grave impact on anesthesiologists, on the professional and personal front, and will possibly cause near-permanent changes in the work culture.

Consequently, ethical concerns and psychological distress emerged. This study aimed to assess nurses ethical conflict, resilience and psychological impact, and compare these variables between nurses who worked in Covid-19 wards and nurses who did not. Methods: DesignMulticentre online survey. SettingMulti-site public hospital; all nursing staff were invited to participate. The survey included validated tools and a novel instrument to assess ethical conflict. Spearmans rho coefficient was used to assess correlations between ethical conflict and psychological distress, logistic regressions to evaluate relationships between nurses characteristics and outcome variables, and the MannCWhitney/t-test to compare groups. Results: 548 questionnaires out of 2039 were returned (275 = Covid-19; 273 = non-Covid-19). We found a lowCmoderate level of ethical conflict (median = 111.5 [76C152]), which emerged mostly for seeing patients dying alone. A moderate and significant positive correlation emerged between ethical conflict and psychological distress rs (546) = 0.453, p < 0.001.

AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the spectrum of abdominal computed tomographic (CT) findings in a cohort of 15 COVID-19 patients (confirmed on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)) who presented with various GI presentations without preceding respiratory symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 93 patients with COVID-19 (confirmed on RT-PCR) who underwent CT imaging (between September 28, 2020 and March 20, 2021) in our center were retrospectively searched from the existing database. Among those, 15 patients having index presentation with abdominal symptoms and underwent CT abdomen were further evaluated. RESULTS: Biliary stasis in the form of distended gallbladder and wall thickening was the most common finding, seen in 66.7% (n = 10) patients, followed by bowel wall thickening. Small bowel and large bowel thickenings were seen in 26.7% (n = 4) and 20% (n = 3) patients, respectively. Other findings include fluid-filled colon (n = 1), mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) (n = 2), paper-thin bowel wall and pneumatosis (n = 1), acute pancreatitis (n = 1), and ascites (n = 2). One patient who presented with abdominal pain did not show any obvious imaging findings on CT.

METHODS: This observational cohort study included 683,905 patients, between the ages of 12-50, hospitalized for childbirth and abortion between January 1, 2019 and May 31, 2021. During the pre-pandemic period, 271,444 women were hospitalized for childbirth. During the pandemic, 308,532 women were hospitalized for childbirth and 2,708 had COVID-19. Associations between COVID-19 and in-hospital adverse perinatal outcomes were examined using propensity score-adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS: Compared to women without COVID-19, women with COVID-19 were more likely to experience both early and late preterm birth (aOR 1.38 [95% CI 1.1-1.7], aOR 1.62 [95% CI 1.3-1.7], respectively), preeclampsia (aOR 1.2 [95% CI 1.0-1.4]), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) (aOR 1.57 [95% CI 1.1-2.2]), pulmonary edema (aOR 2.7 [95% CI 1.1- 6.3]), and need for mechanical ventilation (aOR 8.1 [95% CI 3.8-17.3]). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of stillbirth among women with (n= 16 / 2,708) and without (n= 174 / 39,562) COVID-19, p=0.257. There were no differences in adverse outcomes among women who delivered during the pandemic versus pre-pandemic period. Combined in-hospital mortality was significantly higher for women with COVID-19 (147 [95% CI 3.0 -292] vs 2.5 [95% CI 0-7.5] deaths per 100,000 women). Women diagnosed with COVID-19 within 30 days prior to hospitalization were more likely to experience early preterm birth, placental abruption, and mechanical ventilation, compared to women diagnosed with COVID-19 > 30 days prior to hospitalization for childbirth (4.0% vs. 2.4% for early preterm birth, aOR 1.7 [95% CI 1.1-2.7]; 2.2% vs. 1.2% for placental abruption, aOR 1.86 [95% CI 1.0 - 3.4]); 0.9% vs. 0.1% for mechanical ventilation, aOR 13.7 [95% CI 1.8-107.2])). CONCLUSION: Women with COVID-19 had a higher prevalence of adverse perinatal outcomes and increased in-hospital mortality, with highest risk occurring when diagnosis was within 30 days of hospitalization, raising the possibility of a high-risk period.","output":"Adverse Perinatal Outcomes in a Large US Birth Cohort During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Adverse Perinatal Outcomes During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stress refers to situations in which one feels that the demands imposed on them exceed the limitations of their ability to adapt.

The opacification of the superficial middle cerebral vein (SMCV) on computed tomography perfusion (CTP) has been associated with poor functional outcomes after stroke, while its association with PH has not been verified for acute stroke patients undergoing thrombectomy. Methods Consecutive patients with acute anterior large artery occlusion (LAO) who received thrombectomy were retrospectively enrolled between May 2018 and May 2019. Absent filing of the SMCV (SMCV-) on CTP-derived CT angiography was defined as no contrast filling of the SMCV across the whole venous phase in the ischemic hemisphere, while SMCV+ was defined as the presence of contrast filling of the SMCV at any time point of the venous phase. Results A total of 52 patients were enrolled in the study, and 15 patients (28.8%) developed a PH within 48 hours after thrombectomy. SMCV- was not associated with PH in both the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses (all P>0.05), but was an independent risk factor for reperfusion [modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b-3; odds ratio (OR) =0.172, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.031-0.960, P=0.045]. Reperfusion was associated with a reduced risk of PH (OR =0.110, 95% CI: 0.013-0.913, P=0.041). However, in a subgroup analysis of patients who had reperfusion, the SMCV- group had a higher rate of PH than the SMCV+ group (40.0% vs. 13.8%, P=0.049). Conclusions In patients who received thrombectomy, SMCV- did not predict PH, but was a risk factor for reperfusion. Although reperfusion was a protective factor for PH, the SMCV- group was still at a higher risk of PH compared with the SMCV+ group when reperfusion was successfully achieved.","output":"Absent filling of the superficial middle cerebral vein is associated with reperfusion but not parenchymal hematoma in stroke patients undergoing thrombectomy: an observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore whether the attitudes of nursing students toward the use of mobile learning are positive or negative and to identify the factors influencing their attitudes by reviewing the literature.

Study characteristics, effect size data, and heterogeneity estimates were extracted and presented in tabular form. Methodological quality was assessed by 2 reviewers using the AMSTAR-2 checklist. The validity of results was considered based on AMSTAR-2 scores and study characteristics. RESULTS We included 11 meta-analyses: 6 focused on disease-free older adults and 5 on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) excluding dementia. These meta-analyses summarized 97 unique RCTs. Methodological quality ranged from critically low to high. For overall cognitive functioning, which was the outcome of 6 meta-analyses, 1 showed improvement due to exercise interventions in disease-free older adults (g = 0.29, P < .01), while 2 reported nonsignificant effects. In patients with MCI, 3 meta-analyses reported significant benefits of exercise interventions on overall cognitive functioning (g = 0.25-0.57, P < .01). For cognitive domains such as attention and memory, there was limited evidence of beneficial effects of exercise demonstrated in either disease-free or MCI samples. CONCLUSIONS Exercise may improve overall cognitive functioning in disease-free older adults, but there is too little high-quality evidence to conclude whether this is achieved through improvement in any of the specific cognitive domains assessed.

Asthma and asthma severity (step suggested by GINA) was defined using the diagnostic code and history of asthma medication usage. RESULTS: Among 7590 COVID-19 patients, 218 (2.9%) had underlying asthma. The total medical cost associated with COVID-19 patients with underlying asthma was significantly higher than that of other patients. Mortality rate for COVID-19 patients with underlying asthma (7.8%) was significantly higher than that of other patients (2.8%; p<0.001).

Besides postponement of elective surgeries, outpatient consultations have been drastically reduced. Parallel to these developments, an increase in telemedical consultations has reflected efforts to provide sufficient patient care. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a clinical examination of the hip joint and pelvis by way of a telemedical consultation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients of a German university clinic were recruited and assessed in both telemedical and conventional examinations. Agreement between the two examinations was then assessed, and connections between the observed agreement and patient-specific factors such as age, BMI and ASA classification were investigated. RESULTS: The inspections agreed closely with a mean Cohen's kappa of 0.76  0.37. Palpation showed adequate agreement with a mean Cohen's kappa of 0.38  0.19. Function showed good agreement with a mean Cohen's kappa of 0.61  0.26 and range of motion showed adequate agreement with a mean Cohen's kappa of 0.36  0.19. A significant positive correlation was observed between the number of deviations in the different examinations and age (p = 0.05), and a significant positive correlation was shown between the number of non-feasible examinations and age (p < 0.01), BMI (p < 0.01) and ASA classification score (p < 0.01). DISCUSSION: Inspection and function can be reliably evaluated, whereas the significance of palpation, provocation and measurement of range of motion is limited. The small sample size puts limitations on the significance of a statistically relevant correlation between patient-specific factors such as age, BMI and ASA classification score and valid and successful implementation of a telemedical examination. The authors recommend targeted patient selection. If, however, patients are being evaluated who are very old (> 75 years), obese (BMI > 30) or with multiple comorbidities (ASA 3 and above), caution is advised. Large, prospective studies are needed in the future to fully validate telemedical consultations in the fields of orthopaedics and trauma surgery. CONCLUSION: A telemedical examination of the hip joint and pelvis can be performed with certain limitations. Patient-specific factors such as age, BMI, and extent of comorbidities appear to have a relevant impact on validity and execution of the examination. Patients with multiple comorbidities (ASA 3 and above), advanced age (> 75 years) or obesity (BMI > 30) should, whenever possible, be examined in a conventional outpatient setting.","output":"Evaluation of the Feasibility of a Telemedical Examination of the Hip and Pelvis - Early Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic./ Evaluation der Durchfhrbarkeit einer telemedizinischen Untersuchung des Hftgelenks und des Beckens - frhe Lehren aus der COVID-19-Pandemie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the clinical significance of an optimized approach to improve surgical field visualization and simplify anastomosis techniques using robotic-assisted sleeve lobectomy for lung or bronchial carcinoma. Method: A total of 26 consecutive patients who underwent sleeve lobectomy between January 2017 and April 2020 were enrolled in the study. The cohort included 11 cases of robotic-assisted surgery (RAS group) and 15 cases of mini-thoracotomy (MT group). RAS was performed via an exclusive optimized approach utilizing the 3 to 4-6 to 8/9 four-port technique. Retrieved demographical and clinical data included operation time, anastomosis time, blood loss, chest drainage time and volume, postoperative pain scores, complications, white blood cell (WBC) levels, and duration of hospital stay and follow-up. Results: No cases of perioperative death were recorded. Compared to MT group, the RAS group had a similar anastomosis time (30.82  6.08 vs 33.20  7.73 min, respectively, p > 0.05) and shorter operation time (189.73  36.41 vs 225.33  38.19 min, respectively, p < 0.05). The RAS group had lower pain scores (4.23  0.26 vs 4.91  0.51, p < 0.05), lower levels of WBC (p < 0.05), and no anastomotic complications postoperatively. The RAS and MT groups demonstrated a successful bronchus reconstruction with low risk of angulation (1/11 vs 1/15, p > 0.05) and satisfactory disease-free survival (eight cases, 72.73% and 12 cases, 80%, respectively). Conclusion: The optimized approach to RA sleeve lobectomy is convenient and efficient and provides satisfactory clinical outcomes. Further study with a large sample size and evaluation of long-term survival are warranted. Key points: (i) we present a novel, convenient, and efficient approach for robotic-assisted sleeve lobectomy, ie, 3 to 4-6 to 8/9 four-port technique. The optimized approach for RA sleeve lobectomy is convenient and efficient and provides satisfactory clinical outcomes; (ii) details for the 3 to 4-6 to 8/9 four-port method: the assistant port was located at the fourth intercostal space. The 1-cm camera port was inserted at the sixth intercostal space in the posterior axillary line. The 0.5-cm da Vinci ports of the instrument arms were placed at the third intercostal space in the anterior axillary line and the eighth or ninth intercostal space in the posterior axillary line.

It is one of the major aetiologic agents for HFMD (hand, foot and mouth disease) identified globally. It has led to many outbreaks and epidemics in Asian countries. Infection caused by this virus that can lead to serious psychological problems, heart diseases and respiratory issues in children younger than 10 years of age. Many studies are being carried out on the pathogenesis of the virus, but little is known. The host immune response and other molecular responses against the virus are also not clearly determined. This review deals with the interaction between the host and the EV71 virus. We discuss how the virus makes use of its proteins to affect the host's immunity and how the viral proteins help their replication. Additionally, we describe other useful resources that enable the virus to evade the host's immune responses. The knowledge of the viral structure and its interactions with host cells has led to the discovery of various drug targets for the treatment of the virus. Additionally, this review focusses on the antiviral drugs and vaccines developed by targeting various viral surface molecules during their infectious period. Furthermore, it is asserted that the improvement of prevailing vaccines will be the simplest method to manage EV71 infection swiftly. Therefore, we summarise numerous vaccines candidate for the EV71, such as the use of an inactivated complete virus, recombinant VP1 protein, artificial peptides, VLPs (viral-like particles) and live attenuated vaccines for combating the viral outbreaks promptly.","output":"Does enterovirus 71 urge for effective vaccine control strategies?

The world is in grief, but in early January 2020, before nobody could even imagine that SARS-CoV-2 would turn into the COVID-19 pandemic, a music video version of a pop ballad about love and isolation was spread across a Chinese social network. The song You Are Not Alone was adapted as a cover by young foreigners living in China to express their support to bereaved families and frontline workers and encourage the people of China, their second home. At that time, the rest of the world looked to distant China but could hardly expect to face the same adversity months later. The authors reported that the music video was a spontaneous artistic expression copying such traumatic events and the mourning process. The present work analyses how the music was blended with lyrics and images describing the outbreak in Wuhan to reach their goal. The original song and this shortened version for China were compared regarding musical and lyric structures and main characteristics. Additionally, an analysis of the two videos was done regarding cinemetric variables and non-verbal communication that emphasized the power of songs to express deep sorrow and sympathy but also to give hope. Psychological first aid, the five stages of the mourning process by Kbler-Ross, the dual-process model by Stroebe and Schut, and Taylors tend-to-befriend provided a better understanding of the translation from interpersonal to societal mourning. Finally, other memorable songs that society spontaneously chose to be performed alone or together to cope with sudden and dramatic situations, mitigate physical distancing, and alleviate human suffering are discussed. Music, lyrics, and artistic performance are playing a key role in building social and emotional ties during this pandemic, hampering individual and social pain and sorrow despite cultural barriers.","output":"Youre Not Alone for China: The First Song in Times of COVID-19 to Keep the Faith in a World Crying in Silence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) can be managed through diet and lifestyle changes. The American Diabetes Association acknowledges that knowing what and when to eat is the most challenging aspect of diabetes management. Although current recommendations for self-monitoring of diet and glucose levels aim to improve glycemic stability among people with T2D, tracking all intake is burdensome and unsustainable. Thus, dietary self-monitoring approaches that are equally effective but are less burdensome should be explored. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the feasibility of an abbreviated dietary self-monitoring approach in patients with T2D, in which only carbohydrate-containing foods are recorded in a diet tracker. METHODS: We used a mixed methods approach to quantitatively and qualitatively assess general and diet-related diabetes knowledge and the acceptability of reporting only carbohydrate-containing foods in 30 men and women with T2D. RESULTS: The mean Diabetes Knowledge Test score was 83.9% (SD 14.2%). Only 20% (6/30) of participants correctly categorized 5 commonly consumed carbohydrate-containing foods and 5 noncarbohydrate-containing foods. The mean perceived difficulty of reporting only carbohydrate-containing foods was 5.3 on a 10-point scale. Approximately half of the participants (16/30, 53%) preferred to record all foods. A lack of knowledge about carbohydrate-containing foods was the primary cited barrier to acceptability (12/30, 40%). CONCLUSIONS: Abbreviated dietary self-monitoring in which only carbohydrate-containing foods are reported is likely not feasible because of limited carbohydrate-specific knowledge and a preference of most participants to report all foods. Other approaches to reduce the burden of dietary self-monitoring for people with T2D that do not rely on food-specific knowledge could be more feasible.","output":"Abbreviated Dietary Self-monitoring for Type 2 Diabetes Management: Mixed Methods Feasibility Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the WHOs global pandemic declaration and Ugandas confirmation of its first COVID-19 case in March 2020, a set of guidelines and directives were given to prevent the spread and mitigate the effects of the novel coronavirus. While initial strict enforcement was ensured and adherence to these preventive guidelines registered, it rapidly declined within a few weeks. This paper uses the ecological systems theory and COM-B model to explore adherence barriers and facilitators. We used data from a mixed methods cross-sectional study conducted in two slums within Kampala, Ugandas capital city. Study participants were 807 (660=quantitative, 147=qualitative). For data collection we used interviews, focus group discussions, observation and a community survey. Quantitative data was collected using ODK, cleaned, coded in excel and transferred to SPSS for analysis. Qualitative interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, coded and thematically analysed using NVivo12 software. Study findings show high and varied levels of non-adherence with hand washing at 52.7% and disinfection of touch surfaces at 9.9%. Non-adherence was attributed to a number of economic, sociocultural, political and structural reasons. Despite availability of prevention opportunities, weak capacity and low motivation led to largely undesirable behavior which increased the risk to COVID-19 infections among slumdwellers. The COM-B model can be used to better understand critical intervention pathways to increase adherence to policy and adoption of health protection behavior among vulnerable communities. It is possible to institute adherence barriers among slum dwellers through simple policy and programming responses if contextual factors are recognised.","output":"Slum Dwellers Adherence to COVID-19 Guidelines: Application of the COM-B Model to Barriers and Facilitators of Behavioural Change in Ugandas Urban Slums (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide, youth electronic cigarette use (vaping) has risen significantly over the past decade.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the Spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) impairs lipid metabolism in host cells. MethodsA Spike cell line in HEK293 was generated using the pcDNA vector carrying the Spike gene expression cassette. A control cell line was generated using the empty pcDNA vector. Gene expression profiles related to lipid metabolic, autophagic, and ferroptotic pathways were investigated. Palmitic acid (PA)-overload was used to assess lipotoxicity-induced necrosis. ResultsAs compared with controls, the Spike cells showed a significant increase in lipid depositions on cell membranes as well as dysregulation of expression of a panel of molecules involved lipid metabolism, autophagy, and ferroptosis. The Spike cells showed an upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a multifunctional transcriptional factor, in response to PA. Furthermore, the Spike cells exhibited increased necrosis in response to PA-induced lipotoxicity compared to control cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner via ferroptosis, which could be attenuated by the Nrf2 inhibitor trigonelline. ConclusionsThe Spike protein impairs lipid metabolic and autophagic pathways in host cells, leading to increased susceptibility to lipotoxicity via ferroptosis which can be suppressed by a Nrf2 inhibitor. This data also suggests a central role of Nrf2 in Spike-induced lipid metabolic impairments.

METHODS: During the first weeks of the lockdown in Italy, 2286 respondents (1706 females and 580 males; age range: 18C74 years) completed an online survey that collected sociodemographic information and data related to the experience with the COVID-19 pandemic. Some questionnaires assessed sleep quality, psychological well-being, general psychopathology, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders symptoms, and anxiety. The path analysis was adopted. RESULTS: The study confirms a direct effect of some aspects ascribable to the pandemic, with a mediator role of the psychological variables. Lower sleep quality was directly related to the days spent at home in confinement and the knowledge of people affected by the COVID-19. All the other aspects related to the COVID-19 pandemic influenced sleep quality through the mediator effect of psychological variables. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted that the psychological condition of the population has been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the government actions taken to contain it, but it has also played an important role in mediating the quality of sleep, creating a vicious circle on peoples health. The results suggest that a health emergency must be accompanied by adequate social support programs to mitigate the fear of infection and promote adequate resilience to accept confinement and social distancing.

Understanding their transmission, and possibly forecasting the dynamics of these pathogens, represents both a scientific and sanitary emergency. To this goal, mathematical modeling has been a widely used tool. Nevertheless, they have important limitations to explicitly model the mechanisms involved in the infectious processes at the individual level. Thanks to the increase of computing capacity, computational models such as individual-based models (IBMs) are very relevant for understanding the complexity of mechanisms at the individual level that can be involved in disease outbreaks. Their computational formalism allows a large flexibility, while they rely on the same philosophy than current models in mathematical epidemiology that have proved their relevance. In this chapter, we review the main qualities of IBMs, what kind of new knowledge they can bring and they have already produced in epidemiological modeling. Then, we highlight their caveats and what could be developed during the future years to make IBMs a more reliable and useful approach.","output":"Chapter 14 Individual-Based Models for Public Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients fear of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may delay inevitable treatment, putting potential benefits at risk. This single-center retrospective study aims to analyze temporal relationships of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany with the number of patients who sought and received elective neurosurgical treatment at a German university hospital. Methods: Daily outpatient numbers (ON) and elective procedures (EP) were recorded at our department between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2020 (baseline: between 1 January 2019 and 30 June 2019). In patients who received EP, we recorded indication, outcome, and length of stay (LOS). Moving averages of ON (MAON) and of EP were calculated. Data on governmental action taken in response to the pandemic and on coronavirus-positive cases in Germany (CPCG) were superimposed. Exponential and arc tangent curves (ATC) were fitted to the absolute numbers of CPCG. Phase shifts were estimated, and Spearmans rank correlation coefficient, rho, was calculated between the 2020 MAON and the derivative function of the fitted ATC (DFATC). Wilcoxon rank sum served as statistical test. Significance was assumed with p values of less than 0.05. Results: ON were significantly decreased in April 2020 as compared to April 2019 (p = 0.010). A phase shift between the German lockdown, the DFATC, and the decrease in MAON was not detected, while a phase shift of 10 days between the DFATC and the subsequent increase in MAON was detected. The DFATC was significantly negatively correlated (rho = ?0.92, p < 0.0001) to the MAON until 31 March 2020, and, when shifted by 10 days, the DFATC was significantly negatively correlated (rho = ?0.87, p < 0.0001) to the MAON from 01 April 2020. EP (p = 0.023), including the subset of non-oncological EP (p = 0.032), were significantly less performed in the first half of 2020 as compared to the first half of 2019. In March and April 2020, we conducted significantly more EP due to motor deficits (p = 0.0267, and less), visual disturbances (p = 0.0488), and spinal instability (p = 0.0012), and significantly less EP due to radicular pain (p = 0.0489), as compared to March and April 2019. LOS ranked significantly higher in patients who received cranial or spinal EP in March and April 2020 as compared to March and April 2019 (p = 0.0497). Significant differences in outcome were not observed. Conclusion: The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic was correlated to an immediate and significant decrease in ON, and to a significant decrease in the number of EP performed. The subsequent increase in ON was delayed. Adequate measures to promote timely discharge of patients may become increasingly relevant as the pandemic proceeds. Although we observed a shift in the range of indications towards significantly more EP in patients with neurological deficiencies, care should be taken to avoid potentially deleterious delays of necessary elective treatment in future pandemic situations.","output":"The Demand for Elective Neurosurgery at a German University Hospital during the First Wave of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to anatomical complexity, ultrasound examination of the hamstring muscles is challenging, resulting in potential diagnostic uncertainty and under-confidence in the technique.

Methods A 22-item survey was distributed to neurohospitalists through the Neurohospitalist Society and the American Academy of Neurology Neurohospitalist, Stroke & Vascular Neurology, and Critical Care & Emergency Neurology Sections. Results After 2 weeks of collection, 123 responses were received, with 57% of respondents practicing in academic settings, 23% in private practice, and 7% in community hospitals. A minority of neurohospitalists (8%) were redeployed to care for COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 medicine patients. The most common neurologic diagnoses they reported in COVID-19 patients were delirium (85%), cerebrovascular events (75%), and seizure (35%); however, most neurohospitalists (59%) had evaluated fewer than 10 patients with COVID-19. Respondents observed that fewer patients with unrelated neurological diseases were admitted to the hospital compared to before the pandemic. Neurohospitalists experienced changes in administrative (27%), educational (15%), and research duties (11%), and had overall worse well-being and work-life balance (77%). Conclusions The most common neurologic diagnoses seen in COVID-19 patients by neurohospitalists in this sample are delirium, cerebrovascular disease, and seizure.

In this study, we analyzed the nasopharyngeal microbiota profile of aged patients with COVID-19 (asymptomatic vs. symptomatic) vs. healthy individuals. We examined the nasopharynx swab of 84 aged-matched patients, out of which 27 were negative asymptomatic (NegA), 30 were positive asymptomatic (PA), and 27 patients were positive symptomatic (PSY). Our analysis revealed the presence of abundant Cyanobacterial taxa at phylum level in PA (p-value = 0.0016) and PSY (p-value = 0.00038) patients along with an upward trend in the population of Litoricola, Amylibacter, Balneola, and Aeromonas at the genus level. Furthermore, to know the relationship between the nasal microbiota composition and severity of COVID-19, we compared PA and PSY groups. Our data show that the nasal microbiota of PSY patients was significantly enriched with the signatures of two bacterial taxa: Cutibacterium (p-value = 0.045) and Lentimonas (p-value = 0.007).

Compared to YCs, even less is known about adolescent young carers (AYCs), a group that is in a critical life transition phase. The study forms part of an EU Horizon 2020 funded research project on AYCs aged 15C17 years old. METHODS: A two-round Delphi study was conducted with 66 experts on YCs from 10 European countries. Topics included: (i) visibility and awareness-raising of YCs at local, regional, and national levels, (ii) current interventions to support YCs, and (iii) future strategies to support YCs. RESULTS: Experts reported a lack of visibility and awareness about YCs in general, and AYCs in particular. Although awareness is slowly increasing in most countries, with the UK ranked highest, experts acknowledged that it remains challenging to identify YCs in many countries. Furthermore, the level and type of support available for YCs differs, with most countries mainly offering support on a local level. Diverse views were expressed regarding future strategies to support YCs. Experts highlighted the importance of specific legislation to formalise the rights of YCs, and the issue of whether young people should be safeguarded from caregiving or if this should be considered part of regular family life. They also emphasised the relevance of available integrated support services for YCs, including schools, family, health and social care.

However, one of the biggest challenges of transplantation is determining how to achieve the long-term survival of the allogeneic or xenogeneic transplant by, for example, preventing transplant rejection. In the current study, CD26 gene-knockout mice were used to investigate the potential role of CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPPIV) in allogeneic skin graft rejection by tail-skin transplantation. Compared with wild-type (CD26(+/+)) counterparts, CD26(C/C) mice showed reduced necrosis of grafts and delayed graft rejection after skin transplantation. Concentrations of serum IgG, including its subclasses IgG1 and IgG2a, were significantly reduced in CD26(C/C) mice during graft rejection. Moreover, after allogeneic skin transplantation, the secretion levels of the cytokines IFN-, IL-2, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-13 were significantly reduced, whereas the level of the cytokine IL-10 was increased in the serum of CD26(C/C) mice compared with that in the serum of CD26(+/+) mice. Additionally, the concentration of IL-17 in serum and the percentage of cells secreting IL-17 in mouse peripheral blood lymphocytes (MPBLs) were both significantly lower, while the percentage of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was significantly higher in MPBLs of CD26(C/C) mice than in those of CD26(+/+) mice. Furthermore, a lower percentage of CD8(+) T cells in MPBLs and fewer infiltrated macrophages and T cells in graft tissues of CD26(C/C) mice were detected during graft rejection. These results indicate that CD26 is involved in allogeneic skin graft rejection and provides another hint that CD26 deficiency leads to less rejection due to lower activation and proliferation of host immune cells.","output":"Delayed allogeneic skin graft rejection in CD26-deficient mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a very rare subtype of sarcoma, which frequently harbor chromosomal rearrangements, including anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements (almost 50% of the IMTs) and other kinase fusions such as ROS1.

We conducted a single-center hospital-based study and consecutively recruited 122 suspected and 104 confirmed patients with COVID-19 during January 24 to April 25, 2020. Clinical risk factors of COVID-19 were identified. The discriminative power of low calcium and phosphorus regarding the disease severity was evaluated. Low calcium and low phosphorus are more prevalent in severe or critical COVID-19 patients than moderate COVID-19 patients (odds ratio [OR], 15.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59-143.18 for calcium; OR, 6.90; 95% CI, 2.43-19.64 for phosphorus). The specificity in detecting the severe or critical patients among COVID-19 patients reached 98.5% (95% CI, 92.0%-99.7%) and 84.8% (95% CI, 74.3%-91.6%) by low calcium and low phosphorus, respectively, albeit with suboptimal sensitivity. Calcium and phosphorus combined with lymphocyte count could obtain the best discriminative performance for the severe COVID-19 patients (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.80), and combined with oxygenation index was promising (AUC = 0.71). Similar discriminative performances of low calcium and low phosphorus were found between suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patient. Low calcium and low phosphorus could indicate the severity of COVID-19 patients, and may be utilized as promising clinical biomarkers for discriminative diagnosis.","output":"Low serum calcium and phosphorus and their clinical performance in detecting COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dispersion of cough-generated droplets from a person going up- or downstairs was investigated through a laboratory experiment in a water tunnel. This experiment was carried out with a manikin mounted at inclination angles facing the incoming flow to mimic a person going up or down. Detailed velocity measurements and flow visualization were conducted in the water tunnel experiments. To investigate the influence of the initial position on the motion of particles, a virtual particle approach was adopted to simulate the dispersion of particles using the measured velocity field. Particle clustering, which is caused by the unsteadiness of the flow, was observed in both flow visualization and virtual particle simulation. For the case of going upstairs, particles are concentrated below the persons shoulder and move downward with a short travel distance. For the case of going downstairs, particles dispersing over the persons head advect over for a long distance. We also found that the motion of the particles is closely related to the initial position.

We developed a mathematical model for investigating and predicting the effects of lockdown on future COVID-19 cases with a specific focus on India. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to develop and validate a mathematical model and to assess the impact of various lockdown scenarios on COVID-19 transmission in India. METHODS: A model consisting of a framework of ordinary differential equations was developed by incorporating the actual reported cases in 14 countries. After validation, the model was applied to predict COVID-19 transmission in India for different intervention scenarios in terms of lockdown for 4, 14, 21, 42, and 60 days. We also assessed the situations of enhanced exposure due to aggregation of individuals in transit stations and shopping malls before the lockdown. RESULTS: The developed model is efficient in predicting the number of COVID-19 cases compared to the actual reported cases in 14 countries. For India, the model predicted marked reductions in cases for the intervention periods of 14 and 21 days of lockdown and significant reduction for 42 days of lockdown. Such intervention exceeding 42 days does not result in measurable improvement. Finally, for the scenario of \\"panic shopping\\" or situations where there is a sudden increase in the factors leading to higher exposure to infection, the model predicted an exponential transmission, resulting in failure of the considered intervention strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a strict lockdown for a period of at least 21 days is expected to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. However, a further extension of up to 42 days is required to significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in India. Any relaxation in the lockdown may lead to exponential transmission, resulting in a heavy burden on the health care system in the country.","output":"Mathematical Modelling to Assess the Impact of Lockdown on COVID-19 Transmission in India: Model Development and Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a case of fulminant liver failure in a patient with acute active hepatitis B infection who was found to have COVID-19 without lung involvement A 24-year-old male was brought by ambulance service to Hamad General Hospital, Emergency Department (ED), in Doha on April 8, 2020, with chief complaints of fever and cough for 3 days Upon initial evaluation, the patient was febrile (39 4degreeC), jaundiced, and disoriented regarding time, place, and person, with an unremarkable past medical history Initial blood tests showed severely elevated urea, creatinine, transaminases, and ammonium in addition to an impaired coagulation profile consistent with fulminant liver failure A swab was taken for COVID-19 PCR testing and found to be positive Serological tests revealed hepatitis B surface antigen positivity and other serology indicating acute hepatitis B Initial X-ray and repeat chest X-rays did not show lung infiltrates On the 6th day after admission, the patient developed fixed dilated pupils, with brain edema on CT;cardiac arrest occurred on the 10th day after admission, and the patient died Although it is still largely unclear, HBV0-activated sudden-onset strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and enhanced viral replication and/or retention of the viral capsid in infected hepatocytes may cause the pathogenesis of FH These pathophysiological events cause extensive hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis, which results in deadly severe liver failure Our findings support that the liver damage occurring in COVID-19 is caused by an impaired innate immune system rather than by direct cell damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 We think that more consideration should be given to the presence of acute hepatitis B, especially in COVID-19 patients","output":"Can COVID-19 Cause Flare-Ups of Acute Hepatitis B?

With increased risk of aerosolized spread within confined ambulance compartments, this study specifically evaluated a specially-designed nebulizer mask modified with expiratory-port filters and a sealing faceplate to minimize fugitive bio-aerosol emissions (FBAE). METHODS: As FBAE carrying contagious viruses typically range from 0.5 to 1.5 micron (), a 6-port (0.3-10) Kanomax 3889 particle measurement (PM) counter was placed 78 cm from each of 15 rotating adult volunteers (non-patients;beardless;7 women, 8 men;ages 18-59 yrs) sitting upright in one of 3 rotating fleet ambulances using the EMS agency's usual jet-nebulizers on day 1 with either a conventional mask (CM) or an aerosol-controlling mask (ACM). Each person returned on another day using the other mask as indicated. Ambient ambulance PMs (PMamb) were sampled before subjects entered. After re-closing the door and waiting 5 mins, a pre-nebulization PM (preNeb-PM) was made. Jet-nebulizers (using H2O solutions) were then applied (either by CM or ACM) for 5 min followed by post-neb PMs (Post1) and 2 successive PMs (Post2/Post 3), all 5 mins apart, with masks remaining in place. RESULTS: After treatment, mean 1 CM PMs (Post1CM) were 152.2-fold larger (p=0.001) than mean 1 ACM PMs (Post1ACM), remaining 49.6-fold (p=0.005) and 7.2-fold (p=0.006) larger at Post2 and Post3 readings. PMamb and preNeb-PM were all similar (NSD) for both ACM and CM across all PM sizes (0.5, 1.0, 3.0 ) including 1 ACM preNeb-PMs of 6,977/cf vs. 5.683/cf for CM preNeb-PMs (NSD). While mean 1 Post1ACM readings decreased (-31.7%) from ACM pre-Neb-PM (6,977 to 4,662/cf;p=0.002), the 1 Post1CM readings rose 14,500.1% (5,683 to 700,549.93/cf;p=0.002) with corresponding elevations for 0.5 (p=0.001) and 3 (p=0.002) particles using CM. Of additional note, ACMs were uniformly well-tolerated over the 15 mins being worn. CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional methods, a modified mask system designed specifically to limit aerosolization of inhaled solutions did provide profound control of fugitive aerosolized particle emissions during nebulizer applications.

Differences in intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccination were explored using Pearson Chi-square tests. Additionally, multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse the factors associated with willingness to receive vaccines.

All of them had serologically verified COVID-19 pneumonia with lung involvement 5-60% on CT. None of them were treated by antimalarial drugs. 28 of them were men and 20 women, mean age - 45  4,4 years old. We performed echocardiography in 1 month period from onset of the disease. RESULTS: Most of the patients (30 patients) had enlargement of right heart chambers. Despite of right ventricle enlargement, in none of the patients had reduced right ventricle function (TAPSE 22  2 mm, right ventricle strain -21,2  1,5%). The mean systolic pulmonary artery pressure was slightly elevated (38  2 mm Hg). Left ventricle was enlarged in 9 patients (with mean end diastolic volume 82  5 ml/m2).

The purpose of this study was to examine childrens sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. spring and summer 2020) compared to previous data collected from the same children during each of the two previous years (spring and summer 2018 and 2019). METHODS: 68 children (age = 9.91.2 years, 56% Black, 53% male) previously recruited for an observational cohort study wore a Fitbit Charge 2 on their wrist during the spring and summer from 2018-2020 (i.e. six 30-day measurement periods). We used multilevel mixed models to examine how childrens sleep patterns changed during the pandemic accounting for previous trajectory (i.e. 2018 to 2019). Models included age, sex, and race as covariates. RESULTS: Children had an average of 84 nights of sleep data across all six 30-day measurement periods. In the spring of the pandemic, children slept 24.6 minutes more (95%CI = 11.6, 37.5) compared to previous springs. During the pandemic summer, they slept 40.0 minutes more (95%CI = 24.6, 58.5) compared to previous summers. Sleep midpoint was 117.1 minutes later (95%CI = 103.6, 130.6) in the spring during the pandemic and 46.0 minutes later (95% CI = 26.9, 65.2) in the summer during the pandemic compared to previous years. Sleep efficiency improved slightly by 1.3% (95% CI = 0.7, 1.9) and 3.6% (95% CI = 2.7, 4.5) in spring and summer, respectively, during the pandemic compared to previous years. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, children slept longer after accounting for previous developmental trends.

We explore mathematical models of predator-prey systems, in order to assess whether dormancy can be an effective adaptive strategy to outcompete perennially active (PA) prey, even when both forms of the dormitive prey (active and dormant) are individually disadvantaged. RESULTS: We develop a dynamic population model by introducing an additional dormitive prey population to the existing predator-prey model which can be active (active form) and enter dormancy (dormant form). In this model, both forms of the dormitive prey are individually at a disadvantage compared to the PA prey and thus would go extinct due to their low growth rate, energy waste on the production of dormant prey, and the inability of the latter to grow autonomously. However, the dormitive prey can paradoxically outcompete the PA prey with superior traits and even cause its extinction by alternating between the two losing strategies. We observed higher fitness of the dormitive prey in rich environments because a large predator population in a rich environment cannot be supported by the prey without adopting an evasive strategy, that is, dormancy. In such environments, populations experience large-scale fluctuations, which can be survived by dormitive but not by PA prey. CONCLUSION: We show that dormancy can be an effective adaptive strategy to outcompete superior prey, recapitulating the game-theoretic Parrondos paradox, where two losing strategies combine to achieve a winning outcome. We suggest that the species with the ability to switch between the active and dormant forms can dominate communities via competitive exclusion.","output":"An alternating active-dormitive strategy enables disadvantaged prey to outcompete the perennially active prey through Parrondos paradox"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic increased the burden on many healthcare systems and in the process, exposed the need for medical resources and physical space.

Person-to-person transmission is accepted but WHO only considers aerosol transmission when procedures or support treatments that produce aerosol are performed. However, transmission mechanisms are not fully understood and there is evidence for an airborne route to be considered as the virus remains viable in aerosols for at least 3h and that mask usage was the best intervention to prevent infection. Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC) are used as a primary infection disease control measure. However, they may contribute to the transmission/spreading of airborne diseases as proposed in the past for SARS. The authors believe that airborne transmission is possible and that HVAC systems when not adequately used may contribute to the transmission of the virus, as suggested by descriptions of from Japan, Germany, and the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. Previous SARS outbreaks reported at Amoy Gardens, Emergency Rooms and Hotels, for example, also suggested airborne transmission. Further studies are warranted to confirm our hypotheses but the assumption of such way of transmission would cause a major shift in measures recommended to prevent infection such as the disseminated use of masks and structural changes to hospital and other facilities HVAC systems.","output":"Airborne route and bad use of ventilation systems as non-negligible factors in SARS-CoV-2 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiological evidence suggests that adverse environmental factors in the nasal cavity may increase the risk for neuropsychiatric diseases.

Systematic socioeconomic effects on social distancing and infections emerge, and most effects do not fade as the virus spreads. Deaths, once infected, are less responsive to socioeconomic covariates. Richer counties tend to see greater gains in social distancing and lower infection rates, controlling for more standard epidemiological factors. Income poverty and inequality tend to increase the infection rate, but these effects are largely accountable to their correlation with racial composition. A more elderly population increases deaths conditional on infections, but has an offsetting effect on the infection rate, consistent with the behavioral responses we find through social distancing.","output":"Inequality and the Coronavirus: Socioeconomic Covariates of Behavioral Responses and Viral Outcomes Across US Counties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Despite Public Health England guidance on interval breast cancer (where a patient with new diagnosis of breast cancer was reported to have a normal screening mammogram within last 3 years or normal family history screening mammogram within last 1 year), there has been no uniform policy in place locally.

We investigate the changing epidemiology of severe visual impairment (SVI) and blindness (BL) in children in the UK in the 21st century. METHODS Comparative analysis of two national population-based epidemiological studies of incident childhood SVI/BL (ICD-10 definition; visual acuity worse than 1.0 LogMAR in the better eye). We carry out comparative analysis of studies conducted in 2000 and 2015 using identical methods. RESULTS Overall annual and cumulative incidence rates remained broadly stable in 2015 at 0.38 per 10 000 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.41) for 0-15 years old and 5.65 per 10 000 (5.16 to 6.18) by 16 years, respectively, and with annual incidence in infancy (3.52 per 10 000, 3.13 to 3.97) remaining considerably higher than any other age. Mortality among children diagnosed in infancy declined (from 61.4 to 25.6 per 1000), despite an increase (from 77% to 84%, p=0.037) in the overall proportion with significant non-ophthalmic impairments/disorders. The relative contribution of all the main groups of disorders increased over time, most notably cerebral visual impairment (from 50% to 61%). Aetiological factors operating prenatally continued to predominate, with an increased relative contribution of hereditary conditions in all children (from 35% to 57%, p<0.001). The substantially elevated rates for any ethnic minority group and those born preterm were unchanged, with amplification of increased rates associated with low birth weight. CONCLUSION The changing landscape of healthcare and increased survival of affected children, is reflected in increasing clinical complexity and heterogeneity of all-cause SVI/BL alongside declining mortality.","output":"Temporal trends in the epidemiology of childhood severe visual impairment and blindness in the UK."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection produces a wide spectrum of manifestations, ranging from no symptom to viral pneumonia. This study aimed to determine the genetic variations in cytokines and their receptors in relation to COVID\\\\19 pathogenesis using bioinformatic tools. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes encoding the cytokines and cytokine receptors elevated in patients with COVID\\\\19 were determined from the National Biotechnology Information Center website (using the dbSNP database). Missense variants were found in 3 cytokine genes and 10 cytokine receptor genes. Computational analyses were conducted to detect the effects of these missense SNPs via cloud\\\\based software tools. Also, the miRSNP database was used to explore whether SNPs in the 3\\\\UTR altered the miRNA binding efficiency for genes of cytokines and their receptors.

ABSTRACT: We investigated whether phycoerythrin (PE), a pigment sourced from marine algae, could act as an immunomodulatory agent in whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). To this end, PE was extracted and purified from a PE-rich macroalgae, Colaconema sp. Our in vitro analysis demonstrated that PE enhanced prophenoloxidase and phagocytosis activity but inhibited the production of reactive oxygen species in hemocytes. Additionally, the PE signal could be detected using an in vivo imaging system after its injection into the ventral sinus of the cephalothorax of whiteleg shrimp. The expression profiles of fourteen immune-related genes were monitored in hemocytes from whiteleg shrimp injected with 0.30 g of PE per gram of body weight, and crustin, lysozyme, penaiedin 4, and anti-lipopolysaccharide factor showed up-regulated post-stimulation. The induction of immune genes and enhancement of innate immune parameters by PE may explain the higher survival rates for shrimp that received different doses of PE prior to being challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus or white spot syndrome virus compared to controls. Combined, these results show that PE from Colaconema sp. can differentially stimulate the immune response of whiteleg shrimp in vitro and in vivo and could potentially be used as an immunomodulator in shrimp culture.","output":"Phycoerythrin from Colaconema sp.

Previous published serological studies showed that sera of Bactrian camels were all negative for MERS-CoV antibodies. However, a recent study revealed that direct inoculation of Bactrian camels intranasally with MERS-CoV can lead to infection with abundant virus shedding and seroconversion. In this study, we examined the presence of MERS-CoV antibodies in Bactrian and hybrid camels in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (where dromedaries are also present), and Bactrian camels in Xinjiang, China (where dromedaries are absent). For the 29 serum samples from Bactrian camels in Dubai tested by the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (S-ELISA) and neutralization antibody test, 14 (48%) and 12 (41%), respectively, were positive for MERS-CoV antibodies. All the 12 serum samples that were positive with the neutralization antibody test were also positive for the S-ELISA. For the 11 sera from hybrid camels in Dubai tested with the S-ELISA and neutralization antibody test, 6 (55%) and 9 (82%), respectively, were positive for MERS-CoV antibodies. All the 6 serum samples that were positive for the S-ELISA were also positive with the neutralization antibody test. There was a strong correlation between the antibody levels detected by S-ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers, with a Spearman coefficient of 0.6262 (P < 0.0001; 95% confidence interval, 0.5062 to 0.7225). All 92 Bactrian camel serum samples from Xinjiang were negative for MERS-CoV antibodies tested using both S-ELISA and the neutralization antibody test. Bactrian and hybrid camels are potential sources of MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Since its first appearance in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has affected >25 countries, with >2,400 cases and an extremely high fatality rate of >30%. The total number of mortalities due to MERS is already greater than that due to severe acute respiratory syndrome. MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been confirmed to be the etiological agent. So far, dromedaries are the only known animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. Previously published serological studies showed that sera of Bactrian camels were all negative for MERS-CoV antibodies. In this study, we observed that 41% of the Bactrian camel sera and 55% of the hybrid camel sera from Dubai (where dromedaries are also present), but none of the sera from Bactrian camels in Xinjiang (where dromedaries are absent), were positive for MERS-CoV antibodies. Based on these results, we conclude that in addition to dromedaries, Bactrian and hybrid camels are also potential sources of MERS-CoV infection.","output":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Antibodies in Bactrian and Hybrid Camels from Dubai"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The personal protective equipment (PPE) and frequent hand hygiene procedures needed during the Coronavirus disease-2019 outbreak impair skin integrity in healthcare workers (HCWs).

Strategies were divided into streams, including the impact of COVID-19 on the hospital and the role of RCWMCH in Western Cape Province, communication strategies, adaptation of clinical services at the hospital, specifically with a paediatric-friendly approach, and staff engagement. Interventions utilised: (i) Specific COVID-19 planning was required at a children's hospital, and lessons were learnt from other international children's hospitals. A similar number of patients and staff were infected by the virus (244 patients and 212 staff members by 21 December 2020). (ii) Measures were put in place to assist creation of capacity at metro hospitals' adult services by accepting children with emergency issues directly to RCWMCH, as well as accepting adolescents up to age 18 years. (iii) The communication strategy was improved to include daily engagement with heads of departments/supervisors by earlymorning structured information meetings. There were also changes in the methods of communication with staff using media such as Zoom, MS Teams and WhatsApp. Hospital-wide information and discussion sessions were held both on social platforms and in the form of smallgroup physical meetings with senior hospital administrators (with appropriate distancing). Labour union representatives were purposefully directly engaged to assess concerns. (iv) Clinical services at the hospital were adapted. These included paediatric-friendly services and physical changes to the hospital environment. (v) Staff engagement was particularly important to assist in allaying staff anxiety, developing a staff screening programme, and provision and training in use of personal protective equipment, as well as focusing on staff wellness. In conclusion, visible management and leadership has allowed for flexibility and adaptability to manage clinical services in various contexts. It is important to utilise staff in different roles during a crisis and to consider the different perspectives of people involved in the services. The key to success, that included very early adoption of the above measures, has been hospital staff taking initiative, searching for answers and identifying and implementing solutions, effective communication, and leadership support.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of COVID-19 on TB service indicators in Addis Ababa, where more than two-thirds of the countrys COVID-19 morbidity was recorded. DESIGN: We performed a comparative retrospective study to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on TB services during the pre-COVID-19 era (from April 2019 to March 2020) and the COVID-19 era (from April 2020 to March 2021) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We extracted data on total TB detection rate, TB treatment success rate, isoniazid prophylaxis therapy, and drug susceptibility tests and others from the health information system. Using Poisson regression, we estimated the incidence rate ratios and the absolute number difference of the indicators (number per quarter and year) in the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 eras. RESULTS: Compared with the pre-COVID-19 era, the total TB detection, bacteriologically confirmed TB, TB treatment success rate, latent TB infection treatment and community health workers engagement in TB detection decreased, respectively, by 11%, 11.8%, 17%, 44.7% and 77.2% during the COVID-19 period.

In this study, we have examined the awareness, attitudes, reported practices, and some broader experiences of the community in Dharavi with respect to COVID-19.

People reported high levels of knowledge about COVID-19, with television (90%), family and friends (56%), and social media (47%) being the main sources of information. The knowledge people had, however, was not free of misconceptions and fear; people were scared of being forcefully quarantined and dying alone during the early days of COVID-19. These fears had negative repercussions in the form of patient-related stigma and hesitancy in seeking healthcare. A year into the pandemic, however, people reported a shift in attitudes from extreme fear to low fear (67% reported perceiving low/no COVID risk in October 2020), contributing to a general laxity in following COVID-appropriate behaviors.

The primary goal of this study was to develop methods to reduce the lead time for serological assay development. An approach involving the computational prediction of diagnostic targets, followed by a rapid synthesis of antigens, was adopted to achieve this objective. To avoid cross-reactivity with other closely related swine coronaviruses, the N protein sequences of PEDV were analyzed to identify sequences unique to PEDV. The potential antigenicity of the identified sequence was predicted computationally using the Jameson-Wolf method. A sequence with a high antigenic index was rapidly synthesized using an in vitro transcription and translation system to yield the diagnostic antigen. The computationally designed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was validated using 169 field sera, whose statuses were determined by a PEDV-specific immunofluorescence assay. Comparison of the computationally designed ELISA to a conventionally developed ELISA, using bacterially expressed N protein, and to the immunofluorescence assay showed a high degree of agreement among the three tests (mean kappa statistic, 0.842). The sensitivity and specificity, compared to the conventionally developed assay, were 90.62 and 95.18, respectively.

Consistent with expectations, negative binomial regressions revealed significant interactions, such that higher stress was only associated with more past-month alcohol use among individuals who reported low levels of meaning in life.

At the time of writing, changes to the structure and nature of the surgical workforce are occurring rapidly, even daily. Surgical educators are utilizing remote learning solutions, including flipped classroom approaches, online educational materials, telemedicine, and simulations, to continue education for surgical residents despite cancelations of face-to-face instruction. Our objective is to delineate an interdisciplinary strategy, utilizing the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), by which we can optimize learning during this pandemic. DESIGN: This perspective describes the UDL framework which can be used to situate solutions to issues with delivery of surgical education during this pandemic within the broader view of strategic inclusive instructional design to meet diverse learning needs.. CONCLUSION: The principles of UDL can inform curricular and pedagogical changes in surgical education that may be employed during a time of social distancing, isolation, and quarantine. UDL involves planning flexibility into curricular design from the outset, recognizing that learners are varied in their learning preferences and capabilities, motivational characteristics, and environmental constraints. Viewing the design of remote learning opportunities through the UDL lens aims to remove barriers to learning during this pandemic by targeting three areas: expansion of the means that information is communicated, ways that learners are supported and motivated, and approaches to assessing learning through available distance learning technologies.","output":"Application of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Principles to Surgical Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction and Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic brought new challenges to the healthcare system, with every patient contact a potential risk to staff This required rapid changes to traditional working methods in order to protect healthcare staff from virus exposure, reduce staff anxiety, and manage limited Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supplies We aimed to rapidly implement a new strategy for ward working, which would maintain high-quality patient care while reducing staff virus exposure and PPE consumption Methods We developed an integrated team working concept called SPACES (Shared Patient Assessments Cuts Exposure for Staff) to gain maximum benefit from every staff-patient contact, regardless of the individual's team role For example, a doctor undertaking a ward round would also perform observations, deliver meals, drinks and medication, and undertake procedures such as venesection, at one single visit saving patient contacts by other healthcare colleagues All staff applied the same principle for each patient contact We recorded individual staff entries into each bay (n=5) and side room (n=7) over 24 hours using the SPACES approach, and compared this to pre-SPACES estimates We also reviewed Ward patient and staff feedback pre- A nd post-SPACES Results We estimated that pre-SPACES there were 97 individual staff entries into a bay of 4 patients, and 36 into each side room, per 24 hours Using SPACES, we reduced this to a median [IQR] of 20 [12-22] entries per bay and 11 [10-16] entries per side room (p=0 06 and 0 02 respectively) This decreased PPE consumption by approximately 75% Patient satisfaction survey responses before and after implementing SPACES were unchanged Staff feedback on SPACES reflected high levels of satisfaction, increased sense of teamwork, and reduced anxiety of contracting COVID-19 Conclusions We showed that using the SPACES initiative in a COVID-19 ward decreased staff exposure to highly infectious patients, with resultant PPE use reductions, while maintaining a high standard of patient care and strengthening team spirit and staff morale Following our successful trial period, SPACES received support from the British Thoracic Society and the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Nursing It has been adopted throughout our trust, and by many centres internationally","output":"Covid-19 Spaces Initiative Reduces Staff Exposure while Maintaining the Quality of Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are prevalent and cause considerable burden of disease. Exercise has been shown to be efficacious to treat major depressive disorders, insomnia, panic disorder with and without agoraphobia and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: This pragmatic, two arm, multi-site randomised controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the manualized, group-based six-months exercise intervention ImPuls, among physically inactive patients with major depressive disorders, insomnia, panic disorder, agoraphobia and PTSD within a naturalistic outpatient context in Germany. A minimum of 375 eligible outpatients from 10 different study sites will be block-randomized to either ImPuls in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU only. ImPuls will be conducted by trained exercise therapists and delivered in groups of six patients. The program will combine (a) moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise carried out two-three times a week for at least 30 min with (b) behavior change techniques for sustained exercise behavior change. All outcomes will be assessed pre-treatment, post-treatment (six months after randomization) and at follow-up (12 months after randomization). Primary outcome will be self-reported global symptom severity assessed with the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18). Secondary outcomes will be accelerometry-based moderate to vigorous physical activity, self-reported exercise, disorder-specific symptoms, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and healthcare costs. Intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted using mixed models. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis will be conducted using incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios. DISCUSSION: Despite its promising therapeutic effects, exercise programs are currently not provided within the outpatient mental health care system in Germany. This trial will inform service providers and policy makers about the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the group-based exercise intervention ImPuls within a naturalistic outpatient health care setting. Group-based exercise interventions might provide an option to close the treatment gap within outpatient mental health care settings.

Importations of SARS-CoV-2 to Israel in late February from multiple countries initiated a rapid outbreak across the country. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes were sequenced from 59 imported samples with a recorded country of importation and 101 early circulating samples in February to mid-March 2020 and analyzed to infer clades and mutational patterns with additional sequences identified Israel available in public databases.

Influenza viruses require host genes to replicate. RNA interference (RNAi) screens can identify host genes coopted by influenza virus for replication. Targeting these proinfluenza genes can provide therapeutic strategies to reduce virus replication. Nineteen proinfluenza G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and 13 proinfluenza ion channel genes were identified in human lung (A549) cells by use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These proinfluenza genes were authenticated by testing influenza virus A/WSN/33-, A/CA/04/09-, and B/Yamagata/16/1988-infected A549 cells, resulting in the validation of 16 proinfluenza GPCR and 5 proinfluenza ion channel genes. These findings showed that several GPCR and ion channel genes are needed for the production of infectious influenza virus. These data provide potential targets for the development of host-directed therapeutic strategies to impede the influenza virus productive cycle so as to limit infection. IMPORTANCE Influenza epidemics result in morbidity and mortality each year. Vaccines are the most effective preventive measure but require annual reformulation, since a mismatch of vaccine strains can result in vaccine failure. Antiviral measures are desirable particularly when vaccines fail. In this study, we used RNAi screening to identify several GPCR and ion channel genes needed for influenza virus replication. Understanding the host genes usurped by influenza virus during viral replication can help identify host genes that can be targeted for drug repurposing or for the development of antiviral drugs. The targeting of host genes is refractory to drug resistance generated by viral mutations, as well as providing a platform for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.","output":"G-Protein-Coupled Receptor and Ion Channel Genes Used by Influenza Virus for Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact febrile neutropenia (FN) has on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children with cancer and their families is poorly understood. We sought to characterize the course of child and parent HRQoL during and following FN episodes. METHOD: Data on HRQoL were collected in the multisite Australian Predicting Infectious ComplicatioNs in Children with Cancer (PICNICC) study. Participants were enrolled between November 2016 to January 2018. The Child Health Utility (CHU9D) was used to assess HRQoL in children (N = 167 FN events) and the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL-8D) was used to assess HRQoL parents (N = 218 FN events) at three time points: 0C3 days, 7-days and 30-days following the onset of FN. Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was used to characterize the course of HRQoL. FINDINGS: For children, three distinct groups were identified: persistently low HRQoL over the 30-day course of follow-up (chronic: N = 78/167; 47%), increasing HRQoL after the onset of FN to 30 days follow-up (recovering: N = 36/167; 22%), and persistently high HRQoL at all three timepoints (resilient: N = 53/167; 32%). Applying these definitions, parents were classified into two distinct groups: chronic (N = 107/218, 49%) and resilient (N = 111/218, 51%). The child being male, having solid cancer, the presence of financial stress, and relationship difficulties between the parent and child were significant predictors of chronic group membership for both parents and children. Children classified as high-risk FN were significantly more likely to belong to the recovery group. Being female, having blood cancers and the absence of financial or relationship difficulties were predictive of both parents and children being in the resilient group. INTERPRETATION: Approximately half the children and parents had chronically low HRQoL scores, which did not improve following resolution of the FN episode. The child's sex, cancer type, and presence of financial and relationship stress were predictive of chronic group membership for both parents and children. These families may benefit from increased financial and psychosocial support during anti-cancer treatment.

Introduction and Objectives: COVID-19 has generated negative consequences for people's mental health. This is the case of Peru, one of the Latin American countries most affected by the pandemic. In this sense, the objective of the study was to translate and validate the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) into Spanish. Material and Method: The participants were 704 university students of health sciences (Mage = 23.39 years, SD = 3.45) who were administered the CAS in Spanish, the Mental Health Inventory-5 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 item. The CAS was translated into Spanish using the forward and backward method. Reliability and evidence of validity based on internal structure and relationship with other variables were examined. Results: The factor analysis confirmed the one-dimensional factor structure of the CAS (2 = 7.62, df = 5, p = .18, 2 / gl = 1.52, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .03 [90% CI .00, .06 ]; SRMR = .02, WRMR = .52); In addition, the factor loadings were large and significant (from .68 to .87).

The validity evidence based on the relationship with other CAS variables was supported by the positive correlation with depression (r = .52, p <.01) and negative with subjective well-being (r = -.50, p <. 01). Furthermore, depression mediates the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and subjective well-being (bootstrap value = - .24, 95% CI = - .28, - .20).

RESULTS: Between 14C28 days from onset of symptoms, IgG, IgA, or IgM antibody responses to RBD were all accurate in identifying recently infected individuals, with 100% specificity and a sensitivity of 97%, 91%, and 81% respectively. Although the estimated median time to becoming seropositive was similar across isotypes, IgA and IgM antibodies against RBD were short-lived with most individuals estimated to become seronegative again by 51 and 47 days after symptom onset, respectively. IgG antibodies against RBD lasted longer and persisted through 75 days post-symptoms. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were highly correlated with neutralizing antibodies targeting the S protein.

Amyloid fibril assays of peptide library mixtures and theoretical predictions identified seven amyloidogenic sequences within the S-protein. All seven peptides in isolation formed aggregates during incubation at 37 C. Three 20-amino acid long synthetic spike peptides (sequence 192C211, 601C620, 1166C1185) fulfilled three amyloid fibril criteria: nucleation dependent polymerization kinetics by ThT, Congo red positivity, and ultrastructural fibrillar morphology. Full-length folded S-protein did not form amyloid fibrils, but amyloid-like fibrils with evident branching were formed during 24 h of S-protein coincubation with the protease neutrophil elastase (NE) in vitro. NE efficiently cleaved S-protein, rendering exposure of amyloidogenic segments and accumulation of the amyloidogenic peptide 194C203, part of the most amyloidogenic synthetic spike peptide.

However, the safety and efficacy of rTM in children with severe ARDS complicated by DIC have not been reported. In this preliminary study, we reported the feasibility of using rTM for the treatment of pneumonia-induced severe ARDS complicated by DIC in children. METHODS: Six children (age: median 10 months old) with pneumonia-induced severe ARDS complicated by DIC were enrolled in this preliminary study. rTM (380 U/kg) was administered for a maximum of 6 days, in addition to conventional therapies after diagnosis of severe ARDS complicated by DIC. After administration of rTM, we measured changes in the plasma TM concentration and evaluated the clinical course, status of DIC and ARDS, and other laboratory findings, including levels of cytokines, chemokines, and biomarkers. RESULTS: In all six children, the plasma concentration of TM increased and DIC scores decreased after administration of rTM. Four of the six children recovered from the severe ARDS complicated by DIC after treatment, and were discharged from the hospital with no complications. In survived children, levels of soluble receptors for advanced glycation end products, interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 decreased after administration of rTM compared to those before rTM.

Distinct from intestinal tuft cells which rely on Type 2 immune signals for their expansion, neither IL-25 nor IL-4R signaling are required to drive tuft cell development in dysplastic/injured lungs. Furthermore, tuft cells were also observed upon bleomycin injury, suggesting that their development may be a general response to severe lung injury. While intestinal tuft cells promote growth and differentiation of surrounding epithelial cells, in the lungs of tuft cell deficient mice, Krt5+ dysplasia still occurs, goblet cell production is unchanged, and there remains no appreciable contribution of Krt5+ cells into more regionally appropriate alveolar Type 2 cells. Together, these findings highlight unexpected differences in signals necessary for lung tuft cell amplification and establish a framework for future elucidation of tuft cell functions in pulmonary health and disease.","output":"Injury-induced pulmonary tuft cells are heterogenous, arise independent of key Type 2 cytokines, and are dispensable for dysplastic repair"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Inhaled nebulised unfractionated heparin (UFH) has a strong scientific and biological rationale that warrants urgent investigation of its therapeutic potential in patients with COVID-19. UFH has antiviral effects and prevents the SARS-CoV-2 virus' entry into mammalian cells. In addition, UFH has significant anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant properties, which limit progression of lung injury and vascular pulmonary thrombosis. METHODS: The INHALEd nebulised unfractionated HEParin for the treatment of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (INHALE-HEP) metatrial is a prospective individual patient data analysis of on-going randomised controlled trials and early phase studies. Individual studies are being conducted in multiple countries. Participating studies randomise adult patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who do not require immediate mechanical ventilation, to inhaled nebulised UFH or standard care. All studies collect a minimum core dataset. The primary outcome for the metatrial is intubation (or death, for patients who died before intubation) at day 28. The secondary outcomes are oxygenation, clinical worsening and mortality, assessed in time-to-event analyses. Individual studies may have additional outcomes. ANALYSIS: We use a Bayesian approach to monitoring, followed by analysing individual patient data, outcomes and adverse events. All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle, considering all participants in the treatment group to which they were assigned, except for cases lost to follow-up or withdrawn. TRIAL REGISTRATION, ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The metatrial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04635241. Each contributing study is individually registered and has received approval of the relevant ethics committee or institutional review board. Results of this study will be shared with the World Health Organisation, published in scientific journals and presented at scientific meetings.","output":"INHALEd nebulised unfractionated HEParin for the treatment of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (INHALE-HEP): Protocol and statistical analysis plan for an investigator-initiated international metatrial of randomised studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe individual levels involved in real estate management are thoroughly discussed in the literature. This paper provides a structured meta-analysis of the different theoretical approaches in German-speaking countries. It also investigates the integration of transaction management and technical due diligence into the concepts of organisation theory. In this process, the interfaces are analysed and optimised models are developed for transferring the technical due diligence findings to the operational level.Design/methodology/approachInterviews with transaction management experts were conducted based on a narrative literature review. These interviews shed light on how the components of transaction management and due diligence are integrated into the transaction process, with a particular focus on technical due diligence. They also provide insights into how the related results are taken into account in relation to the transaction, and how they are transferred into the operational phase.FindingsIt becomes apparent that the role of transaction management is not clearly defined and delimited in the structural model of the real estate industry. Technical due diligence findings are usually transferred to the operation of the property via several, manual interfaces with corresponding losses of knowledge. The related models derived and developed for the purpose of operational optimisation define the role of transaction management against a technical background and identify the interfaces to be considered.Practical implicationsThe significance of transaction management for subsequent operations is discussed and elaborated on. More specifically, transferring safety-relevant, high-priority findings from the technical due diligence exercise plays a crucial role for the modelling stage. On the implementation level, the derived models serve as a basis for customising the internal organisational structure.Originality/valueIn Germany, there has hardly been any research into the involvement of technical experts in the real estate transaction process to date. This paper provides initial approaches to optimising organisational structures and sustainably integrating technical due diligence findings into real estate operations.","output":"Potential for optimising organisational structures in the technical due diligence for real estate transactions in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Lower muscle mass is a known predictor of unfavorable outcomes, but its prognostic impact on patients with COVID-19 is unknown. Purpose To investigate the contribution of CT-derived muscle status in predicting clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods Clinical or laboratory data and outcomes (intensive care unit [ICU] admission and death) were retrospectively retrieved for patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who underwent chest CT on admission in four hospitals in Northern Italy from February 21 to April 30, 2020. The extent and type of pulmonary involvement, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion were assessed. Cross-sectional areas and attenuation by paravertebral muscles were measured on axial CT images at the T5 and T12 vertebral level. Multivariable linear and binary logistic regression, including calculation of odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs, were used to build four models to predict ICU admission and death, which were tested and compared by using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results A total of 552 patients (364 men and 188 women; median age, 65 years [interquartile range, 54-75 years]) were included. In a CT-based model, lower-than-median T5 paravertebral muscle areas showed the highest ORs for ICU admission (OR, 4.8; 95% CI: 2.7, 8.5; P < .001) and death (OR, 2.3; 95% CI: 1.0, 2.9; P = .03). When clinical variables were included in the model, lower-than-median T5 paravertebral muscle areas still showed the highest ORs for both ICU admission (OR, 4.3; 95%: CI: 2.5, 7.7; P < .001) and death (OR, 2.3; 95% CI: 1.3, 3.7; P = .001). At receiver operating characteristic analysis, the CT-based model and the model including clinical variables showed the same area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for ICU admission prediction (AUC, 0.83; P = .38) and were not different in terms of predicting death (AUC, 0.86 vs AUC, 0.87, respectively; P = .28). Conclusion In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, lower muscle mass on CT images was independently associated with intensive care unit admission and in-hospital mortality. ?

Rates vary by a number of factors that can be categorized into different levels of the social ecology. Research and theory in this field point to the importance of community-level factors that can contribute to either risk or prevention of child maltreatment. The COVID-19 pandemic context creates additional risks and concerns related to child maltreatment and exacerbates risk factors that existed before: e.g., families and communities are in much worsened states of poverty, unemployment, and food insecurity; losses and grief are affecting mental health; and limitations and safety concerns are affecting in-person child protection work and more. Central to recovery from this pandemic will be the mobilization of community-level resources and the building back up of the social fabric that can support vulnerable children and caregivers. Key to this mobilization will be a better intersectional understanding of structural inequities in the child welfare system and in our communities. Efforts to dismantle structural biases and discrimination are critical to provide safety and support for families and vital for effective child maltreatment prevention. In this context, we discuss the state of the science of community-level prevention of childhood maltreatment, highlighting evidence-based community-level prevention programs and how these types of efforts may be impacted by the current COVID-19 global pandemic.","output":"Community-Level Prevention of Childhood Maltreatment: Next Steps in a World with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human virome is the viral component of the microbiome.

To this end, samples from AR patients at four different times were analyzed to compare the dynamic bacterial community and structure shifts. Diversity indices Chao1 showed significant difference across different time (p<0.05), and the Kruskal-Wallis test identified that Dialister (OTU_31), Roseburia (OTU_36), Bacteroides (OTU_22), Bacteroides (OTU_2040), and Prevotella_9 (OTU_5) were the significant differential bacterial taxa (p<0.05). These distinctive genera were significantly associated with the change of AR clinical indices and the predicted functional pathways such as PPAR signaling pathway, peroxisome, and citrate cycle (TCA cycle) (p<0.05), indicating that they may be important bacterial signatures involving in the sustained remission in AR (p<0.05). Besides, lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio at 6 months follow-up may also contribute to the long-term remission of AR. No seriously adverse events and safety concerns were observed in this study. In conclusion, XQLD is a meaningful, long-term efficient and safe medication for AR treatment.

METHODS: Study participants completed several questionnaires, such as the EQ-5D-3L, 12-item short-form health survey version 2.0 (SF-12v2), Roland-Morris disability questionnaire (RMQ), and Pain Numeric Rating Scale (Pain NRS). Spearmans correlation analyses of the questionnaire results were conducted to examine the discriminant and convergent validity of the EQ-5D-3L. Finally, EQ-5D-3L results from study participants were compared with those from the comparison group of the general population that were match-sampled according to age and sex from the 2013 Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey. RESULTS: Spearmans correlation coefficients between EQ-5D-3L and pain NRS, SF-12v2, and RMQ were statistically significant. The coefficients between the relevant dimensions, such as mobility in the EQ-5D-3L and physical functioning in the SF-12v2, were higher than those between irrelevant ones. Problems reported by study participants in each dimension of EQ-5D-3L showed statistically significant lower scores in pain NRS, PCS, and MCS from the SF-12v2 and RMQ scores.

An automatic disease detection framework assists doctors in the diagnosis of disease and provides exact, consistent, and fast results and reduces the death rate. Coronavirus (COVID-19) has become one of the most severe and acute diseases in recent times and has spread globally. Therefore, an automated detection system, as the fastest diagnostic option, should be implemented to impede COVID-19 from spreading. This paper aims to introduce a deep learning technique based on the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to diagnose COVID-19 automatically from X-ray images. In this system, CNN is used for deep feature extraction and LSTM is used for detection using the extracted feature. A collection of 4575 X-ray images, including 1525 images of COVID-19, were used as a dataset in this system. The experimental results show that our proposed system achieved an accuracy of 99.4%, AUC of 99.9%, specificity of 99.2%, sensitivity of 99.3%, and F1-score of 98.9%. The system achieved desired results on the currently available dataset, which can be further improved when more COVID-19 images become available.

METHODS Caregivers of patients 18 years of age who received telemedicine services from May 4 to June 18, 2020 (duration of telemedicine use) were eligible for this study. Caregivers were contacted via telephone and given the option to answer the TSQ over the phone, receive a link via email, or decline participation. Providers were administered the modified PSQ as an anonymous, self-report online instrument on the 2 nd week of telemedicine implementation. The study authors were excluded from the PSQ. RESULTS 58/148 caregivers completed the TSQ. The TSQ questions were grouped into three categories: quality of care, similarity to in-person care, and perception of the interaction. Caregivers felt the most satisfied with the perception of the interaction (mean response 4.84, SD 0.08, p < 0.05).

METHODS: From 23rd March, 2020 until 30th June, 2020 complete lockdown was imposed in India. During this period there was restructuring of cancer care and radiation oncology department due to operational policies prevalent in the institution, and the care for gynaecological cancer was based on the evolving international recommendations. Institutional review board approval was obtained to audit patterns of care during complete lockdown phase. Descriptive variables were used to report on patient characteristics, compliance, delays, toxicity and observed deviations in recommended care. RESULT: During the lockdown period spanning 100 days, treatment of 270 and telephonic follow-up of 1103 gyneconcological cancer patients was undertaken. Of 270 new patients, due to travel restrictions, 90 patients were referred to the facilities in vicinity of their residence. Of the remaining 180 patients, 138 were planned for complete treatment at our institution and 42 were referred to our centre for brachytherapy. Of 138 patients, only 106 (76%) completed the planned external radiation. Twenty four (26%), patients completed full course of concurrent chemotherapy, 11 (12%) received chemotherapy dose reduction and 57 (62%) received no concurrent chemotherapy. Treatment delay of upto 3 weeks noted in 8.6% patients due to COVID infection. No grade IV-V acute sequelae were observed. No excess adverse effects were observed in high risk population. Low rate of symptom burden was observed amongst 1103 patients on telephonic follow-up. with 100 (9.6%) patients reporting symptoms Amongst these, (54/100) 54% had complete resolution of symptoms within 4 weeks of teleconsultation, while 10% had disease progression. CONCLUSION: Low compliance to planned treatment was observed for radiation and concurrent chemotherapy due to lockdown and fear of contracting COVID, will likely lead to increased risk of cancer related mortality. Rapid restructuring of care is needed to prevent the same as COVID pandemic further evolves. Summary: The current article provides a real world audit of treatment for gynecological cancers during the complete lockdown phase of COVID Pandemic within tertiary cancer centre in India. Unacceptable treatment delays were noted within the health care system primarily due to societal restrictions posed due to lockdown. No untoward adverse effects were noted as a direct result of COVID infection.

The potential effects of these digital technologies driven developments have also been generating concerns, particularly in safety, security, and regulatory terms. Both hardware and software related changes and challenges in sensitive systems such as safety instrumented systems (SIS) can expose a production asset to new forms of risks. Hence, diverse aspects of cybersecurity have gained serious attention from authorities, operators, and service providers, particularly due to increasing general tendencies of major cyber-attacks on high-risk industrial assets, as well as their significant impact on safety, production, and asset economics terms. A SIS in an offshore oil and gas production asset has a critical role towards its safety integrity level (SIL). In general, a SIS consists of specific safety assurance instruments and pre-defined safety functions that are tightly coupled to detect, prevent, or mitigate hazardous situations ensuring process safety. Under the current industrial contexts of major changes within the offshore oil and gas production sector, partly due to unavoidable commercial changes and partly due to rapid technological developments, a better understanding of the cybersecurity exposure potentials of SIS is quite important to mitigate unwanted events and incidents. Under such circumstances, this paper explores critical issues and challenges related to cybersecurity of SIS as an extended step of a research study done in collaboration with industrial partners. It assesses the current actual status, requirements in governing standards and guidelines, and identifies some dangerous failure modes of SISs that need due security-oriented attention in a continuous asset digitalisation process. Towards the end, the paper defines and elaborates in-depth on specific issues and challenges relating to cybersecurity of SIS. Moreover, it identifies and reflects on generic initial steps that can be taken for assurance of cybersecurity of SIS within offshore oil and gas production assets to ensure necessary safety and security integrity levels under rapidly changing industrial contexts.","output":"Cybersecurity of Offshore Oil and Gas Production Assets Under Trending Asset Digitalization Contexts: A Specific Review of Issues and Challenges in Safety Instrumented Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Achievement of financial stability, good sales results and generating return on investment are discussed as being among the main goals of entrepreneurship in general.

Top scoring genes were further validated and assessed in the context of MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E infection as well as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Strikingly, we found that several autophagy-related genes, including TMEM41B, MINAR1, and the immunophilin FKBP8, were common host factors required for pan-CoV replication. Importantly, inhibition of the immunophilin protein family with the compounds cyclosporine A, and the nonimmunosuppressive derivative alisporivir, resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of CoV replication in primary human nasal epithelial cell cultures, which recapitulate the natural site of virus replication.

Identification of immune correlates of control in post-treatment controllers could aid in designing effective HIV-1 vaccine and remission strategies. Here, we perform comprehensive immunoprofiling of the humoral response to HIV-1 in long-term post-treatment controllers. Global multivariate analyses combining clinico-virological and humoral immune data reveal distinct profiles in post-treatment controllers experiencing transient viremic episodes off therapy compared to those stably aviremic. Virally-exposed post-treatment controllers display stronger HIV-1 humoral responses, and develop more frequently Env-specific memory B cells and cross-neutralizing antibodies. Both are linked to short viremic exposures, which are also accompanied by an increase in blood atypical memory B cells and activated subsets of circulating follicular helper T cells.

The decision on whether patients require follow-up for shoulder range of movement is down to the physiotherapist, based on patient presentation on discharge from the ward, with patients who are not easily achieving 90 degrees of shoulder flexion and abduction receiving follow-up. The objective of this study was to see if our breast reconstruction patients were regaining good upper limb function and returning to their normal activity in the expected timescales of 12 weeks with our current pre and post-operative physiotherapy care plans, or whether they require further physiotherapy follow-up. Methods: All patients who were listed for reconstructive surgery were asked to complete the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) at their pre-operative appointment with the Reconstruction Specialist Nurse to give a baseline score for shoulder function. All patients received normal treatment (pre-op Breast forum, ward based care, clinic and outpatient appointment follow-up if indicated). Patients were telephoned at target of 12 weeks post op to repeat SPADI and review return to activity, work and to establish if they had any other physiotherapy related ongoing difficulties. Results: 36 patients completed pre-op SPADI, 20 patients completed pre and post op SPADIs and further assessment questions in the study period (October 2019 to March 2020). 16 patients were lost to follow up due to Covid postponing their surgery. Target for follow-up was 12 weeks, this ranged from 12 to 15 weeks. 9 patients had routine clinic follow-up based on clinical need on assessment on ward, with 1 also requiring outpatient appointments. Only 2 patients had a change in score of >18 (Threshold of minimally clinically important change). Both of these patients had IMPROVED scores post op compared to pre-op. For scores worse than pre-op, range was 0C16.1 (not clinically significant). 5 patients had not returned to their hobbies at 12 weeks, but reasons were due to ongoing chemotherapy, shielding for Covid and slow healing wounds. 11 patients had not returned to work, but not because of problems with shoulder function. 3 patients reported ongoing low back pain, 11 had sore or tight donor sites and 3 reported ongoing soreness of their breast. 1 patient reported feelings of low mood and 2 had ongoing fatigue. Conclusion(s): Patients do regain use of their upper limbs to pre-op level in expected timescale with the current treatment regime. It is not shoulder ROM that is restricting return to work or hobbies Many patients reporting tightness of donor site and, in some cases, low back pain. There may be scope for a further study to see if more Physiotherapy input for donor site exercises post-operatively can influence this. Impact: This study suggests that the current level of Physiotherapy assessment and follow up is sufficient to detect patients who will benefit from ongoing therapy.

OBJECTIVES: : We evaluated the dynamics of the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in two women who were breastfeeding when infected. We assessed paired breast milk and serum samples for six months post-infection for antibodies specific to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. RESULTS: : Starting at 10 days after symptom onset, IgA antibody levels were persistent over a 6-month time period in human milk. For both mothers, no detectable IgA was found in the samples collected pre-symptom onset. RBD-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in tandem serum collected from the two donors demonstrated stable IgG levels over the six-month time period post-symptom onset.

However, data concerning the epidemiological features, viral shedding, and antibody dynamics between asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers and COVID-19 patients remain controversial. METHODS: We enrolled 193 SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects in Ningbo and Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China, from January 21 to March 6, 2020. All subjects were followed up to monitor the dynamics of serum antibody immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using colloidal gold-labeled and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Of those, 31 were asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers, 148 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, and 14 presymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Compared to symptomatic COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic carriers were younger and had higher levels of white blood cell and lymphocyte, lower level of C-reactive protein, and shorter viral shedding duration. Conversion of IgM from positive to negative was shorter in asymptomatic carriers than in COVID-19 patients (7.5 vs. 25.5 days, P = 0.030). The proportion of those persistently seropositive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was higher in COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (66.1% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.037). Viral load was higher in symptomatic patients than presymptomatic patients (P = 0.003) and asymptomatic carriers (P = 0.004). Viral shedding duration was longer in presymptomatic COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (48.0 vs. 24.0 days, P = 0.002). Asymptomatic carriers acquired infection more from intra-familial transmission than did COVID-19 patients (89.0% vs. 61.0%, P = 0.028). In 4 familial clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infection, asymptomatic carriers were mainly children and young adults while severe COVID-19 was mainly found in family members older than 60 years with comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic carriers might have a higher antiviral immunity to clear SARS-CoV-2 than symptomatic COVID-19 patients and this antiviral immunity should be contributable to innate and adaptive cellular immunity rather than humoral immunity. The severity of COVID-19 is associated with older age and comorbidities in familial clustering cases.","output":"Epidemiological feature, viral shedding, and antibody seroconversion among asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers and symptomatic/presymptomatic COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The yellow head virus (YHV) has been reported to be one of most pathogenic viruses for cultivated shrimp; however, serious problems have only been reported in farms in south and southeastern Asian.

Depression was defined as a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score of 10 or higher. Other questionnaires included one measuring psycho-behavioural and social changes, and stress, due to COVID-19, a six-item version of the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6), and a three-item version of the UCLA loneliness scale. RESULTS: Of the 1492 participants not infected by COVID-19, 312 (20.9%) exhibited depression. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that depression was positively associated with COVID-19-related stress and psycho-behavioural variables such as disturbances in eating and sleeping, younger age, smoking, underlying mental illness, and loneliness scale scores. In contrast, exercise three or more times per week and GQ-6 scale scores were inversely associated with depression. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining daily routines including eating, sleeping, and regular exercise and focusing on gratitude may be important for the prevention of depression.

CIPNM diagnosis is usually limited to clinical evaluation. We compared patients with ARDS from COVID-19 and other aetiologies, in whom a neurophysiological evaluation for the detection of CIPNM was performed. The aim was to determine if there were any differences between these two groups in frequency of CINPM and outcome at discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective study performed on mechanically ventilated patients consecutively admitted (January 2016-June 2020) to the ICU of Careggi Hospital, Florence, Italy, with ARDS of different aetiologies. Neurophysiological evaluation was performed on patients with stable ventilation parameters, but marked widespread hyposthenia (Medical Research Council score <48). Creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and mean morning glycaemic values were collected. RESULTS: From a total of 148 patients, 23 with COVID-19 infection and 21 with ARDS due to other aetiologies, underwent electroneurography/electromyography (ENG/EMG) recording. Incidence of CIPNM was similar in the two groups, 65% (15 of 23) in COVID-19 patients and 71% (15 of 21) in patients affected by ARDS of other aetiologies. At ICU discharge, subjects with CIPNM more frequently required ventilatory support, regardless the aetiology of ARDS. CONCLUSION: ENG/EMG represents a useful tool in the identification of the neuromuscular causes underlying ventilator wean failure and patient stratification.

Invasive hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) has been accepted as treatment alternative to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for selected patients, while transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) of the upper airway is being investigated as non-invasive alternative. METHODS: A meta-analysis (CRD42017074674) on the effects of both HNS and TES on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) in OSA was conducted including published evidence up to May 2018. Random-effects models were used. Heterogeneity and between-study variance were assessed by I2 and &#964;2, respectively. RESULTS: Of 41 identified clinical trials, 20 interventional trials (n = 895) could be pooled in a meta-analysis (15 HNS [n = 808], 5 TES [n = 87]). Middle-aged (mean  SD 56.9  5.5 years) and overweight (body mass index 29.1  1.5 kg/m2) patients with severe OSA (AHI 37.5  7.0/h) were followed-up for 6.9  4.0 months (HNS) and 0.2  0.4 months (TES), respectively. The AHI improved by - 24.9 h-1 [95%CI - 28.5, - 21.2] in HNS (&#967;2 79%, I2 82%) and by - 16.5 h-1 [95%CI - 25.1, - 7.8] in TES (&#967;2 7%, I2 43%; both p < 0.001).

STUDY DESIGN We offered the study at 10 sites that provided the service in 13 states and Washington DC. Interested individuals obtained any needed pre-abortion tests locally and had a videoconference with a study clinician. Sites sent study packages containing mifepristone and misoprostol by mail and had remote follow-up consultations within one month by telephone (or by online survey, if the participant could not be reached) to evaluate abortion completeness. The analysis was descriptive. RESULTS We mailed 1390 packages between May 2016 and September 2020. Of the 83% (1157/1390) of abortions for which we obtained outcome information, 95% (1103/1157) were completed without a procedure. Participants made 70 unplanned visits to emergency rooms or urgent care centers for reasons related to the abortion (6%), and ten serious adverse events occurred, including five transfusions (0.4%). Enrollment increased substantially with the onset of COVID-19. Although a screening ultrasound was required, sites determined in 52% (346/669) of abortions that occurred during COVID that those participants should not get the test to protect their health. Use of urine pregnancy test to confirm abortion completion increased from 67% (144/214) in the six months prior to COVID to 90% (602/669) in the six months during COVID. Nearly all satisfaction questionnaires (99%, 1013/1022) recorded that participants were satisfied with the service. CONCLUSIONS This direct-to-patient telemedicine service was safe, effective, and acceptable, and supports the claim that there is no medical reason for mifepristone to be dispensed in clinics as required by the Food and Drug Administration.

Therefore, this work reports the development of a novel comprehensive strategy based on an online middle-pressure chromatography and preparative HPLC for rapid enrichment and separation of flavonoid glycosides from Sphaerophysa salsula. First, the flavonoid glycosides were enriched using an online middle-pressure chromatographic column containing stationary MCI phase. During this process, the high-volume injection of the extracting solution was realized by an empty pre-column positioned before the main chromatographic tower. Then, the compounds were separated through preparative HPLC with Megress C18. As a result, one new flavonol 3-O-glycoside (2) together with two known flavonol 3-O-glycosides (1, 3) were targetedly isolated from Sphaerophysa salsula. The content of compounds 1-3 in Sphaerophysa salsula was 0.09, 0.11, and 0.18 wt%, respectively.

The connectedness of households and their providers was determined by network analysis. Results. A total of 568 households (incorporating 2900 members) and 65 providers were enrolled. Households reported 636 health events in the prior month. Households sought care for 35% (n=220) and treated with home remedies for 44% (n=277). The odds of seeking care increased 217% for severe events (aOR=3.17; 95%CI 1.99-5.05; p< 0.001). The odds of seeking care from a conventional provider increased by 37% with increasing distance (aOR=1.37; 95%CI 1.06-1.79; p=0.016). Despite stating an intention to seek care from conventional providers, there was a lack of congruence in practice that favored non-conventional providers (McNemar's Chi-squared Test p<0.001). Care was sought from primary providers for 68% (n=150) of cases within a three-tiered network; 25% (n=38/150) were non-conventional. Conclusion. Addressing geographic barriers, possibly with technology solutions, should be prioritized to meet healthcare seeking intentions while developing approaches to connect non-conventional providers into healthcare networks when geographic barriers cannot be overcome.","output":"Opportunities to catalyze improved healthcare access in pluralistic systems: a cross-sectional study in Haiti"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Livestream shopping is getting more and more popular as a new shopping form.

In this study, we aim to explore streamers' malicious selling strategies and how viewers may perceive these strategies. First, we collected 40 livestream shopping sessions from two popular livestream platforms in China -- Taobao and Douyin (TikTok of Chinese version). We identified three categories of malicious selling strategies (i.e., Compulsive, Restrictive, and Designing) and found platform designs mostly enhanced these malicious selling strategies. Second, through an interview study with 13 end users, we provide a rich description of users' awareness of malicious selling strategies and challenges to counter malicious selling.

MALT is subdivided into parts (clusters) depending on their anatomical location, but they all have a similar structure: mucus layer, epithelial tissue, lamina propria and lymphoid follicles. Plasma cells of MALT produce a unique type of immunoglobulins, IgA, which have the ability to polymerize. In mucosal immunization, the predominant form of IgA is a secretory dimer, sIgA, which is concentrated in large quantities in the mucosa. Mucosal IgA acts as a first line of defense and neutralizes viruses efficiently at the portal of entry, preventing infection of epithelial cells and generalization of infection. To date, several mucosal antiviral vaccines have been licensed, which include attenuated strains of the corresponding viruses: poliomyelitis, influenza, and rotavirus. Despite the tremendous success of these vaccines, in particular, in the eradication of poliomyelitis, significant disadvantages of using attenuated viral strains in their composition are the risk of reactogenicity and the possibility of reversion to a virulent strain during vaccination. Nevertheless, it is mucosal vaccination, which mimics a natural infection, is able to induce a fast and effective immune response and thus help prevent and possibly stop outbreaks of many viral infections. Currently, a number of intranasal vaccines based on a new vector approach are successfully undergoing clinical trials. In these vaccines, the safe viral vectors are used to deliver protectively significant immunogens of pathogenic viruses. The most tested vector for intranasal vaccines is adenovirus, and the most significant immunogen is SARSCoV-2 S protein.

METHOD We report a retrospective case series of 10 surgical inpatients diagnosed with SARS following an outbreak in the surgical wards. Patients were included if they fulfilled the WHO case definition of probable SARS, had an active surgical problem and were admitted to the surgical wards during the outbreak period. Clinical histories, laboratory investigations and radiological findings were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS The mean age of the cohort was 57.6 years (range: 38-78 years). Nine patients had concomitant medical conditions. Three patients were in the early postoperative period, while the remaining seven were admitted for surgical related infections. All patients presented with fever, but only eight had accompanying respiratory symptoms. Lymphopenia and raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was seen in seven patients. Eight patients had positive bacterial cultures. The primary abnormality on chest radiograph was air-space opacification. Rapid progression of radiological changes was seen in seven patients. Mortality rate for our cohort is 20%. CONCLUSION The diagnosis of SARS in surgical patients differs from that previously described in normal patients. An apparent cause of fever and positive blood cultures cannot exclude a diagnosis of SARS. The current WHO case definition could result in delayed or even missed diagnosis.

DNN-AES models require training on a large dataset of graded essays. However, assigned grades in such datasets are known to be strongly biased due to effects of rater bias when grading is conducted by assigning a few raters in a rater set to each essay. Performance of DNN models rapidly drops when such biased data are used for model training.

The clinical characteristics of the patients who received tocilizumab were compared to those of patients who received baricitinib. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses of the outcomes of all-cause mortality and improvement in respiratory status were performed. The development of secondary infection events was analyzed using the KaplanCMeier method and the log-rank test. Results: Of the 459 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during the study, 64 received tocilizumab treatment and 34 baricitinib treatment, and those 98 patients were included in the study.

We have recently shown that PD-associated sensory neuropathy in patients is associated with high levels of glucosylceramides. Here, we assessed the underlying pathology and mechanisms in Pink1-/- SNCAA53T double mutant mice. METHODS: We studied nociceptive and olfactory behaviour and the neuropathology of dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), including ultrastructure, mitochondrial respiration, transcriptomes, outgrowth and calcium currents of primary neurons, and tissue ceramides and sphingolipids before the onset of a PD-like disease that spontaneously develops in Pink1-/- SNCAA53T double mutant mice after 15 months of age. RESULTS: Similar to PD patients, Pink1-/- SNCAA53T mice developed a progressive prodromal sensory neuropathy with a loss of thermal sensitivity starting as early as four months of age. In analogy to human plasma, lipid analyses revealed an accumulation of glucosylceramides (GlcCer) in the DRGs and sciatic nerves, which was associated with pathologic mitochondria, impairment of mitochondrial respiration, and deregulation of transient receptor potential and TRPV and TRPA channels at mRNA, protein and functional levels in DRGs. Direct exposure of DRG neurons to GlcCer caused transient hyperexcitability, followed by a premature decline of the viability of sensory neurons cultures upon repeated GlcCer application. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that pathological GlcCer contribute to prodromal sensory disease in PD mice via mitochondrial damage and calcium channel hyperexcitability.

This phenomenon not only echoes with the idea of the deconstructed church that Marti and Ganiel described among millennials in the US (Marti and Ganiel 2014), it also imposes a challenge for Latin American religious studies, whose trend has been to ignore the postdenominational category, favoring the continued use of Pentecostal and/or Neopentecostal/charismatic to refer to these congregations, which makes it difficult to understand the changes, the innovation, and the deconstructive processes that postdenominational churches have been undergoing in the last three decades.","output":"Beards, Tattoos, and Cool Kids: Lived Religion and Postdenominational Congregations in Northwestern Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on its forensic capacity and experience gained worldwide from the management of the dead in emergencies, including epidemics, the International Committee of the Red Cross has been asked by the authorities and other relevant stakeholders in some of its operational contexts to advise on the planning, preparation and management of cemeteries during COVID19.

The relationship between health literacy and decisional conflict while making a major medical treatment decision is not understood. OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence of individuals making major medical treatment decisions for themselves or someone else and to explore the relationships between decisional conflict and circumstances of the decision as well as the decision-maker. DESIGN: Two-phase survey study: in phase 1, we screened for who made a major treatment decision; in phase 2, we asked eligible respondents about their experience making the decision. PARTICIPANTS: Address-based random sample of 4000 Wisconsin residents; 1072 completed phase 1 and 464 completed phase 2. MAIN MEASURES: We asked respondents about types of decisions made, the most difficult decision made, and characteristics of the decision-maker and the decision. We included the Decisional Conflict Scale and four domains of the Health Literacy Questionnaire. Open-ended questions also allowed respondents to describe their experiences. KEY RESULTS: About 43% of respondents reported making a major medical treatment decision. Decisions about major surgery and life support were regarded as the most difficult decisions. Respondents who made the decision for a spouse/partner ( = 6.65, p = 0.012), parent ( = 9.27, p < 0.001), or someone else ( = 10.7, p < 0.001) had higher decisional conflict.

Furthermore, it provides a guarantee of vegetable production in the short growing season of agricultural lands in the northern hemisphere and at high altitudes. The growing human population needs super early plant cultivars for these agricultural lands to meet future global demands. This study examined de novo super-early progeny, referred to as much earlier than that of the earlier parent, which flowered in 13C17 days and pod setting in 18C29 days after germination, discovered in F(2) and studied up to F(5) derived from interspecific crosses between garden pea (P. sativum L.) and the most distant relative of pea (P. fulvum Sibth. et Sm.). De novo super-early progeny were found to be earlier by about one month than P. sativum and two months than P. fulvum under short day conditions in the F(5) population. In respect of days to flowering and pod setting, de novo super-early progeny had a relatively high level of narrow sense heritability (h(2) = 82% and 80%, respectively), indicating that the selections for earliness in segregating populations was effective for improvement of extreme early maturing varieties. De novo super-early progeny could be grown under heat stress conditions due to the escape ability. Vegetable types were not only high yielding but also free of any known undesirable traits from the wild species, such as pod dehiscence and non-uniform maturity. It could be considered complementary to speed breeding, possibly obtaining more than six generations per year in a suitable climate chamber. Not only de novo super-early progeny but also transgressive segregation for agro-morphological traits can be created via interspecific crosses between P. sativum and P. fulvum, a precious unopened treasure in the second gene pool.

These individuals represent the majority of patients affected by the disease and are routinely treated at home, facing periods of quarantine. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. All people who tested positive for COVID-19 and classified as mild cases (i.e., no alarm sign/symptom, no need for in-person consultation) during the treatment in the public health system of a Brazilian city with around 160,000 inhabitants were monitored by phone for all the COVID-19 symptoms listed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the active phase of the disease (i.e., no longer experiencing symptoms, up to 14 days in mild cases). After this phase (median = 108 days after intake, IQR = 76C137), we asked these patients who were classified as experiencing mild COVID-19 (n = 993) about last-month substance use in three time-points: pre-COVID, just after COVID-19 acute phase (post-COVID acute phase) and in the period before survey (post-COVID follow-up phase). Results: The number of COVID-19 symptoms was not associated with pre- or post-infection substance use. Pre-COVID alcohol and non-medical benzodiazepine use were associated with specific COVID-19 symptoms. However, sensitivity analyses showed that such associations could be explained by previous psychiatric and medical profiles. Alcohol and tobacco use decreased and non-medical analgesics increased in the post-COVID acute phase. However, just alcohol use remained lower in the post-COVID follow-up period. Higher pre-COVID levels of tobacco and alcohol were associated with post-COVID follow-up cannabis and non-medical analgesic use, respectively. Non-medical benzodiazepine use had positive and negative bi-directional associations with cannabis and non-medical analgesic use, respectively. Conclusion: We were not able to find specific associations between substance use and COVID-19 symptomatology in the present study. Patients with mild COVID-19 should be monitored for substance use in the post-COVID-19 period, and preventive interventions for non-medical analgesic use should be implemented. Focused preventive interventions increasing the perceived risks of cannabis and non-medical benzodiazepine and analgesic use among people experiencing mild COVID-19 that reported previous substance use could be useful.","output":"Substance Use in Mild-COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background and aims The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide emergency. An increasing number of diarrhea cases is reported. Here we investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation, molecular mechanisms, management, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 associated diarrhea. Methods We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to March 2020 to identify studies documenting diarrhea and mechansism of intestinal inflammation in patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases. It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms. A pooled analysis revealed an overall percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%. SARS-CoV uses the the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not only expressed in lung, but also in the small intestinal epithelia. ACE2 is expressed furthermore in the upper esophagus, liver, and colon. SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV. Several reports indicate viral RNA shedding in stool detectable longer time period than in nasopharyngeal swabs. Current treatment is supportive, but several options appear promising and are the subject of investigation. Conclusion Diarrhea is a frequent presenting symptom in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Increasing evidence indicates possible fecal oral transmission, indicating the need for a rapid and effective modification of the screening and diagnostic algorithms.

Concurrent circulation of COVID 19 has led to service disruptions and delays in the standard procedures related to lung cancer (LC) diagnose and may negatively impact in the management, care and therapeutic patient intervention. We aimed to determine COVID 19 impact in the molecular diagnosis of LC at our institution. Methods: A total of 203 patients (pts) diagnosed with advanced NSCLC with molecular testing requested in the period of 2019C2020 were included. Clinical characteristics and testing patient results evaluated in 2019 and 2020 were compared. The SOC at our institution includes evaluation of DNA and RNA from tissue(t) and/or blood(b) with NGS or nCounter. Single-gene testing by PCR, IHC and/or FISH is used as complementary assays to NGS when tissue is limited or in case of genomic platform service interruptions. Results: A total of 106 and 97 pts were required for molecular testing during 2019 and 2020 respectively. Clinical patient characteristics in both cohorts were very similar and there were no significant differences in the number of DNA-based or RNA-based analyses required between both period times (DNAt p = 0.25;DNAb p = 0.59;RNAt p =.08). The 2019 cohort identified 66 pts (65%) with driver genes: being KRAS the most commonly detected (34%), followed by EGFR 15%, BRAF 4%, ALK 4% and MET14 4%. During 2020, driver alterations were found in 56 pts (60%) in a quite similar proportion except for KRAS mutations, 21%. The total number of non evaluable (NE) samples was significantly increased in 2020 compared to 2019 (p =.029). During 2019, 80% of the NE samples could be evaluated by any multiplex technique. On the contrary, during 2020 only 54% of NE were tested by any NGS-based method. Conclusions: Our results show that molecular diagnosis of LC could be preserved during the COVID 19 outbreak. However genomic service disruptions during critical months of the pandemic clearly impacted in the number of pts with a NE result and might explain the differences in the incidence of KRAS mutations observed. While this global crisis rightly demands the world's attention, a continuous and accurate molecular diagnostic testing must be ensured to guarantee quality-care for LC pts.

The particles were tracked using a Lagrangian particle tracking code coupled with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model Ansys Fluent. Air transport was assumed to occur due to indoor ventilation. Flow dynamics were simulated using the Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) approach. The movement and spreading of 5- and 20-mu m particles were studied with 0%, 25%, and 100% attachment efficiencies on surfaces in the supermarket. We found that the indoor airflows can significantly enhance the transport of particles (e.g., &gt;15 m for 5 mu m, and &gt;5 m for 20 mu m);therefore, the 6-ft (2.0 m) social distance recommended by health experts would not be sufficient to prevent the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We found that the attachment on surfaces reduces the transport of particles significantly within the supermarket, and that an attachment efficiency of 25% results in transport similar to that resulting from 100% efficiency. This suggests that the type of surfaces is not crucial in terms of air transport of particles. We support the existing approaches for reducing exposure between people through the adoption of one-way movement within an aisle. However, we also propose placing display shelves within the aisles in a staggered way to form baffles that would both increase the surface area and block the transport of airborne particles. We found that virus-laden particles could be sucked into the ventilation system through return vents, and could pose potential infection risks for the buildings connected to the same ventilation system. Hence, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and pleated filters with a minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) greater than 12 are recommended.

Many intensive care units have been understaffed and the majority of nurses working in these units have little experience. OBJECTIVE To describe how the skilled tele-intensive care unit nurses in our health system quickly changed from a patient-focused strategy to a clinician-focused approach during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis. METHODS We modified workflows, deployed home workstations, and changed staffing models with the goal of providing additional clinical support to bedside colleagues while reducing exposure time and conserving personal protective equipment for those caring for this highly contagious patient population. The unit changed focus and granted more than 300 clinicians access to technology that enabled them to care for patients remotely, added nearly 200 mobile carts, and allowed more than 20 tele-intensive care unit nurses to work from home. RESULTS Tele-intensive care unit nursing provided clinical knowledge to the nurses covering current and expanded critical care units. Using technology, virtual rounding, and increased collaboration with nurses, tele-intensive care unit nursing minimized the risk to bedside nurses while maintaining a high level of care for patients.

During recent years, Indias water usage has increased and diversified, creating both increased water shortages and water quality degradation in rivers and aquifers, thereby threatening broader environmental sustainability. River healthcare gaps blight the quality of life of the average Indian who have been relegated to the periphery. Whereas governments are expected to restore and maintain the wholesomeness of the rivers ensuring environmental flows and preventing the pollution ingress into the water bodies, it is also noteworthy that the protection of water and environmental infrastructure is a social responsibility of every citizenboth individually and collectively. In this background, the paper examines the Ganga conservation and rejuvenation strategies and its impact on environment and drinking water. While government is committed for conserving and rejuvenating National River Ganga, and also addressing interrelated issues like sustainable agriculture, basin protection against floodplains disasters, river hazard management, urban river management, wastewater management and revival of water bodies for providing environmentally safe sanitation and through a well-designated scheme of afforestation in riparian zones to purify base flows and run-off draining into the river, they are also working on to enhance the ecosystem services of our rivers and water bodies that remain healthy for downstream users. In this regard, institutional network of integrated water resource management plan, policy and regulatory governance provides synergy and helps other key stakeholders, experts, investors and well-wishers. On micro-level, key points of river restoration include aspects of flows (aviralta, nirmalta) and functions of river as geologic entity and ecological entity. One may track river science, engineering and operations including afforestation and biodiversity to suggest ways of improving the overall efficacy of aquatic ecology, ecological restoration (lateral, longitudinal and vertical connectivity) and geological safeguarding (sediment transport, assessing quantity, quality and nutrient value). Critical success of recovering wastewater and restoration of drains are components of urban river management. Decentralized infrastructure can greatly enhance the speed of water treatment leading to one city-one operator through reuse of treated sewage/trade effluents. In order to have a successful water economics, it essentially requires creating enabling environment for sustained infrastructure management through water valuation, pricing and effective implementation of the urban river management strategies, and well-functioning water markets.

AIMS: The aim of this prospective study is to scrutinize the dynamic changes in vital parameters, change in end tidal CO(2) (PETCO(2)) levels, the relationship of these changes with taking a break, and the subjective complaints caused by respiratory protection, while healthcare providers are performing their duties with the N95 mask. METHODS: The prospective cohort included 54 healthcare workers (doctors, nurses, paramedics) who worked in the respiratory unit of the emergency department (ED) and performed their duties by wearing valved N95 masks and face shields. The vital parameters and PETCO(2) levels were measured at 0C4thC5th and 9th hours of the work-shift. RESULTS: Only the decrease in diastolic BP between 0 and 9 h was statistically significant (p = 0.038). Besides, mean arterial pressure (MAP) values indicated a significant decrease between 0C9 h and 5C9 h (p = 0.024 and p = 0.049, respectively). In terms of the vital parameters of the subjects working with and without breaks, only PETCO(2) levels of those working uninterruptedly increased significantly at the 4th hour in comparison to the beginning-of-shift baseline levels (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Although the decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and MAP values is assumed to be caused by increased fatigue due to workload and work pace as well as increase in muscle activity, the increase in PETCO(2) levels in the ED healthcare staff working with no breaks between 0 and 4 h should be noted in terms of PPE-induced hypoventilation.","output":"The effect of N95 respirators on vital parameters, PETCO(2), among healthcare providers at the pandemic clinics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Document: \\"This Insight provides a brief overview of Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) declarations and federal assistance programs that may be available for wildfires on nonfederal lands \\"","output":"2020 Wildfire Season: Brief Overview of FEMA Programs and Resources [August 21, 2020]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Service firms invest much to ensure authentic and positive emotion displays from frontline employees And yet, inauthentic positive displays (fake smiles) remain common, and at times, employees even show authentic negative displays (e g , anger), thereby compromising service performance Customer reactions to such unwanted emotion displays are heterogeneous, so managers need to know when possible negative effects on service performance are more or less strong The literature on customer reactions to inauthentic displays is inconclusive and focuses on the moment of service delivery We shine light on how predelivery choice confidence shapes customer reactions to inauthentic positive displays and demonstrate that customers? high confidence in their service provider choice mitigates the negative effects of display inauthenticity We present evidence in terms of tipping in a field study and replicate this interaction effect in three experiments A serial mediation by cognitive dissonance and decision regret explains the conditional effect of inauthenticity We also contrast inauthentic positive displays with authentic negative displays The latter yield the worst service performance, unmitigated by choice confidence We provide recommendations on how to ensure authentic positive displays (e g , recruitment, resources, and rewards), taking into account circumstances that affect choice confidence and market shocks (e g , the COVID-19 pandemic)","output":"Frontline Employees Display of Fake Smiles and Angry Faces: When and Why They Influence Service Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) has potential to play a significant role in realizing a reversal of the current paradigm in health care toward a more patient-centric and more collaborative system to improve the outcomes obtained along with the quality and sustainability of health care systems. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore and understand individual mHealth acceptance drivers between two groups of users: those with chronic health conditions and those without. METHODS: The extended unified theory of acceptance and usage of technology (UTAUT2) was enhanced with a new health-related framework: behavior intention to recommend and new mediation effects. We applied partial least squares (PLS) causal modeling to test the research model. RESULTS: We obtained 322 valid responses through an online questionnaire. The drivers of behavior intention with statistical significance were performance expectancy (=.29, P<.001), habit (=.39, P<.001), and personal empowerment (=.18, P=.01). The precursors of use behavior were habit (= .47, P<.001) and personal empowerment (=.17, P=.01). Behavior intention to recommend was significantly influenced by behavior intention (=.58, P<.001) and personal empowerment (=.26, P<.001).

On the other hand, assuming HWE holds in the study population, a truly associated SNP is expected to be out of HWE in the case group. Efforts have been made in combining association tests with tests of HWE in the cases to increase the power of detecting disease susceptibility loci (Song and Elston (2006), Wang and Shete (2010)). However, these existing methods are ad-hoc and sensitive to model assumptions. Utilizing the recent robust allele-based (RA) regression model for conducting allelic association tests (Zhang and Sun (2020)), here we propose a joint RA test that naturally integrates association evidence from the traditional association test and a test that evaluates the difference in HWD between the case and control groups. The proposed test is robust to genotyping error, as well as to potential HWD in the population attributed to factors that are unrelated to phenotype-genotype association. We provide the asymptotic distribution of the proposed test statistic so that it is easy to implement, and we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the test through extensive simulation studies and an application.","output":"Leveraging HardyCWeinberg disequilibrium for association testing in case-control studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proinflammatory cytokines play a central role in depression-like behaviour and apoptosis in the limbic system after myocardial infarction (MI).

The main objective of this study is to examine the water quality of river Damodar during and prelockdown phase for domestic use and restoration of river ecosystem. A total of eleven (11) effluent discharge sites were selected in prelockdown and during lockdown phase. A new approach of water quality assessment, i.e., water pollution index (WPI) has been applied in this study. WPI is weightage free, unbiased method to analysis of water quality. The result shows that the physical, chemical and heavy elements were found beyond the standard limit in prelockdown period. The cation and anion were arranged in an order of Na2+ > K+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ and Cl- > So4 - > No3 - > F- in both the sessions. WPI of prelockdown showed that about 100% water samples are of highly polluted. WPI of lockdown period showed that around 90.90% samples improved to 'good quality' and 9.10% of samples are of 'moderately polluted.' Hypothesis testing by 't' test proved that there was a significant difference (&#961; = 0.05%) in values of each parameter between two periods.

However, adequate individual targets are still poorly addressed, since patients have different perfusion thresholds. Bedside assessment of cerebral autoregulation may help to optimize individual CPP-guided treatment. OBJECTIVE To assess staff compliance and outcome impact of a new method of autoregulation-guided treatment (CPPopt) based on continuous evaluation of cerebrovascular reactivity (PRx). METHODS Prospective pilot study of severe TBI adult patients managed with continuous multimodal brain monitoring in a single Neurocritical Care Unit (NCCU). Every minute CPPopt was automatically estimated, based on the previous 4-h window, as the CPP with the lowest PRx indicating the best cerebrovascular pressure reactivity. Patients were managed with CPPopt targets whenever possible and otherwise CPP was managed following general/international guidelines. In addition, other offline CPPopt estimates were calculated using cerebral oximetry (COx-CPPopt), brain tissue oxygenation (ORxs-CPPopt), and cerebral blood flow (CBFx-CPPopt). RESULTS Eighteen patients with a total multimodal brain monitoring time of 5,520 h were enrolled. During the total monitoring period, 11 patients (61 %) had a CPPopt U-shaped curve, 5 patients (28 %) had either ascending or descending curves, and only 2 patients (11 %) had no fitted curve. Real CPP correlated significantly with calculated CPPopt (r = 0.83, p < 0.0001). Preserved autoregulation was associated with greater Glasgow coma score on admission (p = 0.01) and better outcome (p = 0.01). We demonstrated that patients with the larger discrepancy (>10 mm Hg) between real CPP and CPPopt more likely have had adverse outcome (p = 0.04). Comparison between CPPopt and the other estimates revealed similar limits of precision. The lowest bias (-0.1 mmHg) was obtained with COx-CPPopt (NIRS). CONCLUSION Targeted individual CPP management at the bedside using cerebrovascular pressure reactivity seems feasible. Large deviation from CPPopt seems to be associated with adverse outcome. The COx-CPPopt methodology using non-invasive CO (NIRS) warrants further evaluation.","output":"Optimal Cerebral Perfusion Pressure Management at Bedside: A Single-Center Pilot Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the lungs are the primary organ involved, increasing evidence supports the neuroinvasive potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

This research underscores the importance of providing options for accessing health care services and diagnostic testing in a clinically rigorous manner. Providing options for patients will be essential in curtailing the spread of COVID-19, and any concomitant confusion caused by the overlapping symptomology of the flu and other upper respiratory viruses. Methods: A survey was sent to patients to collect information related to their experience with testing, guidance, and consults in a telehealth model for SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, patients were asked where they would have sought testing and care had this model not been available, and their satisfaction level with the service itself. Results: More than 1,400 patients responded to the survey for a response rate of 15%.

Vaccination is the most effective preventative measure that can protect 70-90% of healthy adults aged < 65; however, the protection rate is much lower in those most susceptible to infection, namely infants, the elderly and individuals with weakened immune systems. Although four drugs have been approved by the FDA for use as prophylaxis and/or treatment of influenza, concerns about their side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant viruses persist. RNA interference (RNAi), an emerging method of post transcriptional gene silencing, appears ideal for the prevention and treatment of influenza. RNAi in mammals can be mediated by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of approximately 21-27 nucleotides in length.

This study aimed to characterize sleep behaviors among Chinese residents during the early stage of the outbreak and to test the extent to which sleep quality was driven by COVID-19 uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, and perceived stress. Methods. A cross-sectional correlational survey was conducted online. A total of 2,534 Chinese residents were recruited from February 7 to 14, 2020, the third week of lockdown. Self-report measures assessed uncertainty about COVID-19, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived stress, and sleep quality. Structural equation modeling was applied to test the relationships among uncertainty about COVID-19, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived stress, and sleep quality. Results. Sleep disturbance was common, with approximately half of participants (47.1%) reporting going to bed after 12:00am, 23.0% taking 30 minutes or longer to fall asleep, and 30.3% sleeping a total of 7 hours or less. Higher uncertainty about COVID-19 was significantly positively correlated with higher intolerance of uncertainty (r = 0.506, p < 0.001). Uncertainty about COVID-19 had a weak direct effect on poor sleep ( = 0.043, p < 0.05);however, there was a robust indirect effect on poor sleep through intolerance of uncertainty ( = 0.506, p < 0.001) and perceived stress ( = 0.479, p < 0.001).

OBJECTIVES: to investigate sociodemographic and disease-related factors that can influence self-perceived knowledge (poor/medium vs high) about COVID-19 in women of the Italian NINFEA birth cohort. DESIGN: cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: a web-based anonymous survey on COVID-19 was sent in April 2020 to women participating in the NINFEA cohort. A total of 3,129 women were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: using multiple weighted logistic regression models, self-perceived knowledge level was analysed in relation with the following variables: age, education level, family size, cumulative incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases until 7 April 2020 by province, presence of COVID-19-like symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 testing, and COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: the prevalence of self-perceived poor/medium knowledge was 57%. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, the odds ratio (OR) of self-perceived poor/medium COVID-19 knowledge level was increased for low/medium compared with high education level (OR 1.57; 95%CI 1.34-1.84), and decreased for SARS-CoV-2 testing (OR 0.25; 95%CI 0.16-0.39) and COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 0.20; 95%CI 0.07-0.60). There was no evidence of association between the other analysed variables and self-perceived knowledge level.

An original questionnaire integrates the interpersonal traits and personality factors reported in the literature in sales marketing activities (independent variables). The results were matched with the individual job-related and interest data (control variables) and sales performance (criterion variables) - expressed as the total number of closed contracts over the inbound/outbound related contacts of employees with responsibility in marketing activities for a large banking group. We are able to identify the relevant predictors of sales performance by creating full binary trees using control and independent variables in conditional inference forests and variable importance index measures.

In this study, the changes in clinical practice occurred in an orthopaedic center in Milan are described. METHODS: Number and type of admissions, outpatients cancelled and preserved, emergency room, and intensive care unit activities have been analyzed in the timeframe of seven weeks since the beginning of the pandemic (from February 24th to April 10th) and compared with the same period in 2019. RESULTS: The planned surgical admissions declined from 2172 in 2019 to 664 in 2020 (69.42%, p < 0.0001), while emergencies increased from 158 to 268 (69.62%). The rehabilitation admissions declined from 414 to 69 (83.33%). The overall admission decreased by 63.52%, the trend showed a drop in the last weeks. Surgery performed in the COVID-19 operating room increased by 16.7% in the last week. Seven deaths occurred (0.7% of all orthopaedics and trauma admissions) compared with four (0.1%) which happened in the same period in 2019 (p = 0.004). Six of these patients were suffering from COVID-19. A total of 23,580 outpatients (93.8%) were cancelled.

In aquaculture this frequently manifests in an animal welfare crisis, with fish increasingly farmed under high production, high stress conditions. These intense environments can result in fish stocks having a high susceptibility to infection, with parasites and associated disease one of the main factors limiting industry growth. Prediction of infection dynamics is key to preventative treatment and mitigation. Considering the climatic and technology driven changes facing aquaculture, an understanding of how parasites react across a spectrum of conditions is required. Here we assessed the impact of temperature, infection density and host species on the life history traits of Argulus foliaceus, a common palearctic fish louse, representative of a parasite group problematic in freshwater aquaculture and fisheries worldwide. Temperature significantly affected development, growth and survival; parasites hatched and developed faster at higher temperatures, but also experienced shorter lifespans when maintained off the host. At high temperatures, these parasites will likely experience a short generation time as their life history traits are completed more rapidly. A. foliaceus additionally grew faster on natural hosts and at lower infection densities. Ultimately such results contribute to prediction of population dynamics, aiding development of effective control to improve animal welfare and reduce industry loss.","output":"Life in the fast lane: Temperature, density and host species impact survival and growth of the fish ectoparasite Argulus foliaceus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Inhibition of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by nucleotide analogues with ribose modification provides a promising antiviral strategy for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

Strategies are based on evidence from existing research about virtual qualitative methods and on the strategies used by the authors to convert a planned in-person qualitative, grounded theory study to an entirely virtual grounded theory study during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study began in-person in September 2019 and was converted to virtual in March 2020. Virtual data collection was completed in September 2020. DESIGN This article provides a case exemplar of virtual adaptations made to a study underway when the pandemic rendered all in-person research impractical and potentially dangerous. DATA SOURCES The strategies discussed are based on our own experiences and the supporting theoretical assumptions of qualitative research, specifically grounded theory methods. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING Nursing scholars conducting qualitative inquiry may find these strategies helpful in continuing research activities during periods of limited access to the phenomena or persons of interest. Furthermore, these strategies allow nursing scholars to conduct rigorous, in-depth research without geographical limitations, providing greater possibilities for international collaborations and cross-institution research. CONCLUSION Despite novel challenges, methodological adaptations that are carefully planned and purposeful allow qualitative and non-qualitative scholars to continue research activities in a fully virtual manner.

Elective surgeries were triaged based on the urgency of performing the surgical procedure, the hospital burden of COVID-19 patients, and the availability of healthcare resources. Various measures were adopted such as preoperative screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection, use of personal protective equipment, and the COVID-19-free surgical pathway to prevent perioperative SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

The core of the system, the Acusense IoMT platform, consisted of a novel leakage-detection patch comprised of multiple concentric rings to detect blood leakage and quantify the leaked volume. The performance of the leakage-detection system was evaluated on a prosthetic arm and clinical study. Patients with a high risk of blood leakage were recruited as candidates. The system was set up in a hospital, and the subjects were monitored for 2 months. During the pre-clinical simulation experiment, the system could detect blood leakage volumes from 0.3 to 0.9 mL. During the test of the IoMT system, the overall success rate of tests was 100%, with no lost data packets. A total of 701 dialysis sessions were analyzed, and the accuracy and sensitivity were 99.7% and 90.9%, respectively. Evaluation questionnaires showed that the use of the system after training changed attitudes and reduced worry of the nursing staff.

By combining the filament with fibers from other materials including wood, metal, glass, and carbon, the method can easily be adapted to print complex parts using a variety of materials. However, despite its popularity, online print quality and machine monitoring continue to remain a challenge. Here, we present the preliminary results from our efforts on using cheap off-the-shelf sensors in combination with discrete wavelet transform analysis to identify the differences in the vibroacoustic signals measured near the print area during successful and failed first layer filament deposition on the build plate. A failure in creating a strong first layer bond between the extruded filament and the build plate always results in a print failure and is one of most common print issues occurring in FDM printing. By controlling the extruder and build plate temperatures, we control the filament C build plate bond strength while measuring the generated vibroacoustic signals using a PVDF piezo sensor. The measured signals are analyzed using a discrete wavelet transform to partition the signal energy into different energy levels. For the cases studied, we find that the relevant noticeable differences can be observed in specific energy levels during good and bad bond formation. Reconstructing the signal using these energy contributions provides a time domain representation of signal differences under different conditions. The obtained results demonstrate that a cheap and easy to implement method can be developed using PVDF sensors in combination with a wavelet-based signal analysis approach.","output":"Detecting first layer bond quality during FDM 3D printing using a discrete wavelet energy approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: /Objectives: There is concern that measures aiming to limit a further spread of COVID-19, e.g., school closures and social distancing, cause an aggravation of the childhood obesity epidemic.

Subjects/Methods: To assess the change in weight dynamics during the first months of COVID-19, we compared the trends of BMI change (BMI-SDS) and of the proportions of children gaining or losing weight between 2005 and 2019 and the respective changes from 2019 (pre-pandemic) to 2020 (after the onset of anti-pandemic measures) in more than 150 000 children. Results: : During the COVID-19 pandemic, we found a substantial weight gain across all weight and age groups, reflected by an increase in mean BMI-SDS ( = 0.05, 95% CI 0.036 to 0.055;p < 0.001), an increase in the proportion of children gaining weight (OR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.46;p < 0.001), and a decrease in the proportion of children losing weight (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.77;p < 0.001).

However, due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of the topic, numerical simulations of the airborne spread of expiratory droplets face serious challenges. It is essential to examine the assumptions and simplifications made in the existing modeling and simulations, which will be reviewed carefully here to better advance the fidelity of numerical results when compared to the reality. So far, existing review papers have focused on discussing the simulation results without questioning or comparing the model assumptions. This review paper focuses instead on the details of the model simplifications used in the numerical methods and how to properly incorporate important processes associated with respiratory droplet transmission. Specifically, the critical issues reviewed here include modeling of the respiratory droplet evaporation, droplet size distribution, and time-dependent velocity profile of air exhaled from coughing and sneezing. According to the literature review, another problem in numerical simulations is that the virus decay rate and suspended viable viral dose are often not incorporated; therefore here, empirical relationships for the bioactivity of coronavirus are presented.

RESULT: The following areas of need for adaptation of SHARE were identified: 1) Mode of delivery (smart phones/tablets, Zoom/Skype);2) Dissemination of intervention materials (email, use of the SHARE app for iPad);3) Administration of Care Values and Preferences assessments;4) Building and maintaining rapport and trust with care dyads;and 5) Remote presentation of SHARE intervention tools. CONCLUSION: This presentation will highlight a series of best practices and recommendations for a full-scale adaptation of SHARE for Dementia for remote delivery. Insights from SHARE Counselors will highlight support for the use of a remote version of SHARE in non-pandemic times to reach underserved and rural populations in need of support or for PWDs that live alone and have a long-distance care partner. Case examples will be used to illustrate remote delivery successes and challenges as well as highlight ways SHARE can be delivered using a hybrid model to accommodate the unique needs of families that may benefit. ? 2021 the Alzheimer's Association.","output":"Adaptation of an in-person dyadic care planning intervention for virtual delivery: Challenges and opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was declared in the last weeks as global pandemic. Currently affecting more than 5 000 000 individuals worldwide, COVID-19 is most commonly associated with symptoms caused by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As the number of infected individuals increases, we are learning that not only lungs, but also other organs can be affected by the virus. The gastrointestinal symptoms, for example diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea or abdominal pain, are frequent in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, alimentary tract symptoms may precede the respiratory presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and inappropriate management of infected patients. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can be detected in faeces of infected patients and rectal swabs are even reported to remain positive for a longer period of time than nasopharyngeal swabs. Here, we aim to provide an update on the gastrointestinal involvement of COVID-19 presenting the symptoms that can be encountered in infected patients. We address the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which also was found in the gastrointestinal tract. Finally, we briefly discuss faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential role in the pathogenesis of the disease.","output":"COVID-19: Focus on the lungs but do not forget the gastrointestinal tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Liver parenchymal transection is the most invasive and challenging part in the living donor operation. The study was planned to compare the safety, efficacy, and outcome of harmonic scalpel versus spray diathermy as a method of parenchymal liver transection in donor hepatectomy. PATIENT AND METHOD Eighty consecutive patients, who were treated by living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), were included in the study. The study population was divided into two groups according to the method of liver transection: group A by harmonic scalpel (HS) and group B by spray diathermy (SD). The primary outcome was the volume of blood loss during transection. Secondary outcomes were time of transection, number of ligatures needed during transection, pathological changes at cut surface, postoperative morbidities, cost, and hospital stay RESULTS: Blood loss during overall liver transection and in each zone was significantly less in the SD than in the HS group (P = 0.015). The number of ligatures was significantly less in the SD than in the HS group (P = 0.0001). The SD group had significantly higher level of serum bilirubin, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), and international normalized ratio (INR) levels on postoperative day 3 than the HS group. Lateral tissue coagulation and hepatic necrosis are significantly less in HS group. The overall incidence of postoperative morbidities was the same in both groups. The cost was higher in HS group than SD group (US$760 vs. US$40 P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION Spray diathermy is an effective method of parenchymal transection with significantly lower blood loss and lower cost compared to HS with no increase in morbidity.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic tests are expensive, reliant on centralized labs, can take days to deliver results, and are prone to backlogs and supply shortages. Antigen tests that bind and detect the surface proteins of a virus are rapid and scalable but suffer from high false negative rates. To address this problem, an inexpensive, simple, and robust 60-minute do-it-yourself (DIY) workflow to detect viral RNA from nasal swabs or saliva with high sensitivity (0.1 to 2 viral particles/L) and specificity (>97% true negative rate) utilizing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was developed. ALERT (Accessible LAMP-Enabled Rapid Test) incorporates the following features: (1) increased shelf-life and ambient temperature storage, compared to liquid reaction mixes, by using wax layers to isolate enzymes from other reagents; (2) improved specificity compared to other LAMP end-point reporting methods, by using sequence-specific QUASR (quenching of unincorporated amplification signal reporters); (3) increased sensitivity, compared to methods without purification through use of a magnetic wand to enable pipette-free concentration of sample RNA and cell debris removal; (4) quality control with a nasopharyngeal-specific mRNA target; and (5) co-detection of other respiratory viruses, such as influenza B, by multiplexing QUASR-modified RT-LAMP primer sets. The flexible nature of the ALERT workflow allows easy, at-home and point-of-care testing for individuals and higher-throughput processing for labs and hospitals. With minimal effort, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific primer sets can be swapped out for other targets to repurpose ALERT to detect other viruses, microorganisms, or nucleic acid-based markers.","output":"Accessible LAMP-Enabled Rapid Test (ALERT) for Detecting SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Este artigo volta-se para os processos simblicos que, frente  iminncia do adoecimento e da morte, fazem emergir no imaginrio poderosas narrativas que se dinamizam em mitos.

However, vancomycin exposure in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is challenging to predict due to rapidly changing pathophysiological processes and patient-specific factors. Vancomycin concentrations may be decreased for peripheral infections due to augmented renal clearance (ARC) and increased distribution caused by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), increased capillary permeability, and aggressive fluid resuscitation.

However, the relevance of humoral response against seasonal HCoVs to COVID-19 pathogenesis is elusive.Methods: We profiled the temporal changes of IgG antibodies against spike (S;S-IgG) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal HCoVs in 838 plasma samples collected from 344 COVID-19 patients. We tested the antigenic cross-reactivity of S protein between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal HCoVs and evaluated the correlations between HCoV-OC43 S-IgG antibody and disease severity in COVID-19 patients.Findings: SARS-CoV-2 S-IgG titers mounted until days 22C28, whereas HCoV-OC43 antibody titers increased until days 15C21 and then plateaued until day 46. However, IgG antibody titers against HCoV-NL63, -229E, and -HKU1 showed no significant increasing. A two-way cross-reactivity was identified between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were not detected in healthy controls who were positive for HCoV-OC43 S-IgG. HCoV-OC43 S-IgG titers were significantly higher in patients with severe disease than those in mild/moderate patients at days 1C21 post symptom onset (PSO). Higher levels of HCoV-OC43 S-IgG were also observed in patients requiring mechanical ventilation and the elderly. At days 1C10 PSO, HCoV-OC43 S-IgG titers correlated to disease severity in all age groups, and to fatality in over 60-year group.Interpretation: Our data indicate that there exist a humoral cross-reactive response between HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2. The cross-reactive HCoV-OC43 S-IgG antibody is not protective against SARS-CoV-2, but may be a risk factor for the severity and adverse outcome of COVID-19.Funding Statement: This study was funded in part by the National Major Science & Technology Project for Control and Prevention of Major Infectious Diseases in China (2017ZX10204401, 2018ZX10734404), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences (2016-I2M-1C014, 2018-I2M-1-003, 2020-I2M-1-001, 2020-I2M-CoV19-005), Natural Science Foundation of China (82041011/H0104), and National Key R&D Program of China (2020YFA0707600).

This Article answers the question by looking to modern U.S. bankruptcy laws first forebear, the 1841 Bankruptcy Act, which Congress enacted in response to the depressed economic conditions following the Panic of 1837.

METHODS: Data were from 16066 participants in two population-based cohorts of young adult women, born in 1973C78 (GenX) and 1989C95 (millennials). Weight was reported at baseline (age 18C23 in both cohorts) and 4 years later. High weight gain was defined as >2.5% per year. Data were analysed in 2020. RESULTS: Women born in 1989C95 were almost 4 kg heavier at age 18C23 and gained weight over 4 years 1.7 times faster than those born in 1973C78. Prevalence of high weight gain was 34.2% in the 1989C95 cohort and 24% in the 1973C78 cohort. In both cohorts, older age, higher education and high physical activity were associated with lower odds of high weight gain, and more hours in paid work, poorer self-rated health and higher baseline BMI were associated with higher odds of high weight gain. Five factors (outer regional areas, one child, ex or current smoker, high stress and depression) were determinants of high weight gain in the 1989C95 cohort, but not in the 1973C78 cohort. Based on average weight at age 21 and annual percentage weight gain, we estimate that women born in 1989C95 will, on average, be 16.7 kg heavier at age 41 (93.2 kg), than women in the 1973C78 cohort (76.5 kg). CONCLUSION: High weight gain was evident in every sociodemographic group in both cohorts but most evident in millennial women with high levels of stress and depression.

METHODS Twenty-two participants were allocated 5% ibuprofen gel (A) and 0.025% capsaicin cream (B) in random sequence (AB or BA). Patients underwent up to 3 treatment cycles, each comprising one treatment for 4 weeks, an individualized washout period (maximum 4 weeks), then the other treatment for 4 weeks. Differential (ibuprofen or capsaicin) response was defined when change-from-baseline pain intensity scores (0-10 NRS) differed by 1 between treatments in 2 cycles within a participant. RESULTS A total of 104 treatment periods were aggregated. Mean pain reduction was 1.2 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.8) on ibuprofen and 1.6 (95% CI: 0.9, 2.4) on capsaicin (P = 0.221). Of 22 participants, 4 (18%) had a greater response to ibuprofen, 9 (41%) to capsaicin, 4 (18%) had similar responses, and 5 (23%) were undetermined. CONCLUSION Irrespective of equal efficacy overall, 59% of people displayed a greater response to one treatment over the other. Patients who do not benefit from one type of topical treatment should be offered to try another, which may be more effective. N-of-1 trials are useful to identify individual response to treatment.

Interfering with the interaction of viral antigens with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor is a promising strategy by blocking the infection of the coronaviruses into human cells. We have implemented a novel protein engineering technology to produce a super-potent tetravalent form of ACE2, coupled to the human immunoglobulin ?31 Fc region, using a self-assembling, tetramerization domain from p53 protein. This high molecular weight Quad protein (ACE2-Fc-TD) retains binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding spike protein and can form a complex with the spike protein plus anti-viral antibodies. The ACE2-Fc-TD acts as a powerful decoy protein that out-performs soluble monomeric and dimeric ACE2 proteins and blocks both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and SARS-CoV-2 virus infection with greatly enhanced efficacy. The ACE2 tetrameric protein complex promise to be important for development as decoy therapeutic proteins against COVID-19. In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, ACE2 decoy is unlikely to be affected by mutations in SARS-CoV-2 that are beginning to appear in variant forms. In addition, ACE2 multimeric proteins will be available as therapeutic proteins should new coronaviruses appear in the future because these are likely to interact with ACE2 receptor.","output":"A super-potent tetramerized ACE2 protein displays enhanced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With advances in the field of machine learning, precisely algorithms for recommendation systems, robot assistants are envisioned to become more present in the hospitality industry. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the need to have more service robots in our everyday lives, to minimise the risk of human to-human transmission. One such example would be coffee shops, which have become intrinsic to our everyday lives. However, serving an excellent cup of coffee is not a trivial feat as a coffee blend typically comprises rich aromas, indulgent and unique flavours and a lingering aftertaste. Our work addresses this by proposing a computational model which recommends optimal coffee beans resulting from the user's preferences. Specifically, given a set of coffee bean properties (objective features), we apply different supervised learning techniques to predict coffee qualities (subjective features). We then consider an unsupervised learning method to analyse the relationship between coffee beans in the subjective feature space. Evaluated on a real coffee beans dataset based on digitised reviews, our results illustrate that the proposed computational model gives up to 92.7 percent recommendation accuracy for coffee beans prediction. From this, we propose how this computational model can be deployed on a service robot to reliably predict customers' coffee bean preferences, starting from the user inputting their coffee preferences to the robot recommending the coffee beans that best meet the user's likings.","output":"At Your Service: Coffee Beans Recommendation From a Robot Assistant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to analyse the trend and spatial-temporal clusters of risk of transmission of COVID-19 in northeastern Brazil.

In 2017, 6% of children under 5 years were wasted and 18% were stunted. Through the Tajikistan Health and Nutrition Activity (THNA), funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development's Feed the Future, IntraHealth International trained 1,370 volunteer community health workers (CHWs) and 500 community agricultural workers (CAWs) in 500 rural communities to improve nutrition among children and pregnant and breastfeeding women. CHWs and CAWs mutually encourage health behavior change, reinforce better agricultural practices, and promote maternal and child health and nutritious diets through household visits, community events, and peer support groups. CHWs refer children with malnutrition and diarrhea and pregnant women who are not registered for antenatal care to health facilities. THNA supported CHWs/CAWs through peer learning, refresher trainings, supportive supervision, and quarterly material incentives. We observed gains in knowledge, attitudes, and practices across health; nutrition; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and agriculture in target communities. From 2016 to 2019, we observed statistically significant (P<.05) improvements in children receiving a minimum acceptable diet; children with diarrhea receiving more liquids; women making 4 or more antenatal care visits; women reporting improved WASH; and farmers demonstrating improved agricultural practices. A February 2020 screening of 94.6% of children under 5 years in target communities found the prevalence of children with signs of wasting at 2.2%. Partnerships between CHWs, CAWs, and rural health workers facilitated these results. Paired agricultural and health interventions proved successful in improving nutrition of children and may be applicable in other contexts. Although effective in delivering interventions, CHWs/CAWs experience attrition, need motivation, and require intensive support.

Results: Twenty-two pulmonary embolism were diagnosed during the control period and 99 in the pandemic, 74 of which were associated with COVID-19. Of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 5.3% had a pulmonary embolism, with a delay between the two diagnoses of 9.1+/-8.4 days. During the pandemic, patients with pulmonary embolism had fewer predisposing conditions (previous pulmonary embolism 5.1% vs. 18.2%, p = .05; previous surgery 2% vs. 35.4%, p = .0001; deep vein thrombosis 11.1% vs. 45.5%, p=.0001); peripheral pulmonary embolisms were the most frequent (73.5% vs. 50%, p =. 029).

Design/methodology/approach: This study employs 46 semi-structured interviews with senior managers of the three buying firms, four distribution centers and four supplying firms based in four countries (Pakistan, Sri Lanka, China and India). Findings: Results unveil that manufacturing firms are facing limited production and delays in procuring goods and services, while distribution centres are facing inventory shortages. Furthermore, supplying firms are facing increased lead times amid the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, each affected entity has employed specific strategies to address these disruptions. For instance, manufacturing firms are refining their production schedules based on the inventory, getting better visibility to their suppliers performance and developing new inbound routes to meet the production challenges. They are also assessing the tier-1 suppliers risk and activating the relationship with secondary suppliers to address the procurement issues. Second, distributors are modifying inventory policies to meet the inventory shortage. Finally, supplying firms are developing alternative outbound logistics to meet the growing demand. Research limitations/implications: There are some limitations to this study. First, the results of this study cannot be generalized to a wider population. Second, this study explores the interpretations of senior managers based in four Asian countries only. Originality/value: Our study contributes to the supply chain literature by exploring the disruptions caused by COVID-19 to the supply chain operations. It also contributes to theory and practice by articulating the strategies adopted by firms to address such disruptions. Firms can use the steps highlighted in this study to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain disruptions. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Understanding the implications of pandemic outbreaks on supply chains: an exploratory study of the effects caused by the COVID-19 across four South Asian countries and steps taken by firms to address the disruptions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) protein is critical for receptor binding, membrane fusion and internalization of the virus into the human cells. We have tried to search the epitopic component of the S-protein that might be served as crucial targets for the vaccine development and also tried to understand the molecular mechanism of epitopes and TLR4/MD-2 complex for adaptive immunity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Here we identified the antigenicity and the epitopic divergence of S-protein via immunoinformatics approach. The study was performed to identify the epitopes, composition of amino acids and its distribution in epitopic regions, composition of amino acid between the identified epitopes, secondary structure architecture of epitopes, physicochemical and biochemical parameters and molecular interaction between the identified epitope and TLR4/MD-2 complex. The SARS-CoV-2 can be possibly recognised by TLR4 of host immune cells that are responsible for the adaptive immune response. RESULTS: We identified four SARS-CoV-2 S-protein 9mer antigenic epitopes and observed that they bind with the TLR4/MD-2 complex by varied stable molecular bonding interactions. Molecular interaction between these characterized epitopes with TLR4/MD-2 complex might be indicated the binding affinity and downstream signalling of adaptive immune response. Different physicochemical and biochemical parameters such as O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation, Hydrophobicity, GRAVY were identified within epitopic regions of S-protein. These parameters help to understand the protein-protein interaction between epitopes and TLR4/MD-2 complex. The study also revealed different epitopic binding pockets of TLR4/MD-2 complex.

ACE2 is a multifunctional monocarboxypeptidase responsible for generating Ang-(1-7) from Ang II. ACE2 is important in the vascular system where it is found in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in many vascular beds. Among the best characterized functions of ACE2 is its role in regulating vascular tone. ACE2 through its effector peptide Ang-(1-7) and receptor Mas1 induces vasodilation and attenuates Ang II-induced vasoconstriction. In endothelial cells activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas1 axis increases production of the vasodilator's nitric oxide and prostacyclin's and in vascular smooth muscle cells it inhibits pro-contractile and pro-inflammatory signaling. Endothelial ACE2 is cleaved by proteases, shed into the circulation and measured as soluble ACE2. Plasma ACE2 activity is increased in cardiovascular disease and may have prognostic significance in disease severity. In addition to its enzymatic function, ACE2 is the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) and SARS-Cov-2, which cause SARS and coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) respectively. ACE-2 is thus a double-edged sword: it promotes cardiovascular health while also facilitating the devastations caused by coronaviruses. COVID-19 is associated with cardiovascular disease as a risk factor and as a complication. Mechanisms linking COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease are unclear, but vascular ACE2 may be important. This review focuses on the vascular biology and (patho)physiology of ACE2 in cardiovascular health and disease and briefly discusses the role of vascular ACE2 as a potential mediator of vascular injury in COVID-19.","output":"ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas1 axis and the vascular system: vasoprotection to COVID-19-associated vascular disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nurses and other front-line staff in Englands NHS must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by April next year.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine to be mandatory for NHS staff in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The public health response to the current Coronavirus pandemic in long-term care communities, including assisted living, encompasses prohibiting visitors.

Our context is an effort to inform policy regarding social behavior, to mitigate strain on hospital capacity. The model unknowns are taken to be: the time-varying transmission rate, the fraction of exposed cases that require hospitalization, and the time-varying detection probabilities of new asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. In simulations, we obtain accurate estimates of undetected (that is, unmeasured) infectious populations, by measuring the detected cases together with the recovered and dead - and without assumed knowledge of the detection rates. These state estimates require a measurement of the recovered population, and are tolerant to low errors in that measurement. Further, excellent estimates of all quantities are obtained using a temporal baseline of 112 days, with the exception of the time-varying transmission rate at times prior to the implementation of social distancing. The estimation of this transmission rate is sensitive to contamination in the data, highlighting the need for accurate and uniform methods of reporting. Finally, we employ the procedure using real data from Italy reported by Johns Hopkins. The aim of this paper is not to assign extreme significance to the results of these specific experiments \\\\textit{per se}.

Different from traditional colorant research, the properties of functional materials are governed extensively by intermolecular interactions, thereby entailing significant limitations to the classical approach based on molecular structure-molecular property (color, emission, redox properties, etc.) relationships for the respective dye molecules. However, as discussed in this Perspective, such an approach can be pursued for dye aggregates, and in many cases already well-tailored dimers are sufficient to understand the influence of supramolecular organization on the functional properties of ground and photoexcited states. Illustrative examples will be given for exciton coupling and charge-transfer coupling and how these properties relate to desirable functions such as fluorescence, symmetry-breaking charge separation, and singlet fission in molecular aggregates. While the progress in this research so far mostly originated from studies on well-defined folded and self-assembled structures composed of only two dye molecules, future work will have to advance toward larger oligomers of specific size and geometry. Furthermore, future experimental studies should be guided to a larger extent by theoretical predictions that may be supported by machine learning algorithms and new concepts from artificial intelligence.

These problems can lead to psychological problems. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis to ascertain the present impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance among nurses. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The following databases were searched: PubMed, CHINAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MedRxiv and Google Scholar, from January 2020 up to 26th October 2020. Prevalence rates were pooled with meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using I-squared (I(2)) statistics. RESULTS: A total of 93 studies (n = 93,112), published between January 2020 and September 2020, met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of stress was assessed in 40 studies which accounted for 43% (95% CI 37C49). The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 37% (95% CI 32C41) in 73 studies. Depression was assessed in 62 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 35% (95% CI 31C39). Finally, 18 studies assessed sleep disturbance and the pooled prevalence was 43% (95% CI 36C50). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis found that approximately one third of nurses working during the COVID-19 epidemic were suffering from psychological symptoms. This highlights the importance of providing comprehensive support strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among nurses under pandemic conditions.

A technique of obtaining portable chest radiographs (pCXR) through glass doors or windows to minimize technologist-patient contact and conserve PPE has gained popularity, but remains incompletely evaluated in the literature. Our goal was to quickly implement this technique and evaluate image quality and radiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An infographic and video were developed to educate nurses and technologists on the through-glass pCXR technique. Imaging parameters were optimized using a phantom and scatter radiation measured. 3 reviewers independently evaluated 100 conventionally obtained and 100 through-glass pCXRs from 3/13/2020 to 4/30/2020 on patients with suspected COVID-19, using criteria for positioning and sharpness/contrast on a 1 (confident criteria not met) to 5 (confident criteria met) scale. Imaging parameters, including deviation index (DI) were recorded for all radiographs. RESULTS: The through-glass method was rapidly adopted and conserved one isolation gown per interaction. Although there was a statistically significant difference in the positioning (p value 0.018) and sharpness/contrast (p value 0.016), the difference in mean ratings was small: 4.82 vs. 4.65 for positioning and 4.67 vs. 4.50 (conventional vs. modified) for sharpness/contrast. Scatter radiation was measured using a thorax phantom and found to be acceptable for the patient and nearby personnel. Standard deviation was higher for the DI for the through-glass technique (2.8) compared to the conventional technique (1.8), although the means were similar. CONCLUSION: The through-glass technique was quickly implemented, producing diagnostic quality chest radiographs while conserving PPE and reducing risks to radiology staff. There was more variability with imaging technique an DI using the through-glass technique, likely due to technologist uncertainty regarding technical modifications. Further work to reduce this variation is necessary to optimize quality and dose.","output":"Implementing a novel through-glass chest radiography technique for COVID-19 patients: image quality, radiation dose optimization, and practical considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the field of medical education has sought to amplify the voices of those from traditionally marginalised groups and medical education journals have sought to become more accessible and diverse. This study sought to examine the gender and geographical representation of editors and editorial board members in medical education journals. METHODS: Information about individual editors and editorial board members of 10 medical education journals was retrieved from their websites in January 2021, including their gender and the country in which they were based. Countries were categorised according to World Bank Income Classification and World Bank Geographical Regions. We then calculated the Composite Editorial Board Diversity Score for each journal. FINDINGS: Of 488 editors and editorial board members, 283 (58.0%) were male, 452 (92.6%) were based in high-income countries and 322 (66.0%) were from the four countries with greatest representation (the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada). DISCUSSION: The composition of medical education journals' editorial leadership teams remains dominated by males and those from higher income and Western countries. Strikingly, little change has taken place since this was last examined 17 years ago despite the field becoming apparently more globalised. As medical education strives to become a more inclusive and diverse discipline, developing policies to create more globally representative editorial leadership teams should now be an urgent priority.","output":"Editorial diversity in medical education journals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 44-year-old previously healthy woman developed acute myelitis in close temporal relationship with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine first-dose administration.

Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCCoronavirus2 (SARS-COV2) and is an emergent pandemic for which no cure exist at the moment. Several drugs have been tried often with scant clinical evidence and safety. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report the case of 78-years-old woman with cardiometabolic syndrome and COVID-19. A multidrug regimen including others hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics, dexamethasone and paracetamol, low-molecular-weight-heparin and potassium canrenoate was started. After almost 3 weeks, the patient started to display a violaceous rash initially involving the flexural folds atypical targetoid lesions and showing a very fast extension, blister formation and skin detachments of approximately 70% of the total body surface area and mucous membranes involvement consistent with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The ALDEN algorithm was calculated inserting all drugs given to the patient in the 28 days preceding the onset of the skin manifestations. The highest score retrieved was for hydroxychloroquine. Other less suspicious drugs were piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of TEN in a patient suffering from COVID-19 probably associated with hydroxychloroquine. Given the activation of the immune system syndrome induced by the virus and the widespread off-label use of this drug, we suggest a careful monitoring of skin and mucous membranes in all COVID-19 positive patients treated with hydroxychloroquine in order to early detect early signs of toxicities.","output":"A case report of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) in a patient with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine: are these two partners in crime?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fusobacterium necrophorum (F. necrophorum) is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium and a known etiologic agent in Lemierres syndrome.

With regard to the diagnostic criteria, it overlaps a great deal with substance use disorder, i.e., loss of control, craving/withdrawal, and neglect of other areas of life. However, the gambling disorder symptom chasing ones losses is the only criterion absent from substance use disorder. Therefore, special forms of reward (i.e., gain/loss) processing, such as the processing of loss avoidance and loss aversion, have just recently attracted attention among gambling disorder researchers. Because gambling disorder might be considered an addiction in its pure form, i.e., without the influence of a drug of abuse, investigating brain volume changes in people with this behavioral addiction is an important task for neuroimaging researchers in exploring the neural signatures of addiction. Because the brain is a complex network, investigation of alterations in functional connectivity has gained interest among gambling disorder researchers in order to get a more complete picture of functional brain changes in people with gambling disorder. However, only a few studies on brain structure and functional connectivity in gambling disorder have been performed so far.

Excessive fibrosis is the primary cause of organ failure. However, there are currently no approved drugs available for the prevention or treatment of fibrosis-related diseases. It has become evident that fibrosis is characterized by inflammation. In a large number of studies of various organs in mice and humans, pyroptosis has been found to play a significant role in fibrosis. Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death mediated by the N-terminal fragment of cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase (caspase)-1-cleaved gasdermin D (GSDMD, producing GSDMD-N) that gives rise to inflammation via the release of some proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-18 and HMGB1. These cytokines can initiate the activation of fibroblasts. Inflammasomes, an important factor upstream of GSDMD, can activate caspase-1 to trigger the maturation of IL-1 and IL-18. Moreover, the inhibition of inflammasomes, proinflammatory cytokines and GSDMD can prevent the progression of fibrosis.

Unlike elective surgery, ACS workloads cannot be artificially reduced providing a unique challenge for administrators to balance healthcare resources between the COVID-19 surge and regular patient admissions. Methods: An enhanced ACS (eACS) model of care is described with the aim of limiting COVID-19 healthcare worker and patient cross-infection as well as providing 24/7 management of emergency general surgical (GS) and trauma patients. The eACS service comprised 5 independent teams covering a rolling 1:5 24-hr call. Attempts to completely separate eACS teams and patients from the elective side were made. The service was compared to the existing ACS service in terms of clinical and efficiency outcomes. Finally, a survey of staff attitudes towards these changes, concerns regarding COVID-19 and psychological well-being was assessed. Results: There were no staff/patient COVID-19 cross-infections. Compared to the ACS service, eACS patients had reduced overall length of stay (2-days), time spent in the Emergency Room (46 minutes) and time from surgery to discharge (2.4-hours). The eACS model of care saved financial resources and bed-days for the organisation. The changes were well received by team-members who also felt that their safety was prioritised.

After referral for assessment, families often wait 6-12 months before their appointment. This can be a time of uncertainty and stress for families. For some families, other forms of assistance are not accessible and thus timely intervention opportunities are missed. There is little evidence about how to provide the best support for children or caregivers while on assessment waiting lists. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine whether use of a coaching intervention called Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC) combined with service navigation support is feasible for families waiting for ASD assessment, as a crucial first step in planning a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: A pilot and feasibility study will be conducted using recommended constructs and associated measures, which will be reported using CONSORT (Consolidated Standards or Reporting Trials) guidance. Participants will be child and caregiver dyads or triads, recruited within 4 months of their child (aged 1-7 years) being referred to one of two services for an ASD assessment in Victoria, Australia. A blinded randomization procedure will be used to allocate participants to one of three trial arms: (1) coaching and support intervention delivered face to face, (2) coaching and support intervention via videoconference, and (3) usual care. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the sample characteristics of parents and children, inclusive of service access at baseline and follow up. Recruitment rates will be reported, and retention rates will be evaluated against a predicted rate of 70%-80% in each intervention arm. Goal attainment, using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, will indicate preliminary evidence for efficacy within the intervention arms, with an increase of 2 or more points on a 10-point performance and satisfaction scale considered clinically significant.

A long position of a risky asset and a short position of a\\"replicate portfolio\\"of its peers represent that asset's factor residual risk. We coin the expected return of an asset's factor residual risk as its Statistical Arbitrage Risk Premium (SARP). The challenge in empirically estimating SARP is finding the peers for each asset and constructing the replicate portfolios. We use the elastic-net, a machine learning method, to project each stock's past returns onto that of every other stock. The resulting high-dimensional but sparse projection vector serves as investment weights in constructing the stocks' replicate portfolios.

Assessments included the Trail Making Tests, verbal Digit Span tests, Global Assessment of Functioning, Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and the Young Mania Rating Scale, among others. METHOD: Using the data of control individuals (n = 326) from the PsyCourse study who had up to four assessments over 18 months, we modelled the course using linear mixed models or logistic regression. The slopes or odds ratios were estimated and adjusted for age and gender. We also assessed the robustness of these results using a longitudinal non-parametric test in a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Small effects were detected for most cognitive tests, indicating a performance improvement over time (P < 0.05). However, for most of the symptom rating scales and questionnaires, no effects were detected, in line with our initial hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: The slightly but consistently improved performance in the cognitive tests speaks of a test-unspecific positive trend, while psychiatric ratings and questionnaire results remain stable over the observed period.

Therefore, this systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with meta-analysis aimed at characterizing the efficacy of a comprehensive physiotherapy intervention in critically ill patients. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched up to October 22, 2021 to identify RCTs assessing acute patients mechanical ventilated in ICU setting undergoing a rehabilitative intervention. The primary outcomes were MV duration, extubation, and weaning time. The secondary outcomes were weaning successful rate, respiratory function, ICU discharge rate and length of stay. Out of 2503 records, 12 studies were included in the present work. The meta-analysis performed in 6 RCTs showed a significant improvement in terms of MV duration (overall effect size: ?3.23 days; 95% CI = ?5.79, ?0.67, p = 0.01; Z = 2.47) in patients treated with a comprehensive physiotherapy intervention including early mobilization, positioning, airway clearance techniques, lung expansion and respiratory muscle training.

It remains unknown whether this efficacy is mediated predominately by lowering SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility (VESUSC) or development of symptoms after infection (VESYMP). A vaccine with high VESYMP but low VESUSC has uncertain population impact. Methods: We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, calibrated to demographic, physical distancing and epidemic data from King County, Washington. Different rollout scenarios starting December 2020 were simulated assuming different combinations of VESUSC and VESYMP resulting in up to 100% VEDIS with constant vaccine effects over 1 year. We assumed no further increase in physical distancing despite expanding case numbers and no reduction of infectivity upon infection conditional on presence of symptoms. Proportions of cumulative infections, hospitalizations and deaths prevented over 1 year from vaccination start are reported. Results: Rollouts of 1M vaccinations (5,000 daily) using vaccines with 50% VEDIS are projected to prevent 30%-58% of infections and 38%-58% of deaths over one year. In comparison, vaccines with 90% VEDIS are projected to prevent 47%-78% of the infections and 58%-77% of deaths over one year. In both cases, there is a greater reduction if VEDIS is mediated mostly by VESUSC. The use of a ''symptom reducing'' vaccine will require twice as many people vaccinated than a ''susceptibility reducing'' vaccine with the same 90% VEDIS to prevent 50% of the infections and death over one year. Delaying the start of the vaccination by 3 months decreases the expected population impact by approximately 40%. Conclusions: Vaccines which prevent COVID-19 disease but not SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thereby shift symptomatic infections to asymptomatic infections, will prevent fewer infections and require larger and faster vaccination rollouts to have population impact, compared to vaccines that reduce susceptibility to infection. If uncontrolled transmission across the U.S. continues, then expected vaccination in Spring 2021 will provide only limited benefit.","output":"COVID-19 vaccines that reduce symptoms but do not block infection need higher coverage and faster rollout to achieve population impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyses the influence of the Covid-19 coverage by the social media upon the shape of the sovereign yield curves of the five major developing countries, namely Federative Republic of B razil, Russian Federation, Republic of India, Peoples Republic of China, and the Republic of South Africa (BRICS).

This systematic review has two aims: to define the relationship between kinesiophobia and functional outcomes, pain and range of motion following TKR, and to evaluate published treatments for kinesiophobia following TKR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A primary search of electronic databases, grey literature, and trial registries was performed in March 2020. English-language studies recruiting adult primary TKR patients, using the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) were included. Outcome measures were grouped into short (< 6 months), medium (6-12 months), and long term (> 12 months). Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for cohort or case control studies, and the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool for randomised controlled trials. RESULTS: All thirteen included papers (82 identified) showed adequately low risk of methodological bias. TSK1 (activity avoidance) correlated with WOMAC functional score at 12 months in three studies (r = 0.20 p < 0.05, R = 0.317 p = 0.001, and correlation coefficient 0.197 p = 0.005). TSK score significantly correlated with mean active range of motion (ROM) at 2 weeks [65.98 (SD = 14.51) versus 47.35 (SD = 14.48) p = 0.000], 4 weeks [88.20 (SD = 15.11) versus 57.65 (SD = 14.80) p = 0.000], and 6 months [105.33 (SD = 12.34) versus 85.53 (SD = 14.77) p = 0.000] post-operation. Three post-operative interventions improved TSK score vs control following TKR: a home-based functional exercise programme [TSK - 14.30 (SD = 0.80) versus - 2.10 (SD = 0.80) p < 0.001], an outpatient cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme [TSK 27.76 (SD = 4.56) versus 36.54 (SD = 3.58)], and video-based psychological treatment [TSK 24 (SD = 5) versus 29 (SD = 5) p < 0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: Kinesiophobia negatively affects functional outcomes up until 1 year post-operatively, while active ROM is reduced up to 6 months post-procedure.

Seven segments - cervical, petrous, cavernous, paraophthlamic, posterior communicating, choroidal, and terminus - are named. This nomenclature recognizes intrinsic uncertainty in precise angiographic and cross-sectional localization of aneurysms adjacent to the dural rings, regarding all lesions distal to the cavernous segment as potentially intradural. Rather than subdividing various transitional, ophthalmic, and hypophyseal aneurysm subtypes, as necessitated by their varied surgical approaches and risks, the proposed classification emphasizes their common endovascular treatment features, while recognizing that many complex, trans-segmental, and fusiform aneurysms not readily classifiable into presently available, saccular aneurysm-driven schemes, are being increasingly addressed by endovascular means.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the predictors of severe COVID-19 disease requiring admission to an ICU by comparing patients who were ICU admitted to non-ICU groups. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted for the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to six Saudi Ministry of Healths hospitals in Alahsa, between March 1, 2020, and July 30, 2020, by reviewing patients medical records retrospectively. RESULTS: This cohort included 1014 patients with an overall mean age of 47.2  19.3 years and 582 (57%) were males. A total of 205 (20%) of the hospitalized patients were admitted to the ICU. Hypertension, diabetes and obesity were the most common comorbidities in all study patients (27.2, 19.9, and 9%, respectively). The most prevalent symptoms were cough (47.7%), shortness of breath (35.7%) and fever (34.3%). Compared with non-ICU group, ICU patients had older age (p  0.0005) and comprised a higher proportion of the current smokers and had higher respiratory rates (p  0.0005), and more percentage of body temperatures in the range of 37.3C38.0 C (p  0.0005); and had more comorbidities including diabetes (p  0.0005), hypertension (p  0.0005), obesity (p = 0.048), and sickle cell disease (p = 0.039). There were significant differences between the non-ICU and ICU groups for fever, shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, vomiting, dizziness; elevated white blood cells, neutrophils, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin, and decreased hemoglobin; and proportion of abnormal bilateral chest CT images (p < 0.05). Significant differences were also found for multiple treatments (p < 0.05). ICU patients group had a much higher mortality rate than those with non-ICU admission (p  0.0005).

RESULTS: Overall, 23% of female contraceptive users reported they would use a different method, and 39% of nonusers reported they would start using a method, if cost were not an issue. Controlling for user characteristics, low-income contraceptive users who received recent publicly supported contraceptive care reported significantly higher levels of unfulfilled contraceptive preferences due to cost than those without any access to SRH care (aOR = 1.6, CI 1.0C2.5), while having private (aOR = 0.6, CI 0.4C0.9) or public (aOR = 0.7, CI 0.5C1.0) health insurance was associated with significantly lower levels of this outcome.

Here I discuss it in the context of engineering systems and biology, where strong emergence takes place due to a combination of upwards emergence and downwards causation [Ellis 2020]. Firstly, I show that causal closure is strictly limited in terms of spatial interactions because these are cases that are of necessity strongly interacting with the environment. Effective Spatial Closure holds ceteris parabus, and can be violated by Black Swan Events. Secondly, I show that causal closure in the hierarchy of emergence is a strictly interlevel affair, and in the cases of engineering and biology encompasses all levels from the social level to the particle physics level. However Effective Causal Closure can usefully be defined for a restricted set of levels, and one can experimentally determine Effective Theories that hold at each level. This does not however imply those effective theories are causally complete by themselves. In particular, the particle physics level is not causally complete by itself in the contexts of solid state physics (because of interlevel wave-particle duality), digital computers (where algorithms determine outcomes), or biology (because of time dependent constraints).

OBJECTIVES The goals of this study were to identify which equation to estimate GFR is superior for predicting adverse outcomes after PCI and to examine how equation selection would impact drug-dosing recommendations. METHODS Estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD), and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations for 128,805 patients undergoing PCI in the state of Michigan. Agreement between patient pre-PCI eGFR estimates and resultant CKD stage classifications, their ability to discriminate post-procedural in-hospital clinical outcomes, and the impact of equation choice on dosing recommendations for commonly used antiplatelet and antithrombotic medications were investigated. RESULTS CKD-EPI best discriminated post-PCI mortality by receiver operator characteristic analysis. There was wide variability in eGFR, which persisted after grouping by CKD stages. Reclassification by CKD-EPI resulted in net reclassification index improvement for acute kidney injury and new requirement for dialysis. Equation choice affected drug-dosing recommendations, with the formulas agreeing for only 50.3%, 40.0%, and 34.3% of potentially impacted patients for eGFR cutoffs of <60, <50, and <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2), respectively.

The affinity of afucosylated IgG to FcRIIIa is elevated up to 40-fold compared to fucosylated IgG, resulting in enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

Absence of -casein protein significantly curtails secretion of other milk proteins and calcium-phosphate, suggesting a role for -casein in the establishment of casein micelles. In contrast, secretion of albumin, which is not synthesized in the mammary epithelium, into milk is not reduced. The absence of -casein also significantly inhibits transcription of the other casein genes. -Casein deficiency severely delays pup growth during lactation and results in a life-long body size reduction compared to control animals, but has only transient effects on physical and behavioural development of the pups.

MM-PBSA calculations showed that moromycin A has a better binding energy (? 30.42 kcal mol(?1)) compared with other ligands (in a range of ? 18.66 to ? 22.89 kcal mol(?1)) including saquayamycin K4 (? 21.27 kcal mol(?1)) except the co-crystallized ligand N3. However, in vitro and in vivo studies are essential to assess the effectiveness of angucycline compounds against coronavirus.

Considering the ART-related economic and psycho-social costs, the improvement of these percentages is extremely relevant. However, in the identification of predictive markers of ART success, male parameters are largely underestimated so far. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective, observational study. OBJECTIVES To evaluate whether conventional semen parameters could predict the ART success MATERIALS AND METHODS: All couples attending a single third-level Fertility Centre from 1992 to 2020 were retrospectively enrolled, collecting all semen and ART parameters of fresh cycles. Fertilization rate (FR) was the primary end-point, representing a parameter immediately dependent from male contribution. Pregnancy and live birth rates were considered in relation to semen variables. Statistical analyses were performed using the parameters obtained according to WHO manual edition used for semen analysis. RESULTS 22013 in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles were considered. Overall, FR was significantly lower in patients with abnormal semen parameters compared to normozoospermic men, irrespective to the WHO manual edition. In the IVF setting, both progressive motility (p = 0.012) and motility after capacitation (p = 0.002) significantly predicted fertilization rate (statistical accuracy = 71.1%). Sperm motilities predicted also pregnancy (p<0.001) and live birth (p = 0.001) rates. In ICSI cycles, sperm morphology predicted FR (p = 0.001, statistical accuracy = 90.3%). Sperm morphology significantly predicted both pregnancy (p<0.001) and live birth (p<0.001) rates, and a cut off of 5.5% was identified as a threshold to predict clinical pregnancy (AUC = 0.811, p<0.001). DISCUSSION Interestingly, sperm motility plays a role in predicting IVF success, while sperm morphology is the relevant parameter in ICSI cycles. These parameters may be considered reliable tools to measure the male role on ART outcomes, potentially impacting the clinical management of infertile couples. This article is protected by copyright.

OBJECTIVE Thus, the aim of this study is to verify the reliability of an evaluation method for digital models that could be used in the BBO exam, compared to the gold standard. METHODS Measurements were performed by five previously calibrated examiners. Samples of ten sets of plaster models of the final phase of orthodontic treatment were measured using a manual method (Objective Grading System, OGS). These models were digitized using a 3D scanner and exported to Geomagic Qualify software, in which the measurements were made with the proposed digital method. These measurements were repeated using five models, after fifteen days. The intra-examiner performance with this method was analyzed with a paired t-test, whereas the inter-examiner analysis was carried out with analysis of variance and Tukey's test. To compare the manual and digital methods, a paired t-test and Pearson's correlation analysis were performed. RESULTS A statistically significant difference was found. The results showed that, when compared to the manual method, the digital method was effective in measuring the OGS in four of the seven variables studied: Marginal Ridge, Overjet, Occlusal Contact, and Interproximal Contact. The variables Alignment, BL inclination, and Occlusal Relationship showed a great amount of dispersion in the findings.

In the early 2010s, the introduction of a novel set of sequencing methodologies, presented by two platforms, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONT), gave birth to third-generation sequencing (TGS). The innovative long-read technologies turn genome sequencing into an ease-of-handle procedure by greatly reducing the average time of library construction workflows and simplifying the process of de novo genome assembly due to the generation of long reads. Long sequencing reads produced by both TGS methodologies have already facilitated the decipherment of transcriptional profiling since they enable the identification of full-length transcripts without the need for assembly or the use of sophisticated bioinformatics tools. Long-read technologies have also provided new insights into the field of epitranscriptomics, by allowing the direct detection of RNA modifications on native RNA molecules. This review highlights the advantageous features of the newly introduced TGS technologies, discusses their limitations and provides an in-depth comparison regarding their scientific background and available protocols as well as their potential utility in research and clinical applications.","output":"Third-Generation Sequencing: The Spearhead towards the Radical Transformation of Modern Genomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The treatment of incompetent truncal veins has been innovated by the introduction of minimally invasive non-thermal non-tumescent (NTNT) techniques.

The programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)/PD-1 axis is one among the most extensively studied immune-inhibitory checkpoint molecules, which delivers a negative signal for T cell activation by binding to the PD-1 receptor. The general attributes of PD-L1s immune-suppressive qualities and novel mechanisms on the barrier functions of vascular endothelium to regulate blood vessel-related inflammatory diseases are concisely reviewed. Though targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis has received immense recognitionthe Nobel Prize in clinical oncology was awarded in the year 2018 for this discoverythe use of therapeutic modulating strategies for the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway in chronic inflammatory blood vessel diseases is still limited to experimental models. However, studies using clinical specimens that support the role of PD-1 and PD-L1 in patients with underlying atherosclerosis are also detailed. Of note, delicate balances in the expression levels of PD-L1 that are needed to preserve T cell immunity and to curtail acute as well as chronic infections in underlying blood vessel diseases are discussed. A significant link exists between altered lipid and glucose metabolism in different cells and the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 molecules, and its possible implications on vascular inflammation are justified.

Patients with hypercytokinemia might benefit from removal of inflammatory mediators via hemadsorption. Methods: : Single-center prospective randomized trial at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Germany). Patients with confirmed COVID-19, refractory shock (norepinephrine 0.2 g/kg/min to maintain a mean arterial pressure  65 mmHg), IL-6500 ng/l and an indication for renal replacement therapy (RRT) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were included. Patients received either hemadsorption therapy (HT) or standard medical therapy (SMT). For HT, a CytoSorb? adsorber was used for up to 5 days and was replaced every 18C24 hours. The primary endpoint was sustained hemodynamic improvement (norepinephrine 0.05 g/kg/min24h). Secondary endpoints included 28-day mortality, SOFA, and reduction of IL-6, PCT, and MR-proADM. Results: : Of 242 screened patients, 24 were randomized and assigned to either HT (N=12) or SMT (N=12). Both groups had similar severity as assessed by SAPS II (median 75 points HT group vs. 79 SMT group, p=0.590) and SOFA (17 vs. 16, p=0.551). At randomization, 22 (92%) patients were on RRT and 11 (46%) had vv-ECMO. Median IL-6 levels were 2269 (IQR 948C3679) and 3747 (1301C5415) ng/l in the HT and SMT group at baseline, respectively (p=0.378). Serum IL-6 reduction in the first 24h of treatment compared between both groups was 83% vs. 46% (p=0.235). Shock resolution (primary endpoint) was reached in 33% (4/12) vs. 17% (2/12) in the HT and SMT group, respectively (p=0.640). 28-day mortality was 58% (7/12) in the HT compared to 67% (8/12) in the SMT group (p=1.0). Conclusion: HT was associated with a non-significant trend towards clinical improvement within the intervention period including reduction of IL-6 levels and shock resolution. In selected patients, HT might therefore be an option for stabilization and bridge to transfer and decision.

This study aims to assess the association between different tobacco use patterns and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, testing, self-reported infection and social distancing behaviors in the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: Data come from the first wave of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) COVID-19 survey, comprising four birth cohorts (N = 13,077, aged 20-63 years) surveyed between 2 to 31 May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19-related outcomes (symptoms, testing, diagnosis and social distancing behaviors) were compared across different product user groups (non-users, exclusive cigarette users, exclusive e-cigarettes users and dual use) using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel &#967;2 test. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore associations between COVID-19-related outcomes and different smoking patterns. RESULTS: Across all four cohorts, 12.6% and 4.9% of the respondents were current exclusive cigarette and e-cigarette users, respectively, with approximately 3% of the respondents being dual users. Significant differences in prevalence were observed between different tobacco use patterns and COVID-19 symptoms (p = 0.02), self-reported infection (p = 0.04) and social distancing behaviors (p < 0.001). Current cigarette and e-cigarette dual use was associated with 2.15-fold higher odds for reporting COVID-19 infection (aOR = 2.15; CI [1.15-4.05]). Compliance of social distancing behaviors were the lowest for current dual users (aOR = 0.58; CI [0.41-0.83]) and exclusive cigarette users (aOR = 0.72; CI [0.63-0.92]). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight dual users' higher prevalence of having COVID-19 symptoms, infection and incompliance of social distancing behaviors. Self-reported infection was associated with dual product use; dual users and exclusive cigarette users were linked to poor adherence to social distancing behaviors. Smoking cessation support and further monitoring on multiple tobacco use among these populations should be reinforced as preventive measures to tackle the pandemic.","output":"Cigarette and E-Cigarettes Dual Users, Exclusive Users and COVID-19: Findings from Four UK Birth Cohort Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada was forced to critically increase its capacity in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Two pharmacists joined the critical patient care to help the pharmacist who was already integrated in the ICU team. The development of the operational structure was carried out on three levels. The healthcare activity highlights the daily participation of pharmacists in the two clinical sessions in which the ICU teams evaluated all cases and made decisions. This in turn facilitated the pharmaceutical validation that was carried out in the critical units themselves. In addition, one of the pharmacists created the Immuno-COVID Committee, in which they participated together with different specialists for therapeutic decision-making in the most complex cases. On the other hand, the availability of human and material resources allowed the implantation of centralized elaboration in the Pharmacy Service of many intravenous mixtures, including antibiotics elastomers Pumps for continuous infusion, and non-sterile elaborations. In logistics management, in addition to the acquisition of COVID- 19 therapies, the reconciliation with nursing activity stands out.

In this study, we compared the results from the assays of serum 25(OH)D performed with three different methods to evaluate the presence of potential biases and how much these biases can influence the assignment of patients to specific 25(OH)D deficiency/sufficiency categories. Design and Methods: Liaison 25(OH) Vitamin D Total (DiaSorin Liaison XL), Elecsys Vitamin D Total II (Roche Elecsys) and Lumipulse G25(OH) Vitamin D (Fujirebio Lumipulse G1200) were used. Methods comparability was established performing Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-Altman analysis to prove whether the differences found were lower than the preliminarily pre-established maximum acceptable bias. Results: all Passing-Bablok regressions exhibited the presence of a proportional and constant systematic error. Bland-Altman analysis revealed biases well above the maximum acceptable bias, so the 25(OH)D concentrations measured were not comparable. To evaluate whether the three methods had the same ability to classify patients into different categories of vitamin D levels, we categorized results obtained by each method in reference classes. Lumipulse categorized most patients into the class with the lowest 25(OH)D concentrations (<20 ng/mL) whereas Elecsys ranked the lowest number. Conclusions: Liaison XL and Elecsys have shown good accuracy compared to Lumipulse in measuring 25(OH)D levels.

Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown to save lives and stop health systems from being overwhelmed. At the same time, lockdowns entail large socioeconomic costs. One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces the close contacts of those infected with COVID-19. Recent research has demonstrated the theoretical effectiveness of this solution in different disease settings. However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing in the general population. As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app uptake, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the user acceptability of a contact-tracing app in five countries hit by the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a largescale, multicountry study (N=5995) to measure public support for the digital contact tracing of COVID-19 infections. We ran anonymous online surveys in France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We measured intentions to use a contact-tracing app across different installation regimes (voluntary installation vs automatic installation by mobile phone providers) and studied how these intentions vary across individuals and countries. RESULTS: We found strong support for the app under both regimes, in all countries, across all subgroups of the population, and irrespective of regional-level COVID-19 mortality rates. We investigated the main factors that may hinder or facilitate uptake and found that concerns about cybersecurity and privacy, together with a lack of trust in the government, are the main barriers to adoption. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological evidence shows that app-based contact tracing can suppress the spread of COVID-19 if a high enough proportion of the population uses the app and that it can still reduce the number of infections if uptake is moderate. Our findings show that the willingness to install the app is very high. The available evidence suggests that app-based contact tracing may be a viable approach to control the diffusion of COVID-19.","output":"Acceptability of App-Based Contact Tracing for COVID-19: Cross-Country Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Q replicase (RNA-directed RNA polymerase of bacteriophage Q) exponentially amplifies certain RNAs in vitro. Previous studies have shown that Q replicase can initiate and elongate on a variety of RNAs; however, only a minute fraction of them are recognized as legitimate templates. Guanosine 5-triphosphate (GTP)-dependent initiation on a legitimate template generates a stable replicative complex capable of elongation in the presence of aurintricarboxylic acid, a powerful inhibitor of RNACprotein interactions. On the contrary, initiation on an illegitimate template is GTP independent and does not result in the aurintricarboxylic-acid-resistant replicative complex. This article demonstrates that the 3 and 5 termini of a legitimate template cooperate during and after the initiation step. Breach of the cooperation by dividing the template into fragments or by introducing point mutations at the 5 terminus reduces the rate and the yield of initiation, increases the GTP requirement, decreases the overall rate of template copying, and destabilizes the postinitiation replicative complex. These results revive the old idea of a functional circularity of legitimate Q replicase templates and complement the increasing body of evidence that functional circularity may be a common property of RNA templates directing the synthesis of either RNA or protein molecules.","output":"Functional Circularity of Legitimate Q Replicase Templates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is unfortunately highly transmissible across the people.

The proposal leverages the IoT devices that collect streaming data from both medical (e.g., X-ray machine, lung ultrasound machine, etc.) and non-medical (e.g., bracelet, smartwatch, etc.) devices. Moreover, the proposed hybrid fog-cloud framework provides two kinds of federated ML as a service (federated MLaaS);(i) the distributed batch MLaaS that is implemented on the cloud environment for a long-term decision-making, and (ii) the distributed stream MLaaS, which is installed into a hybrid fog-cloud environment for a short-term decision-making. The stream MLaaS uses a shared federated prediction model stored into the cloud, whereas the real-time symptom data processing and COVID-19 prediction are done into the fog. The federated ML models are determined after evaluating a set of both batch and stream ML algorithms from the Pythons libraries. The evaluation considers both the quantitative (i.e., performance in terms of accuracy, precision, root mean squared error, and F1 score) and qualitative (i.e., quality of service in terms of server latency, response time, and network latency) metrics to assess these algorithms.

Whether or not COVID-19 vaccinations impact neutralization of seasonal coronaviruses is largely unknown. METHODS: We analyzed the capacity of sera derived from 24 individuals before and after heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination to neutralize genuine OC43, NL63 and 229E hCoVs, as well as viral pseudoparticles carrying the SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, hCoV-OC43, -NL63 and -229E spike proteins. Genuine hCoVs or spike containing pseudovirions were incubated with different concentrations of sera and neutralization efficiencies were determined by measuring viral RNA yields, intracellular viral nucleocapsid expression, or reporter gene expression in Huh-7 cells. RESULTS: All individuals showed strong preexisting immunity against hCoV-OC43. Neutralization of hCoV-NL63 was more variable and all sera showed only modest inhibitory activity against genuine hCoV-229E. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination resulted in efficient cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-1 but not of MERS-CoV. On average, vaccination significantly increased the neutralizing activity against genuine hCoV-OC43, -NL63 and -229E.

In the present study, 71 articles are included after a careful, thorough screening of the titles and their abstracts for possible inclusion using predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria (PRISMA Guidelines). RESULTS: In the current study, we compiled cell culture-based studies for SARS-CoV-2 and found the best compatible In-Vitro models for SARS-CoV-2 (Vero, VeroE6, HEK293 as well as its variants, Huh-7, Calu-3 2B4, and Caco2). Among other essential cell lines used include LLC-MK2, MDCKII, BHK-21, HepG2, A549,T cell leukemia (MT-2), stems cells based cell line DYR0100for differentiation assays, and embryo-specific NIH3T3 cell line for vaccine production. CONCLUSION: The Present study provides a detailed summary of all the drugs/compounds screened for drug repurposing and discovery purpose using the in-vitro models for SARS-CoV-2 along with isolation, pathogenesis and vaccine production. This study also suggests that after careful evaluation of all the cell line based studies, Kidney cells (VeroE6, HEK293 along with their clones), liver Huh-7cells, respiratory Calu-3 cells, and intestinal Caco-2 are the most widely used in-vitro models for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Clinically relevant cell culture models and their significance in isolation, pathogenesis, vaccine development, repurposing and screening of new drugs for SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Entering the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on supply chains. Reacting to the pandemic and adaptation in the new normal have been challenging tasks. Exiting the pandemic can lead to some after-shock effects such as disruption tails. While the research community has undertaken considerable efforts to predict the pandemics impacts and examine supply chain adaptive behaviors during the pandemic, little is known about supply chain management in the course of pandemic elimination and post-disruption recovery. If capacity and inventory management are unaware of the after-shock risks, this can result in highly destabilized productionCinventory dynamics and decreased performance in the post-disruption period causing product deficits in the markets and high inventory costs in the supply chains. In this paper, we use a discrete-event simulation model to investigate some exit strategies for a supply chain in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model can inform managers about the existence and risk of disruption tails in their supply chains and guide the selection of post-pandemic recovery strategies. Our results show that supply chains with postponed demand and shutdown capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic are particularly prone to disruption tails. We then developed and examined two strategies to avoid these disruption tails. First, we observed a conjunction of recovery and supply chain coordination which mitigates the impact of disruption tails by demand smoothing over time in the post-disruption period. Second, we found a gradual capacity ramp-up prior to expected peaks of postponed demand to be an effective strategy for disruption tail control.","output":"Exiting the COVID-19 pandemic: after-shock risks and avoidance of disruption tails in supply chains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Kyphoscoliosis is a skeletal condition involving the hyperflexion of the thoracic spine. It is characterized by reduced chest wall compliance and impaired respiratory mechanisms leading to progressive hypo-ventilation. We evaluated the effectiveness and the safety of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in patients after an episode of acute respiratory failure (ARF). METHODS Eighteen patients with severe kyphoscoliosis who had been hospitalized for an episode of ARF were followed for 4 years. NIV was applied via mouthpiece (MPV) during the daytime and via mask during the night. The primary outcomes were changes in physiological and functional parameters as well as quality of life. Secondary outcomes were considered re-hospitalization and mortality rate after discharge. A set of control subjects was used for comparison. RESULTS All patients showed a significant improvement in several clinical, physiological, functional and quality of life parameters. Four of them (22.2%) died during the four year follow-up period. In the uni-variate analysis patients who died had higher cardiac co-morbidity, lower MIP and SNIP, higher paCO2, and oxygen desaturation index at initial admission. CONCLUSIONS Diurnal MPV associated with nocturnal NIV had significantly improved lung function, clinical outcomes and quality of life.

We aimed to provide substantial evidence for the effect of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine versus native infection on maternal humoral, as well as transplacentally acquired fetal immune response, potentially providing newborn protection. METHODS: A multicenter study where parturients presenting for delivery were recruited at 8 medical centers across Israel and assigned to three study groups: vaccinated (n=86); PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected during pregnancy (n=65), and unvaccinated non-infected controls (n=62). Maternal and fetal blood samples were collected from parturients prior to delivery and from the umbilical cord following delivery, respectively. Sera IgG and IgM titers were measured using Milliplex MAP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panel (for S1, S2, RBD and N). RESULTS: BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine elicits strong maternal humoral IgG response (Anti-S and RBD) that crosses the placenta barrier and approaches maternal titers in the fetus within 15 days following the first dose. Maternal to neonatal anti-COVID-19 antibodies ratio did not differ when comparing sensitization (vaccine vs. infection). IgG transfer rate was significantly lower for third-trimester as compared to second trimester infection. Lastly, fetal IgM response was detected in 5 neonates, all in the infected group.

We find that the effectiveness of some operational interventions are sensitive to the primary mode of transmission. Restricting customer flow to one-way movement is highly effective if direct exposure is the dominant mode of transmission. In particular, the rate of direct transmission under full compliance with one-way movement is less than one-third the rate under two-way movement. Directing customers to follow one-way flow, however, is not effective if wake exposure dominates. We find that two other interventions - reducing the speed variance of customers and throughput control - can be effective whether direct or wake transmission is dominant. We also examine the trade-off between customer throughput and the risk of infection to customers, and we show how the optimal throughput rate drops rapidly as the population prevalence rises.","output":"Retail Store Customer Flow and COVID-19 Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been a rapid development of biomimetic platforms using cell membranes as nanocarriers to camouflage nanoparticles for enhancing bio-interfacial capabilities.

This study aimed to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on childhood cancer care worldwide. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to paediatric oncology providers worldwide from June 22 to Aug 21, 2020, through the St Jude Global Alliance and International Society for Paediatric Oncology listservs and regional networks. The survey included 60 questions to assess institution characteristics, the number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, disruptions to cancer care (eg, service closures and treatment abandonment), adaptations to care, and resources (including availability of clinical staff and personal protective equipment). Surveys were included for analysis if respondents answered at least two thirds of the items, and the responses were analysed at the institutional level. FINDINGS: Responses from 311 health-care professionals at 213 institutions in 79 countries from all WHO regions were included in the analysis. 187 (88%) of 213 centres had the capacity to test for SARS-CoV-2 and a median of two (range 0-350) infections per institutution were reported in children with cancer. 15 (7%) centres reported complete closure of paediatric haematology-oncology services (median 10 days, range 1-75 days). Overall, 2% (5 of 213) of centres were no longer evaluating new cases of suspected cancer, while 43% (90 of 208) of the remaining centers described a decrease in newly diagnosed paediatric cancer cases. 73 (34%) centres reported increased treatment abandonment (ie, failure to initiate cancer therapy or a delay in care of 4 weeks or longer). Changes to cancer care delivery included: reduced surgical care (153 [72%]), blood product shortages (127 [60%]), chemotherapy modifications (121 [57%]), and interruptions to radiotherapy (43 [28%] of 155 institutions that provided radiotherapy before the pandemic). The decreased number of new cancer diagnoses did not vary based on country income status (p=014). However, unavailability of chemotherapy agents (p=0022), treatment abandonment (p<00001), and interruptions in radiotherapy (p<00001) were more frequent in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. These findings did not vary based on institutional or national numbers of COVID-19 cases. Hospitals reported using new or adapted checklists (146 [69%] of 213), processes for communication with patients and families (134 [63%]), and guidelines for essential services (119 [56%]) as a result of the pandemic. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably affected paediatric oncology services worldwide, posing substantial disruptions to cancer diagnosis and management, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries.

We conducted a cross-sectional survey to quantify and characterize non-household contact and to identify the effect of shielding and isolating on contact patterns. MethodsThrough an online questionnaire, the CoCoNet study measured daily interactions and mobility of 5143 participants between 28 July and 14 August 2020. Negative binomial regression modelling identified participant characteristics associated with contact rates. ResultsThe mean rate of non-household contacts per person was 2.9 d-1. Participants attending a workplace (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 3.33, 95%CI 3.02 to 3.66), self-employed (aIRR 1.63, 95%CI 1.43 to 1.87) or working in healthcare (aIRR 5.10, 95%CI 4.29 to 6.10) reported significantly higher non-household contact rates than those working from home. Participants self-isolating as a precaution or following Test and Trace instructions had a lower non-household contact rate than those not self-isolating (aIRR 0.58, 95%CI 0.43 to 0.79). We found limited evidence that those shielding had reduced non-household contacts compared to non-shielders. ConclusionThe daily rate of non-household interactions remains lower than pre-pandemic levels, suggesting continued adherence to social distancing guidelines. Individuals attending a workplace in-person or employed as healthcare professionals were less likely to maintain social distance and had a higher non-household contact rate, possibly increasing their infection risk.

Several methods of pain assessment have been proposed to assess pain in this environment. These include both behavioural observation scales and evaluation of physiological measurements such as heart rate and blood pressure. Although numerous validation studies pertaining to behavioural observation scales have been published, several limitations associated with using these measures for pain assessment remain. Over the past few years, researchers have been interested in the use of the bispectral index monitoring system as a proxy for the evaluation of encephalography readings to assess the level of anesthesia and, potentially, analgesia. OBJECTIVES To synthesize the main studies exploring the use of the bispectral index monitoring system for pain assessment, to guide future research in adults under sedation in the intensive care unit. METHOD The EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies published between 1996 and 2013 that evaluated the use of the bispectral index in assessing pain. RESULTS Most studies conclude that nociceptive stimulation causes a significant increase in the bispectral index and revealed the importance of controlling certain confounding variables such as the level of sedation.

The developed reagent kits provided 100% sensitivity and a detection limit of 103 GE / ml for qPCR, and at least 200 copies / ml of viral RNA when performing digital PCR. These methods were tested using a panel of 1,328 samples collected from patients with suspected COVID-19 at the beginning of 2020 in the Russian Federation.

Genetic analysis allows some reconstruction of past dispersal events.

This study aimed to investigate the anti-hypoxic activities of dexamethasone to understand a possible mechanism of its action in hypoxia-induced lethality through experimental models of hypoxia. METHODS: In this investigation, 84 Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into groups of seven (12 groups). Treatment groups received 10 days of dexamethasone intraperitoneal injection at both human dose (~0.1 mg/kg) and the animal does (~1 mg/kg). Control negative and positive groups were treated with 10 ml/kg of normal saline and 30 mg/kg of propranolol, respectively. Three experimental models of hypoxia, asphyctic, circulatory, and hemic were applied in this study. RESULTS: The findings showed that dexamethasone significantly prolonged the latency for death in the asphyctic model concerning the control group in both humans (P < .0001) and animal dose (P < .0001). The results were also highly significant for both doses in the hemic model (P < .001). In the circulatory model, although a small increase was observed in death prolongation, results were not statistically significant for both doses in this model (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: This experimental in vivo investigation demonstrated an excellent protective effect for 10 days of dexamethasone treatment against hypoxia, especially in asphyctic and hemic models. In addition to promising dexamethasone outcomes, using propranolol as the positive control illustrated a very substantial anti-hypoxic effect even much better than dexamethasone in all models.

Shockwave therapy, in particular, has received significant attention in direct-to-consumer marketing and is often advertised by non-urologists. However, the nomenclature surrounding shockwave therapy has led to ambiguity. Focused shock wave therapy (fSWT) has become conflated with radial or acoustic wave therapy (rWT), though they differ in mechanism of wave generation and tissue penetration. GAINSWave, a prominent marketing platform for acoustic wave therapy, has also pervaded the marketplace. We aim to characterize the relative impact of direct-to-consumer marketing of shockwave therapy by quantifying the frequency of internet search queries for various shockwave options for ED. METHODS: Population-level Google Search trends in the United States (www.google.com/trends) were used to characterize interest in various forms of shockwave therapy for ED. Search trends for fSWT, rSWT, and GAINSWave were analyzed (Figure 1). Google Search data are tabulated on a relative scale of 0-100, with 100 representing the most frequently searched term over a time interval. Monthly search data were compiled over a 6 year period (1/1/14 through 2/28/20), ending just before the COVID-19 pandemic. Yearly averages were computed to quantify macro-level changes in patient interest. RESULTS: Trends in Google Search interest in various forms of shockwave therapy for erectile dysfunction are depicted in Figure 1. Queries for GAINSWave dominated public interest, increasing by 187- fold from 2016 to 2020. The introduction of GAINSWave represents an inflection point for the entire shockwave market: searches for shockwave therapy increased by 782% from 2016 to 2020.

In a pandemic there is a strong ethical need to consider how to do most good overall. 1. Triage: which patients should receive access to a ventilator if there is overwhelming demand outstripping supply? 2.

In the past few decades, the rise of reperfusion therapy has significantly reduced the mortality rate, but the MI diagnosis is still by means of the identification of myocardial injury markers without highly specific biomarkers of microcirculation disorders. Ferroptosis is a novel reported type of programmed cell death, which plays an important role in cancer development. Maintaining iron homeostasis in cells is essential for heart function, and its role in the pathological process of ischemic organ damages remains unclear. Being quickly detected through blood tests, circulating endothelial cells (CECs) have the potential for early judgment of early microcirculation disorders. In order to explore the role of ferroptosis-related genes in the early diagnosis of acute MI, we relied on two data sets from the GEO database to first detect eight ferroptosis-related genes differentially expressed in CECs between the MI and healthy groups in this study. After comparing different supervised learning algorithms, we constructed a random forest diagnosis model for acute MI based on these ferroptosis-related genes with a compelling diagnostic performance in both the validation (AUC = 0.8550) and test set (AUC = 0.7308), respectively. These results suggest that the ferroptosis-related genes might play an important role in the early stage of MI and have the potential as specific diagnostic biomarkers for MI.","output":"Development and Validation of a Random Forest Diagnostic Model of Acute Myocardial Infarction Based on Ferroptosis-Related Genes in Circulating Endothelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Widespread opinions and discussion exist regarding the efficiency of social distancing after crucial spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the actual Covid-19 pandemic. While Germany has released a federal law that prohibits any type of direct contact for more than 2 people other countries including the US released curfews. People are now wondering whether these measures are helpful to stop or hamper the Covid-19 pandemic and to limit the spread of the new corona virus. A quantitative statement on this question depends on many parameters that are difficult to grasp mathematically and cannot therefore be made conclusively (they include consistent adherence to the measures decided, the estimated number of unreported cases, the possible limitation by test capacities, possible mutations of the virus, etc ...). However, it turns out that a reduction in the actual daily new infection rate (actual daily growth rate of reported cases, in short: infection rate) from the current value of 30-35% in the US to 10% would be extremely effective in stopping the spread of the virus. The severe restrictions in Germany which closed any public events, schools and universities a week ago might already have contributed to a reduction of the growth rate of reported cases below 30%.","output":"A simplified model for expected development of the SARS-CoV-2 (Corona) spread in Germany and US after social distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, an attempt has been made to examine the level of organizational commitment and job satisfaction among male and female school teachers working in private schools during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1, an RNA-binding protein) was shown to mediate deposition of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in internal SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The levels of hNRNPA1 expression and extent of methylation varied, depending on the course of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. The recruitment of eIF4E (translational initiation factor) facilitated viral RNA translation at 1 hour post infection (1 hpi). However, at 2 hpi, methylation of internal SARS-CoV-2 RNA recruited hNRNPA1 which facilitated viral RNA transcription but resulted in translational repression, a phenomenon contributing in understanding the early translation to replication switch in the viral life cycle. Besides, the abrogation of methylation also produced a defective 5 cap of viral RNA which failed to interact with eIF4E, thereby resulting in a decreased synthesis of viral proteins. To conclude, methylation of the internal and 5 cap of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was shown to regulate transcription and translation of SARS-CoV-2 in a time dependent manner. IMPORTANCERNA modifications are found in all life forms and have been linked to development, health and diseases. Our study reveals that internal SARS-CoV-2 RNA methylation (m6A) is essential for interaction with hNRNPA1 to effectively synthesize viral genome. Besides, m6A-marked RNA and hRNPA1 interaction was also shown to regulate early translation to replication switch in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.

People respond much quickly towards any issue on social than any other traditional platform. Observing the patient's opinion on social media about the hospital medical facilities is a new trend that several hospitals are adopting recently in the modern world to improve their heal care facilities. After the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, it has influenced the health care practices of all the world. Initial investigations indicate that patients with comorbidities are more fragile to this SARS-CoV-2 infection. Medical experts suggested postponing the routine treatment of cancer patients. However, few meta-analyses suggested evidence are not sufficient to hold the claim of the frailty of cancer patients to COVID-19. They were not in favor of shelving the scheduled treatments. On the other hand, some medical experts favored postponing cancer patients' scheduled treatments like chemotherapy, which could be a dangerous decision for cancer patients. We conducted the sentiment analysis of the patients with various comorbidities (diseases like diabetes, obesity, and cancer in which patient has to visit the hospital more often) to understand their point of view whether they were satisfied during the pandemic with their treatment or not? How Covid-19 affected their scheduled appointments. To serve the purpose, we gathered more than 150000 relevant tweets from Twitter (Jan 2020 to April 2020) to analyze the sentiment of cancer patients around the world. Our findings demonstrate a surge in the argument about cancer and its treatment after the outbreak of COVID-19. Most of the tweets are reasonable (52.6%) compared to negative ones (24.3%). We developed polarity and subjectivity distribution to better recognize the positivity/negativity in the sentiment. The results reveal that the polarity range of positive tweets is within the range of 0 to 0.5. That means the tendency in the tweets is not negative (it is above zero) nor so much positive too. It is statistical evidence supporting how natural language processing (NLP) can be used to better understand the patient's behavior in real-time.

Zidovudine was used as a positive control. Cell survival and viral inhibition rates were measured. The herb that was the closest inactivity to zidovudine was screened. Mass spectrometry identified the active compounds in herbs (mobile phase: 0.05% formic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile, gradient elution, detection wavelength: 210 nm). The effect of the compounds on reverse transcriptase (RT) products were evaluated by real-time PCR. Gene enrichment was used to analyse underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: With a dose of 1 mg/mL of Cortex Mori, the cell survival rate (57.94%) and viral inhibition rate (74.95%) were closest to the effect of zidovudine (87.87%, 79.81%, respectively).

The performance of our best models is comparable to the currently used questionnaire-based method, with an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of approximately 0.8. We find that the deep-learning model BERTje performs worse than conventional machine learning methods. We also evaluate our data and our classifiers to understand the performance of our models better. This is particularly important for the applicability of evaluated classifiers to new data, and is also of great interest to practitioners, due to the increased availability of new data in electronic format.","output":"Machine Learning for Violence Risk Assessment Using Dutch Clinical Notes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus infection (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020, there have been many concerns about pregnant women and the possible effects of this emergency with catastrophic outcomes in many countries Information on COVID-19 and pregnancy are scarce and spread throughout a few case series, with no more than 50 cases in total The present review provides a brief analysis of COVID-19, pregnancy in the COVID-19 era, and the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy","output":"Covid19 and Pregnancy: An Overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Defibrotide (DF) is a polyribonucleotide with antithrombotic, pro-fibrinolytic, and anti-inflammatory effects on endothelium. These effects and the established safety of DF present DF as a strong candidate to treat viral and post-infectious syndromes involving endothelial dysfunction. AREAS COVERED We discuss DF and other therapeutic agents that have the potential to target endothelial components of pathogenesis in viral and post-infectious syndromes. We introduce defibrotide (DF), describe its mechanisms of action, and explore its established pleiotropic effects on the endothelium. We describe the established pathophysiology of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and highlight the processes specific to COVID-19 potentially modulated by DF. We also present influenza A and viral hemorrhagic fevers, especially those caused by hantavirus, Ebola virus, and dengue virus, as viral syndromes in which DF might serve therapeutic benefit. Finally, we offer our opinion on novel treatment strategies targeting endothelial dysfunction in viral infections and their severe manifestations. EXPERT OPINION Given the critical role of endothelial dysfunction in numerous infectious syndromes, in particular COVID-19, therapeutic pharmacology for these conditions should increasingly prioritize endothelial stabilization. Several agents with endothelial protective properties should be further studied as treatments for severe viral infections and vasculitides, especially where other therapeutic modalities have failed.","output":"Defibrotide: potential for treating endothelial dysfunction related to viral and post-infectious syndromes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of COVID-19 has brought huge public health challenges to the world.

However, limited availability to buprenorphine is pervasive in the United States (US) and may serve to exacerbate the deadly epidemic. Although prior research points to rural counties as especially needy of strategies that improve buprenorphine availability, it is important to investigate the availability of waivered providers according to treatment need as defined by the county-level rate of opioid-overdose deaths (OOD). This study examined differences in buprenorphine provider availability relative to treatment need among rural and urban counties in the US. METHODS: Buprenorphine provider availability relative to need in each county was defined as the number of waivered providers divided by the rate of OODs (i.e., number of OODs/100,000 population), according to 2018 data. Counties with ratios in the bottom tertile of their state were classified as buprenorphine undersupplied. We estimated logit models to statistically test the association of rurality and state main effects and their interaction terms (independent variables) and the county classified as buprenorphine undersupplied (dependent variable). RESULTS: A total of 38 states and 2595 counties had sufficient non-suppressed data to remain in the analysis. A larger percent of urban counties (36.43%) than rural counties (32.01%) were classified as buprenorphine undersupplied (p = 0.001). The likelihood of a rural county being undersupplied varied considerably by state (Chi Square = 82.88, p = 0.000). All states with significant (p < 0.05 or p < 0.10) interaction terms showed lower likelihood of buprenorphine undersupply in rural counties. CONCLUSIONS: The ruralCurban distribution in undersupply of waivered buprenorphine providers relative to need varied markedly by state. Strategies for improving access to buprenorphine-waivered providers should be state-centric and informed by county-specific indicators of need.","output":"Rural and urban differences in undersupply of buprenorphine provider availability in the United States, 2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new coronavirus outbreak called COVID-19 started in December 2019.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among registered members of the Saudi Society for Rheumatology. The questionnaire focused on biosimilars and NMS. Logistic regression was performed to ascertain the effect of demographics and practice characteristics on the use of biosimilars and NMS. RESULTS: Out of 249 SSR members, 143 completed the survey, generating a response rate of 57.4%. Of those (59.44%) were men with a mean (SD) age and years of practice of 42.3  9.13 and 10.3  8.9, respectively.

In most cases, the development of the disease is sporadic and is not associated with any currently known mutations associated with PD.

The study of individuals with an almost identical genetic background, such as monozygotic twins, is one of the best approaches to the analysis of such changes. A whole-transcriptome analysis of dermal fibroblasts obtained from three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for PD was carried out in this work. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes were identified in the three pairs of twins. These genes were included in seven processes within two clusters, according to the results of an enrichment analysis. The cluster with the greatest statistical significance included processes associated with the regulation of the differentiation of fat cells, the action potential, and the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The most significant genes, which occupied a central position in this cluster, were PTGS2, SCN9A, and GRIK2. These genes can be considered as potential candidate genes for PD.

Demonstrated in crystal structures, the residues 452 and 484 in RBD are not in direct contact with interfacial residues in the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This suggests that albeit there are some possibly nonlocal effects, the E484Q and L452R mutations might not significantly affect RBDs binding with ACE2, which is an important step for viral entry into host cells. Thus, without the known molecular mechanism, these two successful mutations (from the point of view of SARS-CoV-2) can be hypothesized to evade human antibodies.

At the same time, this treatment regime leads to significant toxicity, cost, and patient inconvenience. Drug-resistance is linked to CRC stem cells, which are associated with the epidermal-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Thus, to optimally treat CRC, a therapy that can target the cell survival and EMT pathways in both CRC bulk and stem cell populations is critical. We recently identified a novel small molecule NSC30049 (7a) that is effective alone, and in combination potentiates 5-FU-mediated growth inhibition of CRC bulk, FOLFOX-resistant, and CRC stem cells both in vitro and in vivo models. In the present study, we report the synthesis and anti-CRC evaluation of several stable and effective 7a analogs. ASR352 (7b) was identified as one of the equipotent 7a analogs that inhibited the growth of CRC bulk cells, sensitized FOLFOX-resistant cells, and reduced the sphere formation capacity of CRC stem cells. It appears that the complex mechanism of cytotoxicity for 7b includes abrogation of 5-FU-induced the S phase, reduction of the phosphorylation of Chk1 at S317P, S345P and S296P, increased H2AX staining, activation of caspase 3/PARP1 cleavage, and enhancement of Bax/Bcl2 ratio.

The standard administration schedule for most COVID-19 vaccines currently approved is two doses administered 3 to 4 wk apart. To increase the number of individuals with partial protection, some governments are considering delaying the second vaccine dose. However, the delay duration must take into account crucial factors, such as the degree of protection conferred by a single dose, the anticipated vaccine supply pipeline, and the potential emergence of more virulent COVID-19 variants. To help guide decision-making, we propose here an optimization model based on extended susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed (SEIR) dynamics that determines the optimal delay duration between the first and second COVID-19 vaccine doses. The model assumes lenient social distancing and uses intensive care unit (ICU) admission as a key metric while selecting the optimal duration between doses vs. the standard 4-wk delay. While epistemic uncertainties apply to the interpretation of simulation outputs, we found that the delay is dependent on the vaccine mechanism of action and first-dose efficacy.

Results: Changes in collection capacity utilization lagged increases and decreases in COVID-19 hospital discharges, and never exceeded 75% in most simulations. Demand could be met for most of the simulation period in most simulations, but in states with early sharp increases in hospitalizations a substantial portion of demand went unmet during these early peaks. Modeled second wave demand could generally be met with stockpiles established during first epidemic peaks. Apheresis machine capacity (number of machines) and probability that COVID-19 recovered individuals are willing to donate were the most important supply-side drivers of ability to meet demand.

Interventions included combinations of high-volume intraoral suction (HVS[IO]), high-volume extraoral suction (HVS[EO]) and an air cleaning system (ACS). Method A sequence of six AGPs were performed on a phantom head. Real-time aerosol measurements (particle size range 0.0062-9.6 m) were acquired from six locations within a typical dental treatment room (35 m(3)). Results The majority (>99%) of AGP particles were <0.3 m diameter and remained at elevated levels around the dental team during the AGPs. With no active aerosol-management interventions, AGP particles were estimated to remain above the baseline range for up to 30 minutes from the end of the sequence of procedures. Conclusions The results emphasise the importance of personal protection equipment, particularly respiratory protection. Use of HVS(IO), either alone or in combination with the ACS, reduced particle concentrations to baseline levels on completion of AGPs. These data indicate potential to eliminate fallow time.

They may experience secondary traumatic stress (STS) as a result of their empathetic engagement with traumatized clients, and they may also experience vicarious posttraumatic growth (VPTG). The present study examined negative and positive change in hotline counselors concurrently and explored the mechanisms of both positive and negative outcomes. Participants were 776 counselors (81% female, average age = 42.57  7.90, average years of experience = 12.44  5.92) recruited from MOE-CCNU Mental Health Service Platform, the biggest official telephone-based and online psychological support platform in China during COVID-19 period. Empathy and VPTG were measured by revised Chinese versions of self-report questionnaires. STS was assessed by the corresponding subscale of the Professional Quality of Life Scale. The Chinese Meaning in Life Questionnaire was used to assess participants search for life meaning. Mindfulness was evaluated by Mindful Attention Awareness Scale. Latent variable structural equation modeling was applied. After controlling age, trauma cases and total cases, counselors empathy was positively associated with STS and VPTG. Results revealed that empathy was positively associated with STS and VPTG. Mindfulness mediated this association between empathy and STS. Search for meaning mediated the relationship between empathy and VPTG. Additionally, the association between empathy and VPTG was also mediated through other four significant mediating pathways: (a) secondary trauma stress, (b) secondary traumatic stress and search for meaning, (c) mindfulness and search for meaning, and (d) mindfulness and secondary trauma stress and search for meaning. Our findings support that empathy lead to both positive and negative outcomes among hotline counselors during COVID-19 period in China, highlighting dialectical insights into trauma workers experiences. When counselors engage in others traumatic experience, their vicarious negative emotional experience may be a pathway to growth, and search for life meaning is an important factor in that growth. ? 2021, Science Press.

Since respiratory viruses are frequently detected in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) it was our aim to investigate the frequency of hMPV detection in a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with AE-COPD compared to patients with stable COPD and to smokers without by means of quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: We analysed nasal lavage and induced sputum of 130 patients with AE-COPD, 65 patients with stable COPD and 34 smokers without COPD. HMPV was detected in 3/130 (2.3%) AE-COPD patients with a mean of 6.5  10(5 )viral copies/ml in nasal lavage and 1.88  10(5 )viral copies/ml in induced sputum.

These vesicles are widely used in small-molecule drug and nucleic acid delivery and recently gained much attention because of their remarkable success as a delivery platform for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the utility of transient protein expression induced by mRNA extends far beyond vaccines against infectious diseasesa??they also hold promise as cancer vaccines, protein replacement therapies, and gene editing components for rare genetic diseases. However, naked mRNA is inherently unstable and prone to rapid degradation by nucleases and self-hydrolysis. Encapsulation of mRNA within LNPs protects mRNA from extracellular ribonucleases and assists with intracellular mRNA delivery.In this Account, we discuss the core features of LNPs for RNA delivery. We focus our attention on LNPs designed to deliver mRNA; however, we also include examples of siRNA-LNP delivery where appropriate to highlight the commonalities and the dissimilarities due to the nucleic acid structure. First, we introduce the concept of LNPs, the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing nucleic acids as therapeutic agents, and the general reasoning behind the molecular makeup of LNPs. We also briefly highlight the most recent clinical successes of LNP-based nucleic acid therapies. Second, we describe the theory and methods of LNP self-assembly. The common idea behind all of the preparation methods is inducing electrostatic interactions between the nucleic acid and charged lipids and promoting nanoparticle growth via hydrophobic interactions. Third, we break down the LNP composition with special attention to the fundamental properties and purposes of each component. This includes the identified molecular design criteria, commercial sourcing, impact on intracellular trafficking, and contribution to the properties of LNPs. One of the key components of LNPs is ionizable lipids, which initiate electrostatic binding with endosomal membranes and facilitate cytosolic release; however, the roles of other lipid components should not be disregarded, as they are associated with stability, clearance, and distribution of LNPs. Fourth, we review the attributes of LNP constructs as a whole that can heavily influence RNA delivery. These attributes are LNP size, charge, internal structure, lipid packing, lipid membrane hydration, stability, and affinity toward biomacromolecules. We also discuss the specific techniques used to examine these attributes and how they can be adjusted. Finally, we offer our perspective on the future of RNA therapies and some questions that remain in the realm of LNP formulation and optimization.","output":"Chemistry of Lipid Nanoparticles for RNA Delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Appendectomy is the most commonly performed surgery in the emergency department. It is very difficult to determine the minimal duration of the learning curve for junior residents to perform safe laparoscopic surgeries. AIM: This study aimed to determine the feasibility of a safe laparoscopic appendectomy performed by junior residents. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary healthcare center from May 2018 to May 2020. METHODS AND MATERIAL: This study reviewed all the data of laparoscopic appendectomy performed by junior and senior residents. Both groups were compared for the patient outcome in terms of complications, conversion to open, intraoperative findings, operative time, postoperative progress, and hospital stay. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The data were formulated in an excel sheet and analyzed with SPSS. Mean, median, range, standard deviation, percentages, univariate analysis with  test and t-test were used. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in operative time (mean [SD], 84.87 [24.73] vs. 86.95 [24.93], P = 0.679), intraoperative complication (9.2% vs. 7.8%, P = 0.769), postoperative complications (34.2% vs. 34.4%, P = 0.984), conversion to open (6.6% vs. 4.7%, P = 0.633), length of postoperative hospital stay (Mean [SD], 2.3 [2] vs. 2.2 [1], P = 0.739), and readmission (4% vs. 3%, P = 0.794). No major intraoperative complications and mortality were found in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Junior residents may be allowed for safe laparoscopic appendectomy under supervision without experience of open appendectomy. The patients outcomes may be comparable with surgery performed by well-experienced surgeons.

Quantitative real-time PCR and CRISPR-based methods rapidly detect DNA/RNA in 1 h but suffer from inter-site variability. Absolute quantification of DNA/RNA by methods such as digital PCR reduce this variability but are currently too slow for wider application. Here, we report a RApid DIgital Crispr Approach (RADICA) for absolute quantification of nucleic acids in 40-60 min. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a proof-of-concept target, RADICA allows for absolute quantification with a linear dynamic range of 0.6-2027 copies/L (R2 value > 0.99), high accuracy and low variability, no cross-reactivity to similar targets, and high tolerance to human background DNA. RADICA's versatility is validated against other targets such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from human B cells and patients' serum. RADICA can accurately detect and absolutely quantify EBV DNA with similar dynamic range of 0.5-2100 copies/L (R2 value > 0.98) in 1 h without thermal cycling, providing a 4-fold faster alternative to digital PCR-based detection.

METHODS We conducted an observational cohort study on consecutive NHS patients attending three private hospitals between 4 May 2020 and 16 June 2020. Patients attended preoperative assessment, including coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptom screening, were instructed to self-isolate for 14 days and had a negative COVID-19 swab within 72 hours of surgery. Patient age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, body mass index, surgery performed, type of anaesthetic and length of stay were collected. Our primary outcome was a positive COVID-19 swab, secondary outcomes were COVID-19 symptoms, readmission, surgical complications and mortality. RESULTS Between 4 May 2020 and 16 June 2020, 191 patients were admitted to three private hospitals for elective surgery; 121 (67%) patients underwent general or regional anaesthetic, 179 patients were ASA grades 1 or 2 (94%) and 12 (6%) were ASA 3.

Employment questions included current and pre-pandemic work status, reasons for not currently working as a dental hygienist, and estimated levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the primary work location. All statistical analysis was conducted in Qualtrics Core XM; cross tabulation was used to examine dental hygienist working patterns and attitudes by age, practice PPE supply, and other factors.Results: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an estimated 8% reduction in dental hygienist employment. The majority (59.1%, n=205) of this reduction is voluntary, with the main reason being general concerns over COVID-19 (48.3%, n=100). Other reasons include issues surrounding childcare and concerns over safety measures in the workplace. Dental hygienists aged 65 and older were most likely to have left the workforce voluntarily. More than half of respondents reported that their work locations had more than a two-week supply of most PPE items, although about 10% did not know supply levels. Dental hygienists working in settings with lower supplies of PPE were more concerned with COVID-19 transmission risk to themselves or to patients.Conclusion: COVID-19 has led to a reduction in the dental hygienist workforce that is likely to persist until the pandemic passes.The dental hygienist labor market has tightened and employers may continue to experience difficulties in filling vacant dental hygienist positions until the pandemic subsides.

In order to determine the cis-acting sequences necessary for RNA replication, encapsidation, and budding and to approximate the minimal size of RNA that can be packaged into infectious particles, we constructed a series of internal deletions in the DI cDNA to generate plasmids that could be transcribed to yield RNAs which ranged in size from 2209 nucleotides down to 102 nucleotides. All the deletion plasmids retained at least 36 nucleotides from the 5-terminus and 51 nucleotides from the 3-terminus of the DI genome. In cells expressing the five VSV proteins, the deleted DI RNAs were examined for their ability to be encapsidated, to replicate, and to bud to produce infectious DI particles. An RNA as small as 191 nucleotides, which contained 46 nucleotides from the 5-end and 145 nucleotides from the 3-end of the DI genome was encapsidated, replicated, and budded at least as efficiently as the full-length wild-type DI RNA. In contrast, a 102-nucleotide RNA that contained only the 51 nucleotides from the 5-end of the DI RNA and its perfect 51-nucleotide complement at the 3-end replicated poorly and failed to bud infectious DI particles. However, an RNA with an insertion of 1499-nucleotide stuffer sequences of non-VSV origin between the two 51-nucleotide complementary termini not only replicated but also budded infectious particles. These data show that the signals necessary for RNA encapsidation, replication, and packaging into infectious DI particles are contained within the 5-terminal 36 nucleotides and the 3-terminal 51 nucleotides of the DI RNA genome.

The aim of the study was to evaluate prevalence, characteristics, risk factors and impact on mortality of hospitalized patients with CAP according to the presence of ARF and SS on admission. METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational, prospective study of consecutive CAP patients admitted to three hospitals in Italy, Spain, and Scotland between 2008 and 2010. Three groups of patients were identified: those with neither ARF nor SS (Group A), those with only ARF (Group B) and those with both ARF and SS (Group C) on admission. RESULTS: Among the 2,145 patients enrolled, 45% belonged to Group A, 36% to Group B and 20% to Group C. Patients in Group C were more severe than patients in Group B. Isolated ARF was correlated with age (p < 0.001), COPD (p < 0.001) and multilobar infiltrates (p < 0.001). The contemporary occurrence of ARF and SS was associated with age (p = 0.002), residency in nursing home (p = 0.007), COPD (p < 0.001), multilobar involvement (p < 0.001) and renal disease (p < 0.001). 4.2% of patients in Group A died, 9.3% in Group B and 26% in Group C, p < 0.001.

Therefore, fecal sample testing with real-time RT-PCR is highly recommended as a routine test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, varying rates of detection in fecal sample have been reported. The aim of this study was to provide insights into the detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients fecal sample by using four real-time RT-PCR kits and two pretreatment methods (inactive and non-inactive). RESULTS: The detection rate of Trizol pretreatment group was slightly higher than that of Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) groups, showing that pretreatment and inactivation by Trizol had no influence to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test (NAT) results. 39.29% detection rate in fecal sample by DAAN was obtained, while Bio-germ was 40.48%, Sansure 34.52%, and GeneoDx 33.33%. The former three kits had no significant difference. The DAAN kit detection rates of ORF1ab and N gene were nearly equal and Ct value distribution was more scattered, while the Bio-germ kit distribution was more clustered. The positive rate of SARS-COV-2 in fecal samples correlated with the severity of the disease, specifically, severe cases were less likely to be identified than asymptomatic infection in the DAAN group (adjusted OR 0.05, 95%CI = 0.00 ~ 0.91).

Viral and host factors involved in the development of diffuse alveolar damage have been extensively studied in influenza virus infection. Influenza is a self-limited upper respiratory tract infection that causes acute and severe systemic symptoms and its spread to the lungs is limited by CD4(+) T-cell responses. A vicious cycle of CCL2- and CXCL2-mediated inflammatory monocyte and neutrophil infiltration and activation and resultant massive production of effector molecules including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, nitric oxide, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand are involved in the pathogenesis of progressive tissue injury. SARS-CoV-2 directly infects alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages and induces foci of pulmonary lesions even in asymptomatic individuals. Mechanisms of tissue injury in SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia share some aspects with influenza virus infection, but IL-1 seems to play more important roles along with CCL2 and impaired type I interferon signaling might be associated with delayed virus clearance and disease severity. Further, data indicate that preexisting memory CD8(+) T cells may play important roles in limiting viral spread in the lungs and prevent progression from mild to severe or critical pneumonia.

Methods: All COVID-19 admissions to one acute London National Health Service Foundation trust were reviewed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to 1 May 2020 to establish whether there were any pregnant or immediately post-partum admissions. Data were extracted from hospital electronic records and anonymised. Any patients admitted to adult intensive care unit had their case notes reviewed in detail and comparison made to a local risk-assessment guideline identifying patients at-risk of thromboembolic events or cytokine storms. Local hospital guidelines were followed. Patients admitted to adult intensive care unit gave written consent. Results: A total of 24 pregnant or immediately post-partum patients with COVID-19 were admitted. Three patients required long adult intensive care unit admissions for severe single-organ respiratory failure after emergency C-sections. Two of these patients required proning (three times and eight times, respectively). All were considered medium risk for thromboembolic events but had rising D-dimers following adult intensive care unit admission, resulting in increased dosing of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis throughout their admission. All were considered low risk for a cytokine storm, and none had any significant cardiovascular or renal involvement. One patient developed a super-imposed fungal lung infection.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations averted nationwide by US states CICT programs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytical model study used combined data from US CICT programs (eg, proportion of cases interviewed, contacts notified or monitored, and days to case and contact notification) with incidence data to model outcomes of CICT over a 60-day period (November 25, 2020, to January 23, 2021). The study estimated a range of outcomes by varying assumed compliance with isolation and quarantine recommendations. Fifty-nine state and territorial health departments that received federal funding supporting COVID-19 pandemic response activities were eligible for inclusion. Data analysis was performed from July to September 2021. EXPOSURE: Public health case investigation and contact tracing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were numbers of cases and hospitalizations averted and the percentage of cases averted among cases not prevented by vaccination and other nonpharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS: In total, 22 states and 1 territory reported all measures necessary for the analysis. These 23 jurisdictions covered 42.5% of the US population (approximately 140 million persons), spanned all 4 US Census regions, and reported data that reflected all 59 federally funded CICT programs. This study estimated that 1.11 million cases and 27 231 hospitalizations were averted by CICT programs under a scenario where 80% of interviewed cases and monitored contacts and 30% of notified contacts fully complied with isolation and quarantine guidance, eliminating their contributions to future transmission. As many as 1.36 million cases and 33 527 hospitalizations could have been prevented if all interviewed cases and monitored contacts had entered into and fully complied with isolation and quarantine guidelines upon being interviewed or notified. Across both scenarios and all jurisdictions, CICT averted an estimated median of 21.2% (range, 1.3%-65.8%) of the cases not prevented by vaccination and other nonpharmaceutical interventions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that CICT programs likely had a substantial role in curtailing the pandemic in most jurisdictions during the 2020 to 2021 winter peak. Differences in outcomes across jurisdictions indicate an opportunity to further improve CICT effectiveness.

In September 2021, the infection by SARS-CoV-2 had already been responsible for the death of more than 4 million people worldwide. Recently, we and other groups discovered that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces ER-stress and activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. The degradation of misfolded/unfolded proteins is an essential element of proteostasis and occurs mainly in lysosomes or proteasomes. The N-terminal arginylation of proteins is characterized as an inducer of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by the N-end rule pathway. Here we present, for the first time, data on the role of arginylation during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We studied the modulation of protein arginylation in Vero CCL-81 and Calu-3 cells infected after 2h, 6h, 12h, 24h, and 48h. A reanalysis of in vivo and in vitro public omics data combined with immunoblotting was performed to measure the levels of ATE1 and arginylated proteins. This regulation is seen specifically during infections by coronaviruses. We demonstrate that during SARS-CoV-2 infection there is an increase in the expression of the ATE1 enzyme associated with regulated levels of specific arginylated proteins. On the other hand, infected macrophages showed no ATE1 regulation. An important finding revealed that modulation of the N-end rule pathway differs between different types of infected cells. We also confirmed the potential of tannic acid to reduce viral load, and furthermore, to modulate ATE1 levels during infection. In addition, the arginylation inhibitor merbromin (MER) is also capable of both reducing viral load and reducing ATE1 levels. Taken together, these data show the importance of arginylation during the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection and open the door for future studies that may unravel the role of ATE1 and its inhibitors in pathogen infection.","output":"Protein arginylation is regulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Access to publicly funded bariatric surgery is limited, potential candidates face lengthy waits, and no universally accepted prioritization criteria exist. We examined patients' perspectives regarding prioritization for surgery. METHODS We surveyed consecutively recruited patients awaiting bariatric surgery about 9 hypothetical scenarios describing patients waiting for surgery. Respondents were asked to rank the priority of these hypothetical patients on the wait list relative to their own. Scenarios examined variations in age, clinical severity, functional impairment, social dependence and socioeconomic status. Willingness to pay for faster access was assessed using a 5-point ordinal scale and analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS The 99 respondents had mean age of 44.7  9.9 years, 76% were women, and the mean body mass index was 47.3  SD 7.6. The mean wait for surgery was 34.4  9.4 months. Respondents assigned similar priority to hypothetical patients with characteristics identical to theirs (p = 0.22) and higher priority (greater urgency) to those exhibiting greater clinical severity (p < 0.001) and functional impairment (p = 0.003). Lower priority was assigned to patients at the extremes of age (p = 0.006), on social assistance (p < 0.001) and of high socioeconomic status (p < 0.001). Most (85%) respondents disagreed with payment to expedite access, although participants earning more than $80 000/year were less likely to disagree. CONCLUSION Most patients waiting for bariatric surgery consider greater clinical severity and functional impairments related to obesity to be important prioritization indicators and disagreed with paying for faster access.

However, little is known of whether other non-glucose molecules, besides vitamin C, interfere with glucometry. Therefore, we sought to determine whether other antioxidants might behave like vitamin C in causing falsely elevated blood glucose levels, potentially exposing patients to glycemic mismanagement by being administered harmful doses of glucose-lowering drugs. To determine whether various antioxidants can be detected by seven commercial glucose meters, human blood samples were spiked with various antioxidants ex vivo and their effect on the glucose results were assessed by Parkes error grid analysis. Several of the glucose meters demonstrated a positive bias in the glucose measurement of blood samples spiked with vitamin C, N-acetylcysteine, and glutathione. With the most interference-sensitive glucose meter, non-blood solutions of 1 mmol/L N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, cysteine, vitamin C, dihydrolipoate, and dithiothreitol mimicked the results seen on that glucose meter for 0.7, 1.0, 1.2, 2.6, 3.7 and 5.5 mmol/L glucose solutions, respectively. Glucose meter users should be alerted that some of these devices might produce spurious glucose results not only in patients on vitamin C therapy but also in those being administered other antioxidants.

METHODS: We performed systematic literature search in PubMed and Embase to identify articles reporting baseline imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. The quality of the articles was assessed using NIH quality assessment tool for case series studies. The pooled prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of imaging findings were calculated. RESULTS: Fifty-six studies (6007 patients, age, 2.1C70 years, 2887 females, 5762 CT, 396 radiographs,) were included. The mean interval between onset of symptoms and CT acquisition was 1C8 days. On CT, the pooled prevalence of ground glass opacities (GGO), GGO plus consolidation, and consolidation only was 66.9% (95% CI 60.8C72.4%), 44.9% (38.7C51.3%), and 32.1 (23.6C41.9%) respectively. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of GGO on CT was 73% (71%C80%) and 61% (41%C78%), respectively. For GGO plus consolidation and consolidation only, the pooled sensitivities/ specificities were 58% (48%C68%)/ 58% (41%C73%) and 49% (20%C78%)/ 56% (30%C78%), respectively.

Apoptosis is an effective means to sacrifice virus-infected host cells and therefore restrict the spread of pathogens. However, the underlying mechanisms of this process are still poorly understood.

MAVS specifically activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) but not other MAP kinases. Jnk2?/? cells, but not Jnk1?/? cells, are unable to initiate virus-induced apoptosis and SeV further fails to trigger apoptosis in MAPK kinase 7 (MKK7) knockout (Mkk7?/?) cells. Mechanistically, MAVS recruits MKK7 onto mitochondria via its 3D domain, which subsequently phosphorylates JNK2 and thus activates the apoptosis pathway. Consistently, Jnk2?/? mice, but not Jnk1?/? mice, display marked inflammatory injury in lung and liver after viral challenge. Collectively, we have identified a novel signaling pathway, involving MAVS-MKK7-JNK2, which mediates virus-induced apoptosis and highlights the indispensable role of mitochondrial outer membrane in host defenses.","output":"MAVS-MKK7-JNK2 Defines a Novel Apoptotic Signaling Pathway during Viral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chaos game representation (CGR), a milestone in graphical bioinformatics, has become a powerful tool regarding alignment-free sequence comparison and feature encoding for machine learning.

The difficulties performing the technique have prevented it from being widely accepted. This study shows how the authors overcame the difficulties by using the SILS port and proved it to be a safe and useful procedure for the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). METHODS The same surgeon operated on all the patients using the three-port technique (n = 13) and SITS (n = 27) under the same procedural and management policy. The two groups were retrospectively compared in terms of operation time, postoperative complications, hospital stay, pain score, residual paresthesia, satisfaction regarding the wound scar, and surgical material cost. RESULTS The mean age, sex ratio, and previous pneumothorax episodes were similar between the two groups. The uniport and three-port groups did not differ statistically in terms of mean operation time (74.6  22.8 vs 72.4  20.2 min; p = 0.77), hospital stay (2.3  0.7 vs 2.5  0.8 days; p = 0.72), visual analog pain scale (on the day of surgery: 4.1  1.7 vs 4.8  2.2, p = 0.26; on day 1: 3.2  1.4 vs 2.8  1.4, p = 0.33; on day 2: 2.7  1.0 vs 2.6  1.1, p = 0.61), or total surgical material cost (US$1,810  $320 vs $1,741  $329; p = 0.58).

Currently, the literature on CMI is sparse with no standardized physical examination tests used in the diagnosis of this type of injury. PURPOSE To determine the diagnostic accuracy of various physical examination tests in the diagnosis of CMI. STUDY DESIGN Cohort study (Diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3. METHODS A consecutive series of patients evaluated by the senior author with symptoms consistent with CMI were included. Four physical examination tests were routinely performed in these patients by the senior author and were noted in each patient's chart as positive or negative: (1) pain with resisted cross-body sit-up in figure-of-4 position, (2) pain with straight-leg sit-up, (3) pain with resisted hip flexion in external rotation (external rotation Stinchfield test), and (4) the presence of an adductor contracture. CMI was independently diagnosed by a reference standard (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). All MRI scans were read by a musculoskeletal fellowship-trained radiologist. The sensitivity and specificity of each physical examination test alone and in combination were calculated based on this reference standard. RESULTS A total of 81 patients were included in this study. MRI was positive for a CMI in 39 patients (48%) overall. Both the cross-body sit-up test and the presence of an adductor contracture were found to have a sensitivity of 100% (specificity, 3% for both). The external rotation Stinchfield test was found to have the highest specificity of 60% (sensitivity, 15%). The sensitivity of all 4 physical examination tests in combination was found to be 100% (specificity, 0%). CONCLUSION Certain physical examination maneuvers can be used to assist in the diagnosis of a CMI.

The neck ultrasound showed an enlarged pseudonodular thyroid gland with a heterogenous parenchyma and diffuse hypervascularity bilaterally (right lobe, 7.4 x 2.8 x 3.0 cm; left lobe, 8.4 x 3.2 x 3.6 cm; isthmus, 9 mm). A month later, repeat labs showed TSH 1.56 mIU/L, TT3 85 ng/dL, fT4 0.74 ng/dL, and Tg 231.2 ng/mL. She was subsequently referred to Endocrine Clinic 4 months after her initial presentation. She had a persistent diffuse painless goiter, minimally decreased in size, and she remained clinically euthyroid. Labs included a TSH 1.75 mIU/L and fT4 0.78 ng/dL. Conclusion: There are known associations of SAT with chronic TNF-i therapy in patients with psoriasis. Viral infections are an identified cause, but other triggers in chronic TNF-i therapy may exist. Serum Tg is elevated during SAT, but in this case Tg elevation was very significant. Although normal serum Tg levels are established in healthy individuals, there are no known reference values during SAT. Tg levels should not be used in acute illness period to evaluate illness severity or the resolution of SAT.","output":"Subacute Thyroiditis With Very Elevated Thyroglobulin Level in a Patient on Chronic Adalimumab Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinically, bone destruction caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis was serious especially in patients with vitamin D (VD) deficiency. However, the role of VD in M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction remains clear. In this context, we investigate the role of VD and vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction. First, we infected RAW264.7 and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) with Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (M. bovis BCG) in vitro. Then, we activated VDR through VD administration. TRAP and FAK staining, bone resorption assays, immunofluorescence staining, qPCR, and western blot were carried out. In vivo, the M. tuberculosis-induced osteolytic model on the murine skull was established and the CT and histological analyses were performed. We found that VDR and TRAP were upregulated in bone tuberculosis tissue and proved that M. tuberculosis infection promoted osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 and BMMs. VD could inhibit osteoclasts differentiation, fusion, and bone resorption dose-dependently. However, when VDR was knocked down, the inhibitory effect of VD on osteoclasts disappeared. In mechanism, activation of VDR inhibits the phosphorylation of I&#954;B &#945;, thereby inhibiting NF&#954;B signaling pathway and alleviating osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, in the skull osteolysis model, VD administration reduced osteolysis, but not in VDR-/- mice. Our study, for the first time, demonstrates that activation of VDR by VD administration inhibits M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction. Our results reveal that VD and VDR are potential therapeutic targets for M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction, and are of great clinical significance for the development of new therapeutic strategies.","output":"Vitamin D receptor activated by vitamin D administration alleviates Mycobacterium tuberculosis-induced bone destruction by inhibiting NFB-mediated aberrant osteoclastogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Measuring the prevalence of active SARS-CoV-2 infections is difficult because tests are conducted on a small and non-random segment of the population.

This sub-population may provide valuable evidence on prevalence in the general population. We estimate upper and lower bounds on the prevalence of the virus in the general population and the population of non-COVID hospital patients under weak assumptions on who gets tested, using Indiana data on hospital inpatient records linked to SARS-CoV-2 virological tests.

We provide and test conditions under which this non-COVID hospitalization bound is valid for the general population.

In addition, women themselves may have postponed or cancelled their medical monitoring for organisational reasons, for fear of contracting the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) or for other reasons of their own. Delayed care can have deleterious consequences for both the mother and the child. Our objective was therefore to study the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the first lockdown in France on voluntary changes by pregnant women in the medical monitoring of their pregnancy and the associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2020 using a web-questionnaire completed by 500 adult (>18 years old) pregnant women during the first French lockdown (March-May 2020). A robust variance Poisson regression model was used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs). Results: Almost one women of five (23.4%) reported having voluntarily postponed or foregone at least one consultation or pregnancy check-up during the lockdown. Women who were professionally inactive (aPR=1.98, CI95%[1.24-3.16]), who had experienced serious disputes or violence during the lockdown (1.47, [1.00-2.16]), who felt they received little or no support (1.71, [1.07-2.71]), and those who changed health professionals during the lockdown (1.57, [1.04-2.36]) were all more likely to have voluntarily changed their pregnancy monitoring. Higher level of worry about the pandemic was associated with a lower probability of voluntarily changing pregnancy monitoring (0.66, [0.46 -0.96]).

However, to what extent it may modify varying types of plasmalemmal ionic currents remains largely uncertain. In this study, we investigate the effects of SM-102 on ionic currents either in two types of endocrine cells (e.g., rat pituitary tumor (GH(3)) cells and mouse Leydig tumor (MA-10) cells) or in microglial (BV2) cells. Hyperpolarization-activated K(+) currents in these cells bathed in high-K(+), Ca(2+)-free extracellular solution were examined to assess the effects of SM-102 on the amplitude and hysteresis of the erg-mediated K(+) current (I(K(erg))). The SM-102 addition was effective at blocking I(K(erg)) in a concentration-dependent fashion with a half-maximal concentration (IC(50)) of 108 M, a value which is similar to the K(D) value (i.e., 134 M) required for its accentuation of deactivation time constant of the current. The hysteretic strength of I(K(erg)) in response to the long-lasting isosceles-triangular ramp pulse was effectively decreased in the presence of SM-102. Cell exposure to TurboFectin(TM) 8.0 (0.1%, v/v), a transfection reagent, was able to inhibit hyperpolarization-activated I(K(erg)) effectively with an increase in the deactivation time course of the current. Additionally, in GH(3) cells dialyzed with spermine (30 M), the I(K(erg)) amplitude progressively decreased; moreover, a further bath application of SM-102 (100 M) or TurboFectin (0.1%) diminished the current magnitude further. In MA-10 Leydig cells, the I(K(erg)) was also blocked by the presence of SM-102 or TurboFectin. The IC(50) value for SM-102-induced inhibition of I(K(erg)) in MA-10 cells was 98 M. In BV2 microglial cells, the amplitude of the inwardly rectifying K(+) current was inhibited by SM-102. Taken together, the presence of SM-102 concentration-dependently inhibited I(K(erg)) in endocrine cells (e.g., GH(3) or MA-10 cells), and such action may contribute to their functional activities, assuming that similar in vivo findings exist.","output":"Effective Perturbations on the Amplitude and Hysteresis of Erg-Mediated Potassium Current Caused by 1-Octylnonyl 8-[(2-hydroxyethyl)[6-oxo-6(undecyloxy)hexyl]amino]-octanoate (SM-102), a Cationic Lipid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The initial mechanism of COVID-19 is the binding of the virus to ACE2. Since the heart and the vessels also express ACE2, they both could become targets of the virus. However, cardiac performance of patients in ICU and general ward may be different, requested individualized treatment. The aim of this study is to explore the global and segmental myocardial performance of the severe and mild COVID-19 patients. Methods: : 45 patients, including 25 mild and 20 severe patients in intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 infection were included in this study. The clinical history, laboratory test and standard and strain echocardiography were performed at admission. Of them, 13 severe patients received serial echocardiography, especially, 10 patients received echocardiographic examinations more than 7 times. Results: : 1. Both mild and severe COVID-19 infected patients showed reduced cardiac diastolic function;2. Severe patients in ICU exhibited exacerbated right ventricular systolic function;3. Both mild and severe patients with COVID-19 showed impaired left ventricular strain, worse strain in severe patient. 4. The apical longitudinal strain of mild patients was higher than basal and middle segment. No difference among apical, middle and basal segments in severe patients. 5. There was a negative correlation between LV GLS and log TnT-hs, as well as NT-pro BNP. 6. The EF value and strain of left atrium of mild and severe patients decreased;7. LV GLS, LV GCS and LA GLS area under the ROC curve to predict the disease severity were 0.698, 0.758 and 0.782 respectively. 8. In the follow-up of severe patients, left atrial and ventricular strain showed an increased trend. Conclusions: : These findings suggested that left ventricular performance was subclinically impaired during COVID-9 infection irrespective of infection severity and the strain of LV and LA may predict the disease severity. The cardiac function had an increasing trend for severe patients treated in ICU.","output":"Different cardiac perfoemance in patients with COVID-19 in ICU and general ward by standard and strain echocardiography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES This research scrutinizes the important factors influencing the satisfaction of citizens on their governments' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic based on an open-sourced survey of 14 countries.

We examine the Kendall correlation of variables in the 14 countries and use the wild bootstrap method for regression models to find important regressors. RESULTS Our results show that people pay stronger attention on the results of governments' battle against COVID-19 (number of confirmed cases and deaths per million population) rather than what policies they initiate. Health policy and economic support do influence the approval of any national response to COVID-19.

Italy has the highest rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the highest number of deaths, and the highest mortality rate among large countries. Worldwide, a more severe course of COVID-19 is associated with older age, comorbidities, and male sex. Hence, we searched for possible genetic components of the peculiar severity of COVID-19 among Italians, by looking at expression levels and variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, which are crucial for viral infection. Methods: Exome and SNP array data from a large Italian cohort representative of the country's population were used to compare the burden of rare variants and the frequency of polymorphisms with European and East Asian populations. Moreover, we looked into gene expression databases to check for sex-unbalanced expression. Results: While we found no significant evidence that ACE2 is associated with disease severity/sex bias in the Italian population, TMPRSS2 levels and genetic variants proved to be possible candidate disease modulators, contributing to the observed epidemiological data among Italian patients.

Seropositivity was defined as titers >1:10, low titers as <1:100 and high titers as >1:100. We assessed cognitive status annually up to three years after stroke with the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status - modified (TICS-m) and used crude and adjusted linear mixed models to estimate the impact of NMDAR1-abs exposure on TICS-m over time. Results: Data on NMDAR1-abs (median day of sampling=4[IQR=2-5]) were available in 583 of 621 PROSCIS-B patients (39% female; median NIHSS=2[IQR=1-4]; median MMSE=28[IQR:26-30]; median mRS=2[IQR=1-3]) of whom 76(13%) were seropositive (IgM:n=48/IgA:n=43/IgG:n=2).

Due to the absence of effective remedial agents and the shortage of immunizations against the virus, population vulnerability increases. In the current situation, as there are no vaccines available; therefore, social distancing is thought to be an adequate precaution (norm) against the spread of the pandemic virus. The risks of virus spread can be minimized by avoiding physical contact among people. The purpose of this work is, therefore, to provide a deep learning platform for social distance tracking using an overhead perspective. The framework uses the YOLOv3 object recognition paradigm to identify humans in video sequences. The transfer learning methodology is also implemented to increase the accuracy of the model. In this way, the detection algorithm uses a pre-trained algorithm that is connected to an extra trained layer using an overhead human data set. The detection model identifies peoples using detected bounding box information. Using the Euclidean distance, the detected bounding box centroid's pairwise distances of people are determined. To estimate social distance violations between people, we used an approximation of physical distance to pixel and set a threshold. A violation threshold is established to evaluate whether or not the distance value breaches the minimum social distance threshold. In addition, a tracking algorithm is used to detect individuals in video sequences such that the person who violates/crosses the social distance threshold is also being tracked. Experiments are carried out on different video sequences to test the efficiency of the model. Findings indicate that the developed framework successfully distinguishes individuals who walk too near and breaches/violates social distances; also, the transfer learning approach boosts the overall efficiency of the model. The accuracy of 92% and 98% achieved by the detection model without and with transfer learning, respectively. The tracking accuracy of the model is 95%.","output":"A Deep Learning-Based Social Distance Monitoring framework for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) can occur after infection with Hantavirus which can occur by inhaling aerosolized rodent urine, feces, and saliva contaminated with the virus. It presents with the rapid development of pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and cardiogenic shock with the hallmark being microvascular leakage. We report a patient with a history of alcohol abuse and recent exposure to mice and sick kittens who presented with cough with sputum production, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and new-onset lower extremity edema. Imaging revealed bilateral infiltrates more common on the left with an unremarkable echocardiogram. Testing for COVID-19, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), influenza, bacterial pneumonia including tuberculosis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, Blastomyces, and Coccidiodes was negative. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and were negative for acid-fast bacilli and Nocardia cultures. He was further tested for Hantavirus, Q fever, leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis, and empiric treatment with doxycycline initiated. His Hantavirus IgM antibody came back positive. Human Hantavirus infection occurs after inhalation of infected rodent excreta; fortunately, human-to-human transmission has not been documented. HCPS most commonly occurs due to the Sin Nombre virus (SNV), has a case fatality rate of 50%, and is a notifiable disease in the United States. It has 3 distinct phases, prodromal, cardiopulmonary, and convalescent/recovery. The cardiopulmonary phase occurs from increased permeability of pulmonary capillaries and in severe cases can progress to cardiogenic shock. Diagnosis is based on the presence of IgM and IgG Hantavirus antibodies. Treatment is mainly supportive; however, patients are usually treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics while workup is underway. In animal models, ribavirin and favipiravir are only effective when administered in the prodromal phase. If suspicion of Hantavirus infection exists, early mobilization to the intensive care unit for treatment is recommended. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been suggested to improve outcomes in severe HCPS with refractory shock.","output":"Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome and Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage in the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected millions of citizens worldwide and claimed many lives.

Syndromic surveillance application for public health purposes has changed over time and reflects a dynamic evolution from the collection, interpretation of data with dissemination of data to those who need to act, to a more holistic approach that incorporates response as a core component of the surveillance system. Recent infectious disease threats, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (H5N1) and pandemic influenza (H1N1), have all highlighted the need for countries to be rapidly aware of the spread of infectious diseases within a region and across the globe. The International Health Regulations (IHR) obligation to report public health emergencies of international concern has raised the importance of early outbreak detection and response. The emphasis in syndromic surveillance is changing from automated, early alert and detection, to situational awareness and response. Published literature on syndromic surveillance reflects the changing nature of public health threats and responses. Syndromic surveillance has demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt to rapidly shifting public health needs. This adaptability makes it a highly relevant public health tool.","output":"The remarkable adaptability of syndromic surveillance to meet public health needs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyzes the extent to which mobility in Canada declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, using publicly released mobility data from Google first rep","output":"Using Google Data to Understand Canadian Movement Reductions During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Promoting brain health depends on sustaining healthy behaviors across the lifespan. Yet, public adoption of lifestyle behaviors and knowledge of cognitive decline (CD) prevention remains poor. Our multidisciplinary team developed My Healthy Brain (MHB) to promote a healthy lifestyle (e.g. diet, exercise, alcohol, sleep) and build cognitive reserve (e.g. memory compensatory strategies). Our objective was to demonstrate early proof-of-concept for MHB by exploring the feasibility, acceptability, and improvement in primary lifestyle outcomes as well as secondary outcomes of self-determination and subjective wellbeing. MATERIALS AND METHODS Older adults with subjective (self-report only) or objective (confirmed by cognitive testing) CD, referred by neurologists to modify lifestyle risk factors (e.g. sedentary), participated in a non-randomized open pilot of MHB (N = 24). Participants completed the 8-week MHB group (90 min each) and pre-post outcome measures. RESULTS MHB met all a-priori set benchmarks, including good feasibility of recruitment (71% of patients screened) and enrollment (75% completed baseline), and good acceptability of treatment (75% completed 6 of 8 sessions and post-testing). Program satisfaction was excellent (100% of participants) and no adverse events were reported. We also observed improvements in primary lifestyle outcomes as well as secondary outcomes of self-determination and subjective well-being.

Our study tested the effectiveness of a home-based pain relief program that utilized virtual reality and behavioral health for treating acute and chronic pain. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort Study. METHODS: Due to the remote nature of the pain clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with work-related injuries were considered for inclusion in a 90-day Harvard MedTech Vx Pain Relief Program, which consisted of home-based virtual reality therapy (VRT) and tailored behavioral therapy that was conducted through phone consultations. Both the VRT and behavioral therapy focused on the specific workplace injury and centered around setting three personal goals for each patient that were considered meaningful to them. The progress towards achieving these goals was then tracked. The primary outcome of the retrospective analysis was pain scores after completion of home-based VRT. Secondary outcomes included: change in opioid therapy (opioid consumption), psychological awareness/perception of pain, level of immersion, and overall improvement/achievement in patient goals. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients (16 male and 20 female) with acute and chronic pain secondary to workplace injuries were included; these injuries severely limited their activities of daily living and reduced their quality of life. During the course of VRT and after completion of the 90-day program, patients experienced a substantial immediate and legacy pain relief. Specifically, patients reported an average 40% reduction in pain while utilizing the program and an additional 2.8 h of continued pain relief at the conclusion of 90 days. Further, 69% of patients also reported either a decrease in opioid use or complete cessation after VRT. The majority of patients also reported reduced depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: The Harvard MedTech Vx Therapy appears to be an effective tool in the treatment of pain and the psycho-social issues associated with pain. This translates into a greater degree of pain resiliency and an overall improvement in general wellness and improved workplace functionality.","output":"Combining Virtual Reality and Behavioral Health to Promote Pain Resiliency: Analysis of a Novel BioPsychoSocial Modality for Solving Pain in the Workplace"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People perceive cute expressions about situations or events positively or negatively. However, the conditions for how cute expression messaging would be received are less clear. In three studies, we investigated the influences of natural disaster cute expression messaging on audiences to determine the feelings the messaging engendered and perceptions of the content creator's humanity. Study 1 examined cute expression messaging effects of a natural flood disaster. Studies 2 and 3 examined cute expression messaging of the Coronavirus Disease 2019. Study 1 showed that audiences perceived someone using cute expressions to describe a natural disaster as having a lack of humanity. Studies 2 and 3 indicated that cute expressions about the pandemic caused audiences to feel disgusted, leading to a dehumanising perception towards the content creator. Moreover, Study 3 showed that dehumanising the author could further contribute to aggression. From these findings, we conclude that cute expression messaging to describe disasters could be aversive, disrupting perceptions of a shared sense of humanity, and risking aggression against the content creators.

METHODS: A retrospective, comparative analysis of initial chest CT manifestations between 63 pediatric patients infected with Delta variant in 2021 and 23 pediatric patients with COVID-19 in 2020 was conducted. Corresponding imaging features were analyzed. In addition, the changing trend in imaging features of COVID-19 Delta-variant cases were explored by evaluating the initial and follow-up CT scans. RESULTS: Among 63 children with Delta-variant COVID-19 in 2021, 34 (53.9%) showed positive chest CT presentation; and their CT score (1.10  1.41) was significantly lower than that in 2020 (2.56  3.5) (P = 0.0073). Lesion distribution: lung lesions of Delta cases appear mainly in the lower lungs on both sides. Most children had single lobe involvement (18 cases, 52.9%), 14 (41.2%) in the right lung alone, and 14 (41.2%) in both lungs. A majority of Delta cases displayed initially ground glass (23 cases, 67.6%) and nodular shadows (13 cases, 38.2%) in the first CT scan, with few extrapulmonary manifestations. The 34 children with abnormal chest CT for the first time have a total of 92 chest CT examinations. These children showed a statistically significant difference between the 0C3 day group and the 4C7 day group (P = 0.0392) and a significant difference between the 4C7 day group and the more than 8 days group (P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: The early manifestations of COVID-19 in children with abnormal imaging are mostly small subpleural nodular ground glass opacity. The changes on the Delta-variant COVID-19 chest CT were milder than the original strain. The lesions reached a peak on CT in 4C7 days and quickly improved and absorbed after a week.

Methods: : We searched PubMed, MEDLINE and CNKI databases, preprint servers, clinical trial registries and supplementary sources for Chinese- or English-language randomised trials or non-randomised studies with comparator groups, which tested the constituents of 3M3F in the treatment of COVID-19 up to September 2020. Primary outcome was change in disease severity. Secondary outcomes included various symptoms. Meta-analysis (using generic inverse variance random effects model) was performed when there were two or more studies reporting on the same symptom. Results: : Of 607 articles identified, thirteen primary studies (six RCTs and seven retrospective non-randomised comparative studies) with 1467 participants met our final inclusion criteria. Studies were small and had significant methodological limitations, most notably potential bias in assessment of outcomes. No study convincingly demonstrated a statistically significant impact on change in disease severity. Eight studies reported sufficiently similar secondary outcomes to be included in a meta-analysis. Some statistically significant impacts on symptoms, chest CT manifestations, laboratory variables and length of stay were demonstrated, but such findings were sparse and many remain unreplicated. Conclusions: : These findings neither support nor refute the claim that 3M3F alters the severity of COVID-19 or alleviates symptoms.

Methods Data were gathered in 2016 and again in 2020, through the Council of Academic Family Medicine's (CAFM) Educational Research Alliance (CERA) survey of family medicine clerkship directors. Clerkship directors answered questions concerning number of students requiring placement, number of precepting sites used, frequency of negative comments about family medicine as a specialty, and about opportunities for students to experience comprehensive care, patient-centered care, and document in electronic health records. Results The number of students who annually required placement at family medicine preceptor sites increased slightly from 2016 to 2020, but the number of sites utilized per family medicine department did not. There were no changes in the percentage of sites having Patient-Centered Medical Home or similar recognition or providing comprehensive care with or without obstetrics. However, more students were allowed to enter data and write patient encounter notes in 2020 than in 2016. Conclusions Clerkship directors continue to struggle to find high-quality family medicine training sites for students. STFM's Preceptor Expansion Initiative has made strides to help students become active, productive members of care teams, to reduce the administrative burden of teaching, and to promote the precepting of multiple students at once.1 These efforts to incentivize precepting are ongoing, but won't be enough to compensate for the rapid growth in the number of students and the increasing demands on physicians for high-volume patient care.","output":"Changes in the Shortage and Quality of Family Medicine Clinical Training Sites."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in restrictions on gatherings of large crowds, the suspension of live sport events across the globe, and the relegation of topical televised sport to broadcasts of past events and competitions Consequently, there has been a shift in focus from the entertainment aspect of sport to the health and well-being aspects of sport As athletes, teams, and sport organizations have become subject to government legislation concerning physical distancing, self-isolation, and lockdowns, the resultant spare time has presented the opportunity for individual athletes and sport organizations to pursue an approach to social media that includes viral challenges, fundraising, and socializing online This paper provides a commentary on select high-profile athletes' and sport organizations' social media behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has adopted an altruistic tone","output":"The Social Media Response From Athletes and Sport Organizations to COVID-19: An Altruistic Tone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background We evaluated the clinical performance of an immunochromatographic (IC) IgM/IgG antibody assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and chest computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods We examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48 serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients. The presence of IgM/IgG antibody for SARS-CoV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test. Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission. Findings Of the139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8%, 48.0%, and 95.8% of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1-2 weeks, and >2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 3.3%, 8.0%, and 62.5%, respectively. Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1 generated a false-positive result for IgM. Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG. The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22/38) and 68.4% (26/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3% (55/74) and 82.4% (61/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively.

Important progress has recently been made concerning the molecular biology of TGEV. The research work of our group has been focused on two main aspects: genome structure and functional domains of the envelope proteins. TGEV genomic RNA is organised into seven regions. The sequence of six of them, i.e. the 3 most 8300 nucleotides, has been established from cDNA clones. Three genes encoding the structural proteins, the peplomer protein E2, the transmembrane protein E1 and the nucleoprotein, have been identified. Additional open reading frames allowed for the prediction of four non-structural polypeptides, the role of which remains to be discovered. The remaining part of the genome (estimated length 20 kb) is thought to encode the polymerase. Expression of TGEV genes involves the production of six subgenomic mRNAs, which together with the virion RNA, form a 3 terminal nested set. The peplomer glycoprotein E2 (220 kDa) is 1431 residues long and highly glycosylated. Several domains were identified, including a C-terminal anchoring region and at least four major antigenic sites, which cluster in the amino half part of the molecule. Two sites containing most of the critical neutralisation determinants are highly conserved among TGEV strains. The glycoprotein E1 (29kDa) is mostly embedded in the membrane and plays a crucial role in the virion architecture. However, a short N-terminal domain protruding out of the particle mediates complement-dependent neutralisation, and induces alpha interferon synthesis, likely through a direct interaction with the lymphocyte membrane.","output":"Molecular biology of transmissible gastroenteritis virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This parallel cohort study aimed to assess the dentoalveolar, skeletal, periodontal, and airway effects of tooth-borne (hyrax) and computer-guided miniscrew-supported rapid palatal expansion appliances. METHODS: Thirty-six subjects were randomly allocated into 2 groups. Eighteen subjects (mean age, 12.2 years; male-to-female ratio, 10:8) were assigned to receive treatment with the hyrax appliance (group A), and 18 subjects were treated with the computer-guided miniscrew-supported appliance (group B). The same type of expansion screw and expansion protocol was used in both groups. Linear and angular measurements of skeletal, dentoalveolar, periodontal, and nasal floor changes were performed on the pretreatment and posttreatment cone-beam computed tomography images (6-month follow-up). Descriptive statistics and the independent Student t test were used for the statistical analysis. Intraoperator reliability was evaluated using a 2 sample t test. The level of significance was P 0.05. RESULTS: Ten subjects were censured because posttreatment cone-beam computed tomography imaging was not performed because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. In the remaining 26 subjects, increases in linear measurements were observed in both groups. The transversal skeletal increase was greater and statistically significant in the group treated with the bone-borne expander (P 0.05). The dentoalveolar transverse diameters were greater in the tooth-supported expander group, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. The buccal inclination of the maxillary first molar was observed in the group with the tooth-borne expander, with a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. A slight reduction of buccal and palatal thicknesses at the level of the maxillary first molars was observed in both groups, smaller in the skeletal expander group, with a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups only on the right buccal cortical plate. The width of the nasal floor increased more in the group with skeletal expander with a statistically significant difference of 2 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Computer-guided miniscrew-supported maxillary expanders allowed a greater transversal increase of the nasal-maxillary skeletal structures by reducing the dentoalveolar side effects of the tooth-supported devices.","output":"Comparison of changes in skeletal, dentoalveolar, periodontal, and nasal structures after tooth-borne or bone-borne rapid maxillary expansion: A parallel cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammation is a key characteristic of kidney disease, but this immune response is two-faced. In the acute phase of kidney injury, there is an activation of the immune cells to fight against the insult, contributing to kidney repair and regeneration. However, in chronic kidney diseases (CKD), immune cells that infiltrate the kidney play a deleterious role, actively participating in disease progression, and contributing to nephron loss and fibrosis. Importantly, CKD is a chronic inflammatory disease. In early CKD stages, patients present sub-clinical inflammation, activation of immune circulating cells and therefore, anti-inflammatory strategies have been proposed as a common therapeutic target for renal diseases. Recent studies have highlighted the plasticity of immune cells and the complexity of their functions. Among immune cells, monocytes/macrophages play an important role in all steps of kidney injury. However, the phenotype characterization between human and mice immune cells showed different markers; therefore the extrapolation of experimental studies in mice could not reflect human renal diseases.

Next, the features from these two branches are fused together for a final periocular recognition. The proposed method is different from existing methods as it not only uses a shared CNN feature space to train these two tasks jointly, but it also fuses predicted soft biometric features with the periocular features in the training step to improve the overall periocular recognition performance.

The research objective is to design and create a Technology Enhanced Learning Analytics (TELA) dashboard for improving students motivation, engagement, and grades. The Design Science research strategy was followed to achieve the objectives of the research. Initially, a literature survey was conducted analyzing features and limitations in current Learning Analytic dashboards. Then, current Learning Analytic plugins for Moodle were studied to identify their drawbacks. Two surveys with 136 undergraduate students and interviews with 12 lecturers were conducted to determine required features of the TELA system. The system was designed as a Moodle Plugin. Finally, an evaluation of the system was done with third-year undergraduate students of the UCSC. The results showed that the TELA dashboard can improve students' motivation, engagement, and grades. As a result of the system, students could track their current progress and performance compared to the peers, which helps to improve their motivation to engage more in the course. Also, the increased engagement in the course enhances the students self-confidence since the student can see continuous improvement of his/her progress and performance which in turn improves the students grades. ?The Authors.","output":"Technology Enhanced Learning Analytics Dashboard in Higher Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the association between anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) and the risk of newly diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: We used 2003C2013 data derived from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct this nationwide, population-based. We identified AS patients newly diagnosed between 2005 to 2013 as the study group and applied age-sex matched (1:20) and propensity score-matched (PSM) (1:2) non-SLE individuals as controls. The association between APS and risk of incident SLE was determined by calculating hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Results: We identified 1,245 patients with APS as well as 24,900 age- and sex-matched non-APS controls and 727 APS patients as well as 1,454 PSM non-APS controls. We found that the risk for incident SLE in the APS group was 80.70 times higher than the non-APS group, and the association remained robust after PSM (HR, 28.55; 95% CI, 11.49C70.91). The increased risk for SLE in patients with APS mainly existed within 5 years after the diagnosis of APS. The sensitivity analyses found that the risk for SLE in patients with APS was consistent excluding patients with ITP/AIHA and using distinct definitions of SLE.

We characterize the mobility network before and during the pandemic and analyze its evolution and changes between January and July 2020. We then link the observed mobility changes to socioeconomic conditions, estimating a gravity model to assess the effect of socioeconomic conditions on mobility flows. We observe an overall reduction in mobility trends, but the overall connectivity between different areas of the city remains after the lockdown, reflecting the mobility network's resilience.

Past studies have indicated that mentoring programs can positively impact student soft skills development and employability. While undergraduate mentoring programs have mushroomed, research on undergraduate mentoring has not kept pace. This study used a mixed methods approach to examine the effectiveness of a public universitys initiative in mentoring new undergraduates. Using the College Student Mentoring Scale (CSMS), this study found that the universitys undergraduate mentoring initiative is moderately effective. The CSMS assessed four mentoring dimensions, namely academic subject knowledge support, degree and career support, psychological and emotional support as well as role modelling. The results of this study highlighted the mentoring functions that are considered as least effective so that informed and targeted efforts can be undertaken to enhance university freshman mentoring. Findings from this study suggest that a new dimension namely mentor-mentee compatibility, competencies and expectations could be added to the College Student Mentoring Scale (CSMS) to enhance concept operationalization.

However, its benefit or harm while treating COVID-19 is not fully studied. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to assess the rationality on the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. Methods Pubmed, Medline, Clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane library, and Preprint publisher were searched. In the qualitative synthesis, 41 and quantitative 40 studies were included using PRISMA guidelines. Assessment of heterogeneity was done using the I-squared (I 2 ) test and random/fixed-effect analysis was done to determine the odds/risk ratio. Results We found severely ill COVID-19 patients almost 5 (OR 4.78, 2.76-8.26) times higher odds of getting corticosteroids during their treatment. Similarly, the odds for corticosteroids in addition to standard of care (SOC) were approximately 4 (OR 4.09, 1.89-8.84) times higher among intensive care unit (ICU) patients than non-ICU ones. A higher mortality risk with corticosteroids receiving group compared with the SOC alone (RR 2.01, 1.12-3.63) was observed. Niether increased discharge rate (RR 0.79, 0.63-0.99) nor recovery/ improvement rate was shown among corticosteroids group (OR 0.24, 0.13-0.43). Approximately, the overall 4 days longer hospital stay was found among the treatment groups (MD 4.19, 2.57-5.81). For the negative conversion of reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), approximately 3 days (MD 2.42, 1.31-3.53) delay was observed with corticosteroids treatment cases. Conclusion Our study concludes that more severe and critically ill patients tend to get corticosteroids and the mortality risk increases with the use of corticosteroids.

The threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases exists as an imminent threat to human health. It is essential to implement adequate hygiene best practices to break the contagion chain and enhance society preparedness for such critical scenarios and understand the relevance of each disease transmission route. As the unconscious hand-face contact gesture constitutes a potential pathway of contagion, in this paper, the authors present a prototype system based on low-cost depth sensors able to monitor in real-time the attitude towards such a habit. The system records people's behavior to enhance their awareness by providing real-time warnings, providing for statistical reports for designing proper hygiene solutions, and better understanding the role of such route of contagion. A preliminary validation study measured an overall accuracy of 91%. A Cohen's Kappa equal to 0.876 supports rejecting the hypothesis that such accuracy is accidental. Low-cost body tracking technologies can effectively support monitoring compliance with hygiene best practices and training people in real-time. By collecting data and analyzing them with respect to people categories and contagion statistics, it could be possible to understand the importance of this contagion pathway and identify for which people category such a behavioral attitude constitutes a significant risk.","output":"A Body Tracking-Based Low-Cost Solution for Monitoring Workers' Hygiene Best Practices during Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and it is spreading very rapidly worldwide.

We found: 1, the SARS-CoV-2 strains analyzed could be divided into 3 clades with regional aggregation; 2, the non-SARS-CoV-2 common coronaviruses that infect humans or other organisms to cause respiratory syndrome and epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis could also be divided into 3 clades; 3, the hosts of the common coronaviruses closest to SARS-CoV-2 were Apodemus chevrieri (a rodent), Delphinapterus leucas (beluga whale), Hypsugo savii (bat) , Camelus bactrianus (camel) and Mustela vison (mink); and 4, the gene sequences of the receptor ACE2 from different hosts could also be divided into 3 clades.

In total, 298 college students were recruited to participate in this study. The results suggest that, for message framing, loss-framed (vs. gain-framed) messages lead to higher intentions to get vaccinated. Furthermore, compared with non-narrative messages, narrative messages are more persuasive in promoting vaccination behavior. However, the interaction effect between gainCloss message framing and narrative framing is not significant. Additionally, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived costs mediate the effect of narrative framing on behavioral intentions. In other words, compared with non-narrative messages, narrative messages lead to higher levels of perceived severity and perceived benefits, and a lower level of perceived costs, which in turn increase intentions to get vaccinated.

This phenomenon was also demonstrated for anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis inhibiting antibodies that we recently isolated from an actively infected Tuberculosis-sick donor.

Another antimalarial drug, mefloquine, which is not a 4-aminoquinoline like CQ/HCQ, has emerged as a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral in vitro and has also been previously repurposed for respiratory diseases. Here, we investigated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of action of mefloquine in cells relevant for the physiopathology of COVID-19, such as Calu-3 cells (that recapitulate type II pneumocytes) and monocytes. Molecular pathways modulated by mefloquine were assessed by differential expression analysis, and confirmed by biological assays. A PBPK model was developed to assess mefloquines optimal doses for achieving therapeutic concentrations. Mefloquine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3, with an EC(50) of 1.2 M and EC(90) of 5.3 M. It reduced SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in monocytes and prevented virus-induced enhancement of IL-6 and TNF-. Mefloquine reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry and synergized with Remdesivir. Mefloquines pharmacological parameters are consistent with its plasma exposure in humans and its tissue-to-plasma predicted coefficient points suggesting that mefloquine may accumulate in the lungs.

BACKGROUND Stenting vascular stenoses is safe and effective in adults and older children with CHD but is limited in smaller children. The design of the Valeo stent addresses these limitations but has not been extensively described. METHODS Bench testing was conducted to determine the maximum diameter of the stent, foreshortening, and side-cell diameter. A retrospective analysis of Valeo stents implanted between October, 2012 and October, 2014 was performed. Patient profile, pre-implant/post-implant catheterization data, and stent geometry were reviewed. RESULTS Bench testing: medium and large Valeo stents can be dilated up to 13 mm and 20 mm diameters, respectively. Side-cells are dilatable up to 12 mm. Valeo stents are of low profile - delivered through 6- or 7-Fr sheaths - and show minimal foreshortening. Retrospective analysis: a total of 81 stents were implanted in 61 patients with CHD. The median weight was 15.3 kg, and the median age was 58.9 months. Stents were implanted in the pulmonary artery, systemic vein, aorta, and pulmonary vein. Overall, mean vessel diameters increased from 4.1 to 7.7 mm (121.7%). There was effective mean gradient reduction: 3.7-0.5 mmHg (63%) in the venous systems, 28.2-12.5 mmHg (63.7%) in the pulmonary arteries, and 17.4-4 mmHg (77.1%) in the aorta. The mean stent foreshortening was 2.5%, and the mean recoil was 5.9%. Side-cells that crossed other vessels were dilated in four cases, and stents were re-mounted onto different-sized balloons in seven cases.

Molecular mechanism analysis reveals that AAS can activate RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway to increase the expression of type I interferons in vivo. AAS-mediated activation of RLR signaling pathway further promotes the maturation and proliferation of dendritic cells (DCs) and T helper cells (Ths), finally activating B cells to produce potent antibody responses.
