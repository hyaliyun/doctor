Initially, the system extracts the feature descriptors from the radiographs of both healthy and COVID-19 affected patients using the speeded up robust features algorithm. Then, visual vocabulary is built by reducing the number of feature descriptors via quantization of feature space using the K-means clustering algorithm. The visual vocabulary train the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. During testing, an X-ray radiograph's visual vocabulary is sent to the trained SVM classifier to detect the absence or presence of COVID-19. The study used the dataset of 340 X-ray radiographs, 170 images of each Healthy and Positive COVID-19 class. During simulations, the dataset split into training and testing parts at various ratios. After training, the system does not require any human intervention and can process thousands of images with high precision in a few minutes. The performance of the system is measured using standard parameters of accuracy and confusion matrix.

However, high costs for mono- or combination therapies, associated with adverse effects or possible development of resistance in some patients, warrant further development and modification to gain more flexibility for this immunotherapy approach. An attractive alternative to passive immunization with therapeutic antibodies might be active immunization with mimotopes (B-cell peptides) representing the mAbs' binding epitopes, to activate the patient's own anti-tumor immune response following immunization. Here, we identified and examined the feasibility of inducing anti-tumor effects in vivo following active immunization with a mimotope of the immune checkpoint programmed cell death 1 (PD1), alone or in combination with a Her-2/neu B-cell peptide vaccine. Overlapping peptides spanning the extracellular domains of human PD1 (hPD1) were used to identify hPD1-derived mimotopes, using the therapeutic mAb Nivolumab as a proof of concept. Additionally, for in vivo evaluation in a tumor mouse model, a mouse PD1 (mPD1)-derived mimotope was identified using an anti-mPD1 mAb with mPD1/mPDL-1 blocking capacity. The identified mimotopes were characterized by in vitro assays, including a reporter cell-based assay, and their anti-tumor effects were evaluated in a syngeneic tumor mouse model stably expressing human Her-2/neu. The identified PD1-derived mimotopes were shown to significantly block the mAbs' capacity in inhibiting the respective PD1/PD-L1 interactions. A significant reduction in tumor growth in vivo was observed following active immunization with the mPD1-derived mimotope, associated with a significant reduction in proliferation and increased apoptotic rates in the tumors. Particularly, combined vaccination with the mPD1-derived mimotope and a multiple B-cell epitope Her-2/neu vaccine potentiated the vaccine's anti-tumor effect. Our results suggest active immunization with mimotopes of immune checkpoint inhibitors either as monotherapy or as combination therapy with tumor-specific vaccines, as a new strategy for cancer treatment.","output":"A New Strategy Toward B Cell-Based Cancer Vaccines by Active Immunization With Mimotopes of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The prevalence of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is high after bariatric surgery. Vitamin D is supplied to counteract SHPT and bone disease, and we studied vitamin D associations with SHPT. METHODS We measured serum levels of 25-OH vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) 5 years after gastric bypass and duodenal switch. One hundred twenty-five patients were included, of whom 114 (91 %) had undergone gastric bypass and 11 (9 %) had undergone duodenal switch. SHPT was defined as PTH > 7.0 pmol/l in the absence of hypercalcemia. 25-OH vitamin D levels were divided into three categories: <50, 50-74, and 75 nmol/l. Serum ionized calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and creatinine were divided into tertiles. RESULTS Mean age  SD was 44  9 years at 5 years follow-up. Ninety out of 125 (72 %) patients were women. SHPT was present in 45 out of 114 (40 %) gastric bypass patients and in 11 out of 11 (100 %) duodenal switch patients. The prevalence was high in all vitamin D categories studied. An inverse association between ionized calcium and PTH was found. For the gastric bypass patients, the odds ratio for SHPT in the upper two tertiles of ionized calcium was 0.35; 95 % CI, 0.15-0.79; p = 0.011, compared with the lowest tertile. Supplements of vitamin D and calcium were not associated with a lower prevalence of SHPT at 5 years follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of SHPT was high 5 years after gastric bypass and duodenal switch. SHPT was inversely associated with serum ionized calcium, but not with vitamin D. The supplementation used was insufficient to compensate for the impaired calcium absorption after surgery.","output":"Secondary hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D sufficiency, and serum calcium 5 years after gastric bypass and duodenal switch."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To promote nationwide dissemination and implementation of COVID-19 Risk Assessment and Safety Management Operational Guidelines, drawn up by SAMeR Task Force in ART centers in Argentina. Our objective is to prevent and mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at an institutional level, while reducing the risk of infection among both physicians and patients in the context of a critical scenario in the local and Latin American healthcare system. METHODS: SAMeR Executive Committee set up a crisis committee which was made up of specialists in reproductive medicine, embryology, and healthcare management. A critical and updated review of the advances in science, documents, and recommendations released by other societies (ASRM, ESHRE, IFFS, Red LARA, societies of anesthesiologists, infectious diseases, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration-OSHA) was carried out. Likewise, there were joint meetings with the Ministry of Health of Argentina in order to draw up the guidelines. Simultaneously, ongoing medical training was carried out, thus providing added value to them, including two status surveys of the activities of the monovalent and polyvalent centers according to the country's epidemiological mapping. Four additional recommendations were made, and online training was given to healthcare workers. The aforementioned regulations were first analyzed by the healthcare providers and their practical suggestions were then added to the guidelines. RESULTS: The one-off collaborative work and the actions coordinated with the National ART Program of the Ministry of Health of Argentina resulted in the development and implementation of the present COVID-19 Risk Assessment and Safety Management Operational Guidelines at a national level. SAMeR gave recommendations for the implementation of the Management Guidelines for the center reopening, providing new safety criteria against the threat of viral contagion.

Brain CT and CT-angiography were negative for hemorrhages and for vascular malformations. Repeated intracerebral hemorrhages and neurological deterioration then occurred, and a new CT-angiography showed multiple intracranial aneurysms that were not present before.ConclusionIntracranial aneurysm formation as a complication of COVID-19 has not been previously reported. As other viral infections do, COVID-19 may be able to determine a vascular damage that can ultimately lead to development of an aneurysm. It is reasonable to hypothesize an involvement of the renin-angiotensin system as a pathogenic mechanism.A conservative therapy aiming at inflammatory modulation and vascular damage prevention may be warranted in these patients.","output":"De novo intracranial aneurysm formation in SARS-CoV-2 infection: first report of a yet unknown complication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected most of the countries on Earth.

The proposed model can have four equilibrium states based on different parametric conditions. The local and global stability conditions for awareness-free, disease-free equilibrium are studied. Using Lyapunov function theory and LaSalle invariance principle, the disease-free equilibrium is shown globally asymptotically stable under some parametric constraints. The existence of unique awareness-free, endemic equilibrium and unique endemic equilibrium is presented. We calibrate our proposed model parameters to fit daily cases and deaths from Colombia and India. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the transmission rate and the learning factor related to awareness of susceptibles are very crucial for reduction in disease-related deaths. Finally, we assess the impact of prosocial awareness during the outbreak and compare this strategy with popular control measures.

Its distinct pharmacologic properties, which have recently been attributed to the preferential activation of -arrestin over G proteins, make methadone a standard-of-care maintenance medication for opioid addiction. Although a recent biophysical study suggests that methadone stabilizes different MOR active conformations from those stabilized by classical opioid drugs or G protein-biased agonists, how this drug modulates the conformational equilibrium of MOR and what specific active conformation of the receptor it stabilizes is unknown. Here, we report the results of sub-millisecond adaptive sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a predicted methadone-bound MOR complex, and compare them with analogous data obtained for the classical opioid morphine and the G protein-biased ligand TRV130. The model, which is supported by existing experimental data, is analyzed using Markov State Models (MSMs) and transfer entropy analysis to provide testable hypotheses of methadone-specific conformational dynamics and activation kinetics of MOR. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Opioid addiction has reached epidemic proportions in both industrialized and developing countries. Although methadone maintainance treatment represents an effective therapeutic approach for opioid addiction, it is not widely used as needed. In this study, we contribute an atomic-level understanding of how methadone exerts its unique function, in pursuit of more accessible treatments for opioid addiction.

The levels of alkaline phosphatase, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and adiponectin in culture supernatants were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Osteoclast bone resorbing activity was evaluated by toluidine staining and the number and area of bone resorption pits were determined. We observed increased osteogenesis in osteoblasts co-cultured with the BM-derived myeloid cells compared to the osteoblasts cultured alone. Mice with global Lrp5 deletion had a relatively higher bone density compared to the mice carrying osteoblast/osteocyte-specific Lrp5 deletion. An increased frequency of M2 macrophages and reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines were detected in the myeloid cells derived from the bone marrow of mice with global Lrp5 deletion. Higher adipogenic potential and elevated levels of adiponectin in the global Lrp5 deletion mice contributed to the preferential M2 macrophage polarization. Here, we identified a novel systemic regulatory mechanism of bone formation and degradation in mice with global Lrp5 deletion. This mechanism depends on a crosstalk between the adipocytes and M2 macrophages in the bone marrow and is responsible for partly rescuing osteopenia developed as a result of decreased Wnt signaling.","output":"Crosstalk between adipocytes and M2 macrophages compensates for osteopenic phenotype in the Lrp5-deficient mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytidine triphosphate synthase 1 (CTPS1) is necessary for an effective immune response, as revealed by severe immunodeficiency in CTPS1-deficient individuals [E.

Martin et al.], [Nature] [510], [288C292] ([2014]), satisfying increased demand for nucleic acid and lipid synthesis [L. D. Fairbanks, M. Bofill, K. Ruckemann, H. A. Simmonds], [J. Biol.

Selective inhibition of the proliferative CTPS1 isoform is therefore desirable in the treatment of immune disorders and lymphocyte cancers, but little is known about differences in regulation of the isoforms or mechanisms of known inhibitors. We show that CTP regulates both isoforms by binding in two sites that clash with substrates. CTPS1 is less sensitive to CTP feedback inhibition, consistent with its role in increasing CTP levels in proliferation. We also characterize recently reported small-molecule inhibitors, both CTPS1 selective and nonselective. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures reveal these inhibitors mimic CTP binding in one inhibitory site, where a single amino acid substitution explains selectivity for CTPS1. The inhibitors bind to CTPS assembled into large-scale filaments, which for CTPS1 normally represents a hyperactive form of the enzyme [E. M. Lynch et al.], [Nat. Struct. Mol.

This highlights the utility of cryo-EM in drug discovery, particularly for cases in which targets form large multimeric assemblies not amenable to structure determination by other techniques.

Lifting of this quarantine is imminent. We modelled the effects of two key health interventions on the epidemic when the quarantine is lifted. Methods We constructed a compartmental dynamic model to forecast the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic at different quarantine lifting dates and investigated the impact of different rates of public contact and facial mask usage on the epidemic. Results We projected a declining trend of the COVID-19 epidemic if the current quarantine strategy continues, and Wuhan would record the last new confirmed cases in late April 2020. At the end of the epidemic, 65,733 (45,722-99,015) individuals would be infected by the virus, among which 16,166 (11,238-24,603, 24.6%) were through public contacts, 45,996 (31,892-69,565, 69.7%) through household contact, and 3,571 (2,521-5,879, 5.5%) through hospital contacts (including 778 (553-1,154) non-COVID-19 patients and 2,786 (1,969-4,791) medical staff). A total of 2,821 (1,634-6,361) would die of COVID-19 related pneumonia in Wuhan. Early quarantine lifting on 21st March is viable only if Wuhan residents sustain a high facial mask usage of 85% and a pre-quarantine level public contact rate. Delaying city resumption to mid/late April would relax the requirement of facial mask usage to 75% at the same contact rate.

Methods: Data on baseline characteristics, stroke subtype, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, the time between last known well (LKW) to emergency department (ED) arrival, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration, the involvement of large vessel occlusion (LVO), and whether mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was pursued in patients with acute stroke were extracted from 24 March to 23 April 2020 (the time period of a stay-at-home order was placed due to the COVID-19 pandemic as the study group) at a tertiary care hospital in West Michigan, USA, compared with data from 24 March to 23 April 2019 (control group). Results: Our study demonstrated a reduction in cases of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), although this did not reach statistical significance. However, there was an increase in hemorrhagic stroke (7.5% controls vs. 19.2% study group). The age of stroke patients was significantly younger during the period of the stay-at-home order compared to the control group. We identified a significant overall delay of ED arrivals from LKW in the study group. Additionally, an increased number of AIS patients with LVO in the study group (34.8%) was found compared to the control group (17.5%). A significantly increased number of patients received MT in the study group. Additionally, 11 patients were COVID-19 PCR-positive in the study group, 10 with AIS and only 1 with hemorrhagic stroke. Patients with COVID-19 had a high incidence of atrial fibrillation and hyperlipidemia. One AIS patient with COVID-19 rapidly developed cytotoxic edema with corresponding elevated inflammatory biomarkers. No statistical significance was noted when stroke subtype, LVO, and MT groups were compared. Conclusions: There was a trend of decreasing AIS admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also a significantly increased number of AIS patients with LVO who received MT, especially those with COVID-19.

Gelatinization enthalpy decreased with increasing particle sizes of raw HB flour, while no endothermic transitions were observed in sand-roasted flour. Sand roasting destroyed starch granules and decreased short-range molecular order. Starch digestibility increased while total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production decreased with decreasing particle sizes in all samples. The relative crystallinity of sand-roasted HB flour decreased by 80-88% compared with raw samples. Sand roasting raised in vitro starch digestibility, while total SCFAs during in vitro fecal fermentation decreased. Sand-roasted HB flour with particle sizes <150 m had the highest starch digestibility (94.0%) but the lowest production of total SCFAs (1.89-2.24 mM).

To date, there are few data summarizing real-world evidence comparing the 2 mAbs. Additionally, there are insufficient data to guide administration timing relative to symptom onset. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 30-day failure rates for each agent and to identify the relationship between symptom onset and efficacy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of a 6-month period at a large community medical center. Consecutive outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 disease by nasopharyngeal (NP) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing received either bamlanivimab 700 mg or casirivimab/imdevimab 1200 mg/1200 mg. Each patient was followed for a total of 30 days. Three independent, blinded physicians performed adjudication for revisit reasons. The primary outcome was therapy-related failure, defined as COVID-19-related hospital admission within 30 days of infusion. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounders that may have influenced hospital admission in either group. RESULTS: During the period from November 2020 to May 2021, 183 patients were treated with bamlanivimab and 270 with casirivimab/imdevimab. The mean age was ~67 years and body mass index 30 kg/m(2). Thirty-day admission for therapy-related failure rates were 4.8% and 13.7% for casirivimab/imdevimab and bamlanivimab, respectively (P = .001). No significant differences were found between early (<3 days of symptom onset) and late administration of either mAb.

OBJECTIVES As part of a recent RHD initiative in Uganda and Tanzania, we systematically reviewed group A streptococcal disease (GAS), acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and RHD in these countries. METHODS Using a systematic review and meta-analysis/meta-synthesis, we searched PubMed, Embase, and grey literature for quantitative and qualitative studies conducted in Uganda and Tanzania that included individuals affected by GAS, ARF, and RHD. We pre-specified 3 sets of outcomes: 1) disease epidemiology; 2) barriers and facilitators to health care; and 3) stakeholder identification and engagement. Study descriptors, outcomes, and interest, and quality assessments were recorded. For the first objective, we conducted random-effects meta-analyses. For the second objective, we produced a narrative synthesis of themes. No studies contained data on the third objective. RESULTS Of 293 records identified, 12 met our inclusion criteria (9 for objective 1 and 3 for objective 2). Most quantitative studies were at moderate or high risk of bias, and only 1 of 2 qualitative studies was high quality. We estimated the prevalence of RHD to be 17.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.0 to 41.2) per 1,000 individuals. The most frequent nonfatal sequelae were heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.

All emergency general surgery patients were included. Demographics, diagnosis and management were recorded along with Covid-19 testing and results. Thirty-day mortality and readmission rates were also noted. Similar data were collected on patients admitted during the same period in 2019 to allow for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 294 patients were included. There was a 58.3 per cent reduction in admissions when comparing 2020 with 2019 (85 vs 209); however, there was no difference in age (53.2 vs 57.2 years, p = 0.169) or length of stay (4.8 vs 3.7 days, p = 0.133). During 2020, the diagnosis of appendicitis increased (4.3 vs 18.8 per cent, p = < 0.05) as did severity (0 per cent > grade 1 vs 58.3 per cent > grade 1, p = < 0.05).

Fertility is the proportional gametic contribution of parents to their progeny. An effective number of parents, derivative of effective population size, is the probability that two alleles randomly chosen from the gamete gene pool originated from the same parent. The effective number of parents is directly related to the fertility variation among parents, which should be monitored for manipulating gene diversity of seed crops. We formulated a fundamental equation of estimating the effective number of parents and applied it to a seed production population. RESULTS Effective number of parents (Np) was derived from fertility variation () considering covariance (correlation coefficient, r) between maternal and paternal fertility. The  was calculated from the coefficient of variation in reproductive outputs and divided into female (f) and male (m) fertility variation in the population under study. The Np was estimated from the parental  estimated by the fertility variation of maternal (f) and paternal (m) parents. The gene diversity of seed crops was monitored by  and Np. in a 1.5 generation Pinus koraiensis seed orchard as a case of monoecious species. A large variation of female and male strobili production was observed among the studied 52 parents over four consecutive years, showing statistically significant differences across all studied years.

When pooled, the relative effective number of parents was improved as 80.0% of the census number. CONCLUSIONS We recommend the use of fertility variation (i.e., CV, ), Person's product-moment correlation (r), and effective number of parents (Np) as tools for gauging gene diversity of seed crops in production populations. For increasing Np and gene diversity, additional management options such as mixing seed-lots, equal cone harvest and application of supplemental-mass-pollination are recommended.","output":"Gender, reproductive output covariation and their role on gene diversity of Pinus koraiensis seed orchard crops."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The N-terminal 26 amino acids of the prohormone pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) were investigated to determine whether this region has the capacity to act as a sorting signal for the regulated secretory pathway.

Differences in news frequency, framing and information source can impact the public's interpretation of risk messages and subsequent attitudes and behaviors about a particular threat. The media's framing of an outbreak is important, as it may affect both perception of risk and the ability to process important health information. METHODS: To understand how risk communication by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the 2014 Ebola outbreak was framed and delivered and to what extent primetime broadcast news media mirrored CDC's framing and authoritative voice, 209 CDC communications and primetime broadcast transcripts issued between July 24 and December 29, 2014 were analyzed and coded by thematic frame and authoritative voice. Dominant frame and voice were determined for each month and for overall period of analysis. RESULTS: Medical frame was dominant in CDC (60%), Anderson Cooper 360 (49%), The Rachel Maddow Show (47%) and All In with Chris Hayes (47%). The human interest frame was dominant in The Kelly File (45%), while The O'Reilly Factor coverage was equally split between sociopolitical and medical frames (28%, respectively). Primetime news media also changed dominant frames over time. Dominant authoritative voice in CDC communications was that of CDC officials, while primetime news dominantly featured local and federal (non-CDC) government officials and academic/medical experts. CONCLUSION: Differences in framing and delivery could have led the public to interpret risk in a different way than intended by CDC. Overall, public health agencies should consider adapting risk communication strategies to account for a dynamic news environment and the media's agenda.

Sensitivity was higher in household (50.8%; 95% CI: 38.9-62.5) than in non-household (35.7%; 95% CI:16.3-61.2%) contacts. Individuals testing positive by RAD test were more likely (P<0.001) to become symptomatic than their negative counterparts. Conclusion: The Panbio test displays low sensitivity in asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients, particularly in non-household contacts. Nonetheless, establishing the optimal timing for upper respiratory tract collection in this group seems imperative to pinpoint test sensitivity.","output":"Real-life evaluation of a rapid antigen test (Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device) for SARS-CoV-2 detection in asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: After its initial description in China, Covid-19 is hitting nations across the world, with Spain as the third country in number of deaths, after the USA and Italy. Similarly to what is happening in other countries, an important reduction in available operating rooms is affecting our departments. In this study, we aim to know how Covid-19 pandemic is affecting the delivery of plastic surgery services in Spain. Methods: A questionnaire addressing some of our concerns about how the Coronavirus crisis might severelyimpact our specialty has been sent to the heads of the divisions of plastic surgery of several hospitals across Spain. Results: A total of 12 plastic surgery departments from different hospitals across the country agreed to participate in the survey. Most plastic surgery teams will need to maintain 50-80% of their staff in order to be able to offer emergency and undelayable oncological procedures. The total amount of procedures currently being performed ranged from 0 to 44% of the figures before the coronavirus outbreak, except for one department, with elective surgery mainly affected. Microsurgical cases have been massively discontinued during this crisis. Conclusions: Plastic surgery delivery in the Spanish Health System is being severely impacted as a collateral damage from this pandemic. Most of the elective surgery is currently stopped.

One negative consequence of the ongoing pandemic is anxiety brought about by uncertainty and the COVID-19 disease. Increased anxiety is a potential risk factor for wellbeing at work. This study investigated psychological, situational, and socio-demographic predictors of COVID-19 anxiety using longitudinal data. Methods: A nationally representative sample of Finnish workers (N = 1308) was collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis. Eighty percent of the participants responded to the follow-up study (N = 1044). COVID-19 anxiety was measured with a modified Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Psychological and situational predictors included perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, personality, social support received from the work community, and remote working. A number of socio-demographic factors were also investigated. Results: Perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, and neuroticism were identified as robust psychological predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. Increase in psychological distress and technostress during the COVID-19 crisis predicted higher COVID-19 anxiety. A recent change in their field of work and decreased social support from work communities predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Women and young people experienced higher anxiety. Conclusions: Different factors explain workers' COVID-19 anxiety. Increased anxiety can disrupt wellbeing at work, emphasizing the organizations' role in maintaining an inclusive and caring work culture and providing technical and psychological support to workers during crisis.","output":"COVID-19 Anxiety-A Longitudinal Survey Study of Psychological and Situational Risks among Finnish Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Lebanese economic crisis, financial crisis, and USD shortage were conducive to an increased drug addiction especially for students who feel that their future in Lebanon is not safe, as well as the psychological fragility of the Lebanese people, and the more permissive sociocultural context. Our study aimed to assess the addiction levels and profiles of university students in Lebanon, and thus to evaluate the rapid rising in dependence regarding smoking, alcohol, and illegal drug use during this crisis. This cross-sectional study was carried out between February and September 2020. A total of 467 participants (315 females, 152 males; Mage = 23.48  6.03) were recruited through convenience sampling through several universities in Lebanons governorates. Participants received the online link to the survey. Students were divided into three clusters as follows: cluster 1, which corresponds to students with moderate addictions; cluster 2, which corresponds to students with high addictions; and cluster 3, which corresponds to students with low addictions. When comparing cluster 1 to cluster 3, the results of the multinomial regression showed that older age (aOR=1.08) and having a high monthly income compared to no income (aOR=2.78) were significantly associated with higher odds of being in cluster 1 compared to cluster 3. When comparing cluster 2 to cluster 3, the results of the multinomial regression showed that female gender (aOR=0.19) was significantly associated with lower odds of being in cluster 2 compared to cluster 3, whereas having a dead (aOR=16.38) or divorced parent (aOR=6.54) and having a low (aOR=3.93) or intermediate income compared to zero income (aOR=4.71) were significantly associated with higher odds of being in cluster 2 compared to cluster 3. The results of our study revealed a considerable prevalence of addiction to alcohol, illicit drugs, and specially to smoking, among Lebanese university students. These findings emphasize the need to implement firm policies and rules in an attempt to minimize the tendency of the young population to engage in such addictions.","output":"Addictive profiles of Lebanese university students in terms of smoking, alcohol, and illegal drug use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To study the clinical profile and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features in patients of COVID-19-associated rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (CA-ROCM) with orbital involvement and perform a clinicoradiological correlation. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed at a tertiary care center in north India from May 2021 to June 2021. Consecutive patients with clinical, nasal endoscopic, and/or microbiological evidence of CA-ROCM underwent MRI of paranasal sinuses, orbit, and brain as per the study protocol. Orbital MRI findings were studied in detail and were correlated with clinical signs. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy patients were studied. The mean age was 48.4 ( 16.82) years. A male predilection was noted (male:female = 1.77). Orbital involvement was seen in 146 (54%) patients on clinical evaluation and in 184 (68%) patients on MRI. Unilateral orbital involvement was more common (134; 92%). The most common presenting symptom was periorbital and/or facial pain (141; 52.2%) and the most common clinical sign was periorbital edema (116; 43%). The most common MRI finding was suggestive of orbital cellulitis (160; 59%). Orbital compartment syndrome was found in 17 (6.3%) patients. The inter-rater agreement between clinical and radiological assessments to detect the involvement of infraorbital nerve and frontal nerve was found to be 85.56%, ( 0.621) and 93.70% ( 0.776), respectively.

The bilastine drugs, composed of benzene carboxylate, propanoate, carboxylate, methyl-sulfonate, propanoic acid, butanoic acid, and pentanoic acid derivatives, were investigated through computational tools against SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 virus consists of five proteases where the curial function is performed by main proteases (M-pro) and Spike proteases (S-pro). The M-pro and S-pro were selected for calculation of molecular docking by these bilastine drugs which showed higher binding energy (<-6.5 kcal/mol) for both proteases. The main carboxylic acid group in bilastine drugs is found the primary key for a high binding score to show the large binding affinity with M-pro and S-pro, and is highly responsible for forming the hydrogen bond although the various hydrophobic bonds were produced as a weak interaction. For justification, the stability of molecular docked ligand-protein complexes was investigated with molecular dynamics. It showed that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of all these drugs were below the 0.9 angstrom after residue interaction. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO gap, hardness, and softness provided full details for their chemical reactivity. In this view, the pharmacokinetics and Lipinski rule were calculated, and all of these molecules had satisfied the Lipinski rule. Finally, using the admetSAR online database, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity have been calculated which indicated that these bilastine drugs are non-carcinogenic and less harmful for both aquatic and non-aquatic species.

We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of conditions placing individuals in these risk categories to the extent possible. We also examined the sociodemographic characteristics of LTC workers by occupation and COVID-19 illness severity risk status. One percent (552 out of 52,159) of the weighted NHIS sample worked in LTC facilities. Workers in LTC facilities were disproportionately Black, female, and low income. Half of LTC workers (50%) were at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and another 19.6% were potentially at increased risk. There were few significant differences in demographic characteristics between risk groups, though those at increased risk had lower educational attainment and recent trouble affording prescription medications. Despite the high degree of vulnerability of both LTC residents and workers to severe illness from COVID-19, many LTC facilities still have inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment and COVID-19 tests.

In the central nervous system, Zfp276 is exclusively expressed in mature oligodendrocytes. Oligodendroglial deletion of Zfp276 led to strongly reduced expression of myelin genes in the early postnatal mouse spinal cord. Retroviral overexpression of Zfp276 in cultured oligodendrocyte precursor cells induced precocious expression of maturation markers and myelin genes, further supporting its role in oligodendroglial differentiation. On the molecular level, Zfp276 directly binds to and represses Sox10-dependent gene regulatory regions of immaturity factors and functionally interacts with the transcriptional repressor Zeb2 to enable fast transition of oligodendrocytes to the myelinating stage.","output":"Transcription factor Zfp276 drives oligodendroglial differentiation and myelination by switching off the progenitor cell program."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, and ensuing physical distancing measures, poses challenges for researchers in the field of interprofessional care.

In the current minireview, optical phenomena including fluorescence, surface plasmons, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and colorimetry are discussed in the context of detecting virus pathogens. The sensitivity of a viral detection method can be dramatically improved by using materials that exhibit surface plasmons or SERS, but often this requires advanced instrumentation for detection. Although fluorescence and colorimetry lack high sensitivity, they show promise as point-of-care diagnostics because of their relatively less complicated instrumentation, ease of use, lower costs, and the fact that they do not require nucleic acid amplification.

MERS-CoV sequences have since been found in a bat and the virus appears to be enzootic among dromedary camels across the Arabian Peninsula and in parts of Africa. The majority of human cases have occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In humans, the etiologic agent, MERS-CoV, has been detected in severe, mild and influenza-like illness and in those without any obvious signs or symptoms of disease. MERS is often a lower respiratory tract disease associated with fever, cough, breathing difficulties, pneumonia that can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and death among more than a third of those infected. Severe disease is usually found in older males and comorbidities are frequently present in cases of MERS. Compared to SARS, MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute kidney injury, is more often observed as severe disease in patients with underlying illnesses and is more often fatal. MERS-CoV has a broader tropism than SARS-CoV, rapidly triggers cellular damage, employs a different receptor and induces a delayed proinflammatory response in cells. Most human cases have been linked to lapses in infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, with a fifth of virus detections reported among healthcare workers.

We conducted a desktop analysis of public information about remote working and care from 41 Australian universities and compared them to the world's top 10 ranked universities. Findings suggest that during the pandemic, the Australian higher education sector positions decisions about caring leave and participation in the paid labour force as 'private' matters in which employees (mainly women) design their own 'solutions' when compared with international institutional counterparts.

Moreover, it investigated the associations among physical activity, sense of coherence (SOC), and HRQoL. Physical activity profiles were identified through latent class growth analysis, and linear regressions were then performed to explore the association between physical activity, SOC, and HRQoL. After the cardiovascular event, 62% of patients reached adequate physical activity levels and maintained them over time (virtuous profile). The remaining 38% could not implement (23%) or maintain (15%) a healthy behavior. A strong SOC at baseline (standardized  = 0.19, p = 0.002) predicted the probability of belonging to the virtuous profile. Moreover, a strong SOC at baseline (standardized  = 0.27, p < 0.001), together with the probability of belonging to the virtuous profile (standardized  = 0.16, p = 0.031), predicted a better HRQoL at the final follow-up. Findings showed a strong relationship between SOC, the ability to adopt a physically active lifestyle stably over time, and HRQoL in patients with CVD.

Cap methylation of flavivirus genome is an essential structural modification to ensure the normal proliferation of the virus. Tembusu virus (TMUV) (genus Flavivirus) is a causative agent of duck egg drop syndrome and has zoonotic potential. Here, we identified the in vitro activity of TMUV MTase and determined the effect of K61-D146-K182-E218 enzymatic tetrad on N-7 and 2-O methylation. The entire K61-D146-K182-E218 motif is essential for 2-O MTase activity, whereas N-7 MTase activity requires only D146. To investigate its phenotype, the single point mutation (K61A, D146A, K182A or E218A) was introduced into TMUV replicon (pCMV-Rep-NanoLuc) and TMUV infectious cDNA clone (pACYC-TMUV). K-D-K-E mutations reduced the replication ability of replicon. K61A, K182A and E218A viruses were genetically stable, whereas D146A virus was unstable and reverted to WT virus. Mutant viruses were replication and virulence impaired, showing reduced growth and attenuated cytopathic effects and reduced mortality of duck embryos. Molecular mechanism studies showed that the translation efficiency of mutant viruses was inhibited and a higher host innate immunity was induced. Furthermore, we found that the translation inhibition of MTase-deficient viruses was caused by a defect in N-7 methylation, whereas the absence of 2-O methylation did not affect viral translation. Taken together, our data validate the debilitating mechanism of MTase-deficient avian flavivirus and reveal an important role for cap-methylation in viral translation, proliferation, and escape from innate immunity.","output":"Methyltransferase-Deficient Avian Flaviviruses Are Attenuated Due to Suppression of Viral RNA Translation and Induction of a Higher Innate Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Covid-19 was identified in Wuhan China in December, 2019 and has created medical emergency world wise and distorted many life in the couple of month, it is being burned challenging situation for the medical scientist and virologists Fractional order derivative based modeling is quite important to understand the real world problems and to analyse realistic situation of the proposed model In the present investigation a fractional model based on Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative has been developed for the transmission of CORONA VIRUS (COVID-19) in Wuhan China The existence and uniqueness solutions of the fractional order derivative has been investigated with the help of fixed point theory AdamasBashforth numerical scheme has been used in the numerical simulation of the Caputo-Fabrizio fractional order derivative The analysis of susceptible population, exposed population, infected population, recovered population and concentration of the virus of COVID-19 in the surrounding environment with respect to time for different values of fractional order derivative has been shown by means of graph The comparative analysis has also been performed from classical model and fractional model along with the certified experimental data (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved","output":"A numerical simulation of fractional order mathematical modeling of COVID-19 disease in case of Wuhan China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted several instances of churches violating state issued and scientifically recommended guidelines designed to keep populations healthy and to prevent the further spread of the disease While these instances are minority responses to these orders, they nonetheless raise questions about the rationality of ecclesial belonging in response to the COVID-19 pandemic In this article, I draw on the work of William James and W E B Du Bois to articulate a conception of ecclesial belonging as a social epistemological process engaging a complex, fluid multiplicity of knowers of various scales I argue that, in this view, ecclesial rationality involves the construction of a concatenation of internal and external practices individual believers and groups can traverse so long as they consistently satisfy a plurality of desiderata I suggest that what is irrational about religious-based defiance of COVID-19 guidelines is the church-sanctioned severance of internal from external practices I suggest that this behavior is supported by a failure to grasp the demands of ecclesial rationality rather than embrace them, and that this conception of rationality may have been eroded by the value-neutral skepticism of secular rationality ? 2021 Walter Scott Stepanenko, published by De Gruyter 2021","output":"Ecclesial Belonging in a World of Pure Experience: William James, W.

However, the vertical transmission of COVID-19 is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: This is a systematic review of published studies concerning pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 and their neonates. SEARCH STRATEGY: We carried out a systematic search in multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and WHO COVID-19 database using the following keywords: (Coronavirus) OR (novel coronavirus) OR (COVID-19) OR (COVID19) OR (COVID 19) OR (SARS-CoV2) OR (2019-nCoV)) and ((pregnancy) OR (pregnant) OR (vertical transmission) OR (neonate) OR (newborn) OR (placenta) OR (fetus) OR (Fetal)). The search took place in April 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Original articles published in English were eligible if they included pregnant patients infected with COVID-19 and their newborns. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSES: The outcomes of interest consisted of clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant patients with COVID-19 and also the effect of COVID-19 on neonatal and pregnancy outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: 37 articles involving 364 pregnant women with COVID-19 and 302 neonates were included. The vast majority of pregnant patients were in their third trimester of pregnancy, and only 45 cases were in the first or second trimester (12.4%). Most mothers described mild to moderate manifestations of COVID-19. Of 364 pregnant women, 25 were asymptomatic at the time of admission. The most common symptoms were fever (62.4%) and cough (45.3%). Two maternal deaths occurred. Some pregnant patients (12.1%) had a negative SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 test but displayed clinical manifestations and abnormalities in computed tomography (CT) scan related to COVID\\\\19. Twenty\\\\two (6.0%) pregnant patients developed severe pneumonia. Two maternal deaths occurred from severe pneumonia and multiple organ dysfunction. Studies included a total of 302 neonates from mothers with COVID\\\\19. Of the studies that provided data on the timing of birth, there were 65 (23.6%) preterm neonates. One baby was born dead from a mother who also died from COVID-19. Of the babies born alive from mothers with COVID\\\\19, five newborns faced critical conditions, and two later died. A total of 219 neonates underwent nasopharyngeal specimen collection for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, of which 11 tested positive (5%). Seventeen studies examined samples of the placenta, breast milk, umbilical cord, and amniotic fluid, and all tested negative except one amniotic fluid sample. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic review of published studies confirm that the course of COVID-19 in pregnant women resembles that of other populations. However, there is not sufficient evidence to establish an idea that COVID-19 would not complicate pregnancy.","output":"A systematic review of pregnant women with COVID-19 and their neonates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily a pulmonary disease, but also affects the cardiovascular system in multiple ways. In this review, we will summarise and put into perspective findings and debates relating to the diverse aspects of cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19. We will review evidence for the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), the risk of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in COVID-19 susceptibility and course, and the mechanism of acute and long-term myocardial injury. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses membrane-bound angiotensin converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell entry. ACE2 is part of an important counter-regulatory circuit antagonising the harmful effects of angiotensin II on lung and heart. Modulation of ACE2 may therefore affect disease susceptibility and disease course. However, observational clinical studies and one randomised trial have so far not yielded evidence for harmful or beneficial effects of blockers of the RAAS during COVID-19. Age, gender, and multi-morbidity all increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases do so only minimally, but they may aggravate the disease course. Direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of the heart tissue and myocytes is rare. Nevertheless, COVID-19 may lead to myocarditis-like acute cardiac injury, characterised by myocardial oedema, but lacking extensive myocyte loss and lymphocytic infiltration. Independent of this, increases in cardiac biomarkers (troponin, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, D-dimer) are frequent, especially in the phase of severe systemic inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and quantitatively associated with poor outcome. The pulmonary infection may result initially in right ventricular dysfunction, but in cases with severe systemic infection hypoxia, hyperinflammation and cytokine storm heart failure may eventually ensue. Unlike other infections and inflammatory states, COVID-19 does not appear to trigger acute coronary syndromes. In children, even mild COVID-19 can induce a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with Kawasaki-like symptoms frequently accompanied by cardiogenic shock.","output":"Cardiovascular aspects of COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate which non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been more and less effective in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished empirical studies, either observational or interventional, analysing the comparative effectiveness of NPIs against the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched Embase/Medline and medRxiv to identify the relevant literature. RESULTS: We identified 34 studies. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, school closing was the most effective NPI, followed by workplace closing, business and venue closing and public event bans. Public information campaigns and mask wearing requirements were also effective in controlling the pandemic while being less disruptive for the population than other NPIs. There was no evidence on the effectiveness of public transport closure, testing and contact tracing strategies and quarantining or isolation of individuals. Early implementation was associated with a higher effectiveness in reducing COVID-19 cases and deaths, while general stringency of the NPIs was not. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we found that school closing, followed by workplace closing, business and venue closing and public event bans were the most effective NPIs in controlling the spread of COVID-19. An early response and a combination of specific social distancing measures are effective at reducing COVID-19 cases and deaths.

In cooperation with the local health authority, blood samples from fully vaccinated and infected as well as fully vaccinated and uninfected residents of the nursing home were collected 4 weeks after the onset of the outbreak. The humoral immune response was determined in a neutralisation assay with replication-competent virus isolates and by a quantitative ELISA. In this outbreak a total of 23 residents and four health care workers were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Four residents were unvaccinated, including one with a severe course of disease who later severe disease course who later succumbed to infection. Despite their old age, all vaccinated residents showed no or only mild disease. Comparison of the humoral immune response revealed significantly higher antibody levels in fully vaccinated infected individuals compared to fully vaccinated uninfected individuals (p < 0.001). Notably, although only a minority of the vaccinated uninfected group showed neutralisation capacity against SARS-CoV-2, all vaccinated and infected individuals showed high-titre neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 including the alpha and beta variant. Large SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks can occur in fully vaccinated populations, but seem to associate with mild disease. SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated individuals is a strong booster of the humoral immune response providing enhanced neutralisation capacity against immune evasion variants.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Fully Vaccinated Individuals of Old Age Strongly Boosts the Humoral Immune Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using a mixed methods design, this study aimed to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on autistic and non-autistic adults.

Effective infection prevention and control (IPC) in HHC is essential to keeping both healthcare workers and patients safe, especially in the event of an emerging infectious disease outbreak. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we explored successes and challenges with IPC from the perspectives of HHC staff. Design Qualitative descriptive study Setting and Participants From May to November 2018, we conducted in-depth telephone interviews with 41 staff from 13 agencies across the nation. Methods Transcripts were coded by a multidisciplinary coding team, and several primary and subcategories were identified using directed content analysis. Results Four primary categories were generated, including: 1) Uniqueness of Home Healthcare, 2) Infection Prevention and Control as a Priority, 3) Importance of Education, 4) Keys to Success and Innovation. Participants perceived that IPC plays a big part in patient safety and reducing rehospitalizations, and protection of patients and staff was a major motivator for compliance with IPC. The identified challenges included the unpredictability of the home environment, patient/family dynamics, the intermittent nature of HHC, and staffing issues. Education was seen as a tool to improve staff, patient, caregiver and families compliance with IPC. Keys to success and innovation included: a leadership focus on quality, using agency infection data to improve quality, and a coordinated approach to patient care. Conclusions and Implications This qualitative work identified barriers to effective IPC in HHC, as well as important facilitators that HHC agencies can use to implement policies and procedures to improve patient care and keep staff safe.

These variables are juxtaposed with the self-assessment of digital competence and how cyberspace is used. The survey was conducted using a standardised survey questionnaire translated into the relevant national languages in the first half of 2019, and involved a sample of 873 teachers representing eight countries. On the basis of the pilot studies it was noted that: 1) Teachers from LAC and EU like to use digital media - this is a constant trend independent of geographical location; 2) Teachers note that new technologies are not always better than analogue didactic aids; 3) Teachers from selected countries (the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Turkey, and Uruguay) have much greater techno-optimism in themselves than teachers from Bolivia, Poland, Finland and Turkey in terms of the impact of ICT on student motivation and engagement; 4) In all countries teachers prefer free online courses (the different forms of e-learning are used most often by those in the Dominican Republic, and the least often in Bolivia and Poland); 5) In each country teachers who highly value their own digital competences and have a positive attitude towards new media use ICT much more actively; 6) There is also a global trend in that the extensive use of cyberspace (typical e-services) appears in combination with the extensive use of various forms of e-learning; 7) Teachers from Ecuador are most likely to want to ban the use of smartphones in schools.

We propose an augmented optimization objective which imposes a probabilistic structure on the learned latent data summary space and utilize maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to detect potentially catastrophic misspecifications during inference undermining the validity of the obtained results. We verify our detection criterion on a number of artificial and realistic misspecifications, ranging from toy conjugate models to complex models of decision making and disease outbreak dynamics applied to real data. Further, we show that posterior inference errors increase when the distance between the latent summary distributions of the true data-generating process and the training simulations grows.

The following landmarks were recognized: tela-choroidea (TC), foramina of Moro, early CC and the evolving cavum septi pellucidi. The following measurements were taken: total, anterior and posterior sections, and height of the CC (referenced to the anterior TC border). All measurements were correlated to both the gestational age and the transverse cerebellar diameter (TCD). RESULTS: Eighty nine volumes were included in the study (mean 15.1 weeks +/- 0.84, TCD range: 13.1-18.4 mm) with high inter and intra observer correlation of the measurements. We found high correlation between CC length and height, and TCD. The anterior segment of the CC appear earlier than the posterior one, and growth continues bi-directionally.

This study aims to characterize how UCCs manage Medicaid and privately insured patients who present with an emergent condition. METHODS Using a standardized script, we called 1245 randomly selected UCCs in 50 states on 2 occasions. Investigators posed as either a Medicaid or a privately-insured patient with symptoms of an incarcerated inguinal hernia. Rates of direct emergency department (ED) referral were compared between insurance types. RESULTS A total of 1223 (98.2%) UCCs accepted private insurance and 981 (78.8%) accepted Medicaid. At the 971 (78.0%) UCCs that accepted both insurance types, direct-to-ED referral rates for private and Medicaid patients were 27.9% and 33.8%, respectively. Medicaid patients were significantly more likely than private patients to be referred to the ED [odds ratio (OR) 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.60]. Private patients who were triaged by a clinician compared to nonclinician staff were over 6 times more likely to be referred to the ED (OR 6.46, 95% CI 4.63-9.01). Medicaid patients were nearly 9 times more likely to have an ED referral when triaged by a clinician (OR 8.72, 95% CI 6.19-12.29).

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the cohort included all swab positive cases aged 40 years older (No. 18,286) among residents in the territory of the Milan's Agency for Health Protection (ATS-MI) up to 27.04.2020. Data on comorbidities were obtained from the ATS administrative database of chronic conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: to predict 30-day mortality risk, a multivariable logistic regression model, including age, gender, and the selected conditions, was developed following the TRIPOD guidelines. Discrimination and calibration of the model were assessed. RESULTS: after age and gender, the most important predictors of 30-day mortality were diabetes, tumour in first-line treatment, chronic heart failure, and complicated diabetes. The bootstrap-validated c-index was 0.78, which suggests that this model is useful in predicting death after COVID-19 infection in swab positive cases. The model had good discrimination (Brier score 0.13) and was well calibrated (Index of prediction accuracy of 14.8%). CONCLUSIONS: a risk prediction model for 30-day mortality in a large COVID-19 cohort aged 40 years or older was developed. In a new epidemic wave, it would help to define groups at different risk and to identify high-risk subjects to target for specific prevention and therapeutic strategies.","output":"Development of a multivariable model predicting mortality risk from comorbidities in an Italian cohort of 18,286 confirmed COVID-19 cases aged 40 years or older"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 16-year-old male Russian blue cat was presented with acute onset of paraparesis of the forelimbs that progressed to tetraparesis.

However, so far, the causes for these record temperatures remain poorly understood. Here, a detailed characterization of the 2013/2014 austral summer season over Southeast Brazil is proposed, emphasizing the role played by land-atmosphere interactions in temperature escalation. We demonstrate that a strong soil moisture-temperature coupling regime promoted record-breaking temperatures levels exceeding almost 5 C over the previous highest record, and played a key role in triggering an outstanding 'mega-heatwave' that lasted for a period of around 20 days. This pronounced soil desiccation occurred within a current climate change trend defined by drier and hotter conditions in the region. The soil dry-out, coupled with strong radiative processes and low entrainment of cooler air masses through mesoscale sea-breeze circulation processes, led to a water-limited regime and to an enhancement of sensible heat fluxes that, ultimately, resulted in a sharp increase of surface temperatures.","output":"The influence of soil dry-out on the record-breaking hot 2013/2014 summer in Southeast Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: In these pandemic times due to COVID-19, an unprecedented situation must be confronted in our society, a scenario where, apart from having to confront the direct effects of the virus, such as the symptoms of the disease, the fear of contagion and the concern for our loved ones, we must also deal with quarantine measures to stop the pandemic Objective: To describe the psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical sciences students Methods: A descriptive and cross-sectional study was carried out from April to July 2020 The population consisted of 73 students and the sample was made up of 63 students who carried out active screening in the urban area of Los Palacios They were applied the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the scale for assessing their stress level Results: 79 4% of the students maintained a resilient behavior, while only 20 6% showed low resilience levels 33 3% maintained normal stress levels, while 6 7% of the students presented stress Conclusions: Students have been crucial in the confrontation and eradication of epidemic spread, since the time when they stepped forward to assume the task unconditionally However, this situation had a psychological impact on them, so most of them show stress levels and low scores in the dimensions of resilience, pressure under control, and spirituality ? 2020, Editorial Ciencias Medicas All rights reserved","output":"A study about the psychological impact of covid-19 in medical sciences student from los palacios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public transport ridership around the world has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Travellers are likely to adapt their behaviour to avoid the risk of transmission and these changes may even be sustained after the pandemic. To evaluate travellers' behaviour in public transport networks during these times and assess how they will respond to future changes in the pandemic, we conduct a stated choice experiment with train travellers in the Netherlands. We specifically assess behaviour related to three criteria affecting the risk of COVID-19 transmission: (i) crowding, (ii) exposure duration, and (iii) prevalent infection rate. Observed choices are analysed using a latent class choice model which reveals two, nearly equally sized traveller segments: 'COVID Conscious' and 'Infection Indifferent'. The former has a significantly higher valuation of crowding, accepting, on average 8.75 minutes extra waiting time to reduce one person on-board. Moreover, they demonstrate a strong desire to sit without anybody in their neighbouring seat and are quite sensitive to changes in the prevalent infection rate. By contrast, Infection Indifferent travellers' value of crowding (1.04 waiting time minutes/person) is only slightly higher than pre-pandemic estimates and they are relatively unaffected by infection rates. We find that older and female travellers are more likely to be COVD Conscious while those reporting to use the trains more frequently during the pandemic tend to be Infection Indifferent. Further analysis also reveals differences between the two segments in attitudes towards the pandemic and self-reported rule-following behaviour.

Objectives: To identify risk and protective factors for retention among patients in OUD treatment. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients diagnosed with OUD using data from the Rhode Island (RI) All-Payer Claims Database from 2011 to 2019. Patients who initiated treatment (Stage 2) were classified into sub-stages of retention (Stage 3) corresponding to multistate modeling states capturing early retention (sub-stage 1), short and long-term retention (sub-stage 2), and short and long-term disengagement (sub-stage 3). The association of baseline characteristics with state transitions were evaluated. Results: A cohort of 6,939 RI residents diagnosed with OUD included 41% aged 40 to 60 years, 57.6% male, and 70.8% Medicaid beneficiaries. In sub-stage 1, cannabis (Relative risk ratios (RRR) = 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04,1.29) and cocaine use disorders (RRR=1.15; 95% CI=1.05,1.25) increased early disengagement risk after engagement. Medicaid beneficiaries were less likely to experience early disengagement (RRR=0.81; 95% CI =0.76,0.87). In sub-stage 2, alcohol (RRR=1.29; 95% CI=1.13,1.47) or cocaine use disorders (RRR=1.18; 95% CI=1.01,1.40) increased risk of disengagement among patients in the retention states. In sub-stage 3, tobacco (RRR=1.10; 95% CI=1.01,1.21) and alcohol (RRR=1.14; 95% CI=1.03,1.27) use disorders were associated with re-engagement from disengaged states.

METHODS: We conducted an experimental stated preference survey in a national sample of Canadian adults. Preferences were elicited across a range of scenarios and scored on a visual analogue scale. Intervention group participants were randomized to a moral reasoning exercise prior to each choice task. The main outcomes were the differences in mean preference scores by group, scenario, and demographics. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate a consistent preference by participants to allocate scarce health system resources to children. Exposure to the moral reasoning exercise weakened but did not eliminate this preference. Younger respondent age and parenthood were associated with greater preference for children. The top principles guiding participants' allocative decisions were treat equally, relieve suffering, and rescue those at risk of dying. CONCLUSIONS: Our study affirms the relevance of age in public preferences for the allocation of scarce health care resources, demonstrating a significant preference by participants to allocate healthcare resources to children. However, this preference diminishes when challenged by exposure to a range of moral principles, revealing a strong public endorsement of equality of access.

These measures are imposed in order to reduce the spread of the disease and to lift the pressure on healthcare systems. Estimating the impact of such interventions as well as monitoring the gradual relaxing of these stringent measures is quintessential to understand how resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic can be controlled for in the future. In this paper we use a stochastic age-structured discrete time compartmental model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in Belgium. Our model explicitly accounts for age-structure by integrating data on social contacts to (i) assess the impact of the lockdown as implemented on March 13, 2020 on the number of new hospitalizations in Belgium; (ii) conduct a scenario analysis estimating the impact of possible exit strategies on potential future COVID-19 waves. More specifically, the aforementioned model is fitted to hospital admission data, data on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths and serial serological survey data informing the (sero)prevalence of the disease in the population while relying on a Bayesian MCMC approach. Our age-structured stochastic model describes the observed outbreak data well, both in terms of hospitalizations as well as COVID-19 related deaths in the Belgian population. Despite an extensive exploration of various projections for the future course of the epidemic, based on the impact of adherence to measures of physical distancing and a potential increase in contacts as a result of the relaxation of the stringent lockdown measures, a lot of uncertainty remains about the evolution of the epidemic in the next months.","output":"Modelling the early phase of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic using a stochastic compartmental model and studying its implied future trajectories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows a wide variation in expression and severity of symptoms, from very mild or no symptomes, to flu-like symptoms, and in more severe cases, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Large differences in outcome have also been observed between males and females. The causes for this variability are likely to be multifactorial, and to include genetics. The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the infection uses the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell invasion, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. Genetic variation in these two genes may thus modulate an individual's genetic predisposition to infection and virus clearance. While genetic data on COVID-19 patients is being gathered, we carried out a phenome-wide association scan (PheWAS) to investigate the role of these genes in other human phenotypes in the general population. We examined 178 quantitative phenotypes including cytokines and cardio-metabolic biomarkers, as well as 58 medications in 36,339 volunteers from the Lifelines population biobank, in relation to 1,273 genetic variants located in or near ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While none reached our threshold for significance, we observed a suggestive association of polymorphisms within the ACE2 gene with (1) the use of ARBs combination therapies (p=5.7x10-4), an association that is significantly stronger in females (pdiff=0.01), and (2) with the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (p=5.5x10-4). While these associations need to be confirmed in larger sample sizes, they suggest that these variants play a role in diseases such as hypertension and chronic inflammation that are often observed in the more severe COVID-19 cases.

However, information regarding the impact of age on the innate immunity in response to SARS-CoV2 adenovirus vector vaccines and its association with specific immune responses remains scarce. METHODS: Fifteen subjects between 25-35 years (the young group) and five subjects between 60-70 years (the older adult group) were enrolled before ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccination. We determined activation markers and cytokine production of monocyte, natural killer (NK) cells and B cells ex vivo stimulated with TLR agonist (poly (I:C) for TLR3; LPS for TLR4; imiquimod for TLR7; CpG for TLR9) before vaccination and 3-5 days after each jab with flow cytometry. Anti-SARS-CoV2 neutralization antibody titers (surrogate virus neutralization tests, sVNTs) were measured using serum collected 2 months after the first jab and one month after full vaccination. RESULTS: The older adult vaccinees had weaker vaccine-induced sVNTs than young vaccinees after 1(st) jab (47.219.3% vs. 21.222.2%, p value<0.05), but this difference became insignificant after the 2(nd) jab. Imiquimod, LPS and CpG strongly induced CD86 expression in IgD(+)CD27(-) na?ve and IgD(-)CD27(+) memory B cells in the young group. In contrast, only the IgD(+) CD27(-) na?ve B cells responded to these TLR agonists in the older adult group. Imiquimode strongly induced the CD86 expression in CD14(+) monocytes in the young group but not in the older adult group. After vaccination, the young group had significantly higher IFN- expression in CD3(-) CD56(dim) NK cells after the 1(st) jab, whilst the older adult group had significantly higher IFN- and granzyme B expression in CD56(bright) NK cells after the 2(nd) jab (all p value <0.05). The IFN- expression in CD56(dim) and CD56(bright) NK cells after the first vaccination and CD86 expression in CD14(+) monocyte and IgD(-)CD27(-)double-negative B cells after LPS and imiquimod stimulation correlated with vaccine-induced antibody responses. CONCLUSIONS: The innate immune responses after the first vaccination correlated with the neutralizing antibody production. Older people may have defective innate immune responses by TLR stimulation and weak or delayed innate immune activation profile after vaccination compared with young people.","output":"Innate Immune Responses of Vaccinees Determine Early Neutralizing Antibody Production After ChAdOx1nCoV-19 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Modified endoscopic procedures for atrial fibrillation (AF) have a greater success rate because of the increased number of linear lesions. Concerns have been raised about the impact of ablation scars on the left atrium. This study aimed to examine the impact of ablation on left atrial dimension and systolic function after modified endoscopic procedures with echocardiographic measurement. METHODS Of 107 patients undergoing modified endoscopic ablation, 58 had paroxysmal AF and 49 had persistent or long-standing AF. The procedure was performed on the beating heart through three ports on the left chest wall. Three circular and two linear lesions were made on the left atrium. The left atrial appendage was excised by stapler. Echocardiography was performed preoperatively and at the 2-year follow-up. RESULTS Most patients (86.9%) patients were in sinus rhythm (SR) postoperatively. Fourteen patients (5 with paroxysmal AF and 9 with persistent/long-standing AF) failed to maintain SR. Echocardiographic data indicated that the left atrial diameter decreased only in the patients with postoperative SR but continued to increase in patients with fail SR maintenance. Left atrial function was also improved after the procedure, especially in patients with preoperative nonparoxysmal AF or with postoperative SR maintenance. Furthermore, left atrial function in patients who failed to restore SR was not worsened even with left atrial appendage excision. CONCLUSIONS Modified endoscopic procedure for AF improved post-procedural left atrial function of patients with SR maintenance. The left atrial function of patients with failed SR maintenance was also not worsened after left atrial appendage excision.","output":"Study on Left Atrial Dimension and Function After Modified Endoscopic Procedure for Atrial Fibrillation at Two Years' Follow-Up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from mild symptoms to severe complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. In this syndrome, inflammatory cytokines are released after activation of the inflammatory cascade, with the predominant role of interleukin (IL)-6. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of tocilizumab, as an IL-6 antagonist, in patients with severe or critical SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: In this prospective clinical trial, 76 patients with severe or critical SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated for eligibility, and ultimately, 42 patients were included. Tocilizumab was administered at a dose of 400 mg as a single dose via intravenous infusion. Primary outcomes included changes in oxygenation support, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and death. Secondary outcomes included radiological changes in the lungs, IL-6 plasma levels, C-reactive protein levels, and adverse drug reactions. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: Of the 42 included patients, 20 (48%) patients presented the severe infection stage and 22 (52%) were in the critical stage. The median age of patients was 56 years, and the median IL-6 level was 28.55 pg/mL. After tocilizumab administration, only 6 patients (14%) required invasive ventilation. Additionally, 35 patients (83.33%) showed clinical improvement. By day 28, a total of 7 patients died (6 patients in the critical stage and 1 patient in the severe stage).

However, in practice, the yield of the extraction process and the inhibition of the reverse transcription reaction and PCR by foreign substances reduce the sensitivity and may yield false negative results. The sensitivity of the PCR test can be improved by using technologies that can reliably capture the target nucleic acid and remove foreign substances. In this study, we developed photo-cross-linkable probe-modified magnetic particles (PPMPs) for the sequence-specific recovery of target nucleic acids using photo-cross-linkable artificial nucleic acid probes and magnetic particles. Nucleic acid probes modified with photo-cross-linkable artificial nucleic acids can hybridize with the target nucleic acids in a sequence-specific manner and then securely capture the target nucleic acids by UV irradiation-mediated covalent bonding. Then the target nucleic acid is detected by trapping the target-bound probe on the surface of the magnetic particles and subjecting these collected magnetic particles to PCR. Recovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) N gene pseudo-DNA (120 bp) was performed using PPMPs. We confirmed that the PPMPs captured the target consistently even after washes were done with denaturing agents and surfactants. Even in the presence of foreign DNA fragments, PPMPs were able to specifically recover the target DNA. This method allows for a more accurate detection by recovering only the target DNA for PCR. Hence, PPMPs can be successfully used for PCR-mediated detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens whose nucleic acid sequences are known.","output":"Photo-Cross-Linked Probe-Modified Magnetic Particles for the Selective and Reliable Recovery of Nucleic Acids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is influencing global health.

To address this challenge, medical specialists require a well-informed and safe approach to treating human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Herein, an environmental friendly approach for viral inactivation, based on plasma technology, was considered. A microwave plasma system was employed for the generation of the high amount of gaseous nitric oxide to prepare nitric oxide enriched plasma-activated water (NO-PAW), the effects of which on coronaviruses, have not been reported to date. To determine these effects, alpha-HCoV-229E was used in an experimental model. We found that NO-PAW treatment effectively inhibited coronavirus infection in host lung cells, visualized by evaluating the cytopathic effect and expression level of spike proteins. Interestingly, NO-PAW showed minimal toxicity towards lung host cells, suggesting its potential for therapeutic application. Moreover, this new approach resulted in viral inactivation and greatly improved the gene levels involved in host antiviral responses.

Understanding the biological mechanisms that link aging to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is essential for developing of therapeutic strategies. We hypothesized that cell senescence, a basic aging process that plays a pivotal role in lung diseases, is involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 including the development of long-lasting lung alterations. METHODS: To evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cell senescence, we (1) analyzed publicly available datasets of scRNA-seq performed in BALF cells from patients with moderate or severe/critical COVID-19; (2) investigated lung samples from cynomolgus macaques infected with 10(6) pfu of a SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate. Two macaques were sacrificed at 4 days post-infection (dpi.) and two others at 30 dpi. RESULTS: In BALF obtained within 10 days after symptom onset, the expression of several senescence markers, i.e., CDKN2A, CDKN1A (encoding p21), uPAR, CXCL8, IGFBP3, and GDF15 was significantly increased in epithelial cells in BALF from patients with severe COVID-19, suggesting that lung-cell senescence induction was contemporary of viral detection. Next, we investigated macaques at 4 and 30 dpi, corresponding respectively to the viral load peak and to the absence of detectable viral RNA in BALF (1). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed numerous SARS-CoV-2 antigen-stained cells, also co-stained for senescence markers p16- and p21. The lungs at 30 dpi no longer contained the consolidated parenchymal areas seen at 4 dpi but showed extensive lung parenchyma remodelling, with thickening of the alveoli and pulmonary vessel walls and abundant extracellular matrix deposits as assessed by collagen staining. These lesions were accompanied with massive accumulation of p16- and p21-positive cells, mostly pneumocytes II and ECs. Of note, p16 staining of most ECs was seen in pulmonary vessels, notably those occluded by thrombosis and showing intraluminal vWF staining. Cells stained for p16 were alsostained for the DNA damage markers -H2AX protein and p53-binding protein [1].

The aim of this study was to assess knowledge about aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination in sorghum alongside postharvest handling and storage practices among caregivers of children under five years old in Kerio Valley, Kenya. A cross\\\\sectional study was conducted to obtain data from 353 randomly selected caregivers of children aged 6C59 months. Qualitative data were obtained through Focus Group Discussions and Key Informant Interviews. Overall, majority of the caregivers of young children had poor knowledge (61.8%) about mycotoxin contamination of food, and poor postharvest handling and storage practices (74.5%).

These responses can also be of an autoimmune nature, and autoantibodies can sometimes be present even before the onset of clinically overt disease. Autoantibodies can be generated due to mutated gene products, aberrant expression and post-transcriptional modification of proteins, a pro-immunogenic milieu, anti-cancer treatments, cross-reactivity of tumor-specific lymphocytes, epitope spreading, and microbiota-related and genetic factors. Understanding these responses has implications for both basic and clinical immunology.

The X-ray spectra from the CGM depend on the temperature and metallicity of the emitting plasma, providing important information about the feeding and feedback of the galaxy. The observed spectra are commonly fitted using simple 1-Temperature (1-T) or 2-T models. However, the actual temperature distribution of the gas can be complex because of the interaction between galactic outflows and halo gas. Here we demonstrate this by analysing 3-D hydrodynamical simulations of the CGM with a realistic outflow model. We investigate the physical properties of the simulated hot CGM, which shows a broad distribution in density, temperature, and metallicity. By constructing and fitting the simulated spectra, we show that, while the 1-T and 2-T models are able to fit the synthesized spectra reasonably well, the inferred temperature(s) does not bear much physical meaning. Instead, we propose a log-normal distribution as a more physical model. The log-normal model better fits the simulated spectra while reproducing the gas temperature distribution. We also show that when the star formation rate is high, the spectra inside the bi-conical outflows are distinct from that outside, as outflows are generally hotter and more metal-enriched.

This paper aims to define system requirements for COVID-19 management under future transmission and response scenarios, based on surveillance system performance to date. MethodsFrom 1st November 2020 to 30th June 2021 community transmission was eliminated in Australia, allowing investigation of system performance in detecting novel outbreaks, including against variants of concern (VoCs). We characterised surveillance systems in place from peer-reviewed and publicly available data, analysed the epidemiological characteristics of novel outbreaks over this period, and assessed surveillance system sensitivity and timeliness in outbreak detection. These findings were integrated with analysis of other critical COVID-19 public health measures to establish requirements for future COVID-19 management. FindingsAustralia reported 25 epidemiologically distinct outbreaks and 5 distinct clusters of cases in the study period, all linked through genomic sequencing to breaches in quarantine facilities housing international travellers. Most (21/30, 70%) were detected through testing of those with acute respiratory illness in the community, and 9 through quarantine screening. For the 21 detected in the community, the testing rate (percent of the total State population tested in the week preceding detection) was 2.07% on average, was higher for those detected while prior outbreaks were ongoing. For 17/30 with data, the delay from the primary case to detection of the index case was, on average 4.9 days, with 10 of the 17 outbreaks detected within 5 days and 3 detected after > 7days. One outbreak was preceded by an unexpected positive wastewater detection. Of the 24 outbreaks in 2021, 20 had publicly available sequencing data, all of which were VoCs. Surveillance for future VoCs using a similar strategy to that used for detecting SARS-CoV-2 to date would necessitate a 100-1,000-fold increase in capacity for genomic sequencing. InterpretationAustralias surveillance systems performed well in detecting novel introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in a period when community transmission was eliminated, introductions were infrequent and case numbers were low. Detection relied on community surveillance in symptomatic members of the general population and quarantine screening, supported by comprehensive genomic sequencing. Once vaccine coverage is maximised, the priority for future COVID-19 control will shift to detection of SARS-CoV-2 Vos associated with increased severity of disease in the vaccinated and vaccine ineligible. This will require ongoing investment in maintaining surveillance systems and testing of all international arrivals, alongside greatly increased genomic sequencing capacity. Other essential requirements for managing voices are maintaining outbreak response capacity and developing capacity to rapidly engineer, manufacture, and distribute variant vaccines at scale. The most important factor in management of COVID-19 now and into the future will continue to be how effectively governments support all sectors of the community to engage in control measures.","output":"Opening up safely: public health system requirements for ongoing COVID-19 management based on evaluation of Australia's surveillance system performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a neuroimaging technique that allows to monitor the functional hemoglobin oscillations related to cortical activity.

The virus is transmitted through aerosol droplets, and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor-binding domain of its spike protein S1 to attach to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in lung and airway cells. Binding requires the help of another host protein, transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2. Several factors likely contribute to the efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a 10- to 20-fold higher receptor-binding capacity compared with previous pandemic coronaviruses. In addition, because asymptomatic persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 have high viral loads in their nasal secretions, they can silently and efficiently spread the disease. PCR-based tests have emerged as the criterion standard for the diagnosis of infection. Caution must be exercised in interpreting antibody-based tests because they have not yet been validated, and may give a false sense of security of being \\"immune\\" to SARS-CoV-2. We discuss how the development of some symptoms in allergic rhinitis can serve as clues for new-onset COVID-19. There are mixed reports that asthma is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, possibly due to differences in asthma endotypes. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has focused the efforts of scientists on repurposing existing Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs that inhibit viral entry, endocytosis, genome assembly, translation, and replication. Numerous clinical trials have been launched to identify effective treatments for COVID-19. Initial data from a placebo-controlled study suggest faster time to recovery in patients on remdesivir; it is now being evaluated in additional controlled studies. As discussed in this review, till effective vaccines and treatments emerge, it is important to understand the scientific rationale of pandemic-mitigation strategies such as wearing facemasks and social distancing, and implement them.","output":"Molecular mechanisms and epidemiology of COVID-19 from an allergist's perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a major public health problem. Dental procedures that generate aerosols are considered to impose a high risk of infection; therefore, dental professionals, such as dentists and dental hygienists, are considered to be at high risk of viral transmission. However, few studies have reported COVID-19 clusters in dental care settings. Aim: This study aimed to investigate whether dental and oral/maxillofacial procedures are associated with the occurrence of COVID-19 clusters and measures taken to prevent nosocomial infection in dental clinics. METHODS: An online questionnaire survey on clinical activities (administrative control), infection control measures (environmental/engineering control, personal protective equipment [PPE], etc.), and confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases among patients and clinical staff was administered to the faculties of the dental and oral/maxillofacial surgical departments of university hospitals. FINDINGS: Fifty-one faculty members completed the questionnaire. All members were engaged in the treatment of dental and oral surgical outpatients and actively implemented standard precautions. Fourteen faculty members treated patients with COVID-19, but no infections transmitted from the patients to the medical staff were observed. In seven facilities, patients were found to have the infection after treatment (medical staff came in close contact), but there was no transmission from patients to medical staff. Four facilities had medical staff with infections, but none of them exhibited disease transmission from staff to patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 clusters are unlikely to occur in dental and oral surgical care settings if appropriate protective measures are implemented.","output":"COVID-19 transmission in dental and oral/maxillofacial surgical practice during pandemic: questionnaire survey in 51 university hospitals in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we carry out a comparative analysis between the US and South Korea, with a special attention to three key areas, including the stock market, the currency market, and the bond market.

Repeated point prevalence surveys (serial testing of all residents and health care personnel at a health care facility irrespective of symptoms) have been used to identify asymptomatic infections and have reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission during SNF outbreaks (1,3). During March 2020, the Detroit Health Department and area hospitals detected a sharp increase in COVID-19 diagnoses, hospitalizations, and associated deaths among SNF residents. The Detroit Health Department collaborated with local government, academic, and health care system partners and a CDC field team to rapidly expand SARS-CoV-2 testing and implement infection prevention and control (IPC) activities in all Detroit-area SNFs. During March 7-May 8, among 2,773 residents of 26 Detroit SNFs, 1,207 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified during three periods: before (March 7-April 7) and after two point prevalence surveys (April 8-25 and April 30-May 8): the overall attack rate was 44%. Within 21 days of receiving their first positive test results, 446 (37%) of 1,207 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized, and 287 (24%) died. Among facilities participating in both surveys (n = 12), the percentage of positive test results declined from 35% to 18%. Repeated point prevalence surveys in SNFs identified asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, informed cohorting and IPC practices aimed at reducing transmission, and guided prioritization of health department resources for facilities experiencing high levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. With the increased availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing, repeated point prevalence surveys and enhanced and expanded IPC support should be standard tools for interrupting and preventing COVID-19 outbreaks in SNFs.","output":"Initial and Repeated Point Prevalence Surveys to Inform SARS-CoV-2 Infection Prevention in 26 Skilled Nursing Facilities  Detroit, Michigan, MarchCMay 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of COVID-19 within a region in South East Asia has been modelled using a compartment model called SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered).

Since these patients are still affected by poor outcome and increased mortality, we investigated the safety and efficacy of the plasma cell depleting anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab in life-threatening, antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. METHODS In this retrospective, single-center case series, seven patients with autoantibody-driven neurological autoimmune diseases (autoimmune encephalitis n=5, neurofascin-antibody associated chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with sporadic late onset nemaline myopathy n=1, seronegative myasthenia gravis n=1) unresponsive to a median of 4 (range 4-9) immunotherapies were treated with 4-20 cycles of 16mg/kg daratumumab. RESULTS Daratumumab allowed a substantial clinical improvement in all patients, as measured by modified Rankin Scale (before treatment: mRS=5 n=7; after treatment: median mRS=4 [range 0-5]), Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis (from median 21 to 3 points, n=5), Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment Disability Score (from 7 to 0 points, n=1) and Quantitative Myasthenia gravis Score (from 16 to 8 points, n=1). Daratumumab induced a substantial reduction of disease-specific autoreactive antibodies, total IgG (serum 66%, n=7; CSF 58%, n=5) and vaccine-induced titers for rubella (50%) and tetanus toxoid (74%).

Ophthalmologists may have difficulty identifying dysmorphic features in genetic syndrome evaluations. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of Face2Gene (F2G), a digital image analysis software trained on integrating dysmorphic features, by analysing patient photos from genetics textbooks. METHODS: We analysed all clear facial photos contained within the textbooks Smiths Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation and Genetic Diseases of the Eye using F2G under standard lighting conditions. Variables captured include colour versus grey scale photo, the gender of the patient (if known), age of the patient (if known), disease categories, diagnosis as listed in the textbook, and whether the disease has ophthalmic involvement (as described in the textbook entries). Any photos rejected by F2G were excluded. We analysed the data for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity based on disease categories as outlined in Smiths Recognizable Patterns of Malformation. RESULTS: We analysed 353 photos found within two textbooks. The exact book diagnosis was identified by F2G in 150 (42.5%) entries, and was included in the top three differential diagnoses in 191 (54.1%) entries. F2G is highly sensitive for craniosynostosis syndromes (point estimate [PE] 80.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 56.3C94.3%, P = 0.0118) and syndromes with facial defects as a major feature (PE 77.8%, 95% CI 52.4C93.6%, P = 0.0309).

Platelets obtained from blood draws can be used for therapeutic applications, especially platelet transfusion. The needs for platelet transfusions for clinical situation is increasing, due in part to the growing number of patients undergoing chemotherapy. Platelets obtained from donors, however, have the disadvantages of a limited storage lifespan and the risk of donor\\\\related infection. Extensive effort has therefore been directed at manufacturing platelets ex vivo. Here, we review ex vivo technologies for MK development, focusing on human adipose tissue\\\\derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cell line (ASCL)\\\\based strategies and their potential clinical application. Bone marrow and adipose tissues contain mesenchymal stem/stromal cells that have an ability to differentiate into MKs, which release platelets. Taking advantage of this mechanism, we developed a donor\\\\independent system for manufacturing platelets for clinical application using ASCL established from adipose\\\\derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (ASCs). Culture of ASCs with endogenous thrombopoietin and its receptor c\\\\MPL, and endogenous genes such as p45NF\\\\E2 leads to MK differentiation and subsequent platelet production. ASCs compose heterogeneous cells, however, and are not suitable for clinical application. Thus, we established ASCLs, which expand into a more homogeneous population, and fulfill the criteria for mesenchymal stem cells set by the International Society for Cellular Therapy. Using our ASCL culture system with MK lineage induction medium without recombinant thrombopoietin led to peak production of platelets within 12 days, which may be sufficient for clinical application.","output":"Platelet production using adipose\\\\derived mesenchymal stem cells: Mechanistic studies and clinical application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to infect humans and camels, calling for efficient, cost-effective, and broad-spectrum strategies to control its spread. Nanobodies (Nbs) are single-domain antibodies derived from camelids and sharks and are potentially cost-effective antivirals with small size and great expression yield. In this study, we developed a novel neutralizing Nb (NbMS10) and its human-Fc-fused version (NbMS10-Fc), both of which target the MERS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We further tested their receptor-binding affinity, recognizing epitopes, cross-neutralizing activity, half-life, and efficacy against MERS-CoV infection. Both Nbs can be expressed in yeasts with high yield, bind to MERS-CoV RBD with high affinity, and block the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to the MERS-CoV receptor. The binding site of the Nbs on the RBD was mapped to be around residue Asp539, which is part of a conserved conformational epitope at the receptor-binding interface. NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc maintained strong cross-neutralizing activity against divergent MERS-CoV strains isolated from humans and camels. Particularly, NbMS10-Fc had significantly extended half-life in vivo; a single-dose treatment of NbMS10-Fc exhibited high prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy by completely protecting humanized mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. Overall, this study proves the feasibility of producing cost-effective, potent, and broad-spectrum Nbs against MERS-CoV and has produced Nbs with great potentials as anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Therapeutic development is critical for preventing and treating continual MERS-CoV infections in humans and camels. Because of their small size, nanobodies (Nbs) have advantages as antiviral therapeutics (e.g., high expression yield and robustness for storage and transportation) and also potential limitations (e.g., low antigen-binding affinity and fast renal clearance). Here, we have developed novel Nbs that specifically target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike protein. They bind to a conserved site on MERS-CoV RBD with high affinity, blocking RBD's binding to MERS-CoV receptor. Through engineering a C-terminal human Fc tag, the in vivo half-life of the Nbs is significantly extended. Moreover, the Nbs can potently cross-neutralize the infections of diverse MERS-CoV strains isolated from humans and camels. The Fc-tagged Nb also completely protects humanized mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. Taken together, our study has discovered novel Nbs that hold promise as potent, cost-effective, and broad-spectrum anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents.","output":"A Novel Nanobody Targeting Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Receptor-Binding Domain Has Potent Cross-Neutralizing Activity and Protective Efficacy against MERS-CoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Over 500 viruses and bacteria primarily cause respiratory infections During COVID-19 pandemic, these respiratory infections remain;i e , COVID-19 has no ability to suppress these infections from the circulation Therefore, it is very important to differentiate respiratory infections from COVID-19 Proving the presence of COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is not evidence that the disease was caused by this virus Possible options are: First, a random encounter of the virus in the patients upper respiratory tract;second, further possible colonization with a coronavirus (or with COVID-19);the third option is to have an infection;and the fourth possibility is to have a disease or COVID-19 upper respiratory infection Unfortunately, the method with PCR, although it is with high sensitivity and specificity, does not help us to distinguish which of these four possibilities are in question AIM: We aimed to present a guide to leading a patient with symptoms of an acute respiratory infection during a coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) RESULTS: A pandemic of COVID-19 shows that many patients get primary viral pneumonia, but people with normal immune system have no problem recovering People with reduced immunity die from COVID-19, as opposed to the pandemic influenza virus It is indirectly concluded that COVID-19 in itself is not very virulent, but it weakens the immunity of those infected who already have some condition and impaired immunity The available scientific papers show that there is no strong cytokine response, patients have leukopenia and lymphopenia, some patients have a decrease in CD4 T-lymphocytes From the results of the autopsies available so far, it is clear that there are very few inflammatory cells in the lungs and a lot of fluid domination Hence, SARS-Cov-2 only somehow speeds up the decline in immunity The previously published radiographic findings of COVID-19 patients, gave a characteristic findings of the presence of multifocal nodules, described as milky glass, very often localized in the periphery of the lung Whether it is typical pneumonia, atypical, viral, mixed-type pneumonia, or mycotic pneumonia, it can progress to severe pneumonia The pneumonia becomes severe when breathing is over 30/min;diastolic pressure below 60 mmHg;low partial oxygen pressure in the blood (PaO2/FiO2 &lt;250 mmHg) (1 mmHg = 0 133 kPa);massive pneumonia, bilateral or multilayered lung X-ray;desorientation;leukopenia;and increased urea CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 placed in intensive care units should be led by a team of anesthesiologists with an infectious disease specialist or an anesthesiologist with a pulmonologist Critical respiratory parameters should be peripheral oxygen saturation &lt;90%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio 100 or &lt;100, tachycardia above 110/min","output":"Guide to leading a patient with symptoms of an acute respiratory infection during a coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our many voices form the human chorus Here, we present six diverse perspectives that share a common thread: how COVID-19 has changed our lives We hear about the difficulties of providing palliative care on the front, the challenges patients seeking gender-affirming surgeries face, the loss of rituals built into healthcare visits, the pivots researchers take to study SARS-CoV-2, as well as the unique mental health impact of an ongoing trauma These are but a few of the myriad voices that represent our COVID-19 collective Yet they highlight a reality: a pandemic not only touches all people, but also elicits responses we never quite imagined","output":"Voices from a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread globally.

MPM is a lethal cancer, with very little survival improvements in the last years, mirroring very limited therapeutic advances. Platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with pemetrexed and surgery are the standard of care, but prognosis is still unacceptably poor with median overall survival of approximately 12 months. The genomic landscape of MPM has been widely characterized showing a low mutational burden and the impairment of tumor suppressor genes. Among them, BAP1 and BLM are present as a germline inactivation in a small subset of patients and increases predisposition to tumorigenesis. Other studies have demonstrated a high frequency of mutations in DNA repair genes. Many therapy approaches targeting these alterations have emerged and are under evaluation in the clinic. High-throughput technologies have allowed the detection of more complex molecular events, like chromotripsis and revealed different transcriptional programs for each histological subtype. Transcriptional analysis has also paved the way to the study of tumor-infiltrating cells, thus shedding lights on the crosstalk between tumor cells and the microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment of MPM is indeed crucial for the pathogenesis and outcome of this disease; it is characterized by an inflammatory response to asbestos exposure, involving a variety of chemokines and suppressive immune cells such as M2-like macrophages and regulatory T cells.

Design/methodology/approach - With the help of well-structured questionnaire, the study has surveyed 80 food outlets in total by interviewing the managers and owners of these outlets. Food outlets have been classified into four categories namely international, national, local and street food outlets. Econometric techniques like MANOVA and Garret ranking have been employed to fulfil the objective of the study. Findings - The results depict that the impact of COVID-19 on employment level and liquidity constraints is significantly asymmetric amongst different groups of food outlets, even though the decline in extent of clientele is somewhat same for all groups. The survival aspect of outlets also witnesses clear-cut asymmetry in results as big outlets have greater potential to survive for longer if lockdown happens again when compared to street food outlets as their financial availability and stability differ. Research limitations/implications - The sample size of study is restricted, mainly due to lesser number of national franchise's food outlets available in Amritsar, though other categories of eateries were sufficient in number. Further, the study is restricted only to one district of Punjab state, whereas for future research, inter-district comparison can be done. Practical implications - The findings reveal that the street food outlets may gain by fostering its online functioning. Similarly national food outlets are encouraged to alter their business strategies to revive their sales against their competitors. Originality/value - This study is one of the explorer studies to analyse the impact of COVID-19 by making an intra-industry comparison for the eatery industry - considering four different categories of eateries. The classification of eateries helps in analysing whether the employment level, clientele rate, liquidity constraints and survival perspective have been affected symmetrically for the whole eateries industry or does severity of being affected differ asymmetrically.

Hence, it is essential to survey and forecast pollens for the management of pollen allergy. Weather conditions may alter pollen concentrations. A number of studies have shown that increases in CO(2) concentration and atmospheric temperature raise pollen concentration. Hence most of the studies on the impact of climate change on aeroallergens must include the amount and allergenicity of pollens. It is yet unknown whether complex interactions with pollens, meteorological variables, and air pollutants in the changing environment. Considering the effect of climate change on the long-term trends in pollen levels and emerging viral infection, it is crucial to forecast and eliminate the associated risk for human health in future and take appropriate measures to reduce it.","output":"Pollen Allergy in a Changing Planetary Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Astragali Radix (Huangqi) is an important herb medicine that is always processed into pieces for clinical use. Many operations need to be performed before use, among which drying of Astragali Radix (AR) pieces is a key step. Unfortunately, research on its drying mechanism is still limited. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques were applied to study the moisture state and distribution during drying. The content of bioactive components and texture changes were measured by HPLC and texture analyzer, respectively. The moisture content of the AR pieces decreased significantly during drying, and the time to reach the drying equilibrium were different at different temperatures. The time when at 70C, 80C, and 90C reach complete drying are 180 min, 150 min and 120 min, respectively. 80C was determined as the optimum drying temperature, and it was observed that the four flavonoids and astragaloside IV have some thermal stability in AR pieces. When dried at 80C, although the total water content decreased, the free water content decreased from 99.38% to 15.49%, in contrast to the increase in bound water content from 0.62% to 84.51%. The texture parameters such as hardness changed to some extent, with the hardness rising most significantly from 686.23 g to 2656.67 g. Correlation analysis revealed some connection between moisture content and LF-NMR and texture analyzer parameters, but the springiness did not show a clear correlation with most parameters. This study shows that HPLC, LF-NMR, MRI, and texture analyzers provide a scientific basis for elucidating the drying principles of AR pieces. The method is useful and shows potential for extension and application; therefore, it can be easily extended to other natural herb medicines.","output":"Evaluation of processing mechanism in Astragali Radix by low-field nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Continuous rise in the number of COVID-19 cases, since it was first diagnosed in 2019, forced the entire medical fraternity to delay elective surgeries. The preoperative evaluation guidelines that were used in the pre-COVID-19 era underwent significant changes, adding modifications to meet the post-COVID patients' specific criteria and requirements. Currently, all patients before or at the time of hospital admission were tested using a nasopharyngeal swab, by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Apart from this, for a patient undergoing elective surgery in their post-COVID-19 period, it is mandatory to obtain a detailed history of COVID-19 disease/SARS-CoV-2 infection, to identify residual symptoms or any organ dysfunction the infection might have caused. As well as the functional optimization of the patient to achieve the best clinical and biological status before the surgery. After all the systems have been thoroughly investigated, the risk-benefit ratio needs to be calculated, keeping in mind the cytokine storm and inflammatory responses encountered postoperatively. A mere negative RT-PCR test cannot be considered as the only decisive factor to operate, as the post-COVID-19 phase can influence postoperative outcome of the patient. Hence, the pre-operative evaluation protocols of post-COVID patients should be set and followed thoroughly, in order to avoid post-surgical complications. For better surgical and post-surgical management of post-COVID-19 patients, conducting clinical tests, assessing previously administered medications, evaluating the need for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxes, and identifying subclinical inflammatory state are the measures that should be taken.","output":"The preoperative evaluation of post-COVID-19 patients scheduled for elective surgery - What is important not to miss!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyse the measures adopted by the Spanish Government to try to protect tenants who are in a situation of special economic vulnerability due to the health crisis of COVID-19, studying, in particular, the moratorium on the payment of the rent ? 2020 Ibero-American Law Institute All rights reserved","output":"Measures to reduce the adverse effects of COVID-19 on rentals of usual housing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite reaching a point of acceptance as a research tool across the geographical and social sciences, there remain significant methodological challenges for agent\\\\based models.

Motivated by the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, the article provides an overview of scientific evidence regarding adverse impact of diverse human disasters on mental health in afflicted groups and societies. Following this broader context, psychosocial impact of COVID-19 as a specific global human disaster is presented, with an emphasis on disturbing mental health aspects of the ongoing pandemic. Limited resources of mental health services in a number of countries around the world are illustrated, which will be further stretched by the forthcoming increase in demand for mental health services due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health challenges are particularly important for the Republic of Croatia in the current situation, due to disturbing stress of the 2020 Zagreb earthquake and the high pre-pandemic prevalence of chronic Homeland-War-related posttraumatic stress disorders. Comprehensive approach based on digital psychiatry is proposed to address the lack of access to psychiatric services, which includes artificial intelligence, telepsychiatry and an array of new technologies, like internet-based computer-aided mental health tools and services. These tools and means should be utilized as an important part of the whole package of measures to mitigate negative mental health effects of the global coronavirus pandemic. Our scientific and engineering experiences in the design and development of digital tools and means in mitigation of stress-related disorders and assessment of stress resilience are presented.

A wound infiltrated with biofilm, or \\"critically colonised\\" wound, may become clinically infected if the number of microbes exceeds a critical level. Chronic wound biofilms represent a significant treatment challenge by demonstrating recalcitrance towards antimicrobial agents. However, a \\"window of opportunity\\" may exist after wound debridement when biofilms are more susceptible to topical antiseptics. Here, we discuss the role of antiseptics in the management of chronic wounds and biofilm, focusing on povidone-iodine (PVP-I) in comparison with two commonly used antiseptics: polyhexanide (PHMB) and silver. This article is based on the literature reviewed during a focus group meeting on antiseptics in wound care and biofilm management, and on a PubMed search conducted in March 2020. Compared with PHMB and silver, PVP-I has a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity, potent antibiofilm efficacy, no acquired bacterial resistance or cross-resistance, low cytotoxicity, good tolerability, and an ability to promote wound healing. PVP-I represents a viable therapeutic option in wound care and biofilm management, with the potential to treat biofilm-infiltrated, critically colonised wounds. We propose a practical algorithm to guide the management of chronic, non-healing wounds due to critical colonisation or biofilm, using PVP-I.","output":"Update on the role of antiseptics in the management of chronic wounds with critical colonisation and/or biofilm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world, and the vaccine has emerged as a source of hope for return to normal life. Still, various countries have reported high vaccine hesitancy rates. It is important to know the vaccine hesitancy profile in Brazil to help design adequate communication strategies. Methods A voluntary, anonymous online survey was conducted from January 22 to 29, 2021, including resident Brazilian adults to assess factors related to vaccine hesitancy. Sociodemographic and epidemiological data were analyzed. A bivariate analysis was conducted with the independent variables, with vaccine hesitancy as the outcome variable, and a multivariate logistic model was used to calculated adjusted odds ratios. Results The sample included 173,178 respondents, and vaccine hesitancy was found in 10.5%. The principal factors associated with vaccine hesitancy were the following: assigning importance to the vaccins efficacy (AOR=16.39), fear of adverse reactions (AOR = 11.23), and assigning importance to the vaccins country of origin (AOR=3.72). Other risk factors were the following: male gender (AOR=1.62), having children (AOR=1.29), 9 years of schooling or less (AOR=1.31), living in the Central-West region (AOR=1.19), age  40 years (AOR=1.17), and monthly income < U$788.68 (AOR=1.13). The two vaccines available in Brazil, Covishield and CoronaVac, showed similar confidence, 80.13% and 76.36%, respectively, despite the higher rejection of the latter vaccins Chinese origin. Interpretation: This online survey confirms the low vaccine hesitancy rate among Brazilians and allowed the identification of a profile that can assist the elaboration of communication strategies to increase vaccine adherence.

Over the next two years as more approved vaccines are made available and supply meets or exceeds demand, medical and public health professionals will increasingly be faced with the challenge of vaccine hesitancy. There is an urgent need to create demand in groups that are either uninformed, vaccine hesitant, or actively resistant to COVID-19 vaccination. This study reviews theory, evidence, and practice recommendations to develop a vaccine demand creation strategy that has wide applicability. Specifically, we focus on key elements including supply side confidence, vaccine brand promotion strategy, service marketing as it relates to vaccine distribution, and competition strategy. We present evidence that these strategies can make a significant contribution to overcoming COVID-19 hesitancy in a high supply scenario. The paper also makes recommendations about factors that need to be considered in relation to vaccine delivery services and systems that, if done badly, may reduce uptake or result in the creation of more vaccine hesitancy. In summary, there is a need for well researched and tested demand creation strategies that integrate with brand strategy, supply side, and service delivery.","output":"Demand Creation for COVID-19 Vaccination: Overcoming Vaccine Hesitancy through Social Marketing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The molecular details of biomolecular kinetics present a challenging estimation problem because the identities of relevant intermediates and the rates of exchange between them must be determined.

The present study aimed to identify mutational hotspots in PKC and disease-causing non-synonymous variants (nsSNPs) along with the investigation of nsSNPs impact on protein dynamics. Twenty-nine in silico tools were applied to determine nsSNPs' deleteriousness, their impact on protein dynamics and disease association, along with the prediction of PKC post-translational modification (PTM) sites. The present study's outcomes indicated that most nsSNPs were concentrated in the PKC hinge region and C-terminal tail. Most pathogenic variants mapped on the kinase domain. Regulatory domain variants influenced PKC interaction with molecular players, whereas kinase domain variants were predicted to impact its phosphorylation pattern and protein-protein interactions. Most PTM sites were mapped on the hinge region. PKC nsSNPs have an association with oncogenicity and its expression dysregulation is responsible for poor overall survival. Understanding nsSNPs structural impact is a primary step necessary for delineating the relationship of genetic level differences with protein phenotype.

Lastly, several mechanisms for the known anti-coronavirus activity of alkaloids were discussed, showing that the alkaloids are interesting compounds with potential use as bioactive agents against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Alkaloids: Therapeutic Potential against Human Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Therapists are increasing recognised as core members of the critical care multiprofessional team. Each therapy profession provides specialist assessments and interventions, but also work collaboratively across the rehabilitation pathway. Despite inclusion in several national guidance documents, there remains a lack of evidence regarding the perceived role of therapists working within critical care, the unique contributions of each profession and opinion on the day-to-day tasks and responsibilities of each therapy profession. METHOD: A descriptive qualitative methodology was used involving seven focus groups. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit therapists via professional specialist interest groups. All focus groups were uniprofessional and discussions based on a predesigned framework. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Participants (n=65) from across the UK were recruited to seven focus groups with an average of 18.3 years postgraduate clinical experience of which 11.6 years was within critical care. Three core themes were generated from 875 codes and 237 potential subthemes. The final themes were (1) professional characteristics; (2) multidisciplinary team and (3) staffing. An additional theme of COVID-19 pandemic was also identified. Findings were similar across all profession groups particularly regarding the need for holistic, patient-centred care. Expected variation was observed for professional characteristics especially regarding specific assessments and interventions. DISCUSSION: Therapy services are an essential component to the delivery of critical care especially regarding recovery and rehabilitation. Through three core themes, this qualitative study has provided new evidence of the perceptions and opinions of the role that therapists undertake within critical care.","output":"Exploration of therapists views of practice within critical care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Three cases are presented that are characterised by an acute psychopathological decompensation during the state of alarm in Spain due to the COVID-19 epidemic, as an example of the mental morbidity that can be generated as a result of the confinement and social isolation measures.

However, there are no studies in literature showing effects of online Pilates exercises that create proprioceptive inputs on vertebra on trunk proprioception. AIMS: This study aims to reveal effect of online Pilates exercises conducted on trunk proprioception and core muscle endurance in healthy individuals. METHODS: We included thirty-three healthy individuals between ages of 18 and 25 in study. Individuals were randomly divided into two groups. There were 17 individuals in Pilates group (PG), and 16 individuals in control group (CG). The PG was given online Pilates exercises by the physiotherapist in groups 3 days a week for 6 weeks, 1 h a day. There was no exercise program recommended for individuals in CG. We evaluated trunk proprioception with an inclinometer, core muscle endurance with three core endurance tests created by McGill, and prone bridge tests. All evaluations completed just before start of study and 2 days after 6-week training. RESULTS: Two groups had similar demographic characteristics, and there was no difference between baseline measurements (p > 0.05). While improvement observed in PG in trunk proprioception and all of core muscle endurance tests (p < 0.05), no statistically significant difference reported in CG (p > 0.05).

However, previous studies have not investigated the effect of air humidity on the spring phenology using long-term and large-scale ground observations. Therefore, the role of humidity in spring phenology in temperate trees still remains poorly understood. Here, we synthesized 229,588 records of leaf unfolding dates in eight temperate tree species, including four early-successional and four late-successional species, at 1716 observation sites during 1951-2015 in Europe, and comprehensively analyzed the effect of humidity on the spring phenology. We found that rising humidity significantly delayed spring leaf unfolding for all eight temperate tree species. Leaf unfolding was more sensitive to humidity in early-successional species compared to late-successional species. In addition, the delaying effect of humidity on leaf unfolding increased as temperature warmed over the past 65 years. Our results provide evidence that spring leaf unfolding of temperate trees was significantly delayed by rising humidity. The delaying effect of humidity may restrict earlier spring phenology induced by warming, especially for early-successional species, under future climate warming scenarios in temperate forests.","output":"Delaying effect of humidity on leaf unfolding in Europe."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An interview with Emilia Forrester, head dental nurse at dental practice provider Smile Essential, is presented with topics covered such as the importance of gaining trust in a team, the challenge of completing an English test as a dental nurse, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on infection control.","output":"What makes a good leader?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED The objective of this paper is to introduce the schematic protocol of radiofrequency (RF) ablation for the treatment of varicose veins.

DCs were significantly reduced with functional impairment, and ratios of conventional DCs to plasmacytoid DCs were increased among acute severe patients. Besides lymphocytopenia, although neutralizing antibodies were rapidly and abundantly generated in patients, there were delayed receptor binding domain (RBD)- and nucleocapsid protein (NP)-specific T cell responses during the first 3 weeks after symptoms onset. Moreover, acute RBD- and NP-specific T cell responses included relatively more CD4 T cells than CD8 T cells.

Methods: We measured T cell responses in 108 healthcare workers (HCWs) in an observational cohort study, using the commercialised Oxford Immunotec T-SPOT Discovery SARS-CoV-2 assay (OI T-SPOT) and the PITCH ELISpot protocol established for academic research settings. Results: Both assays detected T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. Responses were significantly lower when reported by OI T-SPOT than by PITCH ELISpot. Four weeks after two doses of either Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 AZD1222 vaccine, the responder rate was 63% for OI T-SPOT Panels1+2 (peptides representing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein excluding regions present in seasonal coronaviruses), 69% for OI T-SPOT Panel 14 (peptides representing the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike), and 94% for the PITCH ELISpot assay. The two OI T-SPOT panels correlated strongly with each other showing that either readout quantifies spike-specific T cell responses, although the correlation between the OI T-SPOT panels and the PITCH ELISpot was moderate. Conclusion: The standardisation, relative scalability and longer interval between blood acquisition and processing are advantages of the commercial OI T-SPOT assay. However, the OI T-SPOT assay measures T cell responses at a significantly lower magnitude compared to the PITCH ELISpot assay, detecting T cell responses in a lower proportion of vaccinees.

The ensuing multiorgan system failure frequently has a fatal outcome, with mortality rates in most series ranging from approximately 55% to 95% [1]. Acute liver failure (ALF, previously often referred to as fulminant hepatic failure (FHF)) knows no age boundaries, with many cases occurring in those younger than 30 years. Short of excellent intensive care unit (ICU) support and liver transplantation in selected cases, few viable treatment options are available. Over the past few decades, however, survival has been improved by anticipation, recognition, and early treatment of associated complications, as well as the application of prognostic criteria for early identification of patients requiring liver transplantation (along with improvement in the techniques and science of transplantation itself). The etiology of ALF varies from country to country and the incidence change over time. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has now replaced viral hepatitis as the leading cause of ALF [2]. In a study from London including 310 patients with ALF in the period 1994C2004, 42% of the cases were caused by paracetamol [3], whereas this was only the cause in 2% of 267 patients in Spain from 1992 to 2000 [4].

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to develop and validate liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays for tacrolimus and creatinine analysis using Mitra devices. The usefulness of this approach was assessed in renal transplant patients routinely monitored for tacrolimus and creatinine. METHOD: Routine tacrolimus samples were used to assess the utility and reliability of Mitra sampling. Shared sample preparation for both tacrolimus and creatinine was carried out in a 96-deep well plate; mass spectrometric analysis was then undertaken for tacrolimus followed by re-injection for creatinine analysis. RESULTS: Comparison of 131 Mitra samples with a routine LC-MS/MS assay for tacrolimus showed a minimal bias -5.6% (95% CI -8.5 to -2.7%). Comparison of 135 serum and Mitra samples for creatinine using a fully validated LC-MS/MS assay showed a bias -6.5% (95% CI -8.5 to -4.5%).

Previously, we have shown that induction of PCA by MHV-3 correlated with resistance/susceptibility to infection in different mouse strains. In this study, all BALB/cJ mice that were infected with 10(3) plaque-forming units of MHV-3 developed severe liver disease and died within 96-120 h. Examination of the livers of these animals showed marked hepatic necrosis, deposition of fibrin, and cellular expression of PCA by direct immunofluorescence staining in areas of necrosis as well as in hepatic sinusoids. Splenic mononuclear cells recovered from these mice expressed high concentrations of PCA with time after infection. Infusion into mice of a high-titered monoclonal antibody that neutralized PCA (3D4.3) attenuated the development of hepatic necrosis and enhanced survival in a dose- dependent manner. All of the animals receiving 100 micrograms, and 44% and 22% of the animals that received 50 and 25 micrograms per day, respectively, survived for 10 d and made a full recovery. Administration of the antibody resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in fibrin deposition, PCA expression as detected by direct immunofluorescence staining and by a functional assay. In animals treated with high concentrations of antibody, titers of antibody to PCA fell from 87 +/- 15 micrograms/ml to 100 +/- 7 ng/ml during the active phase of the disease, consistent with sequestration due to binding of the immunoglobulin to cells expressing PCA. Surviving animals, when rechallenged with MHV-3, had a 40% mortality, consistent with the known rates of metabolism of immunoglobulin. This further suggested that protection was by a passive mechanism.

Emerging evidence has suggested a link between the infection and gut microbiome status. This is one of the several factors that may contribute towards severity of infection. Given the fact that the gut is heavily linked to immunity, inflammatory status and the ability to challenge pathogens, it is worthwhile to consider dietary intervention of the gut microbiota as means of potentially challenging the viral outcome. In this context, probiotics and prebiotics have been used to mitigate similar respiratory infections.

The oxidative damage of lipids in membranes or lipoproteins is one of these deleterious consequences that not only alters lipid function but also leads to the formation of neo-self epitopes  oxidation-specific epitopes (OSEs)  which are present on dying cells and damaged proteins. OSEs represent endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns that are recognized by pattern recognition receptors and the proteins of the innate immune system, and thereby enable the host to sense and remove dangerous biological waste and to maintain homeostasis. If this system is dysfunctional or overwhelmed, the accumulation of OSEs can trigger chronic inflammation and the development of diseases, such as atherosclerosis and age-related macular degeneration. Understanding the molecular components and mechanisms that are involved in this process will help to identify individuals with an increased risk of developing chronic inflammation, and will also help to indicate novel modes of therapeutic intervention.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all admissions under the urology service at Liverpool Hospital, Australia from February 1st to April 30th for 2020 and the previous 5 years. RESULTS: There was a total of 397 admissions in 2020 and 438 in 2019. The mean age, proportion of male, and mean length of stay were similar. In 2020, there were 229 emergency admissions. Over the same period during the previous 5 years, there were between 195 and 218 emergency admissions. In 2019, there were 220 planned admissions and 168 in 2020. Between 2019 and 2020, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with admission longer than 10 days (P = 0.602), requiring intensive care unit admission (P = 0.708) or inpatient operative management (P = 0.171).

Methods: Participants were enrolled and monitored through 24-week (From March 29th to Sep 30th, 2020) regularly scheduled phone calls performed by trained medical professionals. Epidemiological and demographic data, as well as RD disease activity status and current treatment data, specific information about COVID-19, hospitalization, need for intensive care, and death was recorded in both groups and stored in the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. COVID-19 was defined according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health (BMH) criteria. The statistical analysis was performed using IBM-SPSS v.20.0 software. Group comparisons were made using the Man-Whitney, Chi-Square and Fisher Exact Test, as well as multivariate regression models adjusted to confounders. Survival curves were performed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: A total of 10,427 participants mean age (SD) of 44.04 (14.98) years were enrolled, including 6004 (57.6%) rheumatic disease patients, of whom 70.8% had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 6.7% rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 4% primary Sj?gren's syndrome (pSS), 1.8% mixed connective tissue disease (DMTC), 1% systemic sclerosis (SSc) and others (15.9), including overlap syndromes. In total, 1,132 (10.8%) participants fulfilled criteria for COVID-19, being 6.7% RD patients and 4.1% controls (p=0.002). A recent influenza vaccination had a protective role (p<0.001). Moderate and severe COVID-19 included the need for hospitalization, intensive care, mechanical ventilation or death. Infection severity was not different between groups (p=0.391) (Table 1). After adjustments for multiple confounders, the main risk factors significantly associated with COVID-19 were higher education level (OR=1.29 95%CI 1.05-1.59), being healthcare professionals (OR=1.91;95%CI 1.45-2.53), presence of two comorbidities (OR=1.31;95%CI 1.01-1.66) and three or more comorbidities associated (OR=1.69;95%CI 1.23-2.32). Interestingly, age =65 years (OR=0.20;95%CI 0.11-0.34) was negatively associated. Regarding RD, the risk factors associated with COVID-19 diagnosys were SLE (OR= 2.37;95%CI 1.92-293), SSc (OR=2.25;95%CI 1.05-4.83) and rituximab use (OR=1.92;95%CI 1.13-3.26). In addition, age =65 years (OR=5.47;95%CI 1.7-19.4) and heart disease (OR=2.60;95%CI 1.06-6.38) were associated with hospitalization. Seven female RD patients died, six with SLE and one with pSS, and the presence of two or more comorbidities were associated with higher mortality rate. Conclusion: Chronic HCQ use did not prevent COVID-19 in RD compared to their household cohabitants.

We measured the apoptosis rate, inflammatory reaction, and fibroplasia in bleomycin- and bleomycin + ODN2088-treated mice. RESULTS: Our results showed a significant amelioration in bleomycin-induced damage to pulmonary architecture following ODN2088 treatment. A marked decrease in pulmonary epithelial and endothelial apoptosis rate as measured by cleaved caspase-3 expression, inflammatory reaction as indicated by tumor necrosis factor  expression, and pulmonary fibrosis as demonstrated by Van Gieson staining and -smooth muscle actin immunohistochemistry were observed following ODN2088 treatment.

Lots of studies have shown that fermented fruit is higher in antioxidants and health benefits. Antioxidants have been reported to be an alternative to enhance body immunity and possibly become an Anti-SARS-CoV-2. One of the antioxidants that are easily found in vitamin C. This study is to process the fermented mango and pineapple fruits into cookies and to test the antioxidant content (especially Vitamin C) in vitro. There were three variations of the formulation, mango: pineapple: CO2 free water. Sample 1 (1: 0.5: 0.5), sample 2 (2: 1: 1) and sample 3 (3: 2: 2). Then, all product samples were inoculated with Lactobacillus paracasei 5% b/v for 14 days under anaerobic conditions to get simpler mangoes and pineapple food fibre. The fermented products were made into flour with a freeze dryer. Sample variation is done to determine the average significance of the antioxidant content in it. The next step was Vitamin C analysis from 3 samples of cookies sample using Titration Iodometric Method, to determine the amount of Vitamin C (mg/100 g) and also the antioxidant activity with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The amount of vitamin C obtained in Sample 1 was 100.20 mg/100 g respectively with antioxidant activity is 35.33%. Sample 2 was 95.75 mg/100 g respectively with antioxidant activity is 30.60%. Sample 3 was 107.90 mg/100 g respectively with antioxidant activity is 44.70%. The formulation with the highest amount of cookies sample containing vitamin C is S3. There was a significant difference (P<0.05) that determined vitamin C levels between sample formulations. The mean ash content of the three samples was 2.020.04% and water content were 1.60 0.15%. The average vitamin C levels in the three sample cookies were 101.286.14 mg/100 g. Sample 3 indicated the best antioxidant activity towards 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in the amount of 44.70%. Therefore, fermented mango and pineapple have a great potential to be developed into healthy snack cookies. The vitamin C and antioxidants content in cookies from the fermentation of mango and pineapple may be a great substitute for snacks since antioxidants has the ability to improve immunity and anti-inflammatory response.

Phase III trials have demonstrated excellent efficacies of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in large population studies (Baden LR, NEJM, 2021;Polack FP, NEJM, 2020). Immunosuppressed individuals such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients are at risk for a suboptimal response to 2 vaccine doses (Herishanu Y, Blood, 2021). The French National Authority for Health recommends the use of a third dose in immunosuppressed patients. However, seroconversion rate after the triple-dose vaccine is not yet known. The objective of our study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses after the first, second and third doses of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines. Data were collected from 17 French Innovative Leukemia Organization (FILO) investigating centers and the French CLL patients' association (SILLC). SARS-CoV-2 IgG anti-Spike levels were measured at 4-6 weeks after each vaccine dose. A total of 530 patients and 14 controls were included in the study. Vaccine response was evaluated post-dose 1 for 158 CLL patients, post-dose 2, for 506 patients and post-dose 3 for 66 patients. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were studied post-dose 2 by flow cytometry in 80 CLL patients and 14 controls. The median age of the patients was 71 years (range 37-93), 218 (40%) were treatment-na?ve (TN), 136 (26%) had a prior CLL treatment and 176 (34%) were on therapy. Post-dose 1, the global response rate was 27% (43/158). TN patients had a response rate of 34% (23/67), similar to those who had a prior CLL treatment (33%,12/36), and higher compared to on-therapy patients (15%, 8/55, P=0.02). Post-dose 2, the global response rate was 52% (265/506). TN patients had the highest response rate of 72% (151/210) compared to previously treated patients, mostly by immunochemotherapy (60%, 78/130, P=0.02) and on-therapy patients (22%, 36/166, P<0.001) (Figure 1A). Among the 166 on-therapy patients, mostly receiving targeted agents, those receiving venetoclax monotherapy achieved a significantly higher response rate (52%, 12/23) than those treated with BTK inhibitors (BTKi) ibrutinib or acalabrutinib (22%, 23/104, P<0.001). Patients treated with venetoclax+anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (n=19) or venetoclax+BTKi (n=6) were all seronegative after the second dose of vaccine (Figure 1B). In multivariate analysis, the variables found to be significantly associated with seroconversion were age >65 years (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.92, P=0.02), ongoing CLL treatment (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.23, P<0.001) and gamma-globulins 6g/L (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.88, P=0.03). Flow cytometry results suggest a differential balance of the T CD4+ cell subpopulations in Binet stage A and in patients on targeted therapy compared to healthy controls. Post-dose 2 seronegative patients were proposed a third dose and to date, 66 have been tested for the antibody response 4-6 weeks post-dose 3. The post-dose 3 response rate was 42% (28/66). TN patients and previously treated patients had a significantly higher response rate (57%, 16/28) compared to on-therapy patients (32%, 12/38, P=0.03). We further analyzed patients tested post-dose 2 with the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG anti-Spike assay (n=24). Those who achieved seroconversion after the third dose (n=10) had significantly higher titers post-dose 2 (median 12, IQR 3.0-40.8) compared to those who remained seronegative (n=14) (median 2.2, IQR 0.5-5.1, p<0.01), although both median values are considered below the threshold by the manufacturer. An additional cohort of 40 CLL patients who presented a SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to vaccination participated to the study and was analyzed independently. All patients achieved seroconversion after infection and a single dose of vaccine, even though 30% (n=12) had an ongoing CLL treatment. In conclusion, double-dose mRNA vaccination generated a humoral response in 52% of our CLL cohort and a third dose induced seroconversion in 42% of the patients who remained seronegat ve after the second dose. The major independent predictor of negative antibody response was ongoing treatment with BTKi. The strongest boost to immune response against the virus seems to be SARS-CoV-2 infection, as a substantial increase in anti-Spike antibodies was observed in all CLL patients with prior infection, after a single dose vaccination.

However, the detailed roles of coarse (>5m) and fine ([]5m) respiratory aerosols produced when breathing, talking, and singing are not well-understood. MethodsUsing a G-II exhaled breath collector, we measured viral RNA in coarse and fine respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients during 30 minutes of breathing, 15 minutes of talking, and 15 minutes of singing. ResultsAmong the 22 study participants, 13 (59%) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols, including 3 asymptomatic patients and 1 presymptomatic patient. Viral loads ranged from 63-5,821 N gene copies per expiratory activity per patient. Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable RNA, and loads differed significantly between breathing, talking, and singing. The largest proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies was emitted by singing (53%), followed by talking (41%) and breathing (6%). Overall, fine aerosols constituted 85% of the viral load detected in our study. Virus cultures were negative. ConclusionsFine aerosols produced by talking and singing contain more SARS-CoV-2 copies than coarse aerosols and may play a significant role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Exposure to fine aerosols should be mitigated, especially in indoor environments where airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur. Isolating viable SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory aerosol samples remains challenging, and whether this can be more easily accomplished for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is an important enquiry for future studies.

Although every GLP laboratory has Standard Operating Procedure for disaster management, the sudden lockdown due to COVID-19 created specific emergency procedures related to this situation such as travel bans, safe distancing, and work from home notifications. Good Laboratory Practice compliances in the context of animal experimentation during and post lockdown period need effective managerial responses that are not just flexible and innovative but can ensure they are well-calibrated to the challenges of business continuity and maintenance of health directives. On-the-ground realities suggest there may still be practical challenges to compliance, and guidelines may not always be complied with. This article discusses the issues that may be encountered due to COVID-19 that could potentially impact the GLP status of a study and suggests ways to manage them so as to minimize or prevent infection with COVID-19. We propose an MMM (Man, Material, and Medium) strategy to ensure compliance with health directives and guidelines that will help staff to keep themselves and others safe in the workplace while endeavoring to comply with GLP requirements.","output":"Managing COVID-19 Lockdown Impacts: Sustaining GLP Compliance and Man Material Medium (MMM) Strategy for Augmenting Prevention of Workplace Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laboratory intensive assignments and hands-on skills are important components in Mechatronics and Control Engineering by their nature.

The complement system has recently emerged as a key player in triggering and maintaining the inflammatory state, but the role of this molecular cascade in severe COVID-19 is still poorly characterized. Objective We aimed at assessing the contribution of complement pathways at both protein and transcriptomic levels. Methods To this end, we systematically assessed RNA levels of 28 complement genes in circulating whole blood of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, including genes of the alternative pathway, for which data remain scarce. Results We found differential expression of genes involved in the complement system, yet with various expression patterns: while patients displaying moderate disease had elevated expression of classical pathway genes, severe disease was associated with increased lectin and alternative pathway activation, which correlated with inflammation and coagulopathy markers. Additionally, properdin, a pivotal positive regulator of the alternative pathway, showed high RNA expression but was found at low protein concentrations in severe and critical patients, suggesting its deposition at the sites of complement activation. Notably, low properdin levels were significantly associated with the use of mechanical ventilation (AUC = 0.82, p = 0.002).

METHODS: T1D Exchange coordinated a US type 1 diabetes COVID-19 registry. Forty-six diabetes centers submitted pediatric cases for patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Associations between clinical factors and hospitalization were tested with Fisher's Exact Test. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for hospitalization. RESULTS: Data from 266 patients with previously established type 1 diabetes aged <19 years with COVID-19 were reported. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was the most common adverse outcome (n = 44, 72% of hospitalized patients). There were four hospitalizations for severe hypoglycemia, three hospitalizations requiring respiratory support (one of whom was intubated and mechanically ventilated), one case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and 10 patients who were hospitalized for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 or diabetes. Hospitalized patients (n = 61) were more likely than nonhospitalized patients (n = 205) to have minority race/ethnicity (67% vs 39%, P < 0.001), public insurance (64% vs 41%, P < 0.001), higher A1c (11% [97 mmol/mol] vs 8.2% [66 mmol/mol], P < 0.001), and lower insulin pump and lower continuous glucose monitoring use (26% vs 54%, P < 0.001; 39% vs 75%, P < 0.001). Age and gender were not associated with risk of hospitalization. Higher A1c was significantly associated with hospitalization, with an odds ratio of 1.56 (1.34-1.84) after adjusting for age, gender, insurance, and race/ethnicity.

It has been shown that CSFV p7 displays substantial ion channel activity when incorporated into membrane systems, but a deep rationalization of the size and dynamics of the induced pores is yet to emerge. Here, we use high-resolution conductance measurements and current fluctuation analysis to demonstrate that CSFV p7 channels are ruled by equilibrium conformational dynamics involving protein-lipid interactions. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirms the existence of a variety of pore sizes and their tight regulation by solution pH. We conclude that p7 viroporin forms subnanometric channels involved in virus propagation, but also much larger pores (1-10 nm in diameter) with potentially significant roles in virus pathogenicity.

From the aforementioned search we can conclude that the most prevalent risk factors were reported to be hypertension followed by diabetes. In terms of mortality, age greater than 65 was the most significant risk factor. Among non-survivors, coagulation profile including d-dimers, prothrombin time, and inflammatory markers like erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum ferritin levels were very deranged.

It has been estimated that only 17C27% of UK clinical practice may be compliant with these guidelines. In February 2020 the Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee (JRCALC)) changed their guidelines for managing respiratory distress in children, emphasizing that salbutamol is rarely effective in children under 1 year of age.ObjectivesWe conducted a quality improvement project assessing the use of pre-admission nebulised salbutamol in infants under 12 months brought in by ambulance to an English NHS Emergency Department (ED), before and after the change to the JRCALC guidelines.MethodsThe audit compared two periods: November 2019;and November/December 2020. Two months were required in 2020 to increase the number of patients included. Electronic patient records for November 2019 were retrospectively audited. Inclusion criteria included: all children under 1 year old brought in by ambulance with an initial presentation documented as respiratory distress and/or a final ED discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis, upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection or viral induced wheeze. We recorded whether these children were treated with nebulised salbutamol before arrival. We then developed an educational video in September 2020 highlighting the above mentioned JRCALC guideline changes and shared it on the Oxfordshire paramedics teaching website. We then conducted a repeat audit for November and December 2020.ResultsIn November 2019, 53 infants were brought in by ambulance to our ED fitting the inclusion criteria, of which 9 (17%) had been given nebulised salbutamol by the paramedics. In November and December 2020, 19 infants met inclusion criteria, of which 2 (15%) received salbutamol from the paramedics. The two patients who received salbutamol were less than 6 months old and were not diagnosed with viral induced wheeze or anaphylaxis.ConclusionsThe JRCALC guidelines for salbutamol were adhered to in 83C85% of the pre-hospital cases that were audited. The change in salbutamol practice between audit cycles was small, however analysis is limited by the low number of patients. Unfortunately, only 4 paramedics watched our video;this may have been related to the pressures of the COVID -19 pandemic that were experienced during this time. We therefore need to assess the best way to disseminate guideline changes to our teams. There was a significant decline (75%) in the number of children brought into our hospital by ambulance with respiratory problems from 2019 to 2020, requiring us to expand data collection to two months, likely to be due to a reduction in circulating respiratory viruses due to the social response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The two infants who received salbutamol did not have a clinical indication for their use in this age group (i.e. anaphylaxis).

Infection is of concern for the patient and expensive for the healthcare system. SSI is multifactorial and can be divided into host-related and perioperative factors. Skin preparation is one of the key peri-operative factors in reducing SSI. The current literature supports a combined chlorhexidine and alcohol preparation technique, although there is some conflicting evidence. Most studies to date have used proxy outcomes such as growth from swabs shortly after skin preparation. There are no large scale studies which have looked at definitive clinical outcomes such as the rate of postoperative SSI. Methods: A retrospective review of data was undertaken for two longitudinal cohorts which were using two different skin preparation solutions and techniques due to a change in hospital protocol. Each cohort was continuous and derived from the same overall populationIn cohort 1, Povidine-Iodine (Betadinetm) followed by Alcoholic Chlorhexidine was used on swabs (Double prep group). In cohort 2, 2 Alcoholic Chlorhexidine was used in a prep stick applicator. Standard criteria for diagnosing surgical site infection were used. All open injuries, procedures for ongoing infection, amputations for osteomyelitis /diabetic foot and COVID- 19 positive cases were excluded. Results: After applying standard exclusion criteria, 919 elective F&A procedures in the Double prep group and 491 procedures were included for the Single prep groupAs these were continuous longitudinal cohorts of large scale from the same population, there is a justifiable presumption of group matchingIn cohort 1 there were 15 superficial infections (1.6%) and 3 deep (0.3%).

The frequency of engaging with pandemic-related media coverage was also considered across all symptom subtypes. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted, with a total of 332 participants recruited. Participants who scored above the optimal cut-off score on the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory Revised edition (OCI-R) were included in the analysis (n = 254). Scores on the six subscales of the OCI-R were correlated with responses to a COVID-19 Impact measure. Result Factor analysis of the COVID-19 Impact measure revealed that items loaded on two components of the measure (handwashing and distress-avoidance).

The gut bacterial composition at the phyla, genus, and species levels were changed as the result of the imbalanced Zn diet (e.g., Lactobacillus reuteri and Akkermansia muciniphila). Moreover, pathways including carbohydrate, glycan, and nucleotide metabolism were decreased by a short-term low-Zn diet. Valeriate production was suppressed by a long-term low-Zn diet. Pathways such as drug resistance and infectious diseases were upregulated in high- and excess-Zn diets over 4-week and 8-week intervals. Long-term zinc fortification doses, especially at the high-Zn level, suppressed the abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing genera as well as the concentrations of metabolites. Finally, Melainabacteria (phylum) and Desulfovibrio sp. strain ABHU2SB (species) were identified to be potential markers for Zn status with high accuracy (area under the curve [AUC], >0.8).

Residents in teaching hospitals bear a large burden in managing SU sequelae and often lack support. Preventive and addiction medicine faculty defined broadly applicable core knowledge and skills for residents across specialties in a tertiary care center. Three 1-hour online modules were developed and delivered asynchronously to interns, followed by a live skills session at orientation. Topics were (1) Unhealthy SU Screening, Detection, and Intervention; (2) Bias and Communication; and (3) Safer Prescribing in Acute Pain. All 68 interns completed the curriculum. Pre/posttesting showed increased knowledge (52%-83% correct, P < .001) and perceived confidence (10-12.9, maximum 16, P < .001). Attitudes were unchanged (18.4-18.7, maximum 20, P = .07).

Existing research mainly focuses on indoor droplet dispersion, but the mechanism of its dispersion and exposure in outdoor environment is unclear. By conducting CFD simulations, this paper investigates the evaporation and transport of solid-liquid droplets in an open outdoor environment. Droplet initial sizes (dp = 10 m, 50 m, 100 m), background relative humidity (RH = 35%, 95%), background wind speed (Uref = 3 m/s, 0.2 m/s) and social distances between two people (D = 0.5 m, 1 m, 1.5 m, 3 m, 5 m) are investigated. Results show that thermal body plume is destroyed when the background wind speed is 3 m/s (Froude number Fr ~ 10). The inhalation fraction (IF) of susceptible person decreases exponentially when the social distance (D) increases from 0.5 m to 5 m. The exponential decay rate of inhalation fraction (b) ranges between 0.93 and 1.06 (IF=IF0e-b(D-0.5)) determined by the droplet initial diameter and relative humidity. Under weak background wind (Uref = 0.2 m/s, Fr ~ 0.01), the upward thermal body plume significantly influences droplet dispersion, which is similar with that in indoor space. Droplets in the initial sizes of 10 m and 50 m disperse upwards while most of 100 m droplets fall down to the ground due to larger gravity force. Interestingly, the deposition fraction on susceptible person is ten times higher at Uref = 3 m/s than that at Uref = 0.2 m/s. Thus, a high outdoor wind speed does not necessarily lead to a smaller exposure risk if the susceptible person locating at the downwind region of the infected person, and people in outdoors are suggested to not only keep distance of greater than 1.5 m from each other but also stand with considerable angles from the prevailing wind direction.","output":"Airborne transmission of pathogen-laden expiratory droplets in open outdoor space"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A wide spectrum of cardiovascular manifestations has been documented in patients suffering from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

However, the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 re-infection, including the levels and role of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein IgG antibodies and the half-maximal concentration (IC50) of neutralizing antibodies remain unknown. METHODS: Both the epidemiological and clinical information has been collected during two episodes of COVID-19 in a patient. Laboratory results, including RT-PCR, Ct values, anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein IgG antibodies, and the IC50 of neutralizing antibodies levels were analyzed on the patient. RESULTS: The patient was a 58-year-old man who developed moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with oxygen demand (cannula 2 L/min) in the first episode. By day 30, he recuperated and was discharged after testing negative for SARS-CoV-2. After two and a half months, his three family members showed COVID-19 symptoms and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 once again and was asymptomatic (the second episode). The IC50 of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 greatly increased from 50.0 g/mL (after the first episode) to 14.8 g/mL (after the second episode), and remained strongly reactive (20.1 l/mL) after 47 days of the second episode. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological, clinical, and serological analyses confirmed that the patient had re-infection instead of persistent viral shedding from first infection. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 re-infection may manifest as asymptomatic with increased neutralizing antibody levels. Further studies such as the virus characteristics, immunology, and epidemiology on SARS-CoV-2 re-infection are needed.","output":"Asymptomatic COVID-19 re-infection in a Japanese male by elevated half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kota Pekanbaru telah memiliki sebuah web resmi yang berisi informasi data COVID-19 beserta info grafisnya yaitu https://ppc-19.pekanbaru.go.id/.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and governor mandated Stay at Home Order on ED super utilizers. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of patients presenting to the 12 emergency departments of the Franciscan Mission of Our Lady Hospital System in Louisiana between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020. Patients who were 18 years of age or older and had four ED visits within a one-year period (2018, 2019, or 2020) were classified as super-utilizers. We examined number and category of visits for the baseline period (January 2018 C March 2020), the governor's Stay at Home Order, and the subsequent Reopening Phases through December 31, 2020. RESULTS: The number of visits by super utilizers decreased by over 16% when the Stay at Home Order was issued. The average number of visits per week rose from 1010.63 during the Stay at Home Order to 1198.09 after the Stay at Home Order was lifted, but they did not return to Pre-COVID levels of approximately 1400 visits per week in 2018 and 2019. When categories of visits were examined, this trend was found for emergent visits (p < 0.001) and visits related to injuries (p < 0.001). Non-emergent visits declined during the Stay at Home Order compared to the baseline period (p < 0.001), and did not increase significantly during reopening compared to the Stay at Home Order (p = 0.87). There were no changes in number of visits for psychiatric purposes, alcohol use, or drug use during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Significant declines in emergent visits raise concerns that individuals who needed ED treatment did not seek it due to COVID-19. However, the finding that super utilizers with non-emergent visits continued to visit the ED less after the Stay at Home Order was lifted raises questions for future research that may inform policy and interventions for inappropriate ED use.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and governor mandated stay at home order on emergency department super utilizers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter mainly discusses the concept, characteristics and cases of the mobile media and mobile media public opinion as well as their management, and lays stress on studying the development and characteristics of WeChat, the major social media and mobile payment platform in China.","output":"Mobile Phone Media and Its Public Opinion Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To determine the diagnostic value of the Duncan-Ely test in predicting abnormal rectus femoris activity during gait in stroke survivors walking with a stiff knee gait. DESIGN Cross-sectional diagnostic study. SUBJECTS A total of 95 patients with chronic stroke. METHODS During physical examination, the Duncan-Ely test was performed and scored. Surface electromyography of the rectus femoris was then recorded during dynamic gait. To determine the diagnostic value, the results of the Duncan-Ely test and surface electromyography recordings (gold standard) were compared. RESULTS The Duncan-Ely test had a sensitivity of 73%, a specificity of 29%, a positive predictive value of 60%, and a negative predictive value of 42%. The area under the curve was 0.488 ([AQ1] CI 0.355-0.621, p = 0.862), showing that the Duncan-Ely test is not better than random guessing. CONCLUSION The Duncan-Ely test has no predictive value for determining abnormal activity of the rectus femoris during gait. Using this test can lead to incorrect identification of abnormal rectus femoris activity, which might hamper the selection of optimal treatment options.

While vaccines have proven to be the best preventive method to combat the flu, the attitude and knowledge about vaccines are a major hindrance to higher uptake in most of the countries. The yearly coverage, especially in the vulnerable groups in the population, often remains below the herd immunity level despite the Flu Awareness Campaign organized by WHO every year worldwide. This brings immense challenges to the nations public health protection agency for strategic decision-making in controlling the flu outbreak every year. To understand the impact of public perceptions and vaccination decisions while designing optimal immunization policy, we model the individual decision-making as a two-strategy pairwise contest game, where pay-off is considered as a function of public health effort for the campaign. We use Pontryagins maximum principle to identify the best possible strategy for public health to implement vaccination and reduce infection at a minimum cost. Our optimal analysis shows that the cost of public health initiatives is qualitatively and quantitatively different under different public perceptions and attitudes towards vaccinations. When individual risk perception evolves with vaccine uptake or disease induced death, our model demonstrates a feed-forward mechanism in the dynamics of vaccination and exhibits an increase in vaccine uptake. Using numerical simulation, we also observe that the optimal cost can be minimized by putting the effort in the beginning and later part of the outbreak rather than during the peak. It confers that public health efforts towards disseminating disease severity or actual vaccination risk might accelerate the vaccination coverage and mitigate the infection faster.","output":"Optimal Management of Public Perceptions During A Flu Outbreak: A Game-Theoretic Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 pandemic and its following confinement measures had a strong impact on individual's well-being especially on undergraduate university students.

We evaluated the external validity of Ali-M3 using sequential Japanese sampling data. In this retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 infection probabilities for 617 symptomatic patients were determined using Ali-M3. In 11 Japanese tertiary care facilities, these patients underwent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. They also underwent chest CT to confirm a diagnosis of COVID-19. Of the 617 patients, 289 (46.8%) were RT-PCR-positive. The area under the curve (AUC) of Ali-M3 for predicting a COVID-19 diagnosis was 0.797 (95% confidence interval: 0.762?0.833) and the goodness-of-fit was P = 0.156. With a cut-off probability of a diagnosis of COVID-19 by Ali-M3 set at 0.5, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.6% and 68.3%, respectively.

Coagulation volume, sphericity, and mean short-axis diameter were assessed, and mathematical functions were fitted for each system and assessed with the coefficient of determination (R(2)). Analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc tests were used for interdevice comparison after 5 and 10 minutes and after maximum recommended ablation time.

METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study. Of the 62 patients with stable COPD who participated in the outpatient PR programme from April 2018 to February 2021, 50 completed the programme. Six-minute walk distance (6MWD) was performed to evaluate exercise tolerance, and ultrasonography was performed to measure DE(max). Responders to PR in exercise capacity were defined as patients who demonstrated an increase of > 30 m in 6MWD. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the cut-off point of DE(max) to predict responses to PR. RESULTS: Baseline levels of forced expiratory volume in 1 s, 6MWD, maximum inspiratory pressure, DE(max) and quadriceps muscle strength were significantly higher, and peak dyspnoea of modified Borg (mBorg) scale score was lower in responders (n = 30) than in non-responders (n = 20) to PR (p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, DE(max) was significantly correlated with an increase of > 30 m in 6MWD.

This study is built upon a revised service recovery cycle model by accounting for three stages and their corresponding attributes; whereon a conceptual stage model of service recovery is proposed. This conceptual stage model incorporates stages of service recovery, their respective attributes, and how they influence relationship marketing strategies. Design/methodology/approach An online marketing company was employed for data collection in 2019, which resulted in 301 valid responses. A Structural Equation Model (SEM) was conducted with all the data to test the relationships between the constructs. The individual measurement model was tested using the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). A structural model was estimated using AMOS to test all the hypotheses. Findings The findings demonstrate that the attributes (i.e., response speed, compensation) paired with the first two stages of service recovery can significantly influence consumer loyalty in a positive state. The findings also manifest the intermediary role that relationship quality has played in the association of service recovery and consumer loyalty, which implies that the food delivery businesses could attain a more comprehended relationship quality with consumers through active and timely compensatory service recovery consumer loyalty to the food businesses. Originality/value This study examines how these different stages of the service recovery cycle influence the decision-making of relationship marketing strategies (i.e., relationship quality, customer loyalty) on the prerequisite of service failure.

Neutrophils are professional phagocytes of the innate immune system that are critical in pathogen handling. Neutrophil responses to infection are dysregulated in diabetes, predominantly mediated by persistent hyperglycaemia; the chief biochemical abnormality in T1D and T2D. Therapeutically enhancing host immunity in diabetes to improve infection resolution is an expanding area of research. Individuals with diabetes are also at an increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), highlighting the need for re-invigorated and urgent focus on this field. The aim of this review is to explore the breadth of previous literature investigating neutrophil function in both T1D and T2D, in order to understand the complex neutrophil phenotype present in this disease and also to focus on the development of new therapies to improve aberrant neutrophil function in diabetes. Existing literature illustrates a dual neutrophil dysfunction in diabetes. Key pathogen handling mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment, chemotaxis, phagocytosis and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are decreased in diabetes, weakening the immune response to infection. However, pro-inflammatory neutrophil pathways, mainly neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, extracellular ROS generation and pro-inflammatory cytokine generation, are significantly upregulated, causing damage to the host and perpetuating inflammation. Reducing these proinflammatory outputs therapeutically is emerging as a credible strategy to improve infection resolution in diabetes, and also more recently COVID-19. Future research needs to drive forward the exploration of novel treatments to improve infection resolution in T1D and T2D to improve patient morbidity and mortality.","output":"A Bittersweet Response to Infection in Diabetes; Targeting Neutrophils to Modify Inflammation and Improve Host Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China has been performing nationwide social lockdown by releasing the Level 1 response to major public health emergencies (RMPHE) to struggle against the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak since late January 2020.

We sought to document measures of distress and perceived preparedness from diverse oncology staff during the COVID-19 pandemic response, and correlate these with unfolding events. Methods:We utilized a mixed-methods approach comprising weekly diarising of executive communications and eventsby investigators, and prospective self-administered online surveys-by staff. Survey domains included perceived institutional preparedness, personal wellbeing, and perceived stress using a distress thermometer (0-10, no-extreme distress). Responses were Likert-scaled or free-text. Quantitative responses were aggregated by role/site and analysed using R. These were correlated with emergent qualitative themes using the Framework Method. The study was conducted at a metropolitan and a regional hospital in Queensland, Australia. Results: 12 surveys across 18 weeks commencing April 3, 2020 (encompassing 1st lockdown, lockdown easing, and 2nd lockdown) had 993 individual responses. 40% respondents were located regionally. Role categories included: nursing (50%), allied health (18%), medical (16%), administrative (15%), ancillary (e.g. cleaner, food service) (1%). Emergent themes were: Strategies for protectionat work and home. Up to 27% respondents reported being able to attend to critical personal needs only sometimes or less, although patients were perceived to be well supported most/all of the time (&gt;90% responses). Navigating rules and keeping up-high levels of perceived institutional preparedness in &gt;75% responders coexisted alongside fluctuating levels of self-reported distress, from median 5 (IQR 3-7) at 1st lockdown outset to 1 (IQR 1-4) after lockdown restriction easing. Tempered optimism-pride in one's place was reported both as reflecting healthcare worker identity and as Australians in the context of low local infection rates. No significant differences in distress or preparedness perceptions were evident comparing geographic sites. Framing the new normal-although respondents longitudinally reported increasing familiarity with pandemic directives, distress levels increased concurrently with the announcement of 2nd lockdown. Conclusions: In the context of low local COVID-19 infection rates, oncology staff regardless of role and geographic setting reported high perceptions of institutional preparedness. Distress levels increased concurrently with lockdown phases and reports of distress and psychosocial workload fatigue were made by various workers including administrative and ancillary. These should be considered frontline staff for the purpose of workplace psychosocial support in pandemic responses.","output":"Psychosocial impacts of COVID- 19 upon a diverse Australian oncology workforce: From doctors to ancillary staff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A key strategy to prevent a local outbreak during the COVID-19 pandemic is to restrict incoming travel. Once a region has successfully contained the disease, it becomes critical to decide when and how to reopen the borders. Here we explore the impact of border reopening for the example of Newfoundland and Labrador, a Canadian province that has enjoyed no new cases since late April, 2020. We combine a network epidemiology model with machine learning to infer parameters and predict the COVID-19 dynamics upon partial and total airport reopening, with perfect and imperfect quarantine conditions. Our study suggests that upon full reopening, every other day, a new COVID-19 case would enter the province. Under the current conditions, banning air travel from outside Canada is more efficient in managing the pandemic than fully reopening and quarantining 95% of the incoming population.

Case Summary An 80-year-old female with no significant cardiac history presented with cardiogenic shock and biopsy-proven fulminant myocarditis within 12 days of receiving the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. She required temporary mechanical circulatory support, inotropic agents, and high-dose steroids for stabilization and management. Ultimately, her cardiac function recovered, and she was discharged in stable condition after 2 weeks of hospitalization. A repeat cardiac MRI 3 months after her initial presentation demonstrated stable biventricular function and continued improvement in myocardial inflammation. Discussion Fulminant myocarditis is a rare complication of vaccination. Clinicians should stay vigilant to recognize this rare, but potentially deadly complication.

So far, it is not known to what extent different devices display similar index values while processing identical electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. OBJECTIVE To compare BIS and state entropy during analysis of identical EEG data. Inspection of raw EEG input to detect potential causes of erroneous index calculation. DESIGN Offline re-analysis of EEG data from a randomised, single-centre controlled trial using the Entropy Module and an Aspect A-2000 monitor. SETTING Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit?t Mnchen, Munich. PATIENTS Forty adult patients undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia. INTERVENTIONS Blocked randomisation of 20 patients per anaesthetic group (sevoflurane/remifentanil or propofol/remifentanil). Isolated forearm technique for differentiation between consciousness and unconsciousness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prediction probability (PK) of state entropy to discriminate consciousness from unconsciousness. Correlation and agreement between state entropy and BIS from deep to light hypnosis. Analysis of raw EEG compared with index values that are in conflict with clinical examination, with frequency measures (frequency bands/Spectral Edge Frequency 95) and visual inspection for physiological EEG patterns (e.g. beta or delta arousal), pathophysiological features such as high-frequency signals (electromyogram/high-frequency EEG or eye fluttering/saccades), different types of electro-oculogram or epileptiform EEG and technical artefacts. RESULTS PK of state entropy was 0.80 and of BIS 0.84; correlation coefficient of state entropy with BIS 0.78. Nine percent BIS and 14% state entropy values disagreed with clinical examination. Highest incidence of disagreement occurred after state transitions, in particular for state entropy after loss of consciousness during sevoflurane anaesthesia. EEG sequences which led to false 'conscious' index values often showed high-frequency signals and eye blinks. High-frequency EEG/electromyogram signals were pooled because a separation into EEG and fast electro-oculogram, for example eye fluttering or saccades, on the basis of a single EEG channel may not be very reliable. These signals led to higher Spectral Edge Frequency 95 and ratio of relative beta and gamma band power than EEG signals, indicating adequate unconscious classification. The frequency of other artefacts that were assignable, for example technical artefacts, movement artefacts, was negligible and they were excluded from analysis. CONCLUSION High-frequency signals and eye blinks may account for index values that falsely indicate consciousness. Compared with BIS, state entropy showed more false classifications of the clinical state at transition between consciousness and unconsciousness.","output":"Differences between state entropy and bispectral index during analysis of identical electroencephalogram signals: a comparison with two randomised anaesthetic techniques."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stenotic and occlusive diseases of the subclavian and brachiocephalic arteries can cause a significant morbidity as it can lead to symptomatic ischemia affecting the upper extremities, brain and, in some cases, the heart.

Further analyses of the spatiotemporal and demographic changes occurring in the last decade and its implication on estimates of disease burden are required to inform intervention strategies. In this study, we quantified the epidemiological shift and geographical heterogeneity in the burden of leptospirosis during 2005C2015 in China. METHODS: We used reported leptospirosis case data from 1st January 2005 to 31st of December 2015 that routinely collected by the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) to analyze the epidemiological trend and estimate the burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) over space, time, and demographical groups. RESULTS: A total of 7763 cases were reported during 2005C2015. Of which, 2403 (31%) cases were the laboratory-confirmed case. Since 2005, the notified incidence rate was gradually decreased (P < 0.05) and it was relatively stable during 2011C2015 (P > 0.05). During 2005C2015, we estimated a total of 10 313 DALYs were lost due to leptospirosis comprising a total of 1804 years-lived with disability (YLDs) and 8509 years-life lost (YLLs). Males had the highest burden of disease (7149 DALYs) compared to females (3164 DALYs). The highest burden estimate was attributed to younger individuals aged 10C19 years who lived in southern provinces of China. During 2005C2015, this age group contributed to approximately 3078 DALYs corresponding to 30% of the total DALYs lost in China. Yet, our analysis indicated a declining trend in burden estimates (P < 0.001) since 2005 and remained relatively low during 2011C2015. Low burden estimates have been identified in the endemic regions where infections principally distributed. Most of the changes in DALY estimates were driven by changes in YLLs. CONCLUSIONS: In the last 11-years, the burden estimates of leptospirosis have shown a declining trend across the country; however, leptospirosis should not be neglected as it remains an important zoonotic disease and potentially affecting the young and productive population in economically less-developed provinces in southern of China. In addition, while in the last five years the incidence has been reported at very low-level, this might not reflect the true incidence of leptospirosis. Strengthened surveillance in the endemic regions is, hence, substantially required to capture the actual prevalence to better control leptospirosis in China.

We conducted a qualitative study to explore barriers to ART maintenance and solutions to ART interruption when stringent COVID\\\\19 control measures were implemented in China, from the perspective of PLHIV and relevant key stakeholders. METHODS: Between 11 February and 15 February 2020, we interviewed PLHIV, community\\\\based organization (CBO) workers, staff from centres for disease control and prevention (CDC) at various levels whose work is relevant to HIV care (CDC staff), HIV doctors and nurses and drug vendors from various regions in China. Semi\\\\structured interviews were conducted using a messaging and social media app. Challenges and responses relevant to ART continuity during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic were discussed. Themes were identified by transcript coding and mindmaps. RESULTS: Sixty\\\\four stakeholders were recruited, including 16 PLHIV, 17 CBO workers, 15 CDC staff, 14 HIV doctors and nurses and two drug vendors. Many CDC staff, HIV doctors and nurses responsible for ART delivery and HIV care were shifted to COVID\\\\19 response efforts. Barriers to ART maintenance were (a) travel restrictions, (b) inadequate communication and bureaucratic obstacles, (c) shortage in personnel, (d) privacy concerns, and (e) insufficient ART reserve. CBO helped PLHIV maintain access to ART through five solutions identified from thematic analysis: (a) coordination to refill ART from local CDC clinics or hospitals, (b) delivery of ART by mail, (c) privacy protection measures, (d) mental health counselling, and (e) providing connections to alternative sources of ART. Drug vendors contributed to ART maintenance by selling out\\\\of\\\\pocket ART. CONCLUSIONS: Social and institutional disruption from COVID\\\\19 contributed to increased risk of ART interruption among PLHIV in China. Collaboration among key stakeholders was needed to maintain access to ART, with CBO playing an important role. Other countries facing ART interruption during current or future public health emergencies may learn from the solutions employed in China.","output":"Stakeholder efforts to mitigate antiretroviral therapy interruption among people living with HIV during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in China: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Probing the conformational and functional hotspot sites within aqueous native protein complexes is still a challenging task Herein, a mass spectrometry (MS)-based two-step isotope labeling-lysine reactivity profiling (TILLRP) strategy is developed to quantify the reactivities of lysine residues and probe the molecular details of protein-protein interactions as well as evaluate the conformational interventions by small-molecule active compounds The hotspot lysine sites that are crucial to the SARS-CoV-2 S1-ACE2 combination could be successfully probed, such as S1 Lys417and Lys444 Significant alteration of the reactivities of lysine residues at the interaction interface of S1-RBD Lys386-Lys462was observed during the formation of complexes, which might be utilized as indicators for investigating the S1-ACE2 dynamic recognition and intervention at the molecular level in high throughput ?

The purpose of current study was to investigate the role of Mas receptor in lipid-induced kidney injury. In mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD), the protein abundance of markers of autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and apoptosis was dramatically increased in the kidney cortex, which was markedly prevented by Mas deletion (Mas(?/?)) or Mas receptor antagonist A779. Palmitic acid (PA) induced persistently increased autophagy, ER stress, and apoptosis as well as mitochondrial injuries in primary cultured proximal tubular cells from wild type, but not from Mas(?/?) mice. In human proximal tubular HK2 cells, PA-induced autophagy and ER stress was aggravated by Mas agonists Ang (1C7) or AVE0991, but attenuated by A779 or Mas knockdown. Stimulation of Mas resulted in elevated intracellular calcium levels [Ca(2+)](i) in HK2 cells treated with PA, whereas inhibition or knockdown of Mas decreased [Ca(2+)](i). Mitochondrial outer membrane located voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1) was markedly upregulated in HK2 cells treated with PA, which was associated with impaired mitochondrial morphology and depolarization. These were enhanced by AVE0991 and suppressed by A779 or Mas knockdown. Mas knockdown in HK2 cells prevented impaired interactions among VDAC1, autophagy adaptor P62, and ubiquitin, induced by PA, leading to a potential ubiquitination of VDAC1.

Treatment regimens include glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents, but their off-target distribution causes severe systemic toxicity. Hence, specific co-delivery of anti-inflammatory/anti-fibrosis drugs to the glomerular mesangial cell (MC) region is expected to produce better therapeutic effects. METHODS: A novel kidney-targeted nanocarrier drug delivery system targeting MCs was constructed using passive targeting resulting from the difference in pore size between the glomerular endothelial layer and the basement membrane, and active targeting based on the specific binding of antibodies and antigens. Specifically, a liposome-nanoparticle hybrid (PLGA-LNHy) was formed by coating the surface of PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) with a phospholipid bilayer, and then PLGA-LNHy was co-modified with PEG and 8 integrin antibodies to obtain PLGA immunoliposomes (PLGA-ILs). RESULTS: The results showed that the obtained NPs had a core-shell structure, uniform and suitable particle size (119.1  2.31 nm), low cytotoxicity, and good mesangial cell-entry ability, which can successfully accumulate in the glomerular MC region. Both dexamethasone (DXMS) and captopril (CAP) were loaded onto PLGA-ILs with a drug loading of 10.22  1.00% for DXMS and 6.37  0.25% for CAP (DXMS/CAP@PLGA-ILs). In vivo pharmacodynamics showed that DXMS/CAP@PLGA-ILs can effectively improve the pathological changes in the mesangial area and positive expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in glomeruli as well as reduce the expression of inflammatory factors, fibrotic factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, renal inflammation and fibrosis were relieved.

Little is known about the performance of ESD in low-volume western centers. Furthermore, it is unclear whether ESD can be self-taught without a tutored approach. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive ESDs, performed in an untutored prevalence-based fashion by a single operator at a private Greek hospital from 2016-2020. Out of 60 lesions, standard ESD was applied for 54 and enucleation for 6; 41 were mucosal and 19 submucosal; 3 esophageal, 24 gastric, one duodenal, 12 colonic, and 20 rectal. RESULTS: Pathology revealed carcinoma (n=14), neuroendocrine tumor (n=7), precancerous lesion (n=27), or other submucosal tumors (n=12). The rates of en bloc and R0 resection were 98% and 91%, respectively. The median resection speed was <3 cm(2)/h for the first 20 cases, but improved progressively to 9 cm(2)/h after 40 cases. Two patients underwent laparoscopic surgery for colonic perforation, and one received a blood transfusion because of delayed bleeding (serious adverse event rate: 5%). No deaths occurred. The median hospital stay was 1.3 days. Variables associated with improvement in ESD speed during the second period of the study were the application of countertraction and the experience acquired through other endosurgical techniques. CONCLUSIONS: ESD was safe and effective in a low-volume center, with an acceptable adverse events rate. At least 40 mixed cases were needed to achieve a high resection speed.

We developed an original pipeline for an analysis of the transcriptional profiles of CD8(+) cells from ECs, treated and untreated progressors. Hierarchical cluster analysis of CD8(+) cells transcription profiles allowed us to identify five distinct groups (EC groups 1C5) of ECs. The transcriptional profiles of EC group 1 were opposite to those of groups 2C4 and similar to those of the treated progressors, which can be associated with residual activation and dysfunction of CD8(+) T-lymphocytes. The profiles of groups 2C4 were associated with different numbers of differentially expressed genes compared to healthy controls, but the corresponding genes shared the same cellular processes. These three groups were associated with increased metabolism, survival, proliferation, and the absence of an exhausted phenotype, compared to both untreated progressors and healthy controls. The CD8(+) lymphocytes from these groups of ECs may contribute to the control under HIV replication and slower disease progression. The EC group 5 was indistinguishable from normal. Application of master regulator analysis allowed us to identify 22 receptors, including interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, and androgen receptors, which may be responsible for the observed expression changes and the functional states of CD8(+) cells from ECs.

METHODS: To simulate a human source, an aerosol generating system was made using a bacterial suspension in a nebulizer attached to an oxygen cylinder. A fan connected to the nebulizer created aerosols. Transmitted aerosols were detected using blood agar plates at 0.1524 and 1.8288 meters from source, simulating exposed person. The study was performed under controlled conditions at room temperature in a biohazard hood with HEPA filter and UV light. RESULTS: When face shields were used alone, significant numbers of bacterial colonies grew on blood agar plates. When a mask used alone for both the subjects (source and exposed), the blood agar yielded minimal colony forming units (CFUs) at both distances. When face shields were used in combination with masks, no significant improvement was observed as compared to masks alone. DISCUSSION: Our results were similar to what have been observed in related studies. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical masks alone provided good protection, surpassing the protection provided by face shields alone. Both used together provided the best protection, although the combined protection was similar to surgical masks use alone.","output":"A Laboratory Model Demonstrating the Protective Effects of Surgical Masks, Face Shields and a Combination of Both in a Speaking Simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis placed a pause on surgical management of nonemergency cases of pheochromocytoma, and it was essential for endocrinologists to provide both resourceful and safe care.

In these dramatic times, healthcare providers and virology researchers would have largely benefited from sound support from the information systems and database communities, able to produce systems that allow to explore data, compute statistics, and discover knowledge on the virus. [Question/problem] The research progress in emergency times is hindered by the lack of experience in organizing effective interaction between parties, possibly supported by specific tools. Streamlining the domain knowledge exchange through an appropriate requirement engineering practice is of paramount importance, not only in health crises but also in disaster management and cases of extreme weather hazards.

Studying adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction and early biomarkers of cardiovascular and immunometabolic risk in Mexican nationals may have a strong impact on future public health policies for US-born Mexican Americans and other populations of Mexican origin in the US. The goal of this study is to evaluate the early transition towards healthy/unhealthy adipose tissue expansion to identify AT dysfunction through systemic, molecular and OMICS measures in the fasting and fed states in symptom-free volunteers with no history of age-related chronic diseases in support of precision medicine and discovery. ABSTRACT: We previously reported preliminary characterization of adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction through the adiponectin/leptin ratio (ALR) and fasting/postprandial (F/P) gene expression in subcutaneous (SQ) adipose tissue (AT) biopsies obtained from participants in the GEMM study, a precision medicine research project. Here we present integrative data replication of previous findings from an increased number of GEMM symptom-free (SF) adults (N = 124) to improve characterization of early biomarkers for cardiovascular (CV)/immunometabolic risk in SF adults with AT dysfunction. We achieved this goal by taking advantage of the rich set of GEMM F/P 5 h time course data and three tissue samples collected at the same time and frequency on each adult participant (F/P blood, biopsies of SQAT and skeletal muscle (SKM)). We classified them with the presence/absence of AT dysfunction: low (<1) or high (>1) ALR. We also examined the presence of metabolically healthy (MH)/unhealthy (MUH) individuals through low-grade chronic subclinical inflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)), whole body insulin sensitivity (Matsuda Index) and Metabolic Syndrome criteria in people with/without AT dysfunction. Molecular data directly measured from three tissues in a subset of participants allowed fine-scale multi-OMIC profiling of individual postprandial responses (RNA-seq in SKM and SQAT, miRNA from plasma exosomes and shotgun lipidomics in blood). Dynamic postprandial immunometabolic molecular endophenotypes were obtained to move towards a personalized, patient-defined medicine. This study offers an example of integrative translational research, which applies bench-to-bedside research to clinical medicine. Our F/P study design has the potential to characterize CV/immunometabolic early risk detection in support of precision medicine and discovery in SF individuals.","output":"Replication of Integrative Data Analysis for Adipose Tissue Dysfunction, Low-Grade Inflammation, Postprandial Responses and OMICs Signatures in Symptom-Free Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an attempt to control the mosquito-borne diseases yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika fevers, a strain of transgenically modified Aedes aegypti mosquitoes containing a dominant lethal gene has been developed by a commercial company, Oxitec Ltd.

However, these studies lack contemporaneously enrolled critically ill patients to understand whether high rates of AKI are unique to COVID-19. It is also unknown whether the risk of AKI is related to SARS-CoV-2 genomic load. Methods: We prospectively enrolled a cohort of patients admitted to the ICU with suspicion of COVID-19 (persons under investigation) from April to September 2020. Of these patients, 78 (46%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and 91 (54%) tested negative (non-COVID-19). AKI was defined as an increase  0.3 mg/dL in 48 hours or  50% increase in serum creatinine (sCr) measured during hospitalization compared to a 'baseline' sCr measured at study enrollment. New dialysis was defined as initiation of dialysis during hospitalization. SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR was performed across four different platforms with comparable cycle threshold (Ct) values. Ct values were a semiquantitative measure of genomic load with an inverse relationship of Ct to genomic load. We used relative risk regression to determine if there was an increased risk of AKI in COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 and whether SARS-CoV-2 genomic load was associated with AKI. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and APACHE III scores. Results: Rates of AKI and new dialysis were similar in COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 (AKI: n=23 (29%) vs n=24 (26%) and Dialysis: n=8 (10%) vs n=6 (6%). Unadjusted and adjusted analyses demonstrated a non-significant difference in risk of AKI (adjusted RR = 1.04 (95% CI: 0.65-1.66) or new dialysis (adjusted RR = 1.55 (95% CI 0.58-4.12) in COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19. We had Ct values available prior to ICU admission in 47 patients. In unadjusted and adjusted analyses, a 10-unit decrement in Ct values was not associated with AKI (adjusted RR = 0.40 (95% CI: 0.14-1.14) or new dialysis (adjusted RR = 0.96 (95% CI: 0.23-2.69) (Figure 1). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that rates of AKI and new dialysis in ICU patients with COVID-19 are similar to rates in non-COVID-19 ICU patients. Moreover, the lack of association between Ct values and AKI in COVID-19, suggests that immune and host response to SARS-CoV-2 may contribute more to risk of AKI in ICU patients rather than the pathogen itself.","output":"Rates of aki in ICU patients admitted under suspicion for COVID-19 do not differ by SARS-CoV 2 status or SARS-CoV-2 genomic load"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A comprehensive evaluation of supervised machine learning models for COVID-19 related domain name detection is presented.

Information on demographic variables, the COVID-19-related events in the lives, knowledge of COVID-19 and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) was collected using online self-administered questionnaires. The mental health status were assessed using the Chinese version of Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) and Chinese version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7 ). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. Results: A total of 822 participants completed questionnaires correctly. (response rate of 95.80% ). The overall prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms were 33.73%, and 29.35%, respectively.

Hence, it is vital to implement an effective screening method of patients using chest radiography since the equipment already exists. With the presence of automatic detection systems, any abnormalities in chest radiography that characterizes COVID-19 can be identified.

SARS-CoV-2 disease is severe in K18 transgenic mice (K18-hACE2 Tg) expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, under an ectopic cytokeratin promoter, with high levels of infection measured in the lung and brain. Here, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 knock-in (KI) mice that express hACE2 under an endogenous promoter in place of murine ACE2 (mACE2). Intranasal inoculation of hACE2 KI mice with SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 resulted in substantial viral replication within the upper and lower respiratory tracts with limited spread to extrapulmonary organs. However, SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2 KI mice did not lose weight and developed limited pathology. Moreover, no significant differences in viral burden were observed in hACE2 KI mice infected with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 variants compared to the WA1/2020 strain. Because the entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 in mice remain uncertain, we evaluated the impact of the naturally occurring, mouse-adapting N501Y mutation by comparing infection of hACE2 KI, K18-hACE2 Tg, ACE2-deficient, and wild-type C57BL/6 mice. The N501Y mutation minimally affected SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 KI mice but was required for viral replication in wild-type C57BL/6 mice in a mACE2-dependent manner and augmented pathogenesis in the K18-hACE2 Tg mice. Thus, the N501Y mutation likely enhances interactions with mACE2 or hACE2 in vivo. Overall, our study highlights the hACE2 KI mice as a model of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease and clarifies the requirement of the N501Y mutation in mice. IMPORTANCE Mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis have facilitated the rapid evaluation of countermeasures. While the first generation of models developed pneumonia and severe disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection, they relied on ectopic expression of supraphysiological levels of human ACE2 (hACE2). This has raised issues with their relevance to humans, as the hACE2 receptor shows a more restricted expression pattern in the respiratory tract. Here, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease with viruses containing or lacking a key mouse-adapting mutation in the spike gene in hACE2 KI mice, which express hACE2 under an endogenous promoter in place of murine ACE2. While infection of hACE2 KI mice with multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2 including variants of concern resulted in viral replication within the upper and lower respiratory tracts, the animals did not sustain severe lung injury. Thus, hACE2 KI mice serve as a model of mild infection with both ancestral and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant strains.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Causes Lung Infection without Severe Disease in Human ACE2 Knock-In Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has infected 47 million individuals and is responsible for over 1.2 million deaths to date.

Antibody levels decrease with time, but the nature and quality of the memory B cells that would be called upon to produce antibodies upon re-infection has not been examined. Here we report on the humoral memory response in a cohort of 87 individuals assessed at 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection. We find that IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody titers decrease significantly with IgA being less affected. Concurrently, neutralizing activity in plasma decreases by five-fold in pseudotype virus assays. In contrast, the number of RBD-specific memory B cells is unchanged. Memory B cells display clonal turnover after 6.2 months, and the antibodies they express have greater somatic hypermutation, increased potency and resistance to RBD mutations, indicative of continued evolution of the humoral response. Analysis of intestinal biopsies obtained from asymptomatic individuals 3 months after COVID-19 onset, using immunofluorescence, electron tomography or polymerase chain reaction, revealed persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the small bowel of 7 out of 14 volunteers.

The fall in functional residual capacity promotes airway closure and atelectasis formation. This narrative review presents the impact of obesity on the respiratory system and the key points to optimize airway management, noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation in ICU patients with obesity. Non-invasive strategies should first optimize body position with reverse Trendelenburg position or sitting position. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is considered as the first-line therapy in patients with obesity having a postoperative acute respiratory failure. Positive pressure pre-oxygenation before the intubation procedure is the method of reference. The use of videolaryngoscopy has to be considered by adequately trained intensivists, especially in patients with several risk factors. Regarding mechanical ventilation in patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), low tidal volume (6 ml/kg of predicted body weight) and moderate to high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), with careful recruitment maneuver in selected patients, are advised. Prone positioning is a therapeutic choice in severe ARDS patients with obesity. Prophylactic NIV should be considered after extubation to prevent re-intubation.

However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, blended learning was modified into full online learning. This modification provided a new experience for both lecturers and students, especially during role-play videos through video conferences. This study aimed to examine educational interventions using blended learning modules to promote student perceptions of professional behaviors such as civility and professional role models in nursing education. Methods: This study applied a pre and post-test design. This study used two questionnaires to assess respondents' perceptions, including the civility index questionnaire and the professional role model questionnaire. A total of 44 respondents at a private nursing school in Jakarta were involved in the study. As the learning modality was shifted to fully online learning, only 20 respondents finished the intervention. Subsequently, only 17 students completed the questionnaires before and after the intervention. Results: This study indicates a significant difference in student perceptions on classmate civility (p-value 0.08) before and after the intervention. Conclusions: Students become more aware of expected civility from their classmates and have higher expectations on civil behaviors from their peers after participating in the study. Moreover, the role-play videos produced by students are also evidence that students were able to demonstrate civility-incivility instances in nursing education. Further research is recommended by involving a more significant number of respondents and using a control group to support the generalizability of study results.","output":"Blended learning to promote professional behavior during the covid-19 pandemic: A pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use the Bank of Italy's Survey on Inflation and Growth Expectations to explore how the COVID-19 shock affects firms pricing policies and their inflation expectations.

The neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) class of drugs, including oseltamivir, have been the standard of care (SOC) for severe influenza illness for many years. The approval of drugs with novel mechanisms of action, such as baloxavir marboxil, is important and broadens potential treatment options for combination therapy. The use of antiviral treatments in combination for influenza is of interest; one potential benefit of this treatment strategy is that the combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action may lower the selection of resistance due to treatment. In addition, combination therapy may become an important treatment option to improve patient outcomes in those with severe illness due to influenza or those that are immunocompromised. Clinical trials increasingly evaluate drug combinations in a range of patient cohorts. Here, we summarise preclinical and clinical advances in combination therapy for the treatment of influenza with reference to immunocompromised animal models and clinical data in hospitalised patient cohorts where available. There is a wide array of drug categories in development that have also been tested in combination. Therefore, in this review, we have included polymerase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), host-targeted therapies, and adjunctive therapies. Combination treatment regimens should be carefully evaluated to determine whether they provide an added benefit relative to effectiveness of monotherapy and in a variety of patient cohorts, particularly, if there is a greater chance of an adverse outcome.

As this rapid growth occurs even in countries with high levels of vaccinations, the question arises as to their effectiveness. The smoothed daily number of new cases and deaths per capita and the ratio of these characteristics were used to reveal the appearance of new coronavirus strains and to estimate the effectiveness of quarantine, testing and vaccination. The third year of the pandemic allowed us to compare the pandemic dynamics in the period from September 2020 to January 2021 with the same period one year later for Ukraine, EU, the UK, USA, India, Brazil, South Africa, Argentina, Australia, and in the whole world. Record numbers of new cases registered in late 2021 and early 2022 once again proved that existing vaccines cannot prevent new infections, and vaccinated people can spread the infection as intensively as non-vaccinated ones. Fortunately, the daily number of new cases already diminishes in EU, the UK, USA, South Africa, and Australia. In late January - early February 2022,the maximum averaged numbers of new cases are expected in Brazil, India, EU, and worldwide.

METHODS: interRAI assessments of Maori, Pacific Peoples and NZ Europeans (aged 60 years and older) completed between 21/3/2020 and 8/6/2020 were compared with assessments of the same ethnicities during the same period in the previous year (21/3/2019 to 8/6/2019). Physical, cognitive, psychosocial and service utilisation indicators were included in the bivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 538 Maori, 276 Pacific Peoples and 11,322 NZ Europeans had an interRAI assessment during the first wave of COVID-19, while there were 549 Maori, 248 Pacific Peoples and 12,367 NZ Europeans in the comparative period. Fewer Maori reported feeling lonely (7.8% vs. 4.5%, p = 0.021), but more NZ Europeans reported severe depressive symptoms (6.9% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.028) during COVID-19.

To date, research has focused on telemedicine use among patients with adequate insurance coverage. To address this gap, this study identifies patient-level factors associated with telemedicine use during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic among one free clinic network's patients who are underinsured or uninsured. Materials and Methods: Electronic health record data were reviewed for patient-level data on patients seen from March 2020 to September 2020. Patients were grouped by telemedicine use history. We controlled for sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, race/ethnicity) and comorbidities. Logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: Across 198 adult patients, 56.6% received telemedicine care. Of these, 99.1% elected for audio-only telemedicine instead of video telemedicine. Telemedicine use was more likely among those living within 15 miles of their clinic (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.70-11.53). It was less likely to be used by older patients (aOR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-1.00), patients of male sex (aOR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.18-0.92), and those establishing care as a new patient (aOR = 0.01, 95% CI 0.00-0.07). Conclusion: The moderate usage of telemedicine suggests that its implementation in free clinics may be feasible.

This study aims to better understand outpatient antibiotic use and prescription in order to identify tailored targets for future public health actions. Using data from the French National Health Data System, we described and compared the individual characteristics of patients with and without an antibiotic prescription. The prescribed antibiotics (ATC-J01) were detailed and compared between 2019 and 2020. Antibiotic prescribing indicators that take prescriber activity into account were estimated and compared. Patients who were female, advanced age, and the presence of comorbidities were associated with antibiotic prescriptions. The overall prescription rate was estimated at 134 per 1000 consultations and 326 per 1000 patients seen in 2019. General practitioners (GPs), dentists and paediatricians were associated with 78.0%, 12.2% and 2.2% of antibiotic prescriptions, respectively, with high prescription rates (391, 447, and 313 p. 1000 patients seen, respectively). In comparison with 2019, this rate decreased in 2020 for paediatricians (?30.4%) and GPs (?17.9%) whereas it increased among dentists (+17.9%). The reduction was twice as high among the male prescribers than among their female counterparts (?26.6 and ?12.0, respectively). The reduction in prescriptions observed in 2020 (?18.2%) was more marked in children (?35.8%) but less so among individuals 65 years (?13.1%) and those with comorbidities (?12.5%). The decrease in penicillin prescriptions represents 67.3% of the overall reduction observed in 2020. The heterogeneous decrease in prescriptions by age and antibiotic class could be explained by the impact of COVID-19 control measures on the spread of respiratory viruses; thus, a substantial proportion of the prescriptions avoided in 2020 is likely inappropriate, particularly among children. In order to keep the rate of prescriptions comparable to that observed in 2020, male prescribers, paediatricians and GPs should be encouraged to maintain that level, while a campaign to raise awareness of the appropriate use of antibiotics should be aimed at dentists in particular.","output":"Outpatient Antibiotic Prescriptions in France: Patients and Providers Characteristics and Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A quarter century after the United Nations endorsed the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995), which identified the necessary steps to remove all barriers to gender equality and the advancement and empowerment of women, support for gender equality across the world inspires encouraging optimism, judging by the results of a global survey conducted by the Pew Research Center (April 2020).

However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel patterns due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 50 States of the US and Washington D.C, the capital city of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people (e.g., education, income, family size, and employment status), built environment data (e.g., population density), and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of family members and high income are less interested in reopening the economy. The accuracy of the model is reasonable (i.e., the model can correctly classify 56.18% of the sentiments). The Pearson chi-squared test indicates that this model has high goodness-of-fit.

False news, conspiracy theories, and magical cures were shared with the general public at an alarming rate, which may lead to increased anxiety and stress levels and associated debilitating consequences. OBJECTIVES: To measure the level of COVID-19 information overload (COVIO) and assess the association between COVIO and sociodemographic characteristics among the general public. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between April and May 2020 using a modified Cancer Information Overload scale. The survey was developed and posted on four social media platforms. The data were only collected from those who consented to participate. COVIO score was classified into high vs. low using the asymmetrical distribution as a guide and conducted a binary logistic regression to examine the factors associated with COVIO. RESULTS: A total number of 584 respondents participated in this study. The mean COVIO score of the respondents was 19.4 ( 4.0). Sources and frequency of receiving COVID-19 information were found to be significant predictors of COVIO. Participants who received information via the broadcast media were more likely to have high COVIO than those who received information via the social media (adjusted odds ratio ([aOR],14.599; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.608C132.559; p = 0.017).

As an alternative, supraglottic airway devices (SAD) are efficient and technically easy to insert. We therefore evaluated the time to ventilation, success rate, and skill retention for various airway management approaches by medical laypersons using a manikin model. METHODS Fifty medical laypersons with no previous experience whatsoever in airway management or resuscitation were enrolled. All participants received a 1-h-long theoretical lecture and a practical demonstration of mouth-to-mouth ventilation, ETI, and six SAD. Afterwards, the laypersons performed mouth-to-mouth ventilation and used each of the seven airway-management systems on an advanced patient simulator (SimMan) in a random sequence. All participants were re-evaluated 3 months later without any further practical or theoretical demonstration. RESULTS The success rates for ETI were 74% during the first evaluation and 64% during the second, whereas the success rate for all six SAD was 100% during all application attempts. The success rate for mouth-to-mouth ventilation was 86% initially and 84% 3 months later. The time to adequate mouth-to-mouth ventilation was 15  13 s initially and 16  7 s subsequently.

This is seen in the current COVID-19 pandemic, as alveolar epithelium is one of the major targets of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Thus, it is essential to understand the mechanisms to maintain the integrity of alveoli epithelium. Alveolar type II (AT2) cells behave as tissue stem cells that repair alveoli epithelium in steady-state replacement and after injury. However, not all AT2 cells are equal in their ability for self-renewal or differentiation. Through marker gene identification, lineage tracing, and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), distinct subpopulations of AT2 cells have been identified that play the progenitor role in different context. The revelation of AT2 heterogeneity has brought new insights into the role of AT2 cells in various lung disease settings and potentiates the finding of more therapeutics targets. In this mini review, we discussed the recently identified subpopulations of AT2 cells and their functions under steady state, after injury and in pathological conditions.","output":"Heterogeneous groups of alveolar type II cells in lung homeostasis and repair"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Given that the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted operations globally, an institution's ability to repeat transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has also been affected. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 on the intervals and outcomes of TACE in HCC patients. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 154 HCC patients who underwent follow-up after TACE treatment from January 2020 to March 2020 (n = 71, study group) and January 2019 to March 2019 (n = 83, control group) at two institutions in China. The endpoints included the follow-up interval and overall response rate (ORR). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for a worse ORR. The cut-off point was determined to divide follow-up durations into long- and short-intervals. Results: The median follow-up interval was 82.0 days (IQR, 61-109) in the study group, which was significantly longer than 66.0 days (IQR, 51-94) in the control group (P = 0.004). The ORR was 23.9 and 39.8% in the study and control group, respectively (P = 0.037). The cut-off value was 95 days. The grouping (OR, 2.402;95% CI, 1.040-5.546;P = 0.040), long interval (OR, 2.573;95% CI, 1.022-6.478;P = 0.045), and China liver cancer staging system (OR, 2.500;95% CI, 1.797-3.480;P &lt;0.001) were independent predictors for the efficacy of TACE treatment. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic causes a longer follow-up interval in general, which may further lead to a lower ORR in HCC patients.

With the global spread increasing and infecting millions, containment efforts by countries have largely focused on lockdowns and social distancing to minimise contact between persons. Social distancing has been touted as the best form of response in managing a rapid increase in the number of infected cases. In this paper, we present a deterministic model to describe the impact of social distancing on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in South Africa. The model is fitted to data from March 5 to April 13, 2020, on the cumulative number of infected cases, and a scenario analysis on different levels of social distancing is presented. The model shows that with the levels of social distancing under the initial lockdown level between March 26 and April 13, 2020, there would be a projected continued rise in the number of infected cases. The model also looks at the impact of relaxing the social distancing measures after the initial announcement of the lockdown. It is shown that relaxation of social distancing by 2% can result in a 23% rise in the number of cumulative cases whilst an increase in the level of social distancing by 2% would reduce the number of cumulative cases by about 18%. The model results accurately predicted the number of cases after the initial lockdown level was relaxed towards the end of April 2020.

Clinical and pathophysiological factors shared by these conditions are reviewed. METHODS: Review of the published literature since the beginning of 2020. RESULTS: COVID-19 is a respiratory infectious disease and SARS-CoV-2 replication and shedding occurs in nasal and bronchial epithelial respiratory cells through the interaction with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors, both overexpressed in smokers and former smokers. Tobacco-smoke airway exposure is also characterized by a chronic inflammation with activation of inflammatory cells and cytokine release including interleukin-6 (IL-6). A high release of cytokine in response to viral infection is documented in COVID-19 patients with adverse clinical outcomes and IL-6 is a key element of the cytokine storm syndrome leading to multi-organ damage.

This response manifested as increased phosphorylation and, thus, activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-&#954;B and was also seen in other subsets, including CD11c+ myeloid dendritic cells, classical monocytes, two subsets of natural killer cells (CD16-CD56brightCD161- and CD16-CD56dimCD161+), and lineage- (Lin-) cells expressing CD161 and CD25.

Prolonged IL-1? stimulation increased the phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3 and to a lesser extent that of STAT1 and STAT5 across various immune cell types.

An important challenge in infectious disease research is to understand molecular similarities and differences in mammalian host response to diverse sets of pathogens. Recently, systems biology studies have produced rich collections of omic profiles measuring host response to infectious agents such as influenza viruses at multiple levels. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory network driving host response to multiple infectious agents, we integrated host transcriptomes and proteomes using a network-based approach. Our approach combines expression-based regulatory network inference, structured-sparsity based regression, and network information flow to infer putative physical regulatory programs for expression modules. We applied our approach to identify regulatory networks, modules and subnetworks that drive host response to multiple influenza infections. The inferred regulatory network and modules are significantly enriched for known pathways of immune response and implicate apoptosis, splicing, and interferon signaling processes in the differential response of viral infections of different pathogenicities. We used the learned network to prioritize regulators and study virus and time-point specific networks. RNAi-based knockdown of predicted regulators had significant impact on viral replication and include several previously unknown regulators.

Our previous case report has shown promising results for rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) in the treatment of Graves orbitopathy. DESIGN: We present the response of 7 individuals with active moderate-to-severe steroid-resistant Graves orbitopathy to rATG, representing preliminary results from a prospective single-center study. METHODS: rATG was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.8C1.0 mg/kg daily (cumulative dose of 150C200 mg). The primary outcome measures at weeks 24 and 48 were 2-point reduction in Clinical Activity Score from baseline, a proptosis response, a diplopia response, and improvement of distant best-corrected visual acuity and mean retinal sensitivity. Key secondary outcomes included stabilization of ganglion cell complex thickness, a decrease of retinal nerve fiber layer in OCT, and a reduction in CD4/CD8 ratio and TRAb at 48 weeks. RESULTS: An improvement in clinical activity score was observed in all patients, with disease inactivation in 3 cases. Proptosis reduction equal to or greater than 2 mm was noted for 8 of 10 eyes. Diplopia improved in three of 6 patients. There was an improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (from 0.69 to 0.78) and mean retinal sensitivity (from 20.8 to 23.5 dB).

RESULTS: No differences were observed in the Whooley, GAD-2 or EPDS scores among pregnant women. The postpartum total GAD-2 scores before vs during the pandemic showed significant differences. Controlling for confounders, we observed a small main positive effect of having an infant during time of COVID-19 (F(1.13) = 5.06, p.025, d.27). The effect was significantly larger for women with (a history of) perinatal psychological problems (F(1.12) = 51.44, p < .001, d.82). Emotional support was significantly related to GAD-2 scores of postpartum women during the pandemic (F(1.90) = 35.54, p < .001). Postpartum women reported significant higher effects of the pandemic on their behavior compared to pregnant women (p.034). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have a positive effect on postpartum women during the first year postpartum, in particular for women with (a history of) perinatal psychological problems and for those women who experienced emotional support. The findings suggest that less external stimuli caused by lockdown restrictions might have a positive effect on postpartum womens emotional wellbeing. The sample consisted of white, educated women in a relationship and information regarding the extent of exposure to adverse COVID-19 consequences was lacking. We relied on self-selection and self-report. The postpartum pandemic sample was small.","output":"Psychological health of pregnant and postpartum women before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In anterior fusion, we use autologous bone grafts from cervical vertebral bodies (Williams-Isu method; WI-method).

In this study, the non-volcanic eruption period was taken as the target and daily PM(2.5) samples were collected from 24 November to 21 December 2016. The daily concentrations in PM(2.5) of ?PAHs, ?NPAHs, and ?WSIIs ranged from 0.36 to 2.90 ng/m(3), 2.12 to 22.3 pg/m(3), and 1.96 to 11.4 g/m(3), respectively. Through the results of the diagnostic ratio analyses of the PAHs, NPAHs, and WSIIs and the backward trajectory analysis of the air masses arriving in Kirishima, the emission sources of PAHs, NPAHs, and WSIIs in PM(2.5) in Kirishima were influenced by the coal burning that came from the East Asian continent, although there was no influence from volcanic emission sources during the sampling period. The total benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)-equivalent concentration was lower than many other cities but the health risks in Kirishima were nonetheless notable. These findings are very important for future research on PM samples during the inactive Asian monsoon and volcanic eruption periods, to further understand the characteristics of air pollutants in Kirishima, and to contribute to the improvement in health of residents and a reduction in the atmospheric circulation of air pollutants in East Asia.","output":"Atmospheric Behaviour of Polycyclic and Nitro-Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Water-Soluble Inorganic Ions in Winter in Kirishima, a Typical Japanese Commercial City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The objective of this study was to evaluate our experience with robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) in comparison with conventional open partial nephrectomy (OPN).

Trifecta was defined as satisfying all of the following 3 criteria: ischemic time of  25 minutes, negative surgical margin and no major postoperative complications. Results After adjusting patient variables by 1:1 propensity-score matching, 37 patients were included in each group, and no significant differences in major clinicopathological characteristics were noted between these 2 groups. RAPN was significantly superior to OPN with respect to operative time, estimated blood loss and postoperative length of hospital stay. The rate of trifecta achievement was significantly higher in the RAPN group than in the OPN group (91.9 vs. 62.2%). Furthermore, the operative procedure and R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score were found to be independently associated with trifecta outcome by multivariate analysis of the entire cohort.

The unfolded protein response (UPR), which is mediated by ER stress (ERS), is a typical outcome in coronavirus-infected cells and is closely associated with the characteristics of coronaviruses. However, the interaction between virus-induced ERS and coronavirus replication is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that infection with the betacoronavirus porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) induced ERS and triggered all three branches of the UPR signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ERS suppressed PHEV replication in mouse neuro-2a (N2a) cells primarily by activating the protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK)-eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) axis of the UPR. Moreover, another eIF2a phosphorylation kinase, interferon (IFN)-induced double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), was also activated and acted cooperatively with PERK to decrease PHEV replication. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the PERK/PKR-eIF2a pathways negatively regulated PHEV replication by attenuating global protein translation. Phosphorylated eIF2a also promoted the formation of stress granules (SGs), which in turn repressed PHEV replication. In summary, our study presents a vital aspect of the host innate response to invading pathogens and reveals attractive host targets (e.g., PERK, PKR, and eIF2a) for antiviral drugs.

We assessed the immunogenicity of BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) administered as a second dose in healthcare workers primed with ChAdOx1-S (Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca). Methods: 197 healthcare workers were included in a monocentric observational study in Foch hospital, France, between June and July 2021. The main outcome was the immunogenicity measured by serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Results: 130 participants received the ChAdOx1-S/BNT vaccine and 67 received the BNT/BNT vaccine. The geometric mean of IgG antibodies was significantly higher in the BNT/BNT vaccine group compared to the ChAdOx1-S/BNT vaccine group, namely 10,734.9, 95% CI (9141.1C12,589.3) vs. 7268.6, 95% CI (6501.3C8128.3), respectively (p < 0.001). However, after adjustment for time duration between the prime and second vaccinations, no significant difference was observed (p = 0.181). A negative correlation between antibody levels and time duration between second dose and serology test was observed for the BNT/BNT vaccine (p < 0.001), which remained significant after adjustment for all covariates (p < 0.001), but not for the ChAdOx1-S/BNT vaccine (p = 0.467). Conclusions: Heterologous and homologous schedules of ChAdOx1-S and BNT vaccines present robust immune responses after the second vaccination. The results observed were equivalent after adjustment for covariates and emphasize the importance of flexibility in deploying mRNA and viral vectored vaccines. Nevertheless, applying the ChAdOx1-S schedule vaccination for the heterologous second dose of BNT was associated with decreased IgG antibody levels compared to the homologous BNT/BNT vaccination.","output":"An Immunogenicity Report for the Comparison between Heterologous and Homologous Prime-Boost Schedules with ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2 Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Increasingly, community-based models of doula care are receiving attention as possible interventions to address racial inequities in maternal health care experiences and outcomes. In 2018, community-based organization SisterWeb launched to provide free culturally congruent community doula care to advance birth equity for Black and Pacific Islander pregnant people, with funding from the San Francisco Department of Public Health. We conducted a process evaluation of SisterWebs first 1.5 years of existence to identify multilevel barriers and facilitators to implementation of their programs. METHODS: Guided by the Equitable Evaluation Framework?, we conducted 46 in-depth interviews with individuals from 5 groups: SisterWeb leadership, doulas, doula mentors, and clients, and external stakeholders. RESULTS: Barriers included having diverse clientele groups with unique needs, an ineffective payment model, and simultaneously building an organization and developing and implementing programs. Facilitators included the presence of established strategic partnerships, positive reception of services due to an unmet need for culturally and linguistically congruent pregnancy and birth support among SisterWebs clients, a clear organizational vision and mission, and a unique doula cohort model. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest developing community doula programs pay close attention to the difference between launching a program versus an organization, including the required resources of each, the sustainability of payment models for community doulas, and the provision of culturally relevant, needed services within priority communities. Furthermore, strategic partnerships with maternal health stakeholders in birthing sites, particularly hospitals, are vital to the success of a community doula program.","output":"Barriers and Facilitators to the Implementation of a Community Doula Program for Black and Pacific Islander Pregnant People in San Francisco: Findings from a Partnered Process Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Achieving food and feed self\\\\sufficiency is important for both China and the world.

The aims of this study are to report characteristics, rates and outcomes of all patients affected by infection with SARS-CoV-2 undergoing HD and treated under our care METHOD: This is an observational study. Our Dialysis Unit has been assigned as a referral unit for Covid-19 positive HD patients. We registered all the data regarding the clinical course of our patients population. Age, primary cause of end stage renal disease, weight, clinical presentation, HD history, outcome, days of hospitalization. RESULTS: 22 Covid-19 positive HD patients were treated under the care of our facility during the period 8 April 2020-17 June 2020. 16 patients were symptomatic at admission and 13 patients admitted with or developed during their stay pleural effusions. 12 patients (8 male) of our group died during their hospitalization. 3 out of 12 were admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). 6 patients were septic, 4 had respiratory failure and 2 developed cardiovascular events. 14.5 days were the mean hospitalization days (range: 1-38 days) for the diceased ones. 2 out of 3 patients that admitted to ICU had quick deterioration, incubated and stayed in ICU for 48 hours. The third one with severe cormobidities (multiple myeloma, cancer of bladder) developed respiratory failure after 8 days of hospitalization, incubated, became septic and died after 20 days in ICU. Mean age of our patients was 74.5 years. It has to be pointed out that 13 patients were over 75 years old. Mean age was higher in those who died compared with those who were discharged with double negative Covid-19 tests (79 vs 74,5 years old respectively). Median dialysis vintage for our patients was 63 months and for the diceased ones was 89 months. Average weight of our patients was 69 kgrs. Weight of diceased patients was 63 kgrs. 11 out of 22 patients and 5 out of 12 diceased patients were diabetic. 14 patients were hypertensive and 16 had official cardiovascular backround. 10 out of total 22 patients under our care discharged after 43 days of hospitalization (range:35-56 days). CONCLUSION: As a conclusion our data provide clues regarding out experience of caring HD patients with COVID-19. Mortality was high.

In most cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in the development of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, known as coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. Intriguingly, besides the respiratory tract, COVID-19 affects other organs and systems of the human body. COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease have a higher risk of death, and SARS-CoV-2 infection itself may cause myocardial inflammation and injury. One possible explanation of such phenomena is the fact that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor required for viral entry. ACE2 is expressed in the cells of many organs, including the heart. ACE2 functions as a carboxypeptidase that can cleave several endogenous substrates, including angiotensin II, thus regulating blood pressure and vascular tone. It remains largely unknown if the SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the enzymatic properties of ACE2, thereby contributing to cardiovascular complications in patients with COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate that ACE2 cleavage of des-Arg9-bradykinin substrate analog is markedly accelerated, while cleavage of angiotensin II analog is minimally affected by the binding of spike protein. These findings may have implications for a better understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding selectively accelerates substrate-specific catalytic activity of ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with diabetes experience impaired growth factor production such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and they are reportedly involved in wound healing processes.

Central in COVID-19 is the burst of cytokines, known as a cytokine storm, and the subsequent widespread endothelial activation, leading to cardiovascular complications such as myocarditis, arrhythmias, and adverse vascular events, among others. Genetic alterations may play an additive, detrimental role in the clinical course of patients with COVID-19, since gene alterations concerning ACE2, major histocompatibility complex class I, and toll-like receptors may predispose patients to a worse clinical outcome. Since the role of inflammation is quintessential in COVID-19, pharmacologic inhibition of various signaling pathways such as the interleukin-1 and -6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon gamma, Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription, and granulocyteCmacrophage colony-stimulating factor may ameliorate the prognosis following timely administration.

During the past decade, evidence has accrued on the protection afforded by inactivated vaccines and the safety and efficacy in children of live influenza-virus vaccines. There have been many new developments in vaccine technology. Moreover, work on viral neuraminidase has led to the licensing of potent selective antiviral drugs, and economic decision modelling provides further justification for annual vaccination and a framework for the use of neuraminidase inhibitors. Progress has also been made on developing near-patient testing for influenza that may assist individual diagnosis or the recognition of widespread virus circulation, and so optimise clinical management. Despite these advances, the occurrence of avian H5N1, H9N2, and H7N7 influenza in human beings and the rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome are reminders of our vulnerability to an emerging pandemic. The contrast between recent cases of H5N1 infection, associated with high mortality, and the typically mild, self-limiting nature of human infections with avian H7N7 and H9N2 influenza shows the gaps in our understanding of molecular correlates of pathogenicity and underlines the need for continuing international research into pandemic influenza.

Methods: 443 serum specimens from serial sampling of 29 COVID-19 patients were used to determine clinical sensitivities. Patients were stratified for the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Individual serum specimens from a pre- COVID-19 cohort of 238 healthy subjects and from a PCR-negative clinical cohort of 257 patients were used to determine clinical specificities. All samples were measured side-by-side with the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgG), Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) (Euroimmun AG, Lubeck, Germany) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA (Roche Diagnostics International, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Results: Median seroconversion occurred earlier in ARDS patients (8-9 days) than in non-ARDS patients (11-17 days), except for EUR N-IgG. Rates of positivity and mean signal ratios in the ARDS group were significantly higher than in the non-ARDS group. Sensitivities between the four tested immunoassays were equivalent.

To the best of the authors knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source network designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases, with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the best of the authors knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who need it the most.","output":"COVID-Net: a tailored deep convolutional neural network design for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The involvement of host proteins in the replication and transcription of viral RNA is a poorly understood area for many RNA viruses. For coronaviruses, it was long speculated that replication of the giant RNA genome and transcription of multiple subgenomic mRNA species by a unique discontinuous transcription mechanism may require host cofactors. To search for such cellular proteins, yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out by using the nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) from the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) as a bait protein, leading to the identification of DDX1, a cellular RNA helicase in the DExD/H helicase family, as a potential interacting partner. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays with cells coexpressing the two proteins and with IBV-infected cells. Furthermore, the endogenous DDX1 protein was found to be relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in IBV-infected cells. In addition to its interaction with IBV nsp14, DDX1 could also interact with the nsp14 protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), suggesting that interaction with DDX1 may be a general feature of coronavirus nsp14. The interacting domains were mapped to the C-terminal region of DDX1 containing motifs V and VI and to the N-terminal portion of nsp14. Manipulation of DDX1 expression, either by small interfering RNA-induced knockdown or by overexpression of a mutant DDX1 protein, confirmed that this interaction may enhance IBV replication. This study reveals that DDX1 contributes to efficient coronavirus replication in cell culture.","output":"The cellular RNA helicase DDX1 interacts with coronavirus nonstructural protein 14 and enhances viral replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is a phantom auditory sensation in the absence of an external stimulus. It is accompanied by a broad range of negative emotional symptoms and a significantly lower quality of life. So far, there is no cure for tinnitus, although various treatment options have been tried. One of them is mobile technology employing dedicated apps based on sound therapy. The apps can be managed by the patient and tailored according to their needs. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to assess the effect of a mobile app that generates background sounds on the severity of tinnitus. METHODS: The study involved 68 adults who had chronic tinnitus. Participants were divided into a study group (44 patients) and a control group (24 patients). For 6 months those in the study group used a free mobile app that enriched the sound environment with a background sound. Participants were instructed to use the app for at least 30 minutes a day using their preferred sound. The participants in the control group did not use the app. Subjective changes in the day-to-day functioning of both groups were evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire, a visual analog scale, and a user survey. RESULTS: After 3 months of using the app, the THI global score significantly decreased (P<.001) in the study group, decreasing again at 6 months (P<.001). The largest improvements were observed in the emotional and catastrophic reactions subscales. A clinically important change in the THI was reported by 39% of the study group (17/44). Almost 90% of the study participants (39/44) chose environmental sounds to listen to, the most popular being rain and ocean waves. In the control group, tinnitus severity did not change over 3 or 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Although the participants still experienced limitations caused by tinnitus, the advantage of the app was that it led to lower negative emotions and thus reduced overall tinnitus severity. It is worth considering whether a mobile app might be incorporated into the management of tinnitus in a professional setting.","output":"Chronic Tinnitus and the Positive Effects of Sound Treatment via a Smartphone App: Mixed-Design Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus-19 global pandemic has forced many governments around the world to enforce lockdowns to curtail the spread of the virus. Studies conducted in the UK, France, Italy and Brazil have demonstrated that one consequence of these lockdowns is significant distortion to the speed of the passage of time. The current study sought to establish how the passage of time was experienced during the Argentinian lockdown. An online questionnaire was used to measure passage of time judgments for the day and the week, physical activity, satisfaction with social interaction, the extent to which daily routines had changed due to covid and demographic data. The results show that distortions to the passage of time were widely experienced during the lockdown in Argentina. There was a tendency for participants to report time passing more quickly than normal. A faster passage of time was associated with being a woman, of younger age and more physically active. A slower passage of time was therefore associated with being a man, of older age and less physically active. The results indicate that whilst distortions to the passage of time during the covid-19 crisis appear to be a global phenomenon, cross-cultural differences are apparent in the factors which influence temporal experience.","output":"Experiences of distortions to the passage of time during the Argentinian Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 - More Lung Pocus and Sparing Use of Stethoscope, Chest X-Ray and Lung CT Abstract.

Despite full clinical recovery, unexpected, unusual and potentially life-threatening complications in these patients are increasingly being recognized, one such patient is discussed here. By far, this is the first ever reported case of a COVID-19 recovered recipient developing recurrent thrombotic complications, which led us to change our routine anticoagulation protocols. Case presentation: We performed liver transplantation on a 51-year-old gentleman with decompensated liver disease 23-days after recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. At the time of surgery, he had no known sequalae of COVID-19. His routine preoperative work-up showed no underlying coagulation disorders. He underwent living related liver transplant (modified right lobe graft) during which, despite massive blood loss and a prolonged anhepatic phase, his thromboelastographic (TEG) parameters persistently revealed hypercoagulability. He received anti-coagulation according to our standard protocol which is based on aPTT ratio and INR. After a brief uneventful early post-operative period, he developed hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT) on the 14 th postoperative day, and again after 4 days, both of which required surgical intervention. He was eventually discharged with normal graft function but was soon readmitted with recurrent HAT and necrosis of anterior sector with cholangiolar abscesses, further leading to graft loss, necessitating re-transplantation, from which he could not recover due to a rejection resistant to all conventional measures. Conclusions: : There is emerging evidence that patients following SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to be hypercoagulable. We believe that this hyper coagulability might have played a significant role in the development of hepatic arterial thrombosis and eventual graft loss in this patient. This highlights the importance of revisiting anticoagulation protocols in liver transplant recipients recovered from COVID-19 and base them on TEG rather than routine parameters such as INR and aPTT, which are routinely deranged in such patients.","output":"Recurrent hepatic artery thrombosis following living donor liver transplant as sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection: case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As of Feb 27, 2022, coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused 434,888,591 infections and 5,958,849 deaths worldwide, dealing a severe blow to the economies and cultures of most countries around the world. As the virus has mutated, its infectious capacity has further increased. Effective diagnosis of suspected cases is an important tool to stop the spread of the pandemic. Therefore, we intended to develop a computer-aided diagnosis system for the diagnosis of suspected cases. METHODS: To address the shortcomings of commonly used pre-training methods and exploit the information in unlabeled images, we proposed a new pre-training method based on transfer learning with self-supervised learning (TS). After that, a new convolutional neural network based on attention mechanism and deep residual network (RANet) was proposed to extract features. Based on this, a hybrid ensemble model (TSRNet) was proposed for classifying lung CT images of suspected patients as COVID-19 and normal. RESULTS: Compared with the existing five models in terms of accuracy (DarkCOVIDNet: 98.08%; Deep-COVID: 97.58%; NAGNN: 97.86%; COVID-ResNet: 97.78%; Patch-based CNN: 88.90%), TSRNet has the highest accuracy of 99.80%. In addition, the recall, f1-score, and AUC of the model reached 99.59%, 99.78%, and 1, respectively.

These cases with findings overlapping with cancer pose a significant dilemma for diagnostic purposes, follow-up, and management leading to possible treatment delays, unnecessary repeat imaging and sampling, and patient anxiety. These cases can largely be avoided by optimal coordination between vaccination and planned imaging as well as preemptive selection of vaccine administration site.

Whereas a large body of literature exists about the antiviral and antitumoral properties of NK cells, their potential role in bacterial infections is not that well delineated. Furthermore, NK cells are much more heterogeneous than previously thought and have tissue-characteristic features and phenotypes. This review gives an overview of airway NK cells and their position within the immunological army dressed against bacterial infections in the upper and predominantly the lower respiratory tracts. Whereas it appears that in several infections, NK cells play a non-redundant and protective role, they can likewise act as rather detrimental.

The chemical composition of propolis is highly complex, and varies with region and season. This inherent chemical variability presents several challenges to its standardisation and quality control. The present review was aimed at highlighting marker compounds for different types of propolis, produced by the species Apis mellifera, from different geographical origins and that display different biological activities, and to discuss strategies for quality control. Over 800 compounds have been reported in the different propolises such as temperate, tropical, birch, Mediterranean, and Pacific propolis; these mainly include alcohols, acids and their esters, benzofuranes, benzopyranes, chalcones, flavonoids and their esters, glycosides (flavonoid and diterpene), glycerol and its esters, lignans, phenylpropanoids, steroids, terpenes and terpenoids. Among these, flavonoids (> 140), terpenes and terpenoids (> 160) were major components. A broad range of biological activities, such as anti-oxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anticancer activities, have been ascribed to propolis constituents, as well as the potential of these compounds to be biomarkers. Several analytical techniques, including non-separation and separation methods have been described in the literature for the quality control assessment of propolis. Mass spectrometry coupled with separation methods, followed by chemometric analysis of the data, was found to be a valuable tool for the profiling and classification of propolis samples, including (bio)marker identification. Due to the rampant chemotypic variability, a multiple-marker assessment strategy considering geographical and biological activity marker(s) with chemometric analysis may be a promising approach for propolis quality assessment.

We hypothesize that continuation of RAAS inhibition will be superior to temporary discontinuation with regards to the primary endpoint of a global rank sum score. The global rank sum score has been successfully used in previous cardiovascular clinical trials. TRIAL DESIGN: This is an open label parallel two arm (1,1 ratio) randomized control superiority trial of approximately 40 COVID-19 patients who are on chronic RAAS inhibitor therapy. PARTICIPANTS: Adults who are admitted to hospital within the McGill University Health Centre systems (MUHC) including Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH), Montreal General Hospital (MGH) and Jewish General Hospital (JGH) and who are within 96 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis (confirmed via PCR on any biological sample) will be considered for the trial. Of note, the initial protocol to screen and enrol within 48 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis was extended through an amendment, to 96 hours to increase feasibility. Participants have to be 18 years or older and would have to be on RAAS inhibitors for at least a month to be considered eligible for the study. Additionally, RAAS inhibitors should not have been held for more than 48 hours before randomization. A list of inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the full protocol document. In order to prevent heart failure exacerbation, patients with reduced ejection fraction were excluded from the trial. Once a patient is admitted on the ward with a diagnosis of COVID-19, we will confirm with the treating physician if the participant is suitable for the RAAS-COVID trial and meets all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the patient is eligible and informed consent has been obtained we will collect data on sex, age, ethnicity, past medical history and list of medications (e.g. other anti-hypertensives or anticoagulants), for further analysis. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: All the study participants will be randomized to a strategy of temporarily holding the RAAS inhibitor [intervention] versus continuing the RAAS inhibitor [continued standard of care]. Among participants who are randomized to the intervention arm, alternative guide-line directed anti-hypertensive medication will be provided to the treating physician team (detail in study protocol). In the intervention arm RAAS inhibitor will be withheld for a total of 7 days with the possibility of the withdrawn medication being initiated at any point after day 7 or on the day of discharge. The recommendation for re-initiating the withdrawn medication will be made to the treating physician. The re-initiation of these therapies are according to standard convention and follow-up as per Canadian guidelines. Additionally, the date of restarting the withdrawn medication or whether the medication was re-prescribed on discharge or not, will be collected. This will be used to conduct a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, biomarkers such as troponin, c-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphocyte count will be assessed during the same time period. Samples will be collected on randomization, day 4 and day 7. MAIN OUTCOMES: PRIMARY ENDPOINT: In this study the primary end point is a global rank score calculated for all participants, regardless of treatment assignment ( score from 0 to 7). Please refer to table 4 in the full protocol. In the context of the current trial, it is estimated that death is the most meaningful endpoint, and therefore has the highest score ( score of 7). This is followed by admission to ICU, the need for mechanical ventilation etc. The lowest scores ( score of 1) are assigned to biomarker changes (e.g. change in troponin, change in CRP). This strategy has been used successfully in cardiovascular disease trials and therefore is applicable to the current trial. The primary endpoint for the present trial is assessed from baseline to day 7 (or discharge). Participants are ranked across the clinical and biomarker domains. Lower values indicate better health (or stability). Participants who died during the 7th day of the study will be ranked based on all events occurring before their death and also including the fatal event in the score. Next, participants who did not die but were transferred to ICU for invasive ventilation will be ranked based on all the events occurring before the ICU entry and also including the ICU admission in the score. Those participants who did not die were not transferred to ICU for invasive ventilation, will be ranked based on the subsequent outcomes. The mean rank score will then be compared between groups. In this scheme, a lower mean rank score indicates greater overall stability for participants. Secondary endpoints : The key secondary endpoints are the individual components of the primary components and include the following: death, transfer to ICU primarily for invasive ventilation, transfer to ICU for other indication, non-fatal MACE ( any of following, MI, stroke, acute HF, new onset Afib), length of stay > 4 days, development of acute kidney injury ( > 40% decline in eGFR or doubling of serum creatinine), urgent intravenous treatment for high blood pressure, 30% increase in baseline high sensitivity troponin, 30% increase in baseline BNP, increase in CRP to > 30% in 48 hours and lymphocyte count drop> 30%. We will also look at the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale for clinical improvement (in COVID-19) in our data. In this scale death will be assigned the highest score of 8. Patients with no limitation of activity will be assigned a score of 1 which indicates overall more stability (3). Additionally, we will evaluate the potential effects of discontinuing RAAS inhibition on alternative schedules (longer/shorter than 7 days, intermittent discontinuation) using a mechanistic mathematical model of COVID-19 immunopathology calibrated to data collected from our patient cohort. In particular, we will assess the impact of alternative schedules on primary and secondary endpoints including increases to baseline CRP and lymphocyte counts. RANDOMIZATION: Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be performed within an electronic database system at the time of enrolment using a random number generator, an approach that has been successfully used in other clinical trials. Neither participant, study team, or treating team will be blinded to the intervention arm. BLINDING: This is an open label study with no blinding. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The approximate number of participants required for this trial is 40 patients (randomized 1:1 to continuation versus discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors). This number was calculated based on previous rates of outcomes for COVID-19 in the literature (e.g. death, ICU transfer) and statistical power calculations.

Risk factors for severe COVID-19 include diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. Currently, there is no vaccine and no approved therapy. Therapeutic approaches are aimed at preventing viral replication and spread, limiting the impact of the inflammatory overdrive (cytokine storm), preventing thromboembolic complications and replacing or supporting organ function. However, despite organ support, mortality is currently 65% for those receiving advanced respiratory support and 78% for those requiring renal replacement therapies. Thus, efforts should be made to provide adjuvant organ protection therapy. This may imply novel therapies in clinical development (e.g., the Fas ligand trap asunercept), but uptake of repurposed drugs already in clinical use may be faster. In this regard, sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were recently shown to protect the heart and kidney both within and outside of a diabetic milieu context. Further, preclinical data support a beneficial effect for the lung. We now discuss the potential benefits and risks of SGLT2 inhibitors in COVID-19 and an ongoing clinical trial testing the impact of dapagliflozin on outcomes in COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure.","output":"Exploring Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter-2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors for Organ Protection in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is increasing awareness of the need for pre- and post-doctoral professional development and career guidance, however many academic institutions are only beginning to build out these functional roles.

MP referenced to predicted body weight (PBW) or respiratory system compliance have better predictive value for mortality than MP alone in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our objective was to assess the potential impact of consecutive changes of MP on hospital mortality among ARDS patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with severe ARDS receiving ECMO in a tertiary care referral center in Taiwan between May 2006 and October 2015. Serial changes of MP during ECMO were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients with severe ARDS rescued with ECMO were analyzed. Overall hospital mortality was 53.3%. There were no significant differences between survivors and nonsurvivors in terms of baseline values of MP or other ventilator settings. Cox regression models demonstrated that mean MP alone, MP referenced to PBW, and MP referenced to compliance during the first 3 days of ECMO were all independently associated with hospital mortality. Higher MP referenced to compliance (HR 2.289 [95% CI 1.214C4.314], p = 0.010) was associated with a higher risk of death than MP itself (HR 1.060 [95% CI 1.018C1.104], p = 0.005) or MP referenced to PBW (HR 1.004 [95% CI 1.002C1.007], p < 0.001). The 90-day hospital mortality of patients with high MP (> 14.4 J/min) during the first 3 days of ECMO was significantly higher than that of patients with low MP (Q 14.4 J/min) (70.7% vs. 46.8%, p = 0.004), and the 90-day hospital mortality of patients with high MP referenced to compliance (> 0.53 J/min/ml/cm H(2)O) during the first 3 days of ECMO was significantly higher than that of patients with low MP referenced to compliance (Q 0.53 J/min/ml/cm H(2)O) (63.6% vs. 29.7%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MP during the first 3 days of ECMO was the only ventilatory variable independently associated with 90-day hospital mortality, and MP referenced to compliance during ECMO was more predictive for mortality than was MP alone.","output":"Mechanical power during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and hospital mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background All pregnant women in labor should be universally screened for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pandemic periods using Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. In many low-middle income countries, screening method was developed as an initial examination because of limited availability of RT-PCR tests. Objectives This study aims to evaluate the screening methods of COVID-19 accuracy in pregnant women. Material and Methods We recruited all pregnant women with suspicion of COVID-19 from April - August 2020 at Universitas Airlangga hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia. The participant was divided into two groups based on RT-PCR results: COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 group. The proportion of positive signs & symptoms, rapid antibody test, abnormal findings in chest x-ray, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) value were then compared between both groups. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy (DOR) were calculated. Results A total 141 pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 cases were recruited for this study. This consist of 62 COVID-19 cases (43.9%) and 79 non COVID-19 pregnant women (56.1%). The sensitivity, spesificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy of each parameter are as follow: clinical sign & symptoms (24.19%, 75.95%, 3.92%, 96.11%, 65.87%), rapid antibody test (72.73%, 35.06%, 4.35%, 96.94%, 36.53%), chest x-ray (40.68%, 59.45%, 3.92%, 96.11%, 58.76%), and NLR > 5.8 (41.38%, 72%, 5.66%, 96.80%, 70.81%). Conclusions The use of combined screening methods can classify pregnant women with high-risk COVID-19 before definitively diagnosed with RT-PCR.

It is commonly believed that, within a matter of weeks, telemedicine was widely and successfully implemented and that medicine is forever changed.

Advanced models of team-based care with in-room support (aTBC) have developed over the past decade, with strategic delegation of tasks to uptrained support staff, allowing physicians to provide undivided attention to their patients and greater access to care for their populations. Herein, we describe our initial experiences with telemedicine in the context of many years practicing in aTBC models. Our experience demonstrates that when implementing telemedicine visits, it is important to avoid a reflex reversion to the outmoded model of the physician alone in the room with the patient and instead bring forth the safety, quality, and satisfaction advantages associated with aTBC. We provide a practical how-to guide for implementing telemedicine visits; outline logistical details of representative video and audio visits from our own practices; describe new opportunities for family engagement, care coordination, and comanagement across specialties; and outline a research agenda going forward to further knowledge of the risks and benefits and optimal application of health care on a telemedicine platform.","output":"Telemedicine and Team-Based Care: The Perils and the Promise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A patient with severe encephalitis had focal findings suggesting herpes simplex encephalitis.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on body weight and body mass index (BMI) in Saudi Arabia. We used electronic health records obtained from a healthcare system representing five hospitals in three different regions in the Kingdom to examine the change in weight utilizing a longitudinal design. The study included all adults who had visited outpatient clinics in two different time points, pre-2020 (years 2018 and 2019 prior to COVID-19) and post-2020 (the year 2021). Weight and BMI changes in percentages were described. Also, bivariate chi-square test, paired t-test, and multivariable multinomial logistic regression model were used for the analyses. A total of 165,279 individuals were included in the study. On average, a significant weight gain of 0.33 kg (95% CI: 0.29C0.36) was observed in our study. Approximately 10% of the population had shifted to either overweight or obese BMI classes during the study period, as 4.8% of those with normal BMI pre-2020 had shifted to overweight or obese classes at post-2020, and 5.1% of those who were overweight had shifted to obese class. Also, 23.1% of the population had gained 5% or more of their pre-2020 weight, while 17% had lost 5% or more. Young individuals were over three times more likely to gain 5% or more than older individuals (OR: 3.34; 95% CI: 3.12C3.56). Females had 24% higher odds to gain 5% or more of their pre-2020 weight than males (OR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.21C1.27). Diabetics were 27% more likely to lose 5% or more than non-diabetics (OR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.23C1.31). Our findings provide insights into the impact of COVID-19 on weight and population health.

General anesthesia and spinal blockage are the most common forms of anesthesia. We consider that this surgery can be managed with intra-articular local anesthesia, thus avoiding prolonged stays in recovery, with effective pain management and optimization of presurgical, intrasurgical and post-surgical times. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective, quasi-experimental, longitudinal study to compare two anesthetic procedures: intraarticular anesthesia (lidocaine with epinephrine, bupivacaine and fentanyl) without the use of ischemia (group A); spinal blockage and use of ischemia (group B) by assessing age, surgery time, pain during surgery and 24 hour post-op VA scale, time spent in recovery, need to administer general anesthesia or anesthetic rescue doses, 24-hour range of motion. Student t-test, significance level was used: p 0.05 for nonparametric variables and 2 parametric variables. RESULTS 38 patients were included per group. The surgical time (45 min vs 39 min, p = 0.03), recovery time (1.9 vs 3 hours, p = 0.0004) were lower in group A, while pain during surgery was greater (17 vs 3%, p = 0.09), without requiring general anesthesia. CONCLUSION The advantages in favor of intraarticular anesthesia were: shortened hospital stays, less pain at 24 hours, safety in its application.

Reasons for the lower pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 than the other two zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are not well understood. We herein compared the codon usage patterns of the three zoonotic CoVs causing severe acute respiratory syndromes and four human-specific CoVs (NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1) causing mild diseases. We found that the seven viruses have different codon usages, with SARS-CoV-2 having the lowest effective number of codons (ENC) among the zoonotic CoVs. Human codon adaptation index (CAI) analysis revealed that the CAI value of SARS-CoV-2 is the lowest among the zoonotic CoVs. The ENC and CAI values of SARS-CoV-2 were more similar to those of the less-pathogenic human-specific CoVs. To further investigate adaptive evolution within SARS-CoV-2, we examined codon usage patterns in 3573 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 collected over the initial 4 months of the pandemic. We showed that the ENC values and the CAI values of SARS-CoV-2 were decreasing over the period. The low ENC and CAI values could be responsible for the lower pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. While mutational pressure appears to shape codon adaptation in the overall genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other zoonotic CoVs, the E gene of SARS-CoV-2, which has the highest codon usage bias, appears to be under strong natural selection.

Many COVID -19 positive patients had to stay at home and reach out to their family physicians for guidance. This gave us an opportunity to observe a group of patients in home quarantine. The challenge was daunting. We could not afford to allow these patients to deteriorate as hospital beds and oxygen support were not readily available. Therefore, we developed an innovative approach to monitor these patients and to intervene at the optimal time to avoid hospitalization. Based on objective biochemical tests like elevated CRP and clinical signs like persistent high-grade fever, we initiated early low dose steroids and antibiotics prior to the onset of hypoxia. None of the home quarantined patients deteriorated because of the timely medical intervention. These patients neither required oxygen support nor hospitalization. We therefore present our new treatment model for home quarantined COVID-19 patients along with our suggestions for implementing the model at the community level. Methods: 25 patients under home quarantine who contacted online for medical guidance underwent clinical and biochemical evaluation. CT radiological examination was done whenever indicated. Treatments were initiated under medical guidance based on the CRP values and clinical presentation. Results: Among the 25 patients, 40% of the patients (10/25) had mild symptoms with normal CRP. 24% of the patients (6/25) had mild symptoms with elevated CRP. 36% of patients (9/25) had elevated CRP with persistent high fever. All the 25 patients recovered over the next four weeks.

The presence of a large reservoir of coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of mixing and selling them in urban markets with suboptimal hygiene, habit of eating exotic mammals in highly populated areas, and the rapid and frequent air travels from these areas are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics. The possibility of emergence of a hypothetical SARS-CoV-3 or other novel viruses from animals or laboratories, and therefore needs for global preparedness should not be ignored. We reviewed representative publications on the epidemiology, virology, clinical manifestations, pathology, laboratory diagnostics, treatment, vaccination, and infection control of COVID-19 as of 20 January 2021, which is 1 year after person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was announced. The difficulties of mass testing, labour-intensive contact tracing, importance of compliance to universal masking, low efficacy of antiviral treatment for severe disease, possibilities of vaccine or antiviral-resistant virus variants and SARS-CoV-2 becoming another common cold coronavirus are discussed.","output":"Lessons learned 1 year after SARS-CoV-2 emergence leading to COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lungs are the most commonly involved organ by HIV/AIDS related diseases, and pulmonary infections are the main reasons for the increasing death rate from AIDS.

It has a vast spectrum of clinical presentations and can affect various organs. Rarely, it has been reported to cause acalculous cholecystitis in a non ICU setting patient. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a rare association of COVID 19 with acalculous cholecystitis in a 40 years old healthy woman. She developed fever, malaise, generalized body weakness, and right hypochondrial pain after fourteen days of COVID 19 infection, raising the possibility of Post COVID dysregulated immune response resulting in acalculous cholecystitis. She was managed conservatively with broad spectrum antibiotics. DISCUSSION: Acalculous cholecystitis primarily occurs due to the gall bladder's hypomotility and most commonly seen in critically ill patients such as severe burns, mechanically ventilated patients, and prolonged parenteral nutrition. The management depends upon treating the underlying pathology and, in some severe cases, may need surgical intervention as well. Up to our knowledge, COVID 19, causing acalculous cholecystitis, is a rare association described only in a few critically ill patients but not in young, healthy patients. It can be attributed to the body's dysregulated immunological response against the virus resulting in systemic inflammation. CONCLUSION: Currently, there is are no clear guidelines for managing acute cholecystitis in COVID-19 patients. It depends on the patient's clinical state and disease severity. We aim to highlight the importance of early diagnosis and management in such clinical scenarios to avoid fatal complications.","output":"Post COVID 19 acute acalculous cholecystitis raising the possibility of underlying dysregulated immune response, a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Load carriage is common in a wide range of professions, but prolonged load carriage is associated with increased fatigue and overuse injuries. Exoskeletons could improve the quality of life of these professionals by reducing metabolic cost to combat fatigue and reducing muscle activity to prevent injuries. Current exoskeletons have reduced the metabolic cost of loaded walking by up to 22% relative to walking in the device with no assistance when assisting one or two joints. Greater metabolic reductions may be possible with optimized assistance of the entire leg. METHODS: We used human-in the-loop optimization to optimize hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton assistance with no additional load, a light load (15% of body weight), and a heavy load (30% of body weight) for three participants. All loads were applied through a weight vest with an attached waist belt. We measured metabolic cost, exoskeleton assistance, kinematics, and muscle activity. We performed Friedmans tests to analyze trends across worn loads and paired t-tests to determine whether changes from the unassisted conditions to the assisted conditions were significant. RESULTS: Exoskeleton assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking relative to walking in the device without assistance for all tested conditions. Exoskeleton assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 48% with no load (p = 0.05), 41% with the light load (p = 0.01), and 43% with the heavy load (p = 0.04). The smaller metabolic reduction with the light load may be due to insufficient participant training or lack of optimizer convergence. The total applied positive power was similar for all tested conditions, and the positive knee power decreased slightly as load increased. Optimized torque timing parameters were consistent across participants and load conditions while optimized magnitude parameters varied. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-leg exoskeleton assistance can reduce the metabolic cost of walking while carrying a range of loads. The consistent optimized timing parameters across participants and conditions suggest that metabolic cost reductions are sensitive to torque timing. The variable torque magnitude parameters could imply that torque magnitude should be customized to the individual, or that there is a range of useful torque magnitudes. Future work should test whether applying the load to the exoskeleton rather than the persons torso results in larger benefits.

With high mortality and limited capacity;appropriate decisions to escalate to critical care were vital for just resource allocation but also to prevent harm where interventions would not change outcomes. NICE guidance highlighted Clinical frailty scoring (CFS) as central to the decision-making process. 1, Despite initial criticism, recent evidence has confirmed increasing CFS as an independent risk factor to inpatient mortality in COVID-19.2 We conducted a quality improvement project with the aim of improving CFS documentation at the Royal Free Hospital. Methods We reviewed the notes of 71 inpatients over the age of 65 years from 6 wards on 08/05/20C12/05/20 for both a CFS score documentation and clear treatment escalation plan at time points of initial clerking, post-take and following ward admission with an audit standard of 100%. We developed teaching sessions, promoted the CFS mobile application, developed a post-take sticker and an elderly medicine ward admission proforma. We re-audited 66 inpatient notes from the same 6 wards from 25/06/20C07/07/20. Results Documentation.of CFS improved from 7% to 17% for clerking and post-take and from 13% to 24% on the ward admission. The number of patients with treatment escalation plans was 50%.

However, en masse mitigation has come with substantial socioeconomic costs. In this paper we demonstrate how individualized policies based on disease status can reduce transmission risk while minimizing impacts on economic outcomes. We design feedback control policies informed by optimal control solutions to modulate interaction rates of individuals based on the epidemic state. We identify personalized interaction rates such that recovered/immune individuals elevate their interactions and susceptible individuals remain at home before returning to pre-lockdown levels. As we show, feedback control policies can yield similar population-wide infection rates to total shutdown but with significantly lower economic costs and with greater robustness to uncertainty compared to optimal control policies. Our analysis shows that test-driven improvements in isolation efficiency of infectious individuals can inform disease-dependent interaction policies that mitigate transmission while enhancing the return of individuals to pre-pandemic economic activity.","output":"Disease-dependent interaction policies to support health and economic outcomes during the COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several mutations in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have increased the transmission and mortality rate of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) across the globe. Although many vaccines have been developed, a large proportion of the global population remains at high risk of infection. The current study aims to develop an antiviral peptide capable of inhibiting the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its six major variants with the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. An in-silico approach was employed to design a therapeutic peptide inhibitor against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3). The binding specificity and affinity of our designed peptide inhibitor Mod13AApi (YADKYQKQYKDAY) with wild-type S-RBD and its six variants was confirmed by molecular docking using the HPEPDOCK tool, whereas complex stability was determined by the MD simulation study. The physicochemical and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties of inhibitory peptides were determined using the ExPASy tool and pkCSM server. The docking results and its properties from our in-silico analysis present the Mod13AApi, a promising peptide for the rapid development of anti-coronavirus peptide-based antiviral therapy. Blockage of the binding of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants with ACE2 in the presence of the therapeutic peptide may prevent deadly SARS-CoV-2 variants entry into host cells. Therefore, the designed inhibitory peptide can be utilized as a promising therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19, as evident from this in-silico study.","output":"In-Silico Design of a Novel Tridecapeptide Targeting Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 lineage alpha in gorillas and felid species in a zoo in Prague, Czech Republic.

We developed a disposable and portable bronchoscope (YunSendo-R) and compared its safety and function with those of current reusable and single-use bronchoscopes using an animal model. METHODS: We compared the YunSendo-R system with a commercially available reusable bronchoscope (Olympus, BF-H290) and single-use bronchoscope (Ambu, Ambu? aScope3?). Eight physicians used the three types of bronchoscopes to operate on Guangxi Bama mini pigs. Each operator performed bronchoscopy and completed a 10-point Likert scale questionnaire for evaluating visual ability and manoeuvrability. Operation time and scores were collected. RESULTS: Operation time had no significant differences among the three bronchoscopes. In visual ability, the YunSendo-R bronchoscope showed superior performance to the Ambu bronchoscope in image clarity, colour contrast, and illumination (P < 0.05) and no significant difference in performance compared with the Olympus bronchoscope (P > 0.05). The YunSendo-R bronchoscope had similar manoeuvrability to the Olympus bronchoscope and better scope tip flexibility than the Ambu bronchoscope (P > 0.05). No relevant complications were reported. CONCLUSION: We have developed a new bronchoscopy system with the advantages of disposability and portability, which was effective and safe in an animal model. It has better visual ability than the Ambu bronchoscope and similar visual ability and manoeuvrability to the Olympus bronchoscope.

Specifically, we analyze how the presence of their children influences parents' work at home and examine how the effect differs by the parent's gender. After controlling for various factors, we find that in cases where parents are full-time employees and the children are: (1) in primary school, mothers are more likely to work remotely, while fathers are less likely to do so and (2) in junior high school, the parents' work styles are hardly affected. This shows that mothers shoulder the burden of working remotely and caring for small children at home, while fathers tend to work in the office and spend less time with their childcare at home.

However, whether this dominant variant can potentially spread through the cold chain and whether the spike protein affects virus stability after cold storage remain unclear. To compare the infectivity of two SARS-CoV-2 variants, namely, SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein with the D614 mutation (S-D614) and G614 mutation (S-G614), after different periods of refrigeration (4C) and freezing (?20C). We also determined the integrity of the viral RNA and the ability of the spike protein to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) after storage at these conditions. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was more stable and infectious after storage at ?20C than at 4C. Particularly, the S-G614 variant was found to be more stable than the S-D614 variant. The spike protein of the S-G614 variant had better binding ability with the ACE2 receptor than that of the S-D614 variant after storage at ?20C for up to 30 days. Our findings revealed that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable and infectious after refrigeration or freezing, and their stability and infectivity up to 30 days depends on the spike variant. Stability and infectivity are related to each other, and the higher stability of S-G614 compared to that of S-D614 may contribute to rapid viral spread of the S-G614 variant. IMPORTANCE It has been observed that variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are more stable and infectious after storage at ?20C than at 4C. A SARS-CoV-2 S-D614G variant is currently the most dominant variant in circulation and is associated with enhanced infectivity. We compared the stability of two SARS-CoV-2 variants: the early S-D614 variant carrying the D614 spike protein and the new S-G614 variant carrying the G614 spike protein, stored at both 4C and ?20C for different periods. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable and infectious after refrigeration or freezing, which further depends on the spike variant, that is, the ability of the spike protein to bind with the ACE2 receptor with higher efficiency. The high stability of the S-G614 variant also explains its rapid spread and infectivity. Therefore, precautions should be taken during and after handling food preserved under cold conditions.","output":"Stability of SARS-CoV-2 Spike G614 Variant Surpasses That of the D614 Variant after Cold Storage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypofractionation of prostate cancer radiotherapy achieves tumour control at lower total radiation doses, however, increased rectal and bladder toxicities have been observed. To realise the radiobiological advantage of hypofractionation whilst minimising harm, the potential reduction in dose to organs at risk was investigated for biofocused radiotherapy. Patient-specific tumour location and cell density information were derived from multiparametric imaging. Uniform-dose plans and biologically-optimised plans were generated for a standard schedule (78 Gy/39 fractions) and hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy/20 fractions and 36.25 Gy/5 fractions). Results showed that biologically-optimised plans yielded statistically lower doses to the rectum and bladder compared to isoeffective uniform-dose plans for all fractionation schedules. A reduction in the number of fractions increased the target dose modulation required to achieve equal tumour control. On average, biologically-optimised, moderately-hypofractionated plans demonstrated 16.3% (p-value:0.01) and 16.0% (p-value:0.04) reduction in rectal and bladder dose compared with standard fractionation. The tissue-sparing effect was more pronounced in extreme hypofractionation with mean reduction in rectal and bladder dose of 37.4% (p-value:<0.01) and 46.8% (p-value:0.02), respectively. This study suggests that the ability to utilise patient-specific tumour biology information will provide greater incentive to employ hypofractionation in the treatment of localised prostate cancer with radiotherapy. However, to exploit the radiobiological advantages given by hypofractionation, greater attention to geometric accuracy is required due to increased sensitivity to treatment uncertainties.","output":"Standard versus hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: assessing the impact on dose modulation and normal tissue effects when using patient-specific cancer biology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid proliferation of misinformation and disinformation on the Internet has brought dire consequences upon societies around the world, fostering extremism, undermining social cohesion and threatening the democratic process.

PM is classified according to size into coarse particles (PM10), fine particles (PM2.5) and ultrafine particles. We aim to provide an original review of the scientific evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies examining the cardiovascular effects of outdoor air pollution. Pooled epidemiological studies reported that a 10g/m3 increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an 11% increase in cardiovascular mortality. Increased cardiovascular mortality was also related to long-term and short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide. Exposure to air pollution and road traffic was associated with an increased risk of arteriosclerosis, as shown by premature aortic and coronary calcification. Short-term increases in air pollution were associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and acute heart failure. The risk was increased even when pollutant concentrations were below European standards. Reinforcing the evidence from epidemiological studies, numerous experimental studies demonstrated that air pollution promotes a systemic vascular oxidative stress reaction. Radical oxygen species induce endothelial dysfunction, monocyte activation and some proatherogenic changes in lipoproteins, which initiate plaque formation. Furthermore, air pollution favours thrombus formation, because of an increase in coagulation factors and platelet activation. Experimental studies also indicate that some pollutants have more harmful cardiovascular effects, such as combustion-derived PM2.5 and ultrafine particles. Air pollution is a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases. Promotion of safer air quality appears to be a new challenge in cardiovascular disease prevention.","output":"Cardiovascular effects of air pollution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Early preventive strict quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic was implemented in Argentina since March 20th, 2020. Transplant societies and organ procurement organizations were challenged to face this complex scenario and sustain organ donation and transplantation activity. Objectives We evaluated the impact of complete and preventive lockdown in organ procurement and transplantation before the COVID-19 peak onset. Materials and Methods We analyzed prospectively collected data from the National Report Agency (INCUCAI). By constructing time series, we compared donation and transplant rates from the years 2010 to 2020, during a same monthly-period between March 3rd and July 20th. We evaluated the effect of preventive lockdown before the peak of COVID-19 curve. Donation rates per million population in these months were also registered for each year. Transplant accessibility was calculated, dividing the total number of transplants and the total number of listed patients. Results The preventive lockdown was associated with a 34.5% relative reduction (95% CI 26.9-43.2) in organ procurement when compared to 2010-2019 and significantly reduced comparing 2019 [53.3% (CI 44.6-61.6)]. This scenario was even worse in Buenos Aires city and its surroundings, the region most affected by COVID-19. During this period, donation per million population rates decreased from 7.8 in 2019 to 3.3 in 2020. This reduction was even higher in the number of deceased and living donor transplants performed comparing 2019 vs. 2020, with a relative reduction of 62.0% (CI 30.8-89.1) and 68.8% (CI 65.7-71.7), respectively. Conclusions During this short observation period of 120 days of preventive quarantine, not yet having reached the \\"peak\\" incidence of COVID-19, a marked reduction in procurement and transplantation rates were observed. Although waiting list mortality was not significantly modified, transplant access has been significantly reduced, showing a future negative trend on waitlist mortality.","output":"P-101 IMPACT OF COMPLETE AND PREVENTIVE LOCKEDCDOWN BEFORE COVID 19 OUTBREAK IN ORGAN PROCUREMENT AND SOLID TRANSPLANTATION IN ARGENTINA: THE WORST HAS NOT YET ARRIVED."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there was minimal data to guide treatment, and we lacked understanding of how clinicians translated this limited evidence base for potential therapeutics to bedside care Our objective was to systematically determine how emerging data about COVID-19 treatments was implemented by analyzing institutional treatment protocols Methods: Treatment protocols from North American healthcare facilities and recommendations from guideline-issuing bodies were collected Qualitative data on treatment regimens and their applications were extracted using an adapted National Institutes of Health/US Food and Drug Administration experimental therapeutics framework Structured data on risk factor and severity of illness scoring systems were extracted and analyzed using descriptive statistics Results: We extracted data from 105 independent protocols Guideline-issuing organizations published recommendations after the initial peak of the pandemic in many regions and generally recommended clinical trial referral, with limited additional guidance Facility-specific protocols favored offering some treatment (96 8%, N = 92 of 95), most commonly, hydroxychloroquine (90 5%), followed by remdesivir and interleukin-6 inhibitors Recommendation for clinical trial enrollment was limited largely to academic medical centers (19 of 52 vs 9 of 43 community/Veterans Affairs [VA]), which were more likely to have access to research studies Other themes identified included urgent protocol development, plans for rapid updates, contradictory statements, and entirely missing sections, with section headings but no content other than \\"in process \\" Conclusions: In the COVID-19 pandemic, emerging information was rapidly implemented by institutions into clinical practice and, unlike recommendations from guideline-issuing bodies, heavily favored administering some form of therapy Understanding how and why evidence is translated into clinical care is critical to improve processes for other emerging diseases","output":"How Are Emerging Data Translated Into Clinical Practice?

SARS-CoV-2 Test [QF]) for detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2-Spike (S)-reactive-IFN--producing T cells after COVID-19 vaccination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The sample included 141 individuals (all male; median age, 42 years; 20C72) who had been fully vaccinated with the Comirnaty? COVID-19 vaccine (at a median of 114 days; 34C145). Prior to vaccination, 91 were categorized as being SARS-CoV-2-na?ve and 50 as SARS-CoV-2-experienced. A whole blood-based FC-ICS using 15-mer overlapping peptides encompassing the entire SARS-CoV-2 S protein was used for enumeration of virus-specific IFN--producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. The QF test (Ag1 for CD4(+) T cells and Ag2 for CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in combination) was carried out following the manufacturers instructions. RESULTS: The FC-ICS and the QF assays returned significantly discordant qualitative results in both the entire cohort (P<0.001 with QF Ag1 and QF Ag2) and in SARS-CoV-2-na?ve participants alone (P=0.005 and P=0.01, respectively). Discrepant results mostly involved FC-ICS positive/QF negative specimens. Overall, no correlation was found either between SARS-CoV-2 IFN-- CD4(+) T-cell frequencies and IFN- levels measured in the QF Ag1 tube (P=0.78) or between the sum of SARS-CoV-2 IFN- CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell frequencies and IFN- levels quantified in the QF Ag2 tube. CONCLUSION: The data suggest a greater sensitivity for the FC-ICS assay than the QF test, and urge caution when comparing SARS-CoV-2 T-cell immune responses assessed using different analytical platforms.

METHODS Included in the study were cats with ISSs undergoing macroscopic surgical removal and subsequent electron beam radiotherapy treatment with either a finely fractionated protocol (48 or 52.8 Gy over 4 weeks delivered in 12 or 16 fractions) or a coarsely fractionated protocol (36 Gy over 3 weeks administered in six fractions). Medical records were reviewed and follow-up information was collected. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare the progression-free interval (PFI) between the two protocols and to test the influence of many clinical variables. RESULTS Fifty-nine cats were included; 38 underwent a finely fractionated protocol and 21 a coarsely fractionated protocol. PFI was not significantly different between the two groups. Overall PFI was 2000 days (2000 vs 540 days; P = 0.449). When only first-occurrence cases were included, median PFI was significantly longer in the finely fractionated group compared with the coarsely fractionated group (1430 vs 540 days; P = 0.007). In cats that underwent multiple surgeries PFI was not different between protocols (233 vs 395 days; P = 0.353). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cats with first-occurrence ISSs appear to benefit from postoperative finely fractionated radiotherapy. The same benefit was not evident in cats that underwent multiple surgeries and we think a coarsely fractionated protocol would be indicated in these cases.","output":"Comparison of definitive-intent finely fractionated and palliative-intent coarsely fractionated radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment of feline microscopic injection-site sarcoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Early identification of COVID-19 patients at risk of critical illness is a challenging endeavor for clinicians.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study to describe rates of high-flow oxygen delivered through nasal cannula and/or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation success (live discharge without endotracheal intubation). Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models were used to identify patient characteristics associated with high-flow oxygen delivered through nasal cannula and/or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation failure (endotracheal intubation and/or in-hospital mortality). SETTING: One large academic health system, including five hospitals (one quaternary referral center, a tertiary hospital, and three community hospitals), in New York City. PATIENTS: All hospitalized adults 18C100 years old with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted between March 1, 2020, and April 28, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 331 and 747 patients received high-flow oxygen delivered through nasal cannula and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation as the highest level of noninvasive respiratory support, respectively; 154 (46.5%) in the high-flow oxygen delivered through nasal cannula cohort and 167 (22.4%) in the noninvasive positive pressure ventilation cohort were successfully discharged without requiring endotracheal intubation. In adjusted models, significantly increased risk of high-flow oxygen delivered through nasal cannula and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation failure was seen among patients with cardiovascular disease (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.17C2.83 and subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.06C1.84, respectively). Conversely, a higher peripheral blood oxygen saturation to Fio(2) ratio at high-flow oxygen delivered through nasal cannula and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation initiation was associated with reduced risk of failure (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.19C0.54, and subdistribution hazard ratio 0.34; 95% CI, 0.21C0.55, respectively).

METHODS: In this study, human cancer cell lines were cultured and subsequently treated with 10 to 100 g/mL of PDSE. MTT test was performed to determine the cell viability, MMP was measured using fluorescent probe JC-1, nuclear condensation was determined by Hoechst 33258 dye, Annexin V-FITC & PI staining and cell cycle analysis were evaluated through flow cytometer, and apoptotic markers were detected using western blotting. The bioactive agents in PDSE were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The binding affinity was validated using molecular docking tools AutoDock Vina and iGEMDOCK v2.1. RESULTS: Cell viability data indicated that PDSE inhibited cell proliferation in both breast cancer cells and liver cancer cells. MDA-MB-231 cells showed maximum growth inhibition with an IC(50) value of 85.86 g/mL for PDSE. However, PDSE did not show any significant toxicity against the normal Vero cell line. PDSE induced MMP loss and formation of apoptotic bodies, enhanced late apoptosis at high doses and arrested cells in the S phase of cell cycle. PDSE activated the enzymatic activity of cleaved caspase-3 and caused the cleavage of poly-ADB ribose polymerase (PARP) protein. PDSE upregulated pro-apoptotic Bax protein markedly but no significant effect on tumor suppressor protein p53, while it downregulated the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. HPLC analysis showed the presence of rutin and quercetin bioactive flavonols in ethanolic extract of PDS. Interestingly, both active components revealed a strong binding interaction with amino acid residues of caspase-3 (PDB ID: 2XYP; Hetero 4-mer - A2B2) protein. CONCLUSION: PDS could serve as a potential medicinal source for apoptotic cell death in human breast cancer cells and, thus, could be used as a promising and crucial candidate in anticancer drug development.

Here we characterize antibody responses in a cohort of participants recovered from mild SARS-CoV-2 infection with follow up to 6 months. We measure IgA, IgM, and IgG binding and avidity to viral antigens and assess neutralizing antibody responses over time. Further, we correlate the effect of fever, gender, age, and time since symptom onset with antibody responses. We observe that total anti-S trimer, anti-RBD, and anti-NP IgG are relatively stable over 6 months of follow-up and anti-S and anti-RBD avidity increases over time, and that fever is associated with higher levels of antibodies. However, neutralizing antibody responses rapidly decay and are strongly associated with declines in IgM levels. Thus, while total antibody against SARS-CoV-2 may persist, functional antibody, particularly IgM, is rapidly lost.

Physician assessments included in traditional indices can be complex and time consuming to complete and cannot be readily conducted by telehealth. This study compares the routine assessment of patient index data 3 (RAPID3), an efficient tool comprising patient self-assessment, with traditional clinician-led composite measures in the PsA clinic setting. METHODS Data were collected prospectively from July 2016 to March 2020 in 2 dedicated PsA clinics in Sydney, Australia. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was created for comparison of RAPID3 score with composite scores minimal disease activity (MDA), very low disease activity (VLDA) and disease activity in psoriatic arthritis (DAPSA) in low disease activity or remission. RESULTS Ninety-three patients had simultaneous collection of RAPID3 and MDA measures. Mean (SD) age was 49.9 (13.5) years, 50.5% were male and 23 (24.7%) had erosive disease at baseline. RAPID3 scores 3.2 and 2.7 (range 0-30) had high sensitivity and specificity for VLDA and DAPSA remission respectively, with ROC curve area under the curve (95% CI) of 0.94 (0.91-0.97) and 0.96 (0.93-0.99). CONCLUSION RAPID3 has good agreement with physician-led composite scores of MDA, VLDA and DAPSA, and provides a viable alternative to composite scores.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by severe impairments in reward processing, but the neural effects of social touch in MDD are still elusive. Objective: We aimed to determine whether the neural processing of social touch is impaired in MDD and to assess the impact of antidepressant therapy. Methods: Before and after antidepressant treatment, 53 MDD patients and 41 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while receiving social touch. We compared neural responses to social touch in the reward network, behavioral ratings of touch comfort and general aversion to interpersonal touch in MDD patients to controls. Additionally, we examined the effect of treatment response on those measures. Results: Clinical symptoms decreased after treatment and 43.4% of patients were classified as responders. Patients reported higher aversion to social touch and lower comfort ratings during the fMRI paradigm than controls. Patients showed reduced responses to social touch in the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus and putamen than controls, both before and after treatment. Non-responders exhibited blunted response in the caudate nucleus and the insula compared to responders, again irrespective of treatment. Conclusions: These findings confirm our hypothesis that interpersonal touch as an indicator of social reward processing is impaired in MDD. Persistent dysfunctional processing of social touch despite clinical improvements may constitute a latent risk factor for social withdrawal and isolation. New treatment approaches are necessary to specifically target social reward processing and disturbed body awareness in MDD.","output":"Altered reward network responses to social touch in major depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Universal screening has been proposed as a strategy to identify asymptomatic individuals infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mitigate transmission. AIM: To investigate the rate of positive tests among pregnant women in Melbourne, Australia. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional prevalence study at three maternity hospitals (one tertiary referral hospital and two secondary maternities) in Melbourne, Australia. SARS-CoV-2 testing was offered to all pregnant women attending face-to-face antenatal visits and to those attending the hospital with symptoms of possible coronavirus disease, between 6(th) and 19(th) of May 2020. Testing was performed by multiplex-tandem polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on combined oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs. The primary outcome was the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed in 350 women, of whom 19 had symptoms of possible COVID-19. The median maternal age was 32 years (IQR 28 to 35 years), and the median gestational age at testing was 33 weeks and four days (IQR 28 weeks to 36 weeks and two days). All 350 tests returned negative results (p? = 0%, 95% CI 0 to 0.86%).

Relevant biological disease features and biomarkers identify patients for the correct therapeutic, delivered at an appropriate time, dose and duration for maximal efficacy. We evaluated whether serum levels of a wide range of proposed therapeutic targets in COVID-19 discriminated between patients with mild and severe disease or death.Methods: A search of clinicaltrials.gov identified immunological drug targets in COVID-19. We subsequently conducted an observational study investigating the association of serum biomarkers relating to putative therapeutic biomarkers with illness severity and outcome.Results: A search of clinicaltrials.gov identified 477 randomized trials assessing immunomodulatory therapies, including 168 different therapies against 83 different pathways. We measured levels of ten cytokines/signalling proteins including those related to the most common therapeutic targets (GM-CSF, IFN-2a, IFN-, IFN-, IL-1, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, TNF-), immunoglobulin G ( IgG) antibodies directed against either the COVID-19 spike protein (S1) or nucleocapsid protein (N), and neutralization titres of antibodies within the first 5 days of hospital admission in 86 patients, 44 (51%) with mild disease and 42 (49%) with severe disease. Six of the ten cytokine/signalling protein markers measured (IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, interferon- a, interferon- b, IL -1ra ) discriminated between patients with mild and severe disease, although most were similar or only modestly raised above that seen in healthy volunteers. A similar proportion of patients with mild or severe disease had detectable S1 or N IgG antibodies with equivalent levels between groups. Neutralization titres were higher among patients with severe disease.Interpretation: Some therapeutic and prognostic biomarkers may be potentially useful in identifying patients who may benefit from specific immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19 disease, particularly interleukin-6. It is however noteworthy that absolute values of a number of identified biomarkers were either appropriately elevated or within the normal range. This implies that these immunomodulatory treatments may be of limited benefit.Funding: National Institute for Health Research UCLH Biomedical Research Centre (BRC756/HI/MS/101440) and the UCL Coronavirus Response Fund.Declaration of Interests: MeS reports grants and advisory board fees from NewB, grants from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Critical Pressure, Apollo Therapeutics, advisory board and speaker fees (paid to his institution) from Amormed, Biotest, GE, Baxter, Roche, and Bayer, and honorarium for chairing a data monitoring and safety committee from Shionogi.

The putative viral-induced inhibition of ACE2 could result in the defective degradation of bradykinin, a potent inflammatory substance. We hypothesize that increased bradykinin in the lungs is an important mechanism driving the development of pneumonia and respiratory failure in COVID-19. METHODS: This is a phase II, single-center, three-armed parallel-group, open-label, active control superiority randomized clinical trial. One hundred eighty eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either the inhibitor of C1e/kallikrein 20 U/kg intravenously on day 1 and day 4 plus standard care; or icatibant 30 mg subcutaneously, three doses/day for 4 days plus standard care; or standard care alone, as recommended in the clinical trials published to date, which includes supplemental oxygen, non-invasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, prophylactic antithrombotic therapy, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapy. DISCUSSION: Accumulation of bradykinin in the lungs is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors leading to cough. In animal models, the inactivation of ACE2 leads to severe acute pneumonitis in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the inhibition of bradykinin almost completely restores the lung structure. We believe that inhibition of bradykinin in severe COVID-19 patients could reduce the lung inflammatory response, impacting positively on the severity of disease and mortality rates.

Separation of conjoined twins involves multidisciplinary teamwork, complex medical management and surgical planning, and multi-stage operations and often still has a high mortality and morbidity rate. In the times of the COVID-19 pandemic, separation of conjoined twins pose even greater challenges. Aiming for the best outcome possible, while minimizing the risk of COVID transmission and ensuring the safety of the personnel, is paramount. This case report presents thoraco-omphalopagus twins who were successfully separated at 4 months of age. The preoperative planning, operative details, postoperative follow-ups, and outcomes are discussed. METHODS: The absence of a tissue expander and the inability to acquire it due to travel restrictions from COVID-19 further complicated the management on this patient. A Routine Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) swab test was performed on the patients and personnel. Standardized personnel protective equipment (PPE) was worn during ward and surgical care. After separation of the twins by cardiothoracic and pediatric surgeons, one twin underwent immediate skin closure using a double keystone perforator island flap and a lower abdominal perforator flap. Due to extensive defects, closure was delayed for the second twin. After a series of dressing changes, eventually local perforator flaps could be raised to close the defect using staged tension sutures and skin grafts for secondary defects. RESULTS: Both twins were discharged with no significant morbidity, and no personnel were exposed to COVID-19 infection during the management CONCLUSION: Preoperative coordination and planning, multidisciplinary effort, adherence to screening protocols for COVID, and strict use of standardized PPE all contributed to the successful separation of thoraco-omphalopagus conjoined twins during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Use of Local Perforator Flaps for Closure of a Thoraco-Omphalopagus Conjoined Twin Defect after Separation during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explored the differences in the effects of collective intelligence and references on open innovation between open and closed access journals.

Findings indicate that all domain aspects of the cognitive apprenticeship model are not equally relevant in an online teaching scenario compared to offline teaching. Findings also indicate that the interpersonal and communicational aspects of the learning environment have gained more prominence in online teaching. This article contributes to the existing literature by bringing early evidence on the challenges and innovations in online teaching. In addition, this study also contributes to the understanding of the cognitive apprenticeship model in an online scenario. Even though the scope of the study was limited to academicians from the finance and accounting area, the findings are globally relevant. They have practical implications for other disciplines as well.JEL Classification Codes: M0, I20, I29, Y7","output":"WhatsApp Generation in Zoom University: Online Pedagogical Challenges and Innovations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To establish trends in Implant Dentistry in Latin America in the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A steering committee and an advisory group of experts in Implant Dentistry were selected among eighteen countries. An open-ended questionnaire by Delphi methodology was validated including 64 questions, divided in 7 topics, concerning the various trends in dental implantology. The survey was conducted in two rounds, which provided the participants in the second round with the results of the first. The questionnaires were completed on August 2020, and the online meeting conference was held on September 2020. The final prediction was developed through consensus by a selected group of experts. RESULTS: A total of 197 experts from Latin America answered the first and second questionnaire. In the first round, the established threshold for consensus (65%) was achieved in 30 questions (46.87%). In the second round, performed on average 45 days later, this level was achieved in 47 questions (73.43%). Consensus was completely reached on the item \\"Diagnostic\\" (100%), the field with the lowest consensus was \\"Demand for treatment with dental implants\\" (37.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The present study in Latin America has provided relevant and useful information on the predictions in the education and practice of Implant Dentistry in the COVID-19 era. The consensus points toward a great confidence of clinicians in the biosecurity protocols used to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. It is foreseen as an important change in education, with introduction of virtual reality and other simulation technologies in implant training.","output":"Delphi Project on the trends in Implant Dentistry in the COVID-19 era: Perspectives from Latin America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 forced Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to quickly reimagine and rethink how lectures and tutorials would continue, how students would be assessed and progressed and how standards would be maintained. This paper focuses on the pedagogical lessons learned from the online pivot in 2020 and how that learning was then harnessed in the 2020C2021 academic year in the reconceptualization and redesign of a Sociology of Education module in one HEI in Ireland.

Alveolar macrophages and neutrophils provide the early innate immune response to clear pneumococcus from infected lungs. However, the level of neutrophil involvement is context dependent, both in humans and in mouse models of the disease, influenced by factors such as bacterial load, age, and coinfections. Here, we show that the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) adaptor protein norbin (neurochondrin, NCDN), which was hitherto known as a regulator of neuronal function, is a suppressor of neutrophil-mediated innate immunity. Myeloid norbin deficiency improved the immunity of mice to pneumococcal infection by increasing the involvement of neutrophils in clearing the bacteria, without affecting neutrophil recruitment or causing autoinflammation. It also improved immunity during Escherichia coli-induced septic peritonitis. It increased the responsiveness of neutrophils to a range of stimuli, promoting their ability to kill bacteria in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner, enhancing degranulation, phagocytosis, and the production of reactive oxygen species and neutrophil extracellular traps, raising the cell surface levels of selected GPCRs, and increasing GPCR-dependent Rac and Erk signaling. The Rac guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Prex1, a known effector of norbin, was dispensable for most of these effects, which suggested that norbin controls additional downstream targets. We identified the Rac guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Vav as one of these effectors. In summary, our study presents the GPCR adaptor protein norbin as an immune suppressor that limits the ability of neutrophils to clear bacterial infections.","output":"The GPCR adaptor protein norbin suppresses the neutrophil-mediated immunity of mice to pneumococcal infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-COV-2 pandemic has brought unparalleled challenges to healthcare provision.

The symptoms appear to be more severe in males older than 65 and people with underlying health conditions; approximately one in five individuals could be at risk worldwide. The virus's sequence was rapidly established days after the first cases were reported and identified an RNA virus from the Coronaviridae family closely related to a Betacoronavirus virus found in bats in China. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, and with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the only ones to cause severe diseases. Lessons from these two previous outbreaks guided the identification of critical therapeutic targets such as the spike viral proteins promoting the virus's cellular entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on the surface of multiple types of eukaryotic cells. Although several therapeutic agents are currently evaluated, none seems to provide a clear path for a cure. Also, various types of vaccines are developed in record time to address the urgency of efficient SARS-CoV-2 prevention. Currently, 58 vaccines are evaluated in clinical trials, including 11 in phase III, and 3 of them reported efficacy above 90 %.

It has not spared any country and has led to 24 lakh deaths. As a result, the testing had to be increased manifold leading to depletion in the number of the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) kits. Point-of-care rapid antigen-based tests were developed in order to meet the increasing demands. The objective of this study was to compare the performance of a rapid chromatographic test (index test) with a gold standard test (RT-qPCR). Methods: A retrospective analysis was done at a tertiary care teaching hospital in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. Paired samples were taken from all patients reporting to the clinic for antigen-based rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) and RT-qPCR. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated to evaluate the performance of the RDT. Results: The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RDT were observed to be 53.6% (39.7-67.0) and 97.35% (94.6-98.9), respectively. In symptomatic individuals, the sensitivity was higher 61.0% (44.5-75.8). The test positivity rates of RDT were found to be higher at a ??cycle threshold value 20.

Yet, little is known about how they are mentally coping with the pandemic-time changes to their lives. This study explores children and youths self-reported subjective well-being (SWB) during the pandemic, and provides novel insights into the correlates of potential decrease, using data from a pan-Canadian online survey of 932 children/youth and their parents. SWB was measured based on perceived changes in 12 affective/emotional states. The results indicate that in spring 2020, at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, many children and youth were more bored (37.6%) and worried (31%) compared to pre-pandemic time. At the same time, many self-reported that they felt calmer (31.9%) and more rested (30%). A latent class analysis revealed that nearly half (49.4%) of surveyed children and youth reported patterns in changes in their emotional state that may contribute to lower SWB. Results from binomial logistic regression suggest that socio-demographic characteristics and size of the municipality were not associated with low pandemic-time SWB. Instead, other potentially modifiable factors such as having access to friends, indoor and outdoor spaces/places to play and exercise, and healthy movement behaviours during the pandemic, were correlated with a lower likelihood of reporting low SWB. The findings can inform pandemic-time public health policy relating to physical distancing, and in the longer term, mental and physical health promotion.

The governments of the world need to record the confirmed infectious, recovered, and death cases for the present state and predict the cases. In favor of future case prediction, governments can impose opening and closing procedures to save human lives by slowing down the pandemic progression spread. There are several forecasting models for pandemic time series based on statistical processing and machine learning algorithms. Deep learning has been proven as an excellent tool for time series forecasting problems. This paper proposes a deep learning time-series prediction model to forecast the confirmed, recovered, and death cases. Our proposed network is based on an encodingCdecoding deep learning network. Moreover, we optimize the selection of our proposed network hyper-parameters. Our proposed forecasting model was applied in Saudi Arabia. Then, we applied the proposed model to other countries. Our study covers two categories of countries that have witnessed different spread waves this year. During our experiments, we compared our proposed model and the other time-series forecasting models, which totaled fifteen prediction models: three statistical models, three deep learning models, seven machine learning models, and one prophet model.

Around 70% of the coronavirus positive-sense single-stranded RNA encodes proteins involved in replication, and these viruses essentially take over the biosynthetic and transport mechanisms to ensure the efficient replication of their genome and trafficking of their virions. Some coronaviruses encode genes for ion-channel proteins - the envelope protein E (orf4a), orf3a and orf8 - which they successfully employ to take control of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex intermediate compartment or ERGIC. The E protein, which is one of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, assembles its transmembrane protomers into homopentameric channels with mild cationic selectivity. Orf3a forms homodimers and homotetramers. Both carry a PDZ-binding domain, lending them the versatility to interact with more than 400 target proteins in infected host cells. Orf8 is a very short 29-amino-acid single-passage transmembrane peptide that forms cation-selective channels when assembled in lipid bilayers.

A buffer with the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 at the time of sample collection could simplify and expand testing for COVID-19 to non-conventional settings. METHODS: We evaluated a guanidium thiocyanate-based buffer, eNAT(?) (Copan) as a possible transport and inactivation medium for downstream RT-PCR testing to detect SARS-CoV-2. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 in eNAT and in diluted saliva was studied at different incubation times. The stability of viral RNA in eNAT was also evaluated for up to 7 days at room temperature (28C), refrigerated conditions (4C) and at 35C. RESULTS: SARS-COV-2 virus spiked directly in eNAT could be inactivated at >5.6 log(10) PFU/ml within a minute of incubation. When saliva was diluted 1:1 in eNAT, no cytopathic effect (CPE) on vero-E6 cell lines was observed, although SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected even after 30 min incubation and after two cell culture passages. A 1:2 (saliva:eNAT) dilution abrogated both CPE and detectable viral RNA after as little as 5 min incubation in eNAT.

Moral injury is associated with negative emotions such as guilt, shame and anger, and a sense of betrayal and is identified among veterans following exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIE). OBJECTIVE: We experimentally investigate how PMIE characteristics affect the intensity of MI and related negative moral emotions in participants with varied military experience. METHOD: We conducted three controlled, randomized experiments. Each exposed male respondents with active combat experience (Study 1) and varied military experience (Study 2) to four textual vignettes describing PMIE (child/adult and innocent/non-innocent suspect) that transpire at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank. In study 3, we exposed participants to two scenarios, where descriptions of police officers enforcing COVID 19 restrictions confronted lockdown violators. RESULTS: Participants assigned to vignettes describing killing an innocent civilian exhibited more intense levels of shame and guilt than those assigned to vignettes describing killing a person carrying a bomb. Religiosity and political ideology were strong predictors of guilt and shame in response to descriptions of checkpoint shootings. These effects disappeared in Study 3, suggesting that political ideology drives MI in intergroup conflict. CONCLUSIONS: Background and PMIE-related characteristics affect the development of moral injury. Additionally, lab experiments demonstrate the potential and limitations of controlled studies of moral injury and facilitate an understanding of the aetiology of moral injury in a way unavailable to clinicians.

A set of online questionnaires were used to measure mental problems (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms), and help-seeking behavior and treatment for these mental problems. RESULTS: Frontline medical workers had higher rates of any mental problem (52.6% vs. 34.0%, adjusted OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.57-2.25), anxiety symptoms (15.7% vs. 7.4%, adjusted OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.46-2.61), depressed mood (marginally insignificant; 14.3% vs. 10.1%, adjusted OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.99-1.76) and insomnia (47.8% vs. 29.1%, adjusted OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.63-2.36) than non-frontline medical workers. No significant difference was observed in terms of suicidal ideation (12.0% vs. 9.0%, adjusted OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.92-1.71), help-seeking (4.5% vs. 4.5%, adjusted OR=1.00, 95% CI=0.53-1.87) or treatment (3.4% vs. 2.3%, adjusted OR=1.38, 95% CI=0.54-3.52) for mental problems. LIMITATIONS: The case-control nature of the data precludes causal inferences, and there is a possibility of bias related to self-reports. CONCLUSIONS: Frontline medical workers had more mental problems but comparable help-seeking behaviors and treatment for these problems than non-frontline medical workers. These findings highlight the timely mental support and intervention for medical workers, especially for those on the frontline.","output":"The mental health of frontline and non-frontline medical workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: A case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma hominis is the smallest prokaryotic microorganism with no cell wall, high pleomorphism, and slower reproduction than bacteria. It is difficult for clinical technicians to find M. hominis through the negative Gram staining of specimens. Therefore, it is likely to miss detection in routine clinical smear etiological examination. M. hominis is generally considered to be a common colonizing bacterium in urogenital tract with low pathogenicity, and it is usually difficult to invade submucosal tissue and enter the bloodstream. METHODS: The abscesses of the patient were examined histopathologically, and the pus in the abscesses was extracted for etiological examination. MALDI\\\\TOF MS was used to identify and confirmed the pathogens in the specimens. The commercial Mycoplasma isolation, culture, and drug sensitivity kit was used to determine antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: No pathogens were found after pathological and smear microscopic examination of the puncture fluid from the sacrococcygeal and pelvic abscesses. Until 48 h later, small, translucent, and gray\\\\white colonies were observed in the blood plate culture results. The laboratory physician ultimately determined that the pathogen was M. hominis by MALDI\\\\TOF MS. CONCLUSION: We report a case of extra\\\\urogenital cystic abscesses infected by M. hominis, in order to improve clinicians comprehensive understanding of the pathogenicity of Mycoplasma. In addition, the clinical laboratory technician should pay attention to the role of WrightCGiemsa staining of puncture fluid smear in the preliminary detection and the application of MALDI\\\\TOF MS in identification of uncommon pathogenic microorganisms.","output":"Identification of sacrococcygeal and pelvic abscesses infected with invasive Mycoplasma hominis by MALDI\\\\TOF MS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS of this review: Metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) is associated with poor prognosis despite advances in the treatment options in recent years. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) represent a novel class of drugs that allows selective transport of highly effective chemotherapy directly into the cancer cells by linkage to a monoclonal antibody which targets antigens overexpressed in the tumor cells as opposed to the normal tissue. In this review we will cover the current data and future perspectives for the use of ADCs in the treatment of mUC. BACKGROUND Several ADCs against different targets are currently in advanced development stages with encouraging efficacy results and manageable toxicity profiles. Two ADC drugs received FDA approval for advanced-line treatment of mUC, Enfortumab Vedotin and Sacituzumab Govitecan, which are currently being evaluated in earlier treatment settings as well as in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. These combinations are expected to enter clinical practice in the near future.

Research linking medical spending to variation in neighborhood resources is critical to building the case for increased funding for social conditions. However, few studies link neighborhood factors to medical spending. This study assesses the relationship between neighborhood social and environmental resources and medical spending across the spending distribution. METHODS Individual-level health outcomes were drawn from a sample of Medicaid enrollees living in Baltimore, Maryland during 2016. A multidimensional index of neighborhood social and environmental resources was created and stratified by tertile (high, medium, and low). Differences were examined in individual-level medical spending associated with living in high-, medium-, or low-resource neighborhoods in unadjusted and adjusted 2-part models and quantile regression models. Analyses were conducted in 2019. RESULTS Enrollees who live in neighborhoods with low social and environmental resources incur significantly higher spending at the mean and across the distribution of medical spending even after controlling for age, race, sex, and morbidity than those who live in neighborhoods with high social and environmental resources. On average, this spending difference between individuals in low- and those in high-resource neighborhoods is estimated to be $523.60 per person per year. CONCLUSIONS Living in neighborhoods with low (versus those with high) resources is associated with higher individual-level medical spending across the distribution of medical spending. Findings suggest potential benefits from efforts to address the social and environmental context of neighborhoods in addition to the traditional orientation to addressing individual behavior and risk.","output":"Impact of Neighborhood Social and Environmental Resources on Medicaid Spending."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is characterized by a high mortality of elderly men with age-related comorbidities. In most of these patients, uncontrolled local and systemic hyperinflammation induces severe and often lethal outcomes. The aging process is characterized by the gradual development of a chronic subclinical systemic inflammation (inflamm-aging) and by acquired immune system impairment (immune senescence). Here, we advance the hypothesis that four well-recognized features of aging contribute to the disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 mortality suffered by elderly men: i. the presence of subclinical systemic inflammation without overt disease, ii. a blunted acquired immune system and type I interferon response due to the chronic inflammation; iii. the downregulation of ACE2 (i.e. the SARS-CoV-2 receptor); and iv. accelerated biological aging. The high mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that clarification of the mechanisms of inflamm-aging and immune senescence can help combat not only age-related disorders but also SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Inflamm-aging: Why older men are the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 complicated outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Policymakers face an extremely uncertain environment during COVID-19 Using a nonlinear VAR estimate for the Euro Area, we argue that the benefit of reducing policy uncertainty at a time dominated by pessimistic expectations amounts to several points of GDP The impact on the economy of uncertainty shocks is much larger during periods of negative outlook for the future We estimate the impact on industrial production of the current COVID-19 induced uncertainty to peak at a year-over-year growth loss of ?15 4 per cent in September 2020, and to lead to a fall in CPI inflation between 1 per cent and 1 5 per cent Policies providing state-contingent scenarios ready to be adopted if the worst-case outcomes materialise can reduce the impact of uncertainty","output":"The Cost of Coronavirus Uncertainty: The High Returns to Clear Policy Plans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the quality and healthfulness of articles and recipes on food blogs to inform nurses, other health professionals, and patients using these as resources.

The aim of this study was to examine the association between total protein intake and different sources of dietary protein and HRQoL in Australians aged 60 years and older over a 12-year period. METHODS: This study used data from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle study (AusDiab), a 12-year population-based prospective study. The sample included 752 (386 females) adults aged 60 years and older. Protein intake was estimated at baseline (1999/2000) from a 74-item Food Frequency Questionnaire, and HRQoL using the 36-item Short-form Health Survey assessed at baseline (1999/2000) and after 12 years (2011/12). The association between protein intake and change in HRQoL was evaluated using multivariate regression analysis adjusted for relevant confounders. The difference in change in HRQoL between participants with total protein intakes of < 1.0 g/kg/day, intakes of between 1.0-1.2 g/kg/day and intakes of > 1.2 g/kg/day were assessed using one-way ANCOVA. RESULTS: Total protein intake at baseline was not associated with 12-year changes in physical component summary (PCS) or mental component summary (MCS) scores of HRQoL. Higher animal, red meat and processed animal protein intakes were associated with deteriorations in PCS scores after adjusting for relevant confounders (? = - 0.04; 95% CI: - 0.07, -0.01 ; p = 0.009; ? = - 0.05; 95% CI: - 0.08, - 0.01; p = 0.018; ? = - 0.17; 95% CI: - 0.31, - 0.02; p = 0.027 respectively). Higher red meat protein intake was associated with deteriorations in MCS scores after adjusting for relevant confounders (? = - 0.04; 95% CI: - 0.08, - 0.01; p = 0.011). There was no difference in 12-year changes in PCS or MCS between participants consuming total protein of < 1.0 g/kg/day, 1.0-1.2 g/kg/day and intakes of > 1.2 g/kg/day. CONCLUSION: There was no relationship between total dietary protein intake and HRQoL, but higher protein intakes from animal, red meat and processed animal sources were associated with a deterioration in HRQoL scores over 12 years.

Understanding public acceptance of such a novel vaccine is vital, but little is known about the topic. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the determinants of intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and willingness to pay (WTP) among people in Bangladesh. METHODS: An anonymous and online-based survey of Bangladeshi people (mean age = 29.96  9.15 years; age range = 18C60 years) was conducted using a self-reported questionnaire consisting of socio-demographics, COVID-19 experience, and vaccination-related information as well as the health belief model (HBM). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination intent and WTP. RESULTS: Of the 894 participants, 38.5% reported a definite intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, whereas 27% had a probable intention, and among this intent group, 42.8% wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Older age, feeling optimistic about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination, believing that vaccination decreases worries and risk of COVID-19 infection, and being less concerned about side effects and safety of COVID-19 vaccination under the HBM construct were found to be significant factors in COVID-19 vaccination intention. Most of the participants (72.9%) were willing to pay for a COVID-19 vaccine, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) amount of BDT 400/US$ 4.72 (IQR; BDT 200C600/US$ 2.36C7.07) per dose. Factors associated with higher WTP were younger age, being male, having higher education, residing in an urban area, having good self-rated health status, positivity towards COVID-19 vaccination's effectiveness, and being worried about the likelihood of getting infected with COVID-19. Participants who were COVID-19 vaccination intent preferred an imported vaccine over a domestically-made vaccine (22.9% vs. 14.8%), while 28.2% preferred a routine immunization schedule. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate a considerable proportion of Bangladeshi people intended to get vaccinated and had WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine.

Interferon (IFN)-, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- peaked in BALF 24C30 h PI, when virus titres and the severity of clinical signs were maximal. Whereas IFN- and IL-12, but not IL-18, increased in tandem in BALF, serum cytokine concentrations were either undetectable or were up to 100-fold lower. The APP C-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin peaked 24 h later than the cytokines and reached higher levels in serum than in BALF.

While research has focused on measuring receptors or ligands independently as biomarkers, very little attention has been given to measuring ligand-receptor complexes, in part, due to the limited availability of suitable technologies to do such measurements. This has led to underappreciation of ligand-receptor complexes as biomarkers in disease, including in cancer. In this commentary, the potential role of ligand-receptor complexes and their importance as biomarkers in cancer is discussed. We also describe a novel RNA aptamer-based technology, designated as ligand-receptor complex-binding aptamers (LIRECAP), that can provide precise measurement of the ligand occupancy of receptors and has potential use as a biomarker discovery platform. ABSTRACT: Molecular complexes, such as ligandCreceptor complexes, are vital for both health and disease and can be shed into the circulation in soluble form. Relatively little is known about the biology of soluble ligandCreceptor complexes. The functional importance of such complexes and their potential use as clinical biomarkers in diagnosis and therapy remains underappreciated. Most traditional technologies used to study ligandCreceptor complexes measure the individual levels of soluble ligands or receptors rather than the complexes themselves. The fraction of receptors occupied by ligand, and the potential clinical relevance of such information, has been largely overlooked. Here, we review the biological significance of soluble ligandCreceptor complexes with a specific focus on their potential as biomarkers of cancer and other inflammatory diseases. In addition, we discuss a novel RNA aptamer-based technology, designated ligandCreceptor complex-binding aptamers (LIRECAP), that can provide precise measurement of the fraction of a soluble receptor occupied by its ligand. The potential applicability of the LIRECAP technology as a biomarker discovery platform is also described.","output":"Quantification of Receptor Occupancy by LigandAn Understudied Class of Potential Biomarkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is transmitting throughout the globe. During this Pandemic situation, medical robots are playing an important role in protecting front line medical staff from this disease. The flexible robotic manipulator has mechanical flexibility, due to that fluctuation or oscillations can be seen either during or after the movement of a manipulator and can create uncertainty in medical operations. During this pandemic situation, reliable operations of these robots are necessary that depend upon the stability of flexible manipulators. In this article, Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), Pole Placement, and Proportional-Integral-Derivatives (PID) control methods have been used to investigate the robust control method for controlling the position of manipulator with flexible link in medical robots. To carry out this research, an effective variant of the flexible Link robotic manipulator has been used as a framework to analyze the robust control method. The Matlab?/Simulink result shows that the LQR control method provides better control response compared to PID and pole placement method and thus provides reliable operation to Medical Robots.","output":"Analysis of robust control method for the flexible manipulator in reliable operation of medical robots during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The frequent lockdown in Nepal during COVID-19 pandemic had brought various kinds of complexities such as stress among college students This situation had created uncertainty of future academic career of undergraduate students in medical colleges Some previously published literature showed gaming as a coping mechanism against stress Objective To assess the gaming behavior of Medical college students during lockdown in COVID-19 pandemic Method A cross-sectional study was conducted during lockdown period of July to August 2020 A total of 412 college students were enrolled Online Google forms were shared to all the eligible students through email, viber and messenger with the help of class representative Collected data were analyzed in SPSS version 20 0 Result The prevalence of gaming disorder was 8 5% among 260 internet gaming users About 69 2% of the participants reported that their gaming behavior had increased due to stress of COVID-19 pandemic Gender and spending more time online per day showed significant associations with greater scores on the internet gaming disorder Conclusion During lockdown period of COVID-19 pandemic, the gaming behavior of medical college students has increased ? 2020, Kathmandu University All rights reserved","output":"Gaming disorder among medical college students during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Therapeutic mammaplasty (TM) is an oncological procedure which combines tumour resection with breast reduction and mastopexy techniques. Previous systematic reviews have demonstrated oncological safety of TM, but poor and inconsistent reporting of quality-of-life, aesthetic and functional outcomes, often with non-validated measurement tools. Moreover, there is a paucity of patient-reported outcome measures. Standardisation of outcome reporting is required to enable study results to be compared and combined, for example, through core outcome set (COS) development. This systematic review aims to comprehensively describe the outcomes reported in clinical studies of TM, their respective outcome measures and the time points at which they were evaluated. The overall objective is to facilitate the development of a COS for TM. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review of clinical studies evaluating outcomes following TM will be completed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The following electronic databases have been searched from inception to 5 August 2020: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science. Primary outcomes will include the number of reported outcomes of various types (clinical, aesthetic, functional, quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness), whether these are patient-reported or clinician-reported, how outcomes are defined and the outcome measurement tool(s) used. The time point(s) at which outcomes were measured will be a secondary outcome. No studies will be excluded on the basis of methodological quality in order to generate a comprehensive list of reported outcomes and outcome measures; hence, risk of bias assessment is not required. The data will be described narratively. This protocol has been reported in line with PRISMA-Protocols. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This study does not involve human or animal participants, hence ethical approval is not required. The findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant conferences.

This study provides admission rates to hospitals and intensive care units (ICU) in Norway, aiming to better understand the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Methods: Data from official reports from The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and the Norwegian Directorate of Health were used to calculate admission rates to hospitals and to ICU per 100 000 inhabitants. We compared rates of hospitalisation between the four health regions and provide separate rates for Oslo. We also assessed national admissions to ICU stratified by age. Results: The admission rate in the south-eastern region was 3.1 per 100 000, and the rate for Oslo was 5.8. Compared to the western region (reference), the Oslo rate was 4.0 times (confidence interval (CI) 3.0-5.5) higher. In Norway as a whole, the rate of ICU admissions was 3.9 per 100 000, and in the age groups 60-69 and 70-79, ICU rates were 10.3 and 11.5, respectively. These rates were 9.5 (CI 6.3-14.3) and 10.6 (CI 6.9-16.2) times higher compared to people younger than 50 years. Conclusion: Hospital admissions due to Covid-19 are much higher in Oslo than anywhere else in Norway, and in the country as a whole, ICU admissions are highest among people 60-79 years of age.

Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 transmission has become a global threat, which includes confirmed cases in all 50 states within the United States (US). As of 25 July 2020, the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering Center for Systems Science and Engineering reports more than 4,112,651 cases and 145,546 deaths.

The author examines the underlying clinical implications that may predispose minority populations and the adverse clinical outcomes that may contribute to increased risk of mortality. Government and community-based strategies to safeguard minority populations at risk for increased morbidity and mortality are essential. Underserved populations living in poverty with limited access to social services across the US are more likely to have underlying medical conditions and are among the most vulnerable.

Psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diagnoses among minors have increased, and the related depressive symptoms may negatively affect quality of life. There is great potential for information technology (IT) to benefit the area of mental health for adolescents, and schools can serve as a setting in which this can be done. We tested whether the IT-based program DepisNet could be used as a universal school-based program to support adolescents well-being and mental health. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a quasi-experimental, pre-post design with two preference arms (intervention and control groups). The study setting comprised two lower secondary schools (N=151 adolescents) in one city in Finland. To analyze the impact of the program, we compared the changes in the outcome measures between the two groups using T-tests and MannCWhitney U-tests. We analyzed the changes within the groups using T-tests and Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the outcomes (depression, quality of life, self-esteem, self-efficacy). Regarding adolescents quality of life, the observed change was more positive in the intervention group, compared to that of the control group (change mean 1.36 vs ?0.49), although statistical significance was not achieved (p=0.10). Our results indicated encouraging results related to the feasibility components: adherence and acceptance. CONCLUSION: Universal interventions and programs that relate to adolescent well-being and mental health can be integrated into school curricula to promote the awareness of adolescents general well-being and mental health issues.","output":"Impact and Feasibility of Information Technology to Support Adolescent Well-Being and Mental Health at School: A Quasi-Experimental Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report our initial experience with the management of a mixed group of patients with COVID-19 infection, admitted and treated in a designated COVID-19 centre in the Athens Metropolitan area over a 4-week period.

PURPOSE: This review of chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), including new and emerging evidence for treatment of patients with this condition, is intended to offer data supporting the use of specific agents for this patient population. SUMMARY: Chronic heart failure is a major health concern affecting millions of Americans annually and remains a significant burden on the healthcare system. Heart failure is divided into categories based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Current treatments for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, defined by an LVEF of less than 40%, involve a variety of agents with established morbidity and mortality benefits. This is in stark contrast to directed treatments for patients with HFpEF, defined by an LVEF of greater than 50%. Treatments for this form of heart failure have been elusive until recently, when studies were published with sacubitril/valsartan and empagliflozin. Results of the PARAGON-HF trial suggested benefit from sacubitril/valsartan in patients with an ejection fraction between 45% and 57%, leading to its approval in 2021 as the first medication indicated for treatment of patients with a preserved ejection fraction. Months later, the results of the EMPEROR-Preserved trial demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in the composite outcome of heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular death in patients with HFpEF taking empagliflozin. This medication has yet to gain approval for HFpEF; however, these data along with ongoing and future trials will likely impact standard treatment for these patients. CONCLUSION: The PARAGON-HF and EMPEROR-Preserved trials will serve as the foundation for a new era in the treatment of HFpEF.","output":"New therapies for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The patients with hematological malignancies are a vulnerable group to COVID-19, due to the immunodeficiency resulting from the underlying disease and oncological treatment that significantly impair cellular and humoral immunity. Here we report on a beneficial impact of a passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma to treat a prolonged, active COVID-19 infection in a patient with a history of nasopharyngeal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with the therapy inducing substantial impairment of particularly humoral arm of immune system. The specific aim was to quantify SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies in a patient plasma during the course of therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Besides the standard of care treatment and monitoring, neutralizing antibody titers in patient's serum samples, calibrated according to the First WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (human), were quantified in a time-dependent manner. During the immunotherapy period peripheral blood flow cytometry immunophenotyping was conducted to characterize lymphocyte subpopulations. RESULTS: The waves of clinical improvements and worsening coincided with transfused neutralizing antibodies rises and drops in the patient's systemic circulation, proving their contribution in controlling the disease progress. Besides the patient's lack of own humoral immune system, immunophenotyping analysis revealed also the reduced level of helper T-lymphocytes and immune exhaustion of monocytes.

DATA SOURCE PubMed (1966-2006), PubMed \\"related articles,\\" publications and Web sites of the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, personal files, abstract proceedings, and reference lists. STUDY SELECTION We reviewed English-language publications pertaining to clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of AI H5N1 and infection control expressly relating to the intensive care setting. DATA SYNTHESIS The majority of reported patients with AI H5N1 are critically ill and require intensive care management. These patients progress rapidly to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Multiorgan failure occurs in a large proportion. Because of the nonspecific clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features, it is critical to seek a history of exposure to poultry or wild birds in suspected cases. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction performed on nasopharyngeal aspirate is the most reliable method for the laboratory diagnosis of AI H5N1. Treatment includes starting neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir as early as possible in addition to the standard supportive management. Aerosol generating procedures should be minimized to avoid nosocomial transmission. Strict infection control procedures are paramount to staff safety, although human-to-human transmission is rare as of this time. CONCLUSIONS Many patients with AI H5N1 are critically ill either at presentation or shortly thereafter. Intensivists and intensive care units are therefore at the front line for this new cause of severe lung injury. Practitioners must be familiar with the nonspecific presentation of AI H5N1 and its diagnostic and therapeutic options.

The low dose of infection suggests that Francisella is unusually efficient at evading host defenses. Although ~50 cfu are necessary to cause human respiratory infection, the early interactions of virulent Francisella with the lung environment are not well understood. To provide additional insights into these interactions during early Francisella infection of mice, we performed TEM analysis on mouse lungs infected with F. tularensis strains Schu S4, LVS and the O-antigen mutant Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn. For all three strains, the majority of the bacteria that we could detect were observed within alveolar type II epithelial cells at 16 hours post infection. Although there were no detectable differences in the amount of bacteria within an infected cell between the three strains, there was a significant increase in the amount of cellular debris observed in the air spaces of the lungs in the Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn mutant compared to either the Schu S4 or LVS strain. We also studied the interactions of Francisella strains with human AT-II cells in vitro by characterizing the ability of these three strains to invade and replicate within these cells. Gentamicin assay and confocal microscopy both confirmed that F. tularensis Schu S4 replicated robustly within these cells while F. tularensis LVS displayed significantly lower levels of growth over 24 hours, although the strain was able to enter these cells at about the same level as Schu S4 (1 organism per cell), as determined by confocal imaging. The Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn mutant that we have previously described as attenuated for growth in macrophages and mouse virulence displayed interesting properties as well. This mutant induced significant airway inflammation (cell debris) and had an attenuated growth phenotype in the human AT-II cells. These data extend our understanding of early Francisella infection by demonstrating that Francisella enter significant numbers of AT-II cells within the lung and that the capsule and LPS of wild type Schu S4 helps prevent murine lung damage during infection. Furthermore, our data identified that human AT-II cells allow growth of Schu S4, but these same cells supported poor growth of the attenuated LVS strain in vitro. Collectively, these data further our understanding of the role of AT-II cells in Francisella infections.","output":"Interactions of Francisella tularensis with Alveolar Type II Epithelial Cells and the Murine Respiratory Epithelium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging infectious diseases in humans are often caused by respiratory viruses such as pandemic or avian influenza viruses and novel coronaviruses. Microbiological testing for respiratory viruses is important for patient management, infection control and epidemiological studies. Nasopharyngeal specimens are frequently tested, but their sensitivity is suboptimal. This study evaluated the incremental benefit of testing respiratory viruses in expectorated saliva using molecular assays. A total of 258 hospitalized adult patients with suspected respiratory infections were included. Their expectorated saliva was collected without the use of any special devices. In the first cohort of 159 patients whose nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) tested positive for respiratory viruses during routine testing, the viral load was measured using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Seventeen percent of the patients (27/159) had higher viral loads in the saliva than in the NPA. The second cohort consisted of 99 patients whose NPAs tested negative for respiratory viruses using a direct immunofluorescence assay. Their NPA and saliva specimens were additionally tested using multiplex PCR. In these patients, the concordance rate by multiplex PCR between NPA and saliva was 83.8%. Multiplex PCR detected viruses in saliva samples from 16 patients, of which nine (56.3%) had at least one virus that was not detected in the NPA. Decisions on antiviral or isolation precautions would be affected by salivary testing in six patients.

In this report, we applied the real-time RT-PCR assay to the evaluation of the inhibitory effect of ribavirin, a well-known broad spectrum antiviral drug, in a cell culture system. When added from the beginning of the infection, ribavirin caused a dose-dependent reduction of VHSV RNA accumulation. Real-time RT-PCR measurements showed 99.8% inhibition at 25 microg/ml ribavirin, with an IC50 of 0.43 microg/ml. Ribavirin maintained its inhibitory activity against VHSV when added at 6 h post-infection. Quantitation of N protein messenger RNA and plus-stranded RNA showed a substantial decrease of viral transcription in ribavirin-treated cells. Partial reversion of the effect of ribavirin by addition of GTP was observed, confirming that ribavirin targets the synthesis of guanidine nucleotides in the cells.

Approaches to design promising drug molecules have gone through many stages, from experiment-based trail-and-error approaches, to the well-established avenue of the quantitative structure-activity relationship, and currently to the stage guided by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence techniques. In this work, we present a study of the permeability of small drug-like molecules across lipid membranes by two types of ML models, namely the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and deep neural network (DNN) models. Molecular descriptors and fingerprints are used for featurization of organic molecules. Using molecular descriptors, the LASSO model uncovers that the electro-topological, electrostatic, polarizability, and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity properties are the most important physical properties to determine the membrane permeability of small drug-like molecules. Additionally, with molecular fingerprints, the LASSO model suggests that certain chemical substructures can significantly affect the permeability of organic molecules, which closely connects to the identified main physical properties. Moreover, the DNN model using molecular fingerprints can help develop a more accurate mapping between molecular structures and their membrane permeability than LASSO models.

After the emergence of the pandemic the major focus of efforts to attenuate the infection has been on repurposing the already approved drugs to treat COVID-19 adopting a fast-track strategy. However, to date a specific regimen to treat COVID-19 is not available. Over the last few months a substantial amount of data about the structures of various key proteins and their recognition partners involved in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis has emerged. These studies have not only provided the molecular level descriptions ofthe viral pathogenesis but also laid the foundation for rational drug design and discovery. In this review, we have recapitulated the structural details of four key viral enzymes, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, 3-chymotrypsin like protease, papain-like protease and helicase, and two host factors including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease involved in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and described the potential hotspots present on these structures which could be explored for therapeutic intervention.

As the world continues to embrace remote virtual communication in the post-COVID-19 era, it is crucial to investigate the impacts of online social copresence on cognitive performance. The present study investigated how the online videoconference presence of a virtual companion affects participants performance on cognitive relational-reasoning tasks. The companion was either present and attentive to the participant, present but nonattentive, or absent. We manipulated the agency of a virtual companion, who was either a real human, an avatar controlled by a human, or an artificial intelligence (AI)-controlled agent. We hypothesized that the mere presence of a virtual companion, and the observance of participants' performance, would influence participants' performance. The results were broadly in line with our hypothesis that a mere presence of a virtual companion improved cognitive performance irrespective of their agency. However, the direction of the results did not support our prediction. We did not find a systematic impact of observance on cognitive performance, not supporting our second hypothesis. Participants performed best overall with an AI-controlled agent, next best with an avatar and worst with a real-human companion. We also observed that participants performed more accurately when a virtual companion was present but nonattentive, and faster when a virtual companion observed the participants, compared to when the participants performed alone. We conclude that online videoconference presence with a virtual companion, regardless of observance, temporarily enhances cognitive performance, and discuss the implications of these findings.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, contact tracing apps for smartphones have also been promoted in many countries as a way to allow public officials to facilitate contact tracing. But uptake in virtually all countries where such apps have been promoted is slow, one reason being privacy concerns. Conducting three experiments across France (n = 471), Australia (n = 202), and the United States (n = 1,005), we explore if salient COVID-19 concerns, which intuitively should increase concerns about personal and public health, might in fact increase privacy concerns and thereby reduce uptake of contact tracing apps. Using an experimental design where we randomly assign participants to either a disease concerns or control condition, we find that salient COVID-19 concerns decrease intentions to download contact tracing apps. Mediation results reveal that greater valuations of privacy explain the lower willingness. We therefore explain why COVID-19 contact tracing apps that are promoted when the pandemic is at its peak see low levels of uptake.

Even with a working knowledge of EHR, it is difficult to know all the relevant codes related to a phenotype due to the large number of codes available. Traditional data mining approaches often require the use of patient-level data, which hinders the ability to share data across institutions to establish a cooperative and integrated knowledge network. In this project, we demonstrate that multi-center large-scale code embeddings can be used to efficiently identify relevant features related to a disease or condition of interest. Method: We constructed large-scale code embeddings for a wide range of codified concepts, including diagnosis codes, medications, procedures, and laboratory tests from EHRs from two large medical centers. We developed knowledge extraction via sparse embedding regression (KESER) for feature selection and integrative network analysis based on the trained code embeddings. We evaluated the quality of the code embeddings and assessed the performance of KESER in feature selection for eight diseases. Besides, we developed an integrated clinical knowledge map combining embedding data from both institutions. Results: The features selected by KESER were comprehensive compared to lists of codified data generated by domain experts. Additionally, features identified automatically via KESER used in the development of phenotype algorithms resulted in comparable performance to those built upon features selected manually or identified via existing feature selection methods with patient-level data. The knowledge map created using an integrative analysis identified disease-disease and disease-drug pairs more accurately compared to those identified using single institution data. Conclusion: Analysis of code embeddings via KESER can effectively reveal clinical knowledge and infer relatedness among diseases, treatment, procedures, and laboratory measurement. This approach automates the grouping of clinical features facilitating studies of the condition. KESER bypasses the need for patient-level data in individual analyses providing a significant advance in enabling multi-center studies using EHR data.","output":"Clinical Knowledge Extraction via Sparse Embedding Regression (KESER) with Multi-Center Large Scale Electronic Health Record Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, Bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) has emerged as an attractive gene delivery viral vector, mainly for vaccination purposes in the veterinary field. In the present study, a new infectious clone of the BoHV-4 genome carrying a bacterial artificial chromosome vector (BoHV-4-BAC) was developed by homologous recombination in mammalian cell culture and bacterial systems, and exploited to express a truncated form of glycoprotein D (tgD) of Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) (BoHV-4-tgD?TK) as a vaccine candidate. This constructs immunogenicity was compared to a DNA vector expressing the same antigen (pC-tgD) in a BALB/c mouse model. After the mice were immunized, total and specific antibody responses, cytokine responses, total splenocyte cells proliferation/cytotoxicity, and virus neutralization assays were conducted to analyze the immune response elicited by both constructs. Mice from both vaccine groups developed significant humoral and cellular immune responses after a booster dose regime was conducted on day 28 post-injection. In almost all immunological assays, BoHV-4-tgDTK induced as high an immune response as pC-tgD. In both vaccine constructs, neutralizing antibodies were a significant determining factor in protection against BoHV-1, even after the first injection.

METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicenter, cohort study involving seven hospitals in Brazil. Inclusion criteria were being > 18 years of age with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, being on invasive mechanical ventilation, having a PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio < 150 mmHg, and being submitted to prone positioning. After the first prone positioning session, a 20 mmHg improvement in the PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was defined as a positive response. RESULTS: The study involved 574 patients, 412 (72%) of whom responded positively to the first prone positioning session. Multiple logistic regression showed that responders had lower Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III)/SOFA scores and lower D-dimer levels (p = 0.01; p = 0.04; and p = 0.04, respectively). It was suggested that initial SAPS III and initial PaO(2)/FIO(2) were predictors of oxygenation response. The mortality rate was 69.3%. Increased risk of mortality was associated with age (OR = 1.04 [95 CI: 1.01-1.06]), time to first prone positioning session (OR = 1.18 [95 CI: 1.06-1.31]), number of sessions (OR = 1.31 [95% CI: 1.00-1.72]), proportion of pulmonary impairment (OR = 1.55 [95% CI: 1.02-2.35]), and immunosuppression (OR = 3.83 [95% CI: 1.35-10.86]). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that most patients in our sample had a positive oxygenation response after the first prone positioning session. However, the mortality rate was high, probably due to the health status and the number of comorbidities of the patients, as well as the severity of their disease. Our results also suggest that SAPS III and the initial PaO(2)/FIO(2) predict the oxygenation response; in addition, age, time to first prone positioning, number of sessions, pulmonary impairment, and immunosuppression can predict mortality.","output":"Impact of prone positioning on patients with COVID-19 and ARDS on invasive mechanical ventilation: a multicenter cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Can bad news about COVID-19 induce negative expectations on sovereign credit risks?

These noncompliance behaviors partly reflect people's concerns for the inherent costs of social distancing while discounting its public health benefits. We propose that this oversight may be associated with the limitation in one's mental capacity to simultaneously retain multiple pieces of information in working memory (WM) for rational decision making that leads to social-distancing compliance. We tested this hypothesis in 850 United States residents during the first 2 wk following the presidential declaration of national emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that participants' social-distancing compliance at this initial stage could be predicted by individual differences in WM capacity, partly due to increased awareness of benefits over costs of social distancing among higher WM capacity individuals. Critically, the unique contribution of WM capacity to the individual differences in social-distancing compliance could not be explained by other psychological and socioeconomic factors (e.g., moods, personality, education, and income levels). Furthermore, the critical role of WM capacity in social-distancing compliance can be generalized to the compliance with another set of rules for social interactions, namely the fairness norm, in Western cultures.

PLpro, with its multifunctional roles like viral polypeptide proteolysis and suppression of the host's innate immune response, is acting as a potential drug target. The X-ray crystal structure of PLpro and ligand molecules were retrieved from the protein structure database and Npatlas database, respectively.

Herein, we report the first case of a germline BRCA1 mutated unresectable MCAC which was effectively treated with olaparib. CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old woman, without personal or family history of cancer, was diagnosed with ovarian and peritoneal metastases of MCAC. She underwent 12 cycles of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX) obtaining a partial response and allowing radical surgery. One year later, local recurrence was documented, and other 12 cycles of GEMOX were administered obtaining a complete response. Seven years later, another local recurrence, not amenable to surgical resection, was diagnosed. She started FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin and fluorouracil), obtaining a partial response after 8 cycles. Given the excellent response to platinum-based chemotherapy, BRCA testing was performed, and a BRCA1 germline mutation was detected. She was switched to maintenance olaparib due to chemotherapy-related toxicities and achieved an almost complete metabolic response, with a reduction in the diameter of the lesion, after three months of therapy.

Participants (N = 114, aged 23 to 67, M = 38.85, SD = 9.82, 74.6% females) answered the PMIE scale items, in addition to questions related to the physical and emotional self-impact related questions, and demographical and work-related variables (i.e. age, gender, medical experience, and speciality). Results: Results suggested that almost 50% of the participants reported high levels of PMIE exposure. No significant associations were found between PMIE exposure, and the type of medical unit physicians worked in (Covid-19 or non-Covid-19), nor their specialization and medical experience. Demographic variables (i.e. age and gender) and experience did not predict PMIE exposure. However, we found significant associations between PMIE and the physicians physical and emotional self-reported impact. Conclusions: Healthcare systems, governments, and societies worldwide need to recognize that physicians are prone to PMIE exposure and related adverse psychological outcomes due to their daily activity in containing the pandemic. Public policies need to actively offer and promote psychological support, to protect and help physicians from the adverse mental health outcomes following the pandemic. ? 2021 The Author(s).

However, the regulation may deteriorate the quality of medical services due to the reduction in training time. Thus, the study aimed to reveal perceptions in terms of generation gaps in views on self-training and overtime work, among members of the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG). METHODS A web-based, self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted among members of the JSOG. In total, 1256 respondents were included in the analysis. Data were collected on age, sex, experience as a medical doctor, location of workplace, work style, the type of main workplace, and number of full-time doctors in the main workplace. The study examined the attitudes of the respondents toward overtime work and self-training. The respondents were categorized based on experience as a medical doctor. RESULTS According to years of experience, 112 (8.9%), 226 (18.0%), 383 (30.5%), 535 (42.6%) doctors have been working for 5, 6-10, 11-19, and  20 years, respectively. Although 54.5% of doctors with 5 years of experience expected the regulation on working hours to improve the quality of medical services, those with 20 years of experience expressed potential deterioration. After adjusting for covariates, more years of experience were significantly related with the expectation of deterioration in the quality of medical services. CONCLUSIONS The study revealed a generation gap in the views about self-training and overtime work among obstetricians and gynecologists in Japan.","output":"Attitudes toward overtime work and self-training: A survey on obstetricians and gynecologists in Japan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hyperthermia therapy is now being used to treat cancer. However, understanding the pattern of temperature increase in biological tissues during hyperthermia treatment is essential. In recent years, many physicians and engineers have studied the use of computational and mathematical models of heat transfer in biological systems. The rapid progress in computing technology has intrigued many researchers. Many medical procedures also use engineering techniques and mathematical modeling to ensure their safety and assess the risks involved. One such model is the modified Pennes bioheat conduction equation. This paper provides an analytical solution to the modified Pennes bioheat conduction equation with a single relaxation time by incorporating in it the (MGT) equation. The suggested model examines heat transport in biological tissues as forming an infinite concentric spherical region during magnetic fluid hyperthermia. To investigate thermal reactions caused by temperature shock, specifically the influence of heat generation through heat treatment on a skin tumor [AEGP9], the Laplace transformation, and numerical inverse transformation methods are used. This model was able to explain the effects of different therapeutic approaches such as cryotherapy sessions, laser therapy, and physical occurrences, transfer, metabolism support, and blood perfusion. Comparison of the numerical results of the suggested model with those in the literature confirmed the validity of the model's numerical results.","output":"Heat Transfer in Biological Spherical Tissues during Hyperthermia of Magnetoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In a densely populated country like Bangladesh, mental health-related burden and associated adverse outcomes are quite prevalent. However, exploration of sleep-related issues in general, and more specifically of insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic has been scarce and restricted to a single location. The present study investigated the prevalence of insomnia and its predictive factors in the general population, and included Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis to identify regional heterogeneities of insomnia in Bangladesh. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Information related to socio-demographics, knowledge of COVID-19, behaviors related to COVID-19, fear of COVID-19, and insomnia were included in a questionnaire, and coupled with GIS-based spatial analysis to identify regional susceptibility to insomnia. RESULTS: Approximately 30.4%, 13.1% and 2.8% of participants reported sub-threshold, moderate, and severe forms of insomnia, respectively. Independent predictive risk factors of insomnia symptoms included female gender, college education, urban residence, presence of comorbidities, using social media, taking naps during daytime, and fear of COVID-19. District-wide variations in the spatial distribution of fear of COVID-19 and insomnia were significantly associated. CONCLUSION: Insomnia is frequently present during a pandemic, and exhibits regional variability along with multifactorial determinants. These analytic approaches should enable improved detection and targeting of at-risk sectors of the population, and enable implementation of appropriate measures to ensure improved sleep quality.","output":"Predictive factors of insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: a GIS-based nationwide distribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trichotemnomania (TT) refers to cutting or shaving of one's own hair as a compulsive act. This condition is reported rarely and may be indicative of an underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder. TT may be misdiagnosed with trichotillomania or other disorders such as alopecia areata, tinea capitis, and postinflammatory scars. The diagnosis of trichotemnomania is confirmed by dermoscopic assessment, histopathological changes of hair, and correlation of these findings with clinical history. A fourteen-year-old adolescent girl presented with focal hair loss over forehead for duration of two-weeks and periodic abnormal breathing and poor sleep for 2-month duration. Besides, she had also lost some of pubic hair and hair on the forearm over preceding 24 hours. This patient was assessed by a team including a paediatrician, gynecologist, dermatologist, and psychiatrist to gather focused medical history and to perform physical examination, laboratory investigations, and dermoscopic assessment. It was revealed that she used to shave or cut regularly following stressful situations across various aspects of her life and hyperventilate as a means of relieving her stress. Eventually, she was diagnosed to have trichotemnomania and was started oral sertraline 50 mg/day for one month. Clinical features and her behaviour improved with regular cognitive behavioural therapy, and hairs were demonstrated to grow up normally with change in behaviour. Currently, she does well at school and is off medications and being followed up at the child guidance clinic. Trichotemnomania is a very rare disorder which is characterised by cutting or shaving of one's own hairs as a compulsive habit.

While decreasing transmission is an important goal, it is not the only goal that quality healthcare must aim to achieve. Severely restricted visitation policies undermine our ability to provide humane, family-centered care, particularly during critical illness and at the end of life. The enforcement of these policies consequently increases the risk of moral distress and injury for providers. Using our experience in a PICU, we survey the shortcomings of current visitation restrictions. We argue that hospital visitation restrictions can be implemented in ways that are nonmaleficent, but this requires unwavering acknowledgment of the value of social and familial support during illness and death. We advocate that visitation restriction policies be implemented by independent, medically knowledgeable decision-making bodies, with the informed participation of patients and their families.","output":"Paved With Good Intentions: Hospital Visitation Restrictions in the Age of Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, faculty are suddenly thrown into a world where they have to teach virtually, forcing them to innovate in their teaching practice without the ability to 'chat with their colleagues' next door. Additionally, many faculty do not know how to create an inclusive classroom, which is crucial for students who have also lost their learning community and support structure. Many faculty are afraid to include issues of inclusion and diversity, feeling ill equipped and unsupported. As tensions rise across the US, there is a critical need for engineering students to be able to discuss issues involving inclusion in the classroom as well as apply their abilities as engineers to make a significant impact (both positively or negatively) on inclusion through their applications and innovations. Without the proper support for the faculty to innovate and foster inclusive classrooms, millions of students will suffer in their education. Additionally, without a trusting support group, most engineering faculty would not choose to assume the risk. In response, we developed a community of practice with six teaching fellows who shared, watched, commented on, and emulated each other's classroom recordings.

Affecting up to 3% of the adult population, this typically chronic, recurring condition significantly impairs quality of life, and its treatment places a heavy financial burden upon healthcare systems. The current mainstay of treatment for venous leg ulcers is compression therapy, which has been shown to enhance ulcer healing rates. Open surgery on the veins in the leg has been shown to reduce ulcer recurrence rates, but it is an unpopular option and many patients are unsuitable. The efficacy of the newer, minimally-invasive endovenous thermal techniques has been established in uncomplicated superficial venous disease, and these techniques are now beginning to be used in the management of venous ulceration, though the evidence for this treatment is currently unclear. It is hypothesised that, when used with compression, ablation may further reduce pressures in the leg veins, resulting in improved rates of healing. Furthermore, since long-term patient concordance with compression is relatively poor, it may prove more popular, effective and cost-effective to provide a single intervention to reduce recurrence, rather than life-long treatment with compression. OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of superficial endovenous thermal ablation on the healing, recurrence and quality of life of people with active or healed venous ulcers. SEARCH METHODS In August 2013 we searched Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions on the language of publication but there was a date restriction based on the fact that superficial endovenous thermal ablation is a comparatively new medical technology. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised clinical trials comparing endovenous thermal ablative techniques with compression therapy alone for venous leg ulcers were eligible for inclusion. Trials had to report on at least one objective measure of ulcer healing (primary outcome) such as proportion of ulcers healed at a given time point, time to complete healing, change in ulcer size, proportion of ulcers recurring over a given time period, or at a specific point, and ulcer-free days. Secondary outcomes sought included patient-reported quality of life, economic data and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Details of potentially eligible studies were extracted and summarised using a data extraction table. Data extraction and validity assessment were performed independently by two review authors, and any disagreements resolved by consensus or by arbitration of a third review author. MAIN RESULTS No eligible randomised controlled trials were identified. There is an absence of evidence regarding the effects of superficial endovenous thermal ablation on ulcer healing, recurrence or quality of life of people with venous leg ulcer disease. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The review identified no randomised controlled trials on the effects on ulcer healing, recurrence or quality of life, of superficial endovenous thermal ablation in people with active or healed venous leg ulcers. Adequately-powered, high quality randomised controlled trials comparing endovenous thermal ablative interventions with compression therapy are urgently required to explore this new treatment strategy. These should measure and report outcomes that include time to ulcer healing, ulcer recurrence, quality of life and cost-effectiveness.","output":"Endovenous thermal ablation for healing venous ulcers and preventing recurrence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: This audit was carried out in response to the Coronavirus pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many teams to review how they provide care to their patients. Due to attempting to reduce the spead of COVID-19, the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service within the Northern Health and Social Care Trust largely switched to telephone reviews instead of face-to-face reviews for non-urgent outpatient appointments from March 2020 onwards. The aim of this audit was to establish whether or not service users found telephone reviews to be as useful and therapeutic as the previous standard face-to-face reviews. METHOD: A questionnaire was used to assess opinions on telephone reviews. Those who were answering the questions were asked to rate their answers on the following scale: not at all, a little, somewhat or a great deal. There was an any other comments section at the end where service users could give detailed opinions on how successful they thought telephone reviews were. A sample of twenty patients was involved. This cohort of twenty patients was a mixture of ten ADHD reviews and ten medication reviews. The audit was conducted by one person and this was done via the telephone. RESULT: For questions one to four (which will be fully outlined in the poster), the most popular category chosen was somewhat and this indicates that the majority of patients found telephone reviews somewhat better than face-to-face appointments. For question five (which was- Overall, was the help you received good?), 80% of service users stated that the help that they received was a great deal better than the help that they had received at previous face-to-face appointments. Lastly, for question six (which was- If a friend or family member needed similar help, would you recommend that they are phoned by our service?), 80% of service users said that they would recommend our service a great deal to family members or friends. CONCLUSION: Generally the feedback was positive for the telephone reviews. However, some still outlined a preference for face-to-face reviews. There may have been bias in this audit as it was the same doctor who did the telephone reviews as conducted the audit. To conclude, telemedicine is likely to become more popular in the future especially as the Coronavirus pandemic is still currently a worldwide problem therefore it is important to explore how service users feel about this as a way of communicating with the clinicians who are treating them.","output":"An audit comparing telephone reviews to standard face-to-face consultations within child and adolescent mental health services at Massereene House"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 that has been characterized as a pandemic by the WHO.

However, there have been no vaccines approved in the world to date. In this study, we analyzed the biological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, Pro330-Leu650 (SARS-CoV-2-SPL), using biostatistical methods. SARS-CoV-2-SPL possesses a receptor-binding region (RBD) and important B (Ser438-Gln506, Thr553-Glu583, Gly404-Aps427, Thr345-Ala352, and Lys529-Lys535) and T (9 CD4 and 11 CD8 T cell antigenic determinants) cell epitopes. High homology in this region between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV amounted to 87.7%, after taking the biological similarity of the amino acids into account and eliminating the receptor-binding motif (RBM). The overall topology indicated that the complete structure of SARS-CoV-2-SPL was with RBM as the head, and RBD as the trunk and the tail region.

AIMS: Aim of this study was to explore SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a single hospital workers cohort. METHODS: All hospital workers were invited to fill in a questionnaire and undergo a blood test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, using two commercial tests (DiaSorin and Abbott). Seropositivity was determined overall and according to demographic and occupations characteristics, for both tests singly and combined. RESULTS: The study enrolled 1562 hospital workers (95% of the eligible population). Overall, 153 (9.8%) participants were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG on DiaSorin test, and 150 (9.6%) were positive on Abbott test; both tests were positive in 123 (7.9%) cases and at least one was positive in 180 (11.5%) cases. Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity included: being a smoker, working in emergency or medicine departments, being a healthcare practitioner, self-reporting a relative with COVID-19 or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and having undergone a nasopharyngeal swab test. The tests were accurate in discriminating infected cases, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.867 using manufacturer-suggested cut-offs and 0.929 using optimised cut-offs. For discriminating symptomatic subjects, this value was 0.915 using optimised cut-offs.

However, only recently COVID-19 confinement measures provided a context to test whether such detrimental effects exist in the human sexuality domain. AIM: This study was aimed at testing the relationship between COVID-19 confinement levels and sexual functioning domains in men and women, while accounting for the mediating role of psychological adjustment during lockdown. METHODS: Two hundred and forty five men and 417 women completed a web survey on the effects of COVID-19 in sexual health. The reference period includes the first confinement in Portugal (March 19-June 1, 2020). Data were handled under Hays' procedures for simple mediation analysis. OUTCOMES: Measurement outcomes included self-reported levels of confinement, IIEF and FSFI scores, and psychological adjustment during lockdown. RESULTS: Psychological adjustment during lockdown mediated the relationship between confinement levels and most sexual functioning domains in men but not in women. Also, while confinement levels were not directly related with most sexual functioning domains, psychological adjustment during lockdown did predict lower sexual functioning in both genders. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: Findings support that human sexual functioning should be framed within a contextual perspective, emphasizing how psychological adjustment and situational life stressors, such as lockdown situations, shape individuals' sexuality. Such perspective should be considered in treatment protocols implemented during current pandemic. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Data add to the literature on the effects of lockdown in the sexuality domain. However, the study precludes inference of causality and targets only a little proportion of all the dynamics involved in sexuality during the current historical moment.

How can a safe and efficient management of these inpatients be achieved? Methods: : We conducted a retrospective analysis of 314 consecutive inpatient patients who presented with possible symptoms of COVID-19 in a German emergency department between March and April 2020 and were tested with a SARS-Cov-2 nasopharyngeal swab. Clinical parameters, Manchester Triage System categories and lab results were compared between patients with positive and negative test results for SARS-Cov-2. Furthermore, we present the existing COVID-19 workflow model of the university hospital in Essen which proved to be efficient during pandemia. Results: : 43 of the 314 patients (13.7%) were tested positive for COVID-19 by SARS-Cov-2 nasopharyngeal swab.

METHODS: A database search in PubMed and Scopus ensued to recruit studies reporting the index case information of COVID-19 infected individuals aged  18. The reviewed articles' quality evaluation included the use of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's tool. A random-effect meta-analysis ensued to determine the prevalence of the parent being and not-being the index case. Heterogeneity was assessed by I(2) and Chi(2) statistics. The publication bias was evaluated by funnel plots and Eggers test. RESULTS: Overall, this review included 13 eligible studies sourcing data from 622 children of 33 nations. Study designs were heterogeneous and primarily included descriptive reports (38.4%). The prevalence of parent being the index case was 54% (95%CI: 0.29-0.79; I(2): 62.3%, Chi(2 )P < 0.001).

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study demonstrates the first deployment of the Anser electromagnetic (EM) tracking system with the CustusX image-guided interventional research platform to navigate using an endobronchial catheter to injected tumour targets. Live animal investigations validated the deployment and targeting of peripheral tumour models using an innovative tumour marking routine. RESULTS Novel tumour model deployment was successfully achieved at all eight target sites across two live animal investigations without pneumothorax. Virtual bronchoscopy with tracking successfully guided the tracked catheter to 2-12 mm from the target tumour site. Deployment of a novel marker was achieved at all eight sites providing a reliable measure of targeting accuracy. Targeting accuracy within 10 mm was achieved in 7/8 sites and in all cases, the virtual target distance at marker deployment was within the range subsequently measured with x-ray. CONCLUSIONS Endobronchial targeting of peripheral airway targets is feasible using existing open-source technology. Notwithstanding the shortcomings of current commercial platforms, technological improvements in EM tracking and registration accuracy fostered by open-source technology may provide the impetus for widespread clinical uptake of electromagnetic navigation in bronchoscopy.","output":"Peripheral tumour targeting using open-source virtual bronchoscopy with electromagnetic tracking: a multi-user pre-clinical study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has killed over 3 million people worldwide.

Although measures were taken to restrict hospital visits, traditional paper-based registration is insufficient to screen and monitor the numbers of visitors to a large hospital. METHODS Throughout March 2020, during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis, a computer system was deployed in the 2800-bed Taipei Veterans General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan) to register, screen, and monitor inpatient visitors. This system comprised three parts: online registration form, entrance check-in interface, and registration database. The early utilization of this newly deployed system was then analyzed. RESULTS A total of 22,336 visits were recorded between March 11, 2020, and March 31, 2020, with 1064 a day on average. Out of these visits, 18.1% (n = 4049) had made online reservations within 48 hours. On the other hand, of all 4941 online reservations, 18.1% (n = 892) were no-shows. In the last 12 days of the study period, eight prospective visitors were identified as ineligible by the computer system, and so their visits were denied. CONCLUSION Using a computer system, the hospital was able to enforce restrictions on hospital visits. Although the online registration system had not been fully used yet in the early phase of adoption, its superiority from the standpoint of disease control should enable hospital managers to consider abolishing on-site visitor registration.","output":"Deployment of a computerized ward visitor registration system in coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic: Experiences of a large academic medical center in Taiwan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is important to have an estimate of the incidence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) because the incidence of ADEM is unknown and the outcomes undefined in China. OBJECTIVES: This study attempts to describe ADEM incidence in large Chinese populations located in four geographically different and moderately distant areas of the same province. METHODS: A retrospective investigation was conducted with ADEM patients in Nanjing, Nantong, Yancheng and Xuzhou. The survey was carried out in regions that might have received patients meeting the case definition of ADEM provided by the International Pediatric MS Study Group from 2008 to 2011. A total of 125 hospitals were included and 412 patients were identified through the hospital information systems (HIS). RESULTS: The incidence of ADEM was 0.32/100,000/year. There are two peaks on the age-specific ADEM rates curve. One is 0.77/100,000/year among 0- to 9-year-olds, the other is 0.45/100,000/year in those aged 50C59 years. The incidence rate found for ADEM in males was 0.34/100,000/year, and in females was 0.29/100,000/year. The highest incidence rate was in Nanjing (0.40/100,000/year).

Those who are moderately to severely ill with COVID-19 are likely to develop acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and require administration of supplemental oxygen. Assessing the need to initiate or titrate oxygen therapy is largely dependent on evaluating the patient's existing blood oxygenation status, either by direct arterial blood sampling or by transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation monitoring, also referred to as pulse oximetry. While the sampling of arterial blood for measurement of dissolved gases provides a direct measurement, it is technically challenging to obtain, is painful to the patient, and can be time and resource intensive. Pulse oximetry allows for non-invasive, real-time, continuous monitoring of the percent of hemoglobin molecules that are saturated with oxygen, and usually closely predicts the arterial oxygen content. As such, it was particularly concerning when patients with severe COVID-19 requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation within one of our intensive care units were observed to have significant discordance between their predicted arterial oxygen content via pulse oximetry and their actual measured oxygen content. We offer these preliminary observations along with our speculative causes as a timely, urgent clinical need. In the setting of a COVID-19 intensive care unit, entering a patient room to obtain a fresh arterial blood gas sample not only takes exponentially longer to do given the time required for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), it involves the consumption of already sparce PPE, and it increases the risk of viral exposure to the nurse, physician, or respiratory therapist entering the room to obtain the sample. As such, technology similar to pulse oximetry which can be applied to a patients finger, and then continuously monitored from outside the room is essential in preventing a particularly dangerous situation of unrealized hypoxia in this critically-ill patient population. Additionally, it would appear that conventional two-wavelength pulse oximetry may not accurately predict the arterial oxygen content of blood in these patients. This discordance of oxygenation measurements poses a critical concern in the evaluation and management of the acute hypoxemic respiratory failure seen in patients with COVID-19.","output":"An Evolving Clinical Need: Discordant Oxygenation Measurements of Intubated COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The structure of the HIV transmission networks can be dictated by just a few individuals. Public health intervention, such as ensuring people living with HIV adhere to antiretroviral therapy and remain virally-suppressed, can help control the spread of the virus. However, such intervention requires utilizing limited public health resource allocations. Determining which individuals are most at risk of transmitting HIV could allow public health officials to focus their limited resources on these individuals. SETTING Molecular epidemiology can help prioritize people living with HIV by patterns of transmission inferred from their sampled viral sequences. Such prioritization has been previously suggested and performed by monitoring cluster growth. In this paper, we introduce ProACT (Prioritization using AnCesTral edge lengths), a phylogenetic approach for prioritizing individuals living with HIV. METHODS ProACT starts from a phylogeny inferred from sequence data and orders individuals according to their terminal branch length, breaking ties using ancestral branch lengths. We evaluated ProACT on a real dataset of 926 HIV-1 subtype B pol data obtained in San Diego between 2005 and 2014, and a simulation datasets modelling the same epidemic. Prioritization methods are compared by their ability to predict individuals who transmit most after the prioritization. RESULTS Across all simulation conditions and most real data sampling conditions, ProACT outperformed monitoring cluster growth for multiple metrics of prioritization efficacy. CONCLUSION The simple strategy used by ProACT improves the effectiveness of prioritization compared to state-of-the-art methods that rely on monitoring the growth of transmission clusters defined based on genetic distance.","output":"HIV Care Prioritization using Phylogenetic Branch Length."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered global energy consumption, particularly affecting investment in renewable energy projects In India, strict shelter-in-place orders enforced during March 2020 have since led to a considerable change in public and private sector investments in planned renewable energy installations In this paper, we attempt to highlight trends in energy consumption and installed renewable energy capacity noted in India during a period concurrent with the shelter-in-place orders We discuss recent policy measures and additions to installed renewable energy capacity, and propose key policy recommendations that may help the sector adopt a growth trajectory similar to one noted pre-pandemic This paper is organized into four main parts In the first section, we draw focus to India's renewable energy policies and pay special emphasis on recent interventions and campaigns targeted towards achieving high growth rates in the sector We briefly discuss the need for effective public-private partnerships in order to meet these targets In the second part, we quantitatively characterise the growth of renewables in India We present an overview of several mechanisms and missions the government has launched in line with their policy to mitigate the environmental impact of India's energy mix In the third part, we analyse the decrease in electricity demand in India from 24 March to 30 June 2020, a period concurrent with shelter-at-home orders issued by the Government We also characterise changes in installed renewable energy capacity between March to December 2016C2020 to provide causal evidence of the effect of the pandemic on the growth of renewables In this section, we also compile and analyse data on state-wise stressed assets across renewable energy generators in the country Lastly, in the fourth and final portion of this paper, we highlight policy recommendations that may help the sector overcome logistical and financial bottlenecks in the short-term We do this with the hope of outlining key measures that decision makers may employ to achieve pre-COVID sectoral growth in the long term Our recommendations cover three different policy instruments: investment subsidies, operational subsidies, and recommendations for DISCOMs","output":"Reduced renewable energy stability in India following COVID-19: Insights and key policy recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To compare the practicability (usability and satisfaction) and analytical performances of VitaPCR&#8482; Flu A&B Assay (Credo Diagnostics Biomedical Pte.

We present ICCs from a school-based cRCT assessing the effectiveness of a meningococcal B vaccine (Bexsero, GlaxoSmithKline) on reducing oropharyngeal carriage of Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) in 34,489 adolescents from 237 schools in South Australia in 2017/2018. We also explore the contribution of shared behaviours and characteristics to these ICCs. The ICC for carriage of disease-causing Nm genogroups (primary outcome) pre-vaccination was 0.004 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.007) and for all Nm was 0.007 (95%CI: 0.004, 0.011). Adjustment for social behaviours and personal characteristics reduced the ICC for carriage of disease-causing and all Nm genogroups by 25% (to 0.003) and 43% (to 0.004), respectively. ICCs are also reported for risk factors here, which may be outcomes in future research. Higher ICCs were observed for susceptibility and/or exposure variables related to Nm carriage (having a cold, spending 1 night out socializing or kissing 1 person in the previous week). In metropolitan areas, nights out socializing was a highly correlated behaviour. By contrast, smoking was a highly correlated behaviour in rural areas.

Although calorie restriction and exercise are the most common therapies for obesity or overweight, it is unclear what kind of supplementation these people should take or how much exercise they should perform. Hence, in this study, we examined the effect of 8 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with spirulina supplementation on the humoral immunity, cardio-respiratory fitness, and body composition of overweight and obese women. The results demonstrated that spirulina supplementation with HIIT not only decreased fat free mass but also boosted immunoglobin-A, which plays an important role in the immune system. ABSTRACT: Our study examined the effect of 8 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and spirulina supplementation on the humoral immunity, cardio-respiratory fitness, and body composition of overweight and obese women. Thirty sedentary women (height: 161.7  2.8 cm, body mass: 75.8  8.4 kg, body mass index [BMI]: 28.8  2.5 kg/m(2), age: 25.1  6.7 years) were divided into three groups: placebo with HIIT group, spirulina group (SG), or combined group (CG). Exercise groups performed HIIT for 8 weeks, with three sessions per week and four to seven repetitions in each session of 30 s running and 30 s walking; the intensity was established at 90% of the maximum heart rate. Supplementation groups received 6 g of spirulina powder per day. Fasting blood samples were collected before and after 8 weeks to determine the concentrations of immunoglobulins (IgA and IgG). There was a significant group-by-time interaction for fat free mass (FFM; p = 0.001, f = 8.52, p(2) = 0.39) and IgA (p = 0.036, f = 3.86, p(2) = 0.22). The post hoc analysis revealed that CG reduced FFM significantly (p = 0.012, g = ?0.55) after training. CG and SG showed significantly greater IgA concentrations after 8 weeks (p = 0.02, g = 0.70 and p = 0.001, g = 0.34, respectively).

In this scenario, clinicians may focus on documenting widely reported symptoms that indicate a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, albeit at the expense of infrequently reported symptoms.

If done at scale, a combination of data from the EHR and recordings of clinic visits can be used to power NLP and machine learning models, thus rapidly generating a clinical phenotype of COVID-19. We propose the generation of a pipeline extending from audio or video recordings of clinic visits to establish a model that factors in clinical symptoms and predict COVID-19 incidence.

It was conducted based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). Criteria for eligibility were all published population-based primary literature in PubMed interface and the Science Direct, dealing with incubation period of COVID-19, written in English, since December 2019 to December 2020. We estimated the mean of the incubation period using meta-analysis, taking into account between-study heterogeneity, and the analysis with moderator variables. RESULTS: This review included 42 studies done predominantly in China. The mean and median incubation period were of maximum 8 days and 12 days respectively. In various parametric models, the 95th percentiles were in the range 10.3C16 days. The highest 99th percentile would be as long as 20.4 days. Out of the 10 included studies in the meta-analysis, 8 were conducted in China, 1 in Singapore, and 1 in Argentina. The pooled mean incubation period was 6.2 (95% CI 5.4, 7.0) days. The heterogeneity (I(2) 77.1%; p < 0.001) was decreased when we included the study quality and the method of calculation used as moderator variables (I(2) 0%). The mean incubation period ranged from 5.2 (95% CI 4.4 to 5.9) to 6.65 days (95% CI 6.0 to 7.2).

Methods Transparent collagen plates were prepared in dry and wet conditions. Physical properties of collagen plates and porcine colon tissue were examined using a rheometer. Adjustable and fixed-type circular staplers were applied on the collagen plates and the gap distance and compressive pressure were measured during anvil approximation. Tissue injury was evaluated using a compression injury scale. Compression properties were accessed to optimal or overcompression based on gap distance. Results Unacceptable injuries were rarely observed on the dry collagens, regardless of compression device. In the adjustable compression, the compressibility ratio was similar between dry and wet collagen. Overcompression and unacceptable injury increased on the wet collagens. In the fixed compression, the compressibility ratio increased significantly and unacceptable injuries were observed in more than 50% of wet collagens. Peak pressure was significantly higher in the fixed-compression types than those of adjustable type. On bivariate correlation analysis, fixed-compression type and wet collagens were respectively associated with overcompression. On multivariate analysis, edematous collagen condition was the most important risk factor and proximal anvil side, fixed compression type, and overcompression were also independent risk factors for unacceptable compression injury. Conclusion In the edematous tissue condition, unintentional overcompression could be increased and result in tissue injury on the compression line of the circular stapler.","output":"Compression injury of the circular stapler for gastrointestinal end-to-end anastomosis: preliminary in-vitro study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: It has been almost 2 years since the first reports on cutaneous manifestations of COVID\\\\19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The main chemical components and targets of Ligusticum wallichii were obtained from TCMSP, Swiss Target Prediction and Phammapper databases, and the targets were uniformly regulated in the Uniprot protein database after the combination. The main targets of IPF were obtained through Gencards, OMIM, TTD and DRUGBANK databases, and protein interaction analysis was carried out by using String to build PPI network. Metascape platform was used to analyze its involved biological processes and pathways, and Cytoscape3.8.2 software was used to construct component-IPF target-pathway network. And molecular docking verification was conducted through Auto Dock software. RESULTS: The active ingredients of Ligusticum wallichii were Myricanone, Wallichilide, Perlolyrine, Senkyunone, Mandenol, Sitosterol and FA. The core targets for it to improve IPF were MAPK1, MAPK14, SRC, BCL2L1, MDM2, PTGS2, TGFB2, F2, MMP2, MMP9, and so on. The molecular docking verification showed that the molecular docking affinity of the core active compounds in Ligusticum wallichii (Myricanone, wallichilide, Perlolyrine) was <0 with MAPK1, MAPK14, and SRC. Perlolyrine has the strongest molecular docking ability, and its docking ability with SRC (?6.59 kJ/mol) is particularly prominent.

Study design Children aged 24 months on October 31 who were hospitalized or had outpatient visits for respiratory illness and/or fever during OctoberCMay 2001C2008 in 3 US counties were included. PZ receipt was obtained from parent interviews and medical records among children subsequently infected with RSV. Archived nasal/throat swab specimens were tested for RSV by real-time RT-PCR. The coding region of the PZ binding site of the RSV F protein was sequenced using both Sanger and pyrosequencing methods. Results Of 8762 enrolled children, 375 (4.3%) were tested for RSV and had a history of PZ receipt, of which 56 (14.9%) were RSV-positive and 45 of these had available archived specimens.

Despite growing concern about occupational burnout among CRAs in China, little is known about this topic. AIMS We evaluated the factors associated with occupational burnout among CRAs in China and assessed the extent and nature of this syndrome in order to develop effective countermeasures. METHODS In October 2020, we collected data from a convenience sample of 438 CRAs from 26 major cities across China using a custom-designed questionnaire. We evaluated their psychopathological status and degree of occupational burnout based on the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Factors associated with burnout were identified using the Wilcoxon rank test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman's rank correlation and multivariable ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS Of the 438 CRAs analyzed, 82% showed signs of occupational burnout, with a large proportion experiencing moderate burnout (50%). Burnout in Chinese CRAs manifested as emotional exhaustion (77%), depersonalization (66%) and low sense of accomplishment (15%). The severity of burnout was significantly affected by mode of working (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-2.34), average number of working hours per week (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14-2.46), support provided by the hospital (OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.40-6.99) and likelihood of receiving a promotion (OR 4.05, 95% CI 1.34-12.22) (all P < 0.05).

Respondents with tertiary level of education and those with partners had higher score (71.7% and 70.28% respectively) for awareness on mental healthcare. Respondents with primary education level and individuals that were single had higher score (46.98% and 43.72% respectively) for anxiety. Respondents with primary education level and those living with partners had higher mean score (56.44% and 56.21% respectively) for anger. Respondents with no formal education and those who had lost partners had higher mean score (32.11% and 30.50% respectively) for depression. Individuals without formal educational and primary education were observed to have a negative correlation (r 2 = 47.4 and 6.4% respectively) with awareness on mental healthcare, and the no formal group had positive correlation with anger and depression (r 2 =1.9 and 0.3% respectively), while other groups were negatively correlated (r 2 =10.1%). The group of single individuals had a negative correlation with awareness on mental healthcare, anger and depression (r 2 =1.9, 0.8 and 0.3% respectively), and a positive correlation with anxiety (r 2 =3.9%).

Therefore, we suggest policy maker pay more attention to social transformation, through proper engagement of low income earners.","output":"COVID-19-related mental health burden and reduced awareness of mental healthcare services in low income earners of Western Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anethole has possessed anti-inflammatory and antioxidant responses in numerous studies. Oxidative stress has a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of colitis. The current study is designed to determine the effect of anethole on acetic acid-induced colitis in mice in view of its possible anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In this study, 48 mice were grouped into 6 groups (n = 8), and colitis was induced with 0.2 ml of 7% acetic acid. Mice received intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 7 constant days normal saline and/or anethole at doses of 31.25, 62.5, 125, and 250 mg/kg, respectively. After treatments, the colon was dissected out, and histopathological changes, expression of inflammatory genes (IL-1, TNF-, and TLR4), and evaluation of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were assessed. The results showed that colitis is associated with edema and inflammatory responses in all layers and severe damage to the epithelium of the colon. Colitis causes a decrease in TAC, an increase in MDA levels, and an increase in inflammatory genes in the colon. Findings determined that anethole ameliorated the adverse effects of acetic acid-induced colitis in the colon. It is concluded that anethole, partially at least, possessed protective effects in acetic acid-induced colitis in mice through attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammatory response.","output":"Anethole Ameliorates Acetic Acid-Induced Colitis in Mice: Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People with dementia occupy 25% of the hospital beds.

Mechanisms remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to report the demographics, angiographic findings, and in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 ACS patients and compare these with preCCOVID-19 cohorts. METHODS: From March 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020, data from 55 international centers were entered into a prospective, COVID-ACS Registry. Patients were COVID-19 positive (or had a high index of clinical suspicion) and underwent invasive coronary angiography for suspected ACS. Outcomes were in-hospital major cardiovascular events (all-cause mortality, reCmyocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, unplanned revascularization, or stent thrombosis). Results were compared with national preCCOVID-19 databases (MINAP [Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project] 2019 and BCIS [British Cardiovascular Intervention Society] 2018 to 2019). RESULTS: In 144 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 121 nonCST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) patients, symptom-to-admission times were significantly prolonged (COVID-STEMI vs. BCIS: median 339.0 min vs. 173.0 min; p < 0.001; COVID NSTE-ACS vs. MINAP: 417.0 min vs. 295.0 min; p = 0.012). Mortality in COVID-ACS patients was significantly higher than BCIS/MINAP control subjects in both subgroups (COVID-STEMI: 22.9% vs. 5.7%; p < 0.001; COVID NSTE-ACS: 6.6% vs. 1.2%; p < 0.001), which remained following multivariate propensity analysis adjusting for comorbidities (STEMI subgroup odds ratio: 3.33 [95% confidence interval: 2.04 to 5.42]).

In the present study, volume and shape of the basal ganglia was examined in people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder relative to healthy controls and hypothesized that unique neuroanatomical differences would be observed in each patient group. Magnetic resonance 1.5T images were obtained from schizophrenia (n = 47), schizoaffective disorder (n = 15), and from healthy control (n = 42) participants, matched for age, gender, parental socioeconomic status, and race. The caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus were characterized using high-dimensional brain mapping procedures (Csernansky et al., 2004b). Results revealed significant shape deformations between schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder that also differed from control subjects. Relative to schizophrenia, schizoaffective subjects showed exaggerated inward deformations indicative of localized volume loss in subregions of the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus (all p < 0.001). These shape features correlated with mental flexibility and negative symptoms in schizophrenia (all p < 0.05), but not schizoaffective disorder.

However, the role of foreign direct investment that highlights either pollution haven or halo hypothesis and pivotal role of domestic credit to private sector in an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) environment is lacking in the extant literature. To this end, this study used augmented mean group (AMG) and method of moment quantile regression (MM-QR) approaches to explore the nexus between per capital income and its square, tourism, foreign direct investment, domestic credit to private sector and CO(2) emission. Empirical results show that tourism had a negative significant relationship with CO(2) emission. Furthermore, income on the other hand had positive relationship with emissions while its square had negative relationship with emissions. This result also shows the presence of EKC indicating the inverted U-shaped curve. FDI has shown a positive significant relationship with pollution which indicates the pollutant haven hypothesis (PHH), and credit to private sector shows a positive relationship with CO(2) emission. On the causality analysis from Dumitrescu and Hurlin panel causality test, there was a bi-directional causality between: tourism and CO(2) emission, per capital income and CO(2) emission as well as domestic credit and CO(2) emission. From these outcomes, it shows that tourism development is not detrimental to environmental quality in the Mediterranean region investigated.

Electronic health information exchange (HIE) is a recommended practice to improve care coordination and encourage patient engagement in services, but it remains underutilized in depression care. Understanding factors affecting acceptance and adoption of this technology among underrepresented patient populations is needed to increase dissemination of HIE within mental health treatment. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to identify patient barriers and facilitators towards the acceptance of HIE within the context of depression treatment and to examine how HIE impacts depression-related care coordination and patient activation. DESIGN: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 27 patients. PARTICIPANTS: Respondents were English-speaking adults (> 18) receiving depression treatment within a large, safety-net primary care clinic. APPROACH: A grounded theory approach was used to code and analyze data for emergent themes. Thematic analysis was guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, a leading informatics theory used to predict end-user adoption of technology. KEY RESULTS: Respondents reported that HIE made depression care more convenient, transparent, and trustworthy. Though respondents desired greater access to their health records, stigma surrounding depression inhibited acceptance of electronic communication and information sharing. Confusing electronic interface also diminished perceived benefits of HIE. CONCLUSION(S): Respondents desire greater transparency in their depression care. While HIE was perceived to improve the overall quality of depression care, stigma associated with mental illness undermined more robust adoption of this technology among underserved populations.

This study aimed to investigate the association between PEEP-induced lung overdistension/recruitment and VQMatch by electrical impedance tomography (EIT). METHODS: The study was conducted prospectively on 30 adult mechanically ventilated patients: 18/30 with ARDS and 12/30 with high risk for ARDS. EIT measurements were performed at zero end-expiratory pressures (ZEEP) and subsequently at high (12C15 cmH(2)O) PEEP. The number of overdistended pixels over the number of recruited pixels (O/R ratio) was calculated, and the patients were divided into low O/R (O/R ratio < 15%) and high O/R groups (O/R ratio  15%). The global inhomogeneity (GI) index was calculated to evaluate the ventilation distribution. Lung perfusion image was calculated from the EIT impedanceCtime curves caused by 10 ml 10% NaCl injection during a respiratory pause (> 8 s). DeadSpace(%), Shunt(%), and VQMatch(%) were calculated based on lung EIT perfusion and ventilation images. RESULTS: Increasing PEEP resulted in recruitment mainly in dorsal regions and overdistension mainly in ventral regions. VQMatch(%) (VQMatch(%) at high PEEP minus that at ZEEP) was significantly correlated with recruited pixels (r = 0.468, P = 0.009), overdistended pixels (r = ? 0.666, P < 0.001), O/R ratio (r = ? 0.686, P < 0.001), and SpO(2) (r = 0.440, P = 0.015). Patients in the low O/R ratio group (14/30) had significantly higher Shunt(%) and lower VQMatch(%) than those in the high O/R ratio group (16/30) at ZEEP but not at high PEEP. Comparable DeadSpace(%) was found in both groups. A high PEEP caused a significant improvement of VQMatch(%), DeadSpace(%), Shunt(%), and GI in the low O/R ratio group, but not in the high O/R ratio group. Using O/R ratio of 15% resulted in a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 100% for an increase of VQMatch(%) > 20% in response to high PEEP. CONCLUSIONS: Change of ventilationCperfusion matching was associated with regional overdistention and recruitment induced by PEEP.

Here we provide a quantitative analysis of the symptom heterogeneity and disorder comorbidity across a sample of 107,349 adult individuals (aged 18C85 years) from 8 English-speaking countries. Data were acquired using the Mental Health Quotient, an anonymous, online, self-report tool that comprehensively evaluates symptom profiles across 10 common mental health disorders. Dissimilarity of symptom profiles within and between disorders was then computed. We found a continuum of symptom prevalence rather than a clear separation of normal and disordered. While 58.7% of those with 5 or more clinically significant symptoms did not map to the diagnostic criteria of any of the 10 DSM-5 disorders studied, those with symptom profiles that mapped to at least one disorder had, on average, 20 clinically significant symptoms. Within this group, the heterogeneity of symptom profiles was almost as high within a disorder label as between 2 disorder labels and not separable from randomly selected groups of individuals with at least one of any of the 10 disorders. Overall, these results quantify the scale of misalignment between clinical symptom profiles and DSM-5 disorder labels and demonstrate that DSM-5 disorder criteria do not separate individuals from random when the complete mental health symptom profile of an individual is considered.

Trained on potentially sensitive datasets, machine learning models have been shown to leak information about individuals in the dataset as well as global dataset information. We here take research in dataset property inference attacks one step further by proposing a new attack against ML models: a dataset correlation inference attack, where an attacker's goal is to infer the correlation between input variables of a model. We first show that an attacker can exploit the spherical parametrization of correlation matrices, to make an informed guess. This means that using only the correlation between the input variables and the target variable, an attacker can infer the correlation between two input variables much better than a random guess baseline. We propose a second attack which exploits the access to a machine learning model using shadow modeling to refine the guess. Our attack uses Gaussian copula-based generative modeling to generate synthetic datasets with a wide variety of correlations in order to train a meta-model for the correlation inference task. We evaluate our attack against Logistic Regression and Multi-layer perceptron models and show it to outperform the model-less attack. Our results show that the accuracy of the second, machine learning-based attack decreases with the number of variables and converges towards the accuracy of the model-less attack. However, correlations between input variables which are highly correlated with the target variable are more vulnerable regardless of the number of variables.

Comparative data between orthopaedic surgery and other specialties are needed to help identify solutions to closing the diversity gap. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Which surgical specialties have the greatest representation of women residents and residents from URM groups? (2) How have the proportions of women residents and residents from URM groups changed across the surgical specialties during the past decade? METHODS: This was a retrospective evaluation of a large, longitudinally maintained survey database. Resident data by gender and ethnicity were retrieved from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Data Resource Books for the 2011 to 2012 through 2019 to 2020 academic years. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education database is updated annually; thus, it is the most up-to-date and complete database available for gender and ethnicity data for all surgical residents. Data were obtained and analyzed for seven different surgical specialties: orthopaedic surgery, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, general surgery, and urology. No sampling was necessary, and thus descriptive statistics of the data were completed. Because the entire population of residents was included for the period of time in question, no statistical comparisons were made, and the reported differences represent absolute differences between the groups for these periods. Linear regression analyses were performed to estimate the annual growth rates of women residents and residents from URM groups in each specialty. RESULTS: Among the seven surgical specialties, representation of women residents increased from 28% (4640 of 16,854) or residents in 2012 to 33% (6879 of 20,788) in 2020. Orthopaedic surgery had the lowest representation of women residents every year, with women residents comprising 16% of residents (700 of 4342) in 2020. Among the seven surgical specialties, representation of residents from URM groups increased from 8.1% (1362 of 16,854) in 2012 to 9.7% (2013 of 20,788) in 2020. In 2020, the representation of residents from URM groups in orthopaedic surgery was 7.7% (333 of 4342). In 2020, general surgery had the highest representation of women residents (42%; 3696 of 8809) as well as residents from URM groups (12%; 1065 of 8809). Plastic surgery (1.46% per year) and general surgery (0.95% per year) had larger annual growth rates of women residents than the other specialties did. In each surgical specialty, the annual growth rate of residents from URM groups was insignificant. CONCLUSION: During the past decade, there was only a small increase in the representation of women in orthopaedic surgery, while the representation of people from URM groups did not change. In contrast, by 2020, general surgery had become the most diverse among the seven surgical specialties. To increase diversity in our field, we need to evaluate and implement some of the effective interventions that have helped general surgery become the diverse surgical specialty that it is today. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: General surgery has substantially reduced gender and ethnic disparities that existed in the past, while those in orthopaedic surgery still persist. General surgery residencies have implemented a holistic review of resident applications and longitudinal mentoring programs to successfully address these disparities. Orthopaedic surgery programs should consider placing less emphasis on United States Medical Licensing Examination score thresholds and more weight on applicants' non-academic attributes, and put more efforts into targeted longitudinal mentorship programs, some of which should be led by non-minority faculty.","output":"What is the Trend in Representation of Women and Under-represented Minorities in Orthopaedic Surgery Residency?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accounts of the numerous negative effects caused by COVID\\\\19 are pervasive, but few perspectives have identified any positive impacts of this massive societal shift.

Technology helps people schedule meetings as remote videoconferencing sessions rather than face-to-face interactions. Psychologists are in high demand because of an increase in stress as a result of COVID-19, and videoconferencing provides an opportunity for mental health clinicians to treat current and new referrals. However, shifting treatment from face-to-face to videoconferencing is not simple: both psychologists and clients miss in-person information cues, including body language. OBJECTIVE: This review proposes a new theoretical framework to guide the design of future studies examining the impact of a computer as a mediator of psychologist-client relationships and the influence of videoconferencing on the relationship process. METHODS: We conducted a literature review including studies focused on communication and key concepts of the therapeutic relationship and therapeutic alliance. RESULTS: Studies have reported that clients are generally satisfied with videoconference therapy in terms of the relationship with their therapists and the establishment of the therapeutic alliance. Conversely, studies indicate that psychologists continue to highlight difficulties in establishing the same quality of therapeutic relationship and therapeutic alliance. The contrasting experiences might underlie the differences in the type of emotional and cognitive work required by both actors in any therapy session; furthermore, the computer seems to take part in their interaction not only as a vehicle to transmit messages but also as an active part of the communication. A new model of interaction and relationship is proposed, taking into account the presence of the computer, along with further hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to consider the computer as having an active role in the client-psychologist relationship; thus, it is a third party to the communication that either assists or interferes with the interaction between psychologists and clients.","output":"A Perspective on Client-Psychologist Relationships in Videoconferencing Psychotherapy: Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perioperative care for cardiac surgery is undergoing rapid evolution.

Results were analyzed in a multivariable model accounting for age, sex and time since the administration of the second dose of the vaccine. RESULTS: Sex and time since the second dose had little association with the antibody titres. Age, however, was highly relevant: measurable antibody levels were present in about 90% of individuals below the age of 50, but antibody production after BBIBP-CorV vaccination was strongly reduced with increasing age. A large number of elderly subjects, reaching 25% at 60 years, and up to 50% at ages over 80, were found not to produce any protective antibody.

Cox proportional hazards and competing risks analyses were conducted to analyze the impact of corticosteroids on mortality and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance, respectively. We performed a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to control confounding factors.RESULTSOf 774 eligible patients, 409 patients received corticosteroids, with a median time from hospitalization to starting corticosteroids of 1.0 day (IQR 0.0-3.0 days) . As compared with usual care, treatment with corticosteroids was associated with increased rate of myocardial (15.6% vs. 10.4%, P = 0.041) and liver injury (18.3% vs. 9.9%, P = 0.001), of shock (22.0% vs. 12.6%, P < 0.001), of need for mechanical ventilation (38.1% vs. 19.5%, P < 0.001), and increased rate of 28-day all-cause mortality (44.3% vs. 31.0%, P < 0.001). After PS matching, corticosteroid therapy was associated with 28-day mortality (adjusted HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01-2.13, P = 0.045).

A Quality Improvement Project was designed to address communication and safety concerns from the on-call team at the Bethlem Royal psychiatric hospital out-of-hours through the introduction of weekend safety huddles.MethodDaily weekend safety huddles were introduced to improve communication regarding workload, acuity, new admissions, seclusion reviews, deteriorating patients;and to improve team cohesiveness and trainee support out-of-hours.The QIP team involved the deputy medical director, the associate director for speciality units, consultants, the college tutor, specialty registrars and core psychiatry trainees. Prior to initiating the huddles, the QIP team met to decide which specialties to involve, to agree on an agenda and liaise with other sites regarding existing huddles. Once the huddles began in April 2020, the team met periodically to agree next courses of action and to troubleshoot. The huddles initially involved acute services and eventually included CAMHS, Forensic, Older Adults, Specialist Units, all on-call consultants, the on-call registrar, two core trainees, the psychiatric liaison manager and the duty senior nurse.ResultData were gathered throughout the QIP using Likert scale surveys which were sent to all junior doctors on the out-of-hours rota. Paper surveys were used initially but were later replaced with Microsoft Forms to ensure anonymity.The percentage of respondents who answered most of the time or all of the time increased across all parameters when comparing data from before and after implementation of the safety huddles.These results included improvement in: understanding of workload and acuity (9% before vs 69% after), discussion of new admissions on site (4% before vs 90% after), discussion of patients with deteriorating mental health (35% before vs 90% after) and physical health (22% before vs 83% after), understanding of number of patients in seclusion (61% before vs 93% after) and feeling part of a cohesive on-call team (17% before vs 86% after). In addition, the results suggested a reduction in frequency of safety concerns on site (83% answered at least sometimes before vs 62% after).ConclusionThe results of the final survey demonstrated a measurable and positive impact on communications between the out-of-hours team, improved team cohesiveness and a reduction in safety concerns.

Consequently, this study aims to provide up-to-date hospitalization trends for several conditions including cardiovascular, psychiatry, oncology and surgery cases in both the in- and outpatient setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using claims data of 86 Helios hospitals in Germany, consecutive cases with an in- or outpatient hospital admission between March 13, 2020 (the begin of the \\"protection\\" stage of the German pandemic plan) and December 10, 2020 (end of study period) were analyzed and compared to a corresponding period covering the same weeks in 2019. Cause-specific hospitalizations were defined based on the primary discharge diagnosis according to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) or German procedure classification codes for cardiovascular, oncology, psychiatry and surgery cases. Cumulative hospitalization deficit was computed as the difference between the expected and observed cumulative admission number for every week in the study period, expressed as a percentage of the cumulative expected number. The expected admission number was defined as the weekly average during the control period. A total of 1,493,915 hospital admissions (723,364 during the study and 770,551 during the control period) were included. At the end of the study period, total cumulative hospitalization deficit was -10% [95% confidence interval -10; -10] for cardiovascular and -9% [-10; -9] for surgical cases, higher than -4% [-4; -3] in psychiatry and 4% [4; 4] in oncology cases. The utilization of inpatient care and subsequent hospitalization deficit was similar in trend with some variation in magnitude between cardiovascular (-12% [-13; -12]), psychiatry (-18% [-19; -17]), oncology (-7% [-8; -7]) and surgery cases (-11% [-11; -11]). Similarly, cardiovascular and surgical outpatient cases had a deficit of -5% [-6; -5] and -3% [-4; -3], respectively. This was in contrast to psychiatry (2% [1; 2]) and oncology cases (21% [20; 21]) that had a surplus in the outpatient sector. While in-hospital mortality, was higher during the Covid-19 pandemic in cardiovascular (3.9 vs. 3.5%, OR 1.10 [95% CI 1.06-1.15], P<0.01) and in oncology cases (4.5 vs. 4.3%, OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.01-1.11], P<0.01), it was similar in surgical (0.9 vs. 0.8%, OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.00-1.13], P = 0.07) and in psychiatry cases (0.4 vs. 0.5%, OR 1.01 [95% CI 0.78-1.31], P<0.95). CONCLUSIONS: There have been varying changes in care pathways and in-hospital mortality in different disciplines during the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany. Despite all the inherent and well-known limitations of claims data use, this data may be used for health care surveillance as the pandemic continues worldwide. While this study provides an up-to-date analysis of utilization of hospital care in the largest German hospital network, short- and long-term consequences are unknown and deserve further studies.","output":"Utilization of in- and outpatient hospital care in Germany during the Covid-19 pandemic insights from the German-wide Helios hospital network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sample pooling strategy was intended to determine the optimal parameters for group testing of pooled specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and process them without significant loss of test usability.

Out of 16 tested pools, 12 were positive with cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0.5 and 3.01 Ct of the original individual specimens. The analysis of 112 specimens determined that 12 pools were positive, followed by identification of 6 positive individual specimens among the 112 tested. This testing was accomplished with the use of 16 extractions/PCR tests, resulting in saving of 96 reactions but adding the 40 centrifugal filters.

We will use national administrative data birth cohorts, including data from all children born in England in 2005C2014 and in Scotland in 1997C2020, created via linkage between civil registration, maternity and hospital admission data sets. We will further enhance these cohorts via linkage to census data on housing conditions and socioeconomic position and small area-level data on ambient air pollution and building characteristics. We will use time-to-event analyses to examine the association between air pollution, housing characteristics and the risk of RTI admissions in children, calculate population attributable fractions for ambient air pollution and housing characteristics, and use causal mediation analyses to explore the mechanisms through which housing and air pollution influence the risk of infant RTI admission. ETHICS, EXPECTED IMPACT AND DISSEMINATION: To date, we have obtained approval from six ethics and information governance committees in England and two in Scotland.

Viral entry by ACE-2 receptor and an excessive activation of the immune system are key to understand both incidence and severity of disease. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) represents a special condition associated with an inordinate response of the immune system to external agents. IBD treatments have been associated to an increased risk of bacterial and viral infections. This has raised the question of possible higher incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection in IBD patients. Several papers have been published during this year of pandemic to answer that question. Moreover, COVID-19 vaccination offers great promise in controlling infection in patients with IBD. Based on current evidence, patients with IBD do not have a higher incidence of COVID-19 than the general population, and they do not have worse disease evolution. Advanced age and presence of a greater number of comorbidities have been associated with worse outcomes, similar to the general population. Corticosteroids are associated to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, higher hospitalization rate and higher risk of severe COVID-19. 5-ASA / Sulfasalazine and Thiopurines have a possible increased risk of severe COVID-19, although studies are lacking. On the other hand, Anti-TNF may have a possible protective effect. It is recommended to maintain the treatment. Anti-IL-12/23, anti-integrins and tofacitinib have results comparable to anti-TNF.

U-Report is a mobile empowerment platform that connects young people all over the world to information that will change their lives and influence decisions. Previous studies of U-Reports effectiveness highlight strengths in the timeliness, low cost and high credibility for collecting and sending information, however they also highlight areas to improve on concerning data representation. EquityTool has developed a simpler approach to assess the wealth quintiles of respondents based on fewer questions derived from large household surveys such as Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). METHODS: The methodology of Equity Tool was adopted to assess the socio-economic profile of U-Reporters (ie, enrolled participants of U-Report) in Bangladesh. The RapidPro flow collected the survey responses and scored them against the DHS national wealth index using the EquityTool methodology. This helped placing each U-Reporter who completed all questions into the appropriate wealth quintile. RESULTS: With 19% of the respondents completing all questions, the respondents fell into all 5 wealth quintiles, with 79% in the top-two quintiles and only 21% in the lower-three resulting in an Equity Index of 53/100 where 100 is completely in line with Bangladesh equity distribution and 1 is the least in line. An equitable random sample of 1828 U-Reporters from among the regular and frequent respondents was subsequently created for future surveys and the sample has an Equity Index of 98/100. CONCLUSIONS: U-Report in Bangladesh does reach the poorest quintiles while the initial recruitment skews to respondents towards better off families. It is possible to create an equitable random sub-sample of respondents from all five wealth quintiles and thus process information and data for future surveys. Moving forward, U-Reporters from the poorly represented quintiles may be incentivized to recruit peers to increase equity and representation.

Early work focused on rapid sequencing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), subsequent in-vitro and in-silico work, along with greater understanding of the different clinical phases of the infection, have helped identify a catalogue of potential therapeutic agents requiring assessment. In a pandemic, there is a need to quickly identify efficacious treatments, and reject those that are non-beneficial or even harmful, using randomised clinical trials. Whilst each potential treatment could be investigated across multiple, separate, competing two-arm trials, this is a very inefficient process. Despite the very large numbers of interventional trials for COVID-19, the vast majority have not used efficient trial designs. Well conducted, adaptive platform trials utilising a multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) approach provide a solution to overcome limitations of traditional designs. The multi-arm element allows multiple different treatments to be investigated simultaneously against a shared, standard-of-care control arm. The multi-stage element uses interim analyses to assess accumulating data from the trial and ensure that only treatments showing promise continue to recruitment during the next stage of the trial. The ability to test many treatments at once and drop insufficiently active interventions significantly speeds up the rate at which answers can be achieved. This article provides an overview of the benefits of MAMS designs and successes of trials, which have used this approach to COVID-19. We also discuss international collaboration between trial teams, including prospective agreement to synthesise trial results, and identify the most effective interventions.

Objectives: The objective is to assess COVID-19-related fears and hopes in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods: REUMAVID is an international collaboration led by the Health & Territory Research group at the University of Seville, together with a multidisciplinary team including patient organisations and rheumatologists. This cross-sectional study consisting of an online survey gathering data from 1,800 patients with a diagnosis of 15 RMDs recruited by patient organisations in Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and, the United Kingdom. Data are collected in two phases, the first phase between April and July 2020, the second in 2021. Participants rated a series of fears (infection, medication consequences, lack of medication, impact on healthcare, job loss, civil disorder) on a Likert scale from zero (no concern at all) to five (extremely concerned) and their hopes (treatment/vaccine availability, going outside, travel, economic situation, treatment continuation, health status) on a Likert scale from zero (not hopeful at all) to five (extremely hopeful). The Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyse the different fears and hopes according to socio-demographics characteristics, disease and health status. Results: 1,800 patients participated in the first phase of REUMAVID. The most frequent RMDs group was inflammatory arthritis (75.4%), the mean age was 52.6 years and 80.1% were female. The most important fear for patients was the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare (3.1 out of 5), particularly for those younger in age (3.0 vs 3.2, p=0.004), female gender (3.2 vs 2. 9 of men, p=0.003), experiencing greater pain (3.1 vs 2.8, p=0.007), with higher risk of anxiety (3.3 vs 2.9 of without anxiety, p<0.001) and depression (3.3 vs 2.9 without depression, p<0.001). The possible impact of anti-rheumatic medication and the development of severe disease if they became infected with COVID-19,was mostly feared (2.8 out of 5), by those receiving biological therapy (3.1 vs 2.5 not biological therapy, p<0.001) or those with underlying anxiety (2.9 vs 2.6 without anxiety, p=0.007). The risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their condition (2.8 out of 5), was especially feared by those with vasculitis (3.2 out of 5), who were female (2.9 vs 2.5, p<0.001), using biologics (2. 9 vs 2.7 of no use, p=0.003), in greater pain (2.8 vs 2.4, p<0.001), with a risk of anxiety (3.0 vs 2.6 without anxiety, p=0.004), and risk of depression (3.0 vs 2.6 without depression, p<0.001). The major hopes were to be able to continue with their treatment as usual (3.7 out of 5), particularly for those taking biologics (3.8 vs 3.6 not taking, p=0.026), those with a better well-being (3.8 vs 3.6 with worse well-being, p=0.021), without anxiety (3.8 vs 3.6 at risk, p=0.004) and without depression (3.8 vs 3.6 at risk, p=0.007). Hoping not to become infected with COVID-19 and to maintain the same health status, were especially those who were older (3.6 vs 3.4 p=0.018) without anxiety (3.4 vs 3.6 at risk, p=0.005), and without depression (3.6 vs 3.4 at risk, p=0.006). Another important hope was the availability of a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, which was important for patients experiencing better well-being (3.3 vs 3.0 with worse well-being, p<0.001;Figure 1). Conclusion: The outstanding COVID-19-related fear expressed by European patients with RMDs was its impact on healthcare, while the greatest hope was to be able to continue treatment. Younger patients reported more fears while older patients were more hopeful. Those receiving biologics had greater fears and hopes associated with their treatment. In addition, patients at risk of mental disorders presented greater fears and less hopes.","output":"Fears and hopes during the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with rheumatic diseases Results from the reumavid study (PHASE 1)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the changes in physical inactivity of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic, with reference to their academic calendar. We used the daily step counts recorded by a smartphone application (iPhone Health App) from April 2020 to January 2021 (287 days) for 603 students. The data for 287 days were divided into five periods based on their academic calendar. The median value of daily step counts across each period was calculated. A k-means clustering analysis was performed to classify the 603 participants into subgroups to demonstrate the variability in the physical inactivity responses. The median daily step counts, with a 7-days moving average, dramatically decreased from 5,000 to 2,000 steps/day in early April. It remained at a lower level (less than 2,000 steps/day) during the first semester, then increased to more than 5,000 steps/day at the start of summer vacation. The clustering analysis demonstrated the variability in physical inactivity responses. Independent of the academic calendar, many inactive students did not recover their original daily step counts after its dramatic decrement.

This study examined whether the effectiveness of a semester-long credit-bearing course (GESS 1900), designed to educate first year college students about correlates of sexual violence in order to ultimately reduce campus sexual violence, differed by instructional mode. Two cohorts had completed GESS 1900 in-person when the COVID-19 pandemic struck;the third cohort was taught entirely online through synchronous instruction and with the exact same faculty instructors and course materials. This created a natural experiment to compare outcomes by instructional mode. We used a quasi-experimental, pretest?posttest survey design to compare in-person (n?=?92) versus online (n?=?45) GESS 1900 students across eight previously validated attitudinal measures related to gender, sexuality, and sexual violence. Results from a two-way, mixed-factorial ANOVA showed no significant differences related to instructional mode on seven of the eight measures. Findings further showed change over time in the desired direction for all students, regardless of instructional mode;many measures showed different starting points for the two groups, but similar rates of change over time. Thus both in-person and synchronous online versions of GESS 1900 were effective in shaping positive student outcomes.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of many designated infectious diseases monitored by the agency. During the present pandemic, patients who suspected COVID-19 were instructed to call the Coronavirus Consultation Center in the PHC prior to visiting the hospital. The aim of this study was to elucidate the differences in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity between PHC referrals and direct walk-in patients. METHODS: The present was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted at the Tokyo Metropolitan Hospital from March to September, 2020. Patients who received a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 were included and categorized into the PHC referral or direct walk-in groups. The outcomes included the total number of patients undergoing PCR tests and the percentage of PCR positivity in each group. RESULTS: We identified 1680 patients (781 PHC referred and 899 direct walk-in groups). The percentage of PCR positivity did not significantly differ between the PHC referral and direct walk-in groups during the first wave (30.5% vs. 29.2%; p = 0.78).

However, acceptance rates of such food swaps tend to be low. This study aimed to see whether framing lower-energy food swaps in terms of cost savings or social norms could improve likelihood of acceptance relative to framing swaps in terms of health benefits. Participants (n = 900) were asked to shop from a 12-item shopping list in a simulation online supermarket. When a target high-energy food was identified in the shopping basket at check-out, one or two lower-energy foods would be suggested as an alternative (a swap). Participants were randomised to only see messages emphasising health benefits (fewer calories), cost benefits (lower price) or social norms (others preferred this product). Data were analysed for 713 participants after exclusions. Participants were offered a mean of 3.17 swaps (SD = 1.50), and 12.91% of swaps were accepted (health = 14.31%, cost = 11.49%, social norms = 13.18%). Swap acceptance was not influenced by the specific swap frame used (all p > .170). Age was significantly and positively associated with swap acceptance (b = 0.02, SE = 0.00, p < .001), but was also associated with smaller decreases in energy change (b = 0.46, SE = .19, p = .014). Overall, offering swaps reduced both energy (kcal) per product (b = -9.69, SE = 4.07, p = .017) and energy (kcal) per shopping basket (t(712) = 11.09, p < .001) from pre- to post-intervention.

METHODS: A statistical classifier for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was trained using >4000 SARS-CoV-2Cassociated TCR sequences identified by comparing 784 cases and 2447 controls from 5 independent cohorts. The T-Detect? COVID assay applies this classifier to TCR repertoires sequenced from blood samples to yield a binary assessment of past infection. Assay performance was assessed in 2 retrospective (n = 346; n = 69) and 1 prospective cohort (n = 87) to determine positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA). PPA was compared to 2 commercial serology assays, and pathogen cross-reactivity was evaluated. RESULTS: T-Detect COVID demonstrated high PPA in individuals with prior RT-PCRCconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (97.1% 15 + days from diagnosis; 94.5% 15 + days from symptom onset), high NPA (100%) in presumed or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 negative cases, equivalent or higher PPA than 2 commercial serology tests, and no evidence of pathogen cross-reactivity.

Our results indicated that IL-6 levels were closely related to age, sex, body temperature, oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) of blood, and underlying diseases. As a stable indicator, the changes in IL-6 levels could indicate the inflammatory conditions during a viral infection. Two specific treatments, namely, tocilizumab and convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), decreased the level of IL-6 and relieved inflammation. CPT has an important role in the therapy for patients with critical COVID-19.

Sample selection Seven deceased individuals, who were admitted to the intensive care unit of the Hospital das Clnicas of the Medicine School of Sao Paulo University for invasive mechanical ventilation following a positive nasopharyngeal COVID-19 test result, underwent a post-mortem examination. Individuals with comorbidities were included. Exclusion criteria included a current smoking habit. Design A cross-sectional study involving a videoscope-guided autopsy to obtain a periodontal tissue sample. The plastic body wrapping was incised in the facial region, allowing the insertion of a video endoscope. A single sample of periodontal tissue (junctional epithelium, adjacent oral epithelium and underlying connective tissue) was obtained from the mesial interproximal papilla of the maxillary first molar (or if absent, the mesial tooth). The sample was cleaned using an enzymatic detergent (Riozyme) to mimic the effects of salivary flow and was collected using blunt dissection. The sample was divided into two samples for either histopathological analysis (haematoxylin and eosin stain) or molecular analysis. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was used to test for the presence of the envelope (E) gene of SARS-CoV-2. Data on comorbidities, smoking status, period of hospitalisation and time from onset of symptoms to death were also collected. Data analysis Descriptive analysis was performed and results were presented as a cross tabulation. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in samples was presented as the rRT-PCR cycle threshold value and the histopathological analysis results were Boolean (that is, presence/absence of vacuolisation or nuclear pleomorphism). Results A total of seven individuals were examined: four women and three men. The age range was 8-74 years and the range of periods between onset of symptoms and death was 10-31 days. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in five samples, with a mean cycle threshold of 31.38 (range 27.28-36.55). Nuclear pleomorphism and vacuolisation were found in two and three cases, respectively. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 genetic material was present in most periodontal tissue samples of individuals with COVID-19. The sample size, however, was small and only included severely ill individuals with prolonged periods of hospitalisation. Consequently, the applicability of the findings to the general population is limited.","output":"Is SARS-CoV-2 present in the periodontium?

This study assesses the effects of before and after the lockdown on functionality rates and quality of life (QoL) in patients with ALS. METHODS: A longitudinal observational study was conducted. Participants were assessed three times - early January (T0), before mandatory lockdown (T1), and during lockdown (T2) - using the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the ALS-Specific Quality of Life-Short Form (ALSSQOL-SF). The paired-sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included with a mean age of 56.9 (SD 14.2) years and mean symptoms onset of 27.1 (SD 14.3) months. ALSFRS-R mean scores decayed significantly over time when comparing T0-T1 (0.26  0.38) and T1-T2 (1.36  1.43) slopes (p < 0.001). Significant differences were observed between T1 and T2 for ALSSQOL-SF scores (115.31  17.06 vs. 104.31  20.65), especially in four specific domains, and FSS scores (34.06  16.84 vs. 40.09  17.63). Negative correlations between negative emotions and physical symptoms assessed by ALSSQOL-SF and FSS were found. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESULTS: Rehabilitation treatment routines in palliative care, such as physiotherapy and speech therapy, appear to mitigate the ALSFRS-R slope. Prolonged interruption of rehabilitation during the lockdown may have accelerated the functional decline in ALS patients' motor skills with as measured after 2 months by the ALSFRS-R in the limb and bulbar subscores, but not respiratory subscore. Other short-term effects, increased fatigue and negative impact on QoL, were also verified.","output":"Effects of prolonged interruption of rehabilitation routines in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) professionals must base their advice and interventions on evidence from science, in balance with their expertise, and with workers and other stakeholders values and preferences. Evidence-based professional practice is one of the remedies against misinformation creating confusion and distrust in the society. OBJECTIVES: To present, for OSH professionals, an overview and critical considerations about concepts, strategies, and tools needed for an accurate search for evidence-based information. METHODS: Information sources have been collected and discussed as a base for a documented vision on knowledge questions, online information sources, search engines, databases, and tools. RESULTS: Every search should start with a carefully phrased question. To help finding a reliable answer, potential evidence-based online sources are presented. Systematic reviews and original scientific articles are regarded as primary sources. Secondary and tertiary sources are discussed, such as practice guidelines, point-of-care summaries, advisory reports, quality websites or apps, Wikipedia, quality videos, and e-lessons. To find sources, adequate use of search engines and databases is required. Examples are discussed briefly, such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Virtual Health Library, NICE, Cochrane Library, Cochrane Work, Google (Scholar), and YouTube. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based practice in OSH must be stimulated, relying mainly on trusted online sources. The breadth of appropriate information sources is wider than described in most publications. Search engines facilitate the finding of quality reports, videos, e-courses, and websites. Such sources can be explored by well-trained professionals to complement the use of scientific articles, reviews, point-of-care summaries, and guidelines. Adequate use of online information sources requires awareness, motivation, and skills in professionals and educators. To date, the quality of skills in searching is low, thus a more adequate education is crucial. The quality of sources, search engines, and databases will be considered more thoroughly in another study.

METHODS A comprehensive PubMed search was performed for all relevant urological literature regarding LESS and adrenal surgery. In addition, experience gained at the authors' own institutions was considered. Clinical descriptive and comparative reports on LESS adrenal surgery procedures were analysed. RESULTS LESS adrenal surgery has been effectively performed for a number of indications. A wide variety of approaches (transperitoneal versus retroperitoneal, multichannel trocar versus multiple ports, trans- or extraumbilical) have been described. LESS adrenalectomy seems to be safe, taking more time than the standard laparoscopic counterpart but appears to offer the patient less postoperative discomfort. Technical difficulties of the procedure include the requirement of more time for adjustment of articulating instruments, longer 'one-handed' manipulation time, and a high peroperative tissue re-grasping rate.

The coinfection rate of M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) can reach 52% in some areas, but the effects of coinfection with different pathogens have not been clearly recognized. METHODS: The cases of MPP hospitalized in Beijing Childrens Hospital from 1/1/2014 to 12/31/2016 were screened. MPP patients coinfected with Human adenovirus (HAdV) were categorized into the research group. Patients with single M. pneumoniae infection were categorized into the control group, matching the research group by age and admission time with a ratio of 1:3. Clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and disease severity were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: A total of 2540 hospitalized MPP cases were screened in Beijing Childrens Hospital, among which thirty cases were enrolled in the research group and ninety cases were enrolled in the control group. The results indicated that patients in the research group had longer hospital stays, longer fever durations and a higher rate of dyspnea, as well as a larger proportion applications of oxygen therapy and noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). No obvious differences were found in lab examinations within the two groups. Regarding disease severity, the proportions of extremely severe pneumonia and severe disease defined by the clinical score system were higher in the research group than in the control group.

The orexin (Orx) system targets key components of this neurocircuitry in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). METHODS We assessed the contribution of intra-BLA Orx1 receptors (Orx1Rs) in the expression of stress-induced phenotypes of mice. Using the Stress Alternatives Model, a social stress paradigm that produces two behavioral phenotypes, we characterized the role of intra-BLA Orx1R using acute pharmacological inhibition (SB-674042) and genetic knockdown (AAV-U6-Orx1R-shRNA) strategies. RESULTS In the BLA, we observed that Orx1R (Hcrtr1) messenger RNA is predominantly expressed in CamKII+ glutamatergic neurons and rarely in GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acidergic) cells. While there is a slight overlap in Hcrtr1 and Orx2 receptor (Hcrtr2) messenger RNA expression in the BLA, we find that these receptors are most often expressed in separate cells. Antagonism of intra-BLA Orx1R after phenotype formation shifted behavioral expression from stress-sensitive (Stay) to stress-resilient (Escape) responses, an effect that was mimicked by genetic knockdown. Acute inhibition of Orx1R in the BLA also reduced contextual and cued fear freezing responses in Stay animals. This phenotype-specific behavioral change was accompanied by biased molecular transcription favoring Hcrtr2 over Hcrtr1 and Mapk3 over Plcb1 cell signaling cascades and enhanced Bdnf messenger RNA. CONCLUSIONS Functional reorganization of intra-BLA gene expression is produced by antagonism of Orx1R, which promotes elevated Hcrtr2, greater Mapk3, and increased Bdnf expression. Together, these results provide evidence for a receptor-driven mechanism that balances pro- and antistress responses within the BLA.","output":"Orexin 1 Receptor Antagonism in the Basolateral Amygdala Shifts the Balance From Pro- to Antistress Signaling and Behavior."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 preventions have cut access to routine medical care, especially for many chronic neurological disease patients This condition has especially promoted telemedicine use in providing healthcare This study aimed to review telemedicine use catalyzed by several regulations of the Indonesian Government and review 20 cases from Bethesda Hospital in Yogyakarta providing online consultation services Perceptions of experience on telemedicine were collected from neurological patients at the hospital who were asked about their impressions of consultations and pharmacy medication services, and their suggestions about the new system in outpatient consultations The regulations for telemedicine use are relevant because of these patients' risks related to comorbidities and treatments Of the 20 respondents involved in this study, 15 (75%) were satisfied with the service, 3 (15%) very satisfied, and 2 (10%) others neutral Most respondents suggest improvement of reimbursement (80%) and others suggest improvement on medications (10%) and services (10%) System and hospital requirements for telemedicine services for neurological cases have been accelerated due to the pandemic Telemedicine is a way to provide healthcare needed by patients at high risks for COVID-19 fatality related to comorbidities and treatments Payment regulations, regulatory structures, state licensing, and credentialing across hospitals for better telemedicine experience need to be enhanced","output":"Acceleration of Telemedicine Use for Chronic Neurological Disease Patients during COVID-19 Pandemic in Yogyakarta, Indonesia: A Case Series Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Various modalities are under study for prevention and treatment of novel coronavirus.

We found that SARS-CoV-2 isolates replicated in the respiratory tracts of 12-month-old (aged) mice and caused pathological features of pneumonia upon intranasal infection. In contrast, rapid viral clearance was observed 5 days following infection in 2-month-old (young) mice with no evidence of pathological changes in the lungs. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicited significantly upregulated production of cytokines, especially interleukin 6 and interferon gamma, in aged mice, whereas this response was much weaker in young mice. Subsequent challenge of infected aged BALB/c mice with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in neutralized antibody responses, a significantly reduced viral burden in the lungs, and inflammation mitigation. Deep sequencing showed a panel of mutations potentially associated with the enhanced infection in aged BALB/c mice, such as the Q498H mutation, which is located at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. We further found that the isolates cannot only multiply in the respiratory tract of mice, but also cause disease in aged mice. Overall, viral replication and rapid adaption in aged BALB/c mice were associated with pneumonia, confirming that the age-related susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in mice resembled that in humans. IMPORTANCE Aged BALB/c mice are in use as a model of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Our research demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 can rapidly adapt in aged BALB/c mice through causing mutations at the RBD of the S protein. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-infected aged BALB/c mice indicated that alveolar damage, interstitial pneumonia, and inflammatory immune responses were similar to the clinical manifestations of human infections. Therefore, our aged BALB/c challenge model will be useful for further understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and for testing vaccines and antiviral agents.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Rapidly Adapts in Aged BALB/c Mice and Induces Typical Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The speed and scale of new information during the COVID-19 pandemic required a new approach toward developing best practices and evidence-based clinical guidance.

In June 2020 NAD circulated optional surveys to leads for dementia in acute hospitals and carers asking about the impact of the pandemic on the organisation and provision of hospital care. Methods: Anonymous survey links were sent to hospital dementia leads directly and circulated to carers of people with dementia via social media and representative organisations. Dementia Leads' questions included whether they and/or their team had been redeployed during the pandemic and whether wards had access to specialist services. Carers' questions included whether patients' needs were discussed, whether they were permitted to visit/how this was communicated, any measures to facilitate communication with their loved ones, and whether they were updated about progress and discharge. Results: 53 dementia hospital leads completed the questionnaire. 32% had been redeployed to other clinical areas during the pandemic, 45% said the same for members of the dementia team. Specialist support for people with dementia on both Covid and Non-Covid wards was significantly compromised. 32 carers completed the questionnaire. 48% were not asked about the needs of the patient they cared for, 90% not allowed to visit, 43% were not given any explanation about visiting and 48% not given support to keep in touch with their loved one. Conclusions: Clinical priorities inevitably meant redeployment of dementia specialist staff, and changes to visiting. However, continuation of specialist support is a requirement for people with dementia admitted to hospital. Liaison with carers/families must be a priority, including facilitating remote support.

In a tertiary hospital contending with COVID-19 during a dengue epidemic, a triage strategy of routine COVID-19 testing for febrile patients with viral prodromes was used. All febrile patients with viral prodromes and no epidemiologic risk for COVID-19 were first admitted to a designated ward for COVID-19 testing, where enhanced personal protective equipment was used by healthcare workers until COVID-19 was ruled out. From January to May 2020, 11,086 admissions were screened for COVID-19; 868 cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed in our institution, along with 380 cases of dengue. Only 8.5% (943/11,086) of suspected COVID-19 cases were concurrently tested for dengue serology due to a compatible overlapping clinical syndrome, and dengue was established as an alternative diagnosis in 2% (207/10,218) of suspected COVID-19 cases that tested negative. There were eight COVID-19 cases with likely false-positive dengue serology and one probable COVID-19/dengue coinfection. From April to May 2020, 251 admissions presenting as viral prodromes with no respiratory symptoms were screened; of those, 15 cases had COVID-19, and 2/15 had false-positive dengue IgM.

There is a wide variety of face masks available on the market for various applications, but they are all passive in nature, i.e., simply act as air filters for the nasal passage and/or mouth. In this paper, we present a new \\"active mask\\" paradigm, in which the wearable device is equipped with smart sensors and actuators to both detect the presence of airborne pathogens in real time and take appropriate action to mitigate the threat. The proposed approach is based on a closed-loop control system that senses airborne particles of different sizes close to the mask and then makes intelligent decisions to reduce their concentrations. This paper presents a specific implementation of this concept in which the on-board controller determines ambient air quality via a commercial particulate matter sensor, and if necessary activates a piezoelectric actuator that generates a mist spray to load these particles, thus causing them to fall to the ground. The proposed system communicates with the user via a smart phone application that provides various alerts, including notification of the need to recharge and/or decontaminate the mask prior to reuse. The application also enables a user to override the on-board control system and manually control the mist generator if necessary. Experimental results from a functional prototype demonstrate significant reduction in airborne particulate counts near the mask when the active protection system is enabled.","output":"The Smart Mask: Active Closed-Loop Protection against Airborne Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the Laboratory Response Checklist for Infectious Disease Outbreaks (the Checklist) is to provide public health laboratories and laboratory networks operating at multiple jurisdictional levels with a useful, adaptable tool to help rapidly identify important outbreak response considerations, particularly when investigating a previously unknown infectious disease threat.

While the Checklist was initially designed to reflect lessons learned through National Microbiology Laboratory participation in extended national and international outbreak responses (e.g. Zika virus epidemic [2015-2016], Ebola virus epidemic, West Africa [2014-2016]), the importance of optimizing laboratory response coordination has only been underscored by the ongoing challenges presented by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic response requirements. The Checklist identifies five highly interdependent laboratory response themes, each of which encompasses multiple considerations that may be critical to a coordinated, strategic outbreak response. As such, the comprehensive review of Checklist considerations by responding laboratory organizations may provide a valuable opportunity to quickly detect key response considerations and interdependencies, and mitigate risks with the potential to impact public health action.","output":"Laboratory response checklist for infectious disease outbreaks-preparedness and response considerations for emerging threats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: There is increasing anecdotal evidence that olfactory and gustatory dysfunction may be associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Aim: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to find the association of these symptoms with Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) and estimate their pooled prevalence Materials and Methods: PubMed, Embase, EBSCO and Cochrane databases were searched for cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies evaluating olfactory and gustatory symptoms in patients with COVID-19 The search terms included COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus, olfaction disorders, anosmia, hyposmia, dysgeusia and ageusia Random effects model was used to calculate a pooled Odds Ratio (OR) and pooled prevalence Results: Total 14 studies were included in qualitative synthesis and 13 studies were incorporated in quantitative synthesis, involving 3125 patients The pooled OR was 15 59 reflecting that smell and taste disorders were strongly associated with COVID-19 The pooled prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction was 56% and 44%, respectively Conclusion: It can be concluded that there is a significant association between olfactory and gustatory symptoms and COVID-19 Majority of the studies support the use of these symptoms as screening tools for COVID-19 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Clinical & Diagnostic Research is the property of JCDR Research & Publications Private Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Olfactory and Gustatory Symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 is evolving; however, a cytokine storm has been implicated. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the value of anticytokine therapies to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019. This review summarizes the existing literature evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticytokine therapy to tackle the dysregulated immune response to infectious pathogens, discusses potential reasons for failure, applicability to coronavirus disease 2019, and future direction. DATA SOURCES: Medline, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and media reports. STUDY SELECTION: The studies were included by author consensus. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were selected for inclusion after reviewing each study by author consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: Cytokine storm is a nonspecific term, encompassing systemic inflammatory response to infectious pathogens, autoimmune conditions, cancers, trauma, and various chemotherapies. Like bacterial sepsis, viral pathogens may fuel immunopathogenesis by inducing a dysregulated autoamplifying cytokine cascade, ultimately leading to organ injury. This narrative review discusses what we know of the immune milieu of coronavirus disease 2019 versus noncoronavirus disease 2019 sepsis and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome, summarizes the existing literature on cytokine inhibitors in patients with sepsis and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and discusses possible reasons for recurrent failure. In doing so, it aims to assist decisions regarding the use of anticytokine therapy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, as many regions of the world confront the second wave of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: As ongoing clinical trials determine the efficacy and safety of anticytokine therapy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, clinicians should uphold caution when incorporating it into treatment protocols, while maintaining focus on established evidence-based practices and the mantra of less is more.","output":"New Decade, Old Debate: Blocking the Cytokine Pathways in Infection-Induced Cytokine Cascade"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Very few cases of lung transplant patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported to date.

The largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic to date in 2013-2016 in West Africa highlighted the urgent need for countermeasures, leading to the development and FDA approval of the Ebola virus vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo(?)) in 2020 and two monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapeutics (Inmazeb(?) [atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn] and Ebanga(?) (ansuvimab-zykl) in 2020. The humoral response plays an indispensable role in ebolavirus immunity, based on studies of mAbs isolated from the antibody genes in peripheral blood circulating ebolavirus-specific human memory B cells. However, antibodies in the body are not secreted by circulating memory B cells in the blood but rather principally by plasma cells in the bone marrow. Little is known about the protective polyclonal antibody responses in convalescent plasma. Here we exploited both single-cell antibody gene sequencing and proteomic sequencing approaches to assess the composition of the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP)-reactive antibody repertoire in the plasma of an EVD survivor. We first identified 1,512 GP-specific mAb variable gene sequences from single cells in the memory B cell compartment. Using mass spectrometric analysis of the corresponding GP-specific plasma IgG, we found that only a portion of the large B cell antibody repertoire was represented in the plasma. Molecular and functional analysis of proteomics-identified mAbs revealed recognition of epitopes in three major antigenic sites - the GP head domain, the glycan cap, and the base region, with a high prevalence of neutralizing and protective mAb specificities that targeted the base and glycan cap regions on the GP. Polyclonal plasma antibodies from the survivor reacted broadly to EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP, while reactivity of the potently neutralizing mAbs we identified was limited mostly to the homologous EBOV GP. Together these results reveal a restricted diversity of neutralizing humoral response in which mAbs targeting two antigenic sites on GP C glycan cap and base C play a principal role in plasma-antibody-mediated protective immunity against EVD.","output":"Proteo-Genomic Analysis Identifies Two Major Sites of Vulnerability on Ebolavirus Glycoprotein for Neutralizing Antibodies in Convalescent Human Plasma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a recent emerging pandemic whose prognosis is still unclear.

The aim of this study is to provide a safe laparoendoscopic technique for hiatal hernia repair in the presence of an ALHA. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent LARS or LHHR between March 2016 and March 2018. We reviewed clinical and laboratory data and operative reports and images. Follow-up data included gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) questionnaire results and the results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and upper gastrointestinal studies. Results One hundred thirty-one LARS and LHHR procedures were performed by a single surgeon. Eight (6.1%) patients had an ALHA. There were 6 female and 2 male patients. The average age was 54.5 (10.4) years, and the average body mass index was 28.1 (5.5) kg/m2. The duration of their GERD symptoms was 16.6 (6.9) years. Patients underwent LHHR followed by transoral incisionless fundoplication. Hiatoplasty was performed with extracorporeal sliding arthroscopic knots. The ALHA was preserved in all cases. There was no intraoperative bleeding, mortality or postoperative complications. All antireflux medications were discontinued with significant improvement of GERD questionnaires. All patients had EGD at 3 months postoperatively with no recurrence of hiatal hernia. Five patients who had the surgery longer than 1 year ago had an upper gastrointestinal study without evidence of hiatal hernia recurrence. Conclusion The laparoendoscopic technique of hiatal hernia repair, using extracorporeal arthroscopic sliding knots and concomitant transoral incisionless fundoplication, is safe, preserves an ALHA, and allows proper surgical techniques in a confined operative field.","output":"Benefit of Laparoendoscopic Repair of Hiatal Hernia in the Presence of Aberrant Left Hepatic Artery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has made endocrinologists from all over the world to be the first liner to care for patients.

She was previously healthy with no cardiac medications. Family history was significant for granulomatosis with polyangiitis. COVID-19 swab was negative. She was symptomatic with transient complete heart block and junctional escape of 20bpm. A temporary transvenous pacemaker was placed. Echocardiogram showed biventricular dysfunction with left ventricular ejection fraction < 30%. Troponin and brain-natriuretic peptide were elevated. Coronary angiogram showed no significant occlusions. CT excluded pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, or adenopathy. She was initiated on heart failure medications but beta blocker was not started given heart block. Six days into admission, her heart failure improved but she developed transient complete heart block without junctional escape. There was no ventricular ectopy. Evaluation for rheumatologic, infectious, and inflammatory causes showed elevated C-reactive protein and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. The remainder of the workup was negative. Leading diagnoses were idiopathic giant cell myocarditis or cardiac sarcoidosis. An endomyocardial biopsy revealed multinucleated giant cells and myocyte necrosis.

METHODS: Seroprevalence and the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody responses were measured in surplus serum from 11 422 (53.3% [6084] male; median age 36.8 years) patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, stored at six therapeutic drug monitoring laboratories between January 29 and September 30, 2020. Data were linked to nationally held SARS-CoV-2 PCR results to July 11, 2021. RESULTS: Rates of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar across treatment groups. Seroprevalence rates were lower in infliximab- and adalimumab- than vedolizumab-treated patients (infliximab: 3.0% [178/5893], adalimumab: 3.0% [152/5074], vedolizumab: 6.7% [25/375], p = 0.003). The magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 reactivity was similar in infliximab- vs adalimumab-treated patients (median 4.30 cut-off index [COI] [1.94C9.96] vs 5.02 [2.18C18.70], p = 0.164), but higher in vedolizumab-treated patients (median 21.60 COI [4.39C68.10, p < 0.004). Compared to patients with detectable infliximab and adalimumab drug levels, patients with undetectable drug levels [<0.8 mg/L] were more likely to be seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. One-third of patients who had PCR testing prior to antibody testing failed to seroconvert, all were treated with anti-TNF. Subsequent positive PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 was seen in 7.9% [12/152] of patients after a median time of 183.5 days [129.8C235.3], without differences between drugs. CONCLUSION: Anti-TNF treatment is associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid seroprevalence and antibody reactivity when compared to vedolizumab-treated patients. Higher seropositivity rates in patients with undetectable anti-TNF levels support a causal relationship, although confounding factors, such as combination therapy with a immunomodulator, may have influenced the results.","output":"Adalimumab and Infliximab Impair SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses: Results from a Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Study in 11 422 Biologic-Treated Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 outbreak of a severe respiratory disease caused by an emerging coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread globally with high morbidity and mortality.

Due to the very unusual feeding behaviour of Ae. albopictus, we also evaluated the role of this mosquito in a potential mechanical transmission of the virus. METHODS: For the vector competence study, mosquitoes were allowed to take several infectious blood meals. The mosquitoes were then collected and analysed at 0, 3, 7 and 10 days post-feeding. For the mechanical transmission test, Ae. albopictus females were allowed to feed for a short time on a feeder containing infectious blood and then on a feeder containing virus-free blood. Both mosquitoes and blood were tested for viral presence. RESULTS: Culex pipiens and Ae. albopictus were found not be competent vectors for SARS-CoV-2, and Ae. albopictus was unable to mechanically transmit the virus. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that the most common species of vector mosquitoes in Europe do not transmit SARS-CoV-2 and that Ae. albopictus is unable to mechanically transmit the virus from a positive host to a healthy host through host-feeding.","output":"The common European mosquitoes Culex pipiens and Aedes albopictus are unable to transmit SARS-CoV-2 after a natural-mimicking challenge with infected blood"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are two subspecies of Rhinolophus sinicus currently recognized in China.

Additionally, type I HCs transmit via non-quantal transmission to calyx afferent fibers, by accumulation of glutamate and potassium in the synaptic cleft. Vestibular efferent inputs originating in the brainstem contact type II HCs and vestibular afferents. Here, we aimed at characterizing the synaptic efferent inputs to type II HCs using electrical and optogenetic stimulation of efferent fibers combined with in vitro whole-cell patch clamp recording from type II HCs in the rodent vestibular crista. Properties of efferent synaptic currents in type II HCs were similar to those found in cochlear hair cells and mediated by activation of 9/10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and SK potassium channels. While efferents showed a low probability of release at low frequencies of stimulation, repetitive stimulation resulted in facilitation and increased probability of release. Notably, the membrane potential of type II HCs measured during optogenetic stimulation of efferents showed a strong hyperpolarization even in response to single pulses and was further enhanced by repetitive stimulation. Such efferent-mediated inhibition of type II HCs can provide a mechanism to adjust the contribution of signals from type I and type II HCs to vestibular nerve fibers. As a result, the relative input of type I hair cells to vestibular afferents will be strengthened, emphasizing the phasic properties of the incoming signal that are transmitted via fast non-quantal transmission. New and Noteworthy Type II vestibular hair cells (HCs) receive inputs from efferent fibers originating in the brainstem. We used in vitro optogenetic and electrical stimulation of efferent fibers to study their synaptic inputs to type II HCs. Efferent inputs inhibited type II HCs, similar to cochlear efferent effects. We propose that efferent inputs adjust the contribution of signals from type I and type II HCs that report different components of the incoming signal to vestibular nerve fibers.","output":"Efferent Synaptic Transmission at the Vestibular Type II Hair Cell Synapse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is the disease caused by an infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first identified in the city of Wuhan, in Chinas Hubei province in December 2019. COVID-19 was previously known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) respiratory disease before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the official name as COVID-19 in February 2020. AIM: The aim of this study is to search scientific literature in the biomedicine and analyzed current results of investigations regarding morbidity and mortality rates as consequences of COVID-19 infection of Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and other most common chronic diseases which are on the top mortality and morbidity rates in almost all countries in the world. Also, to propose most useful measures how to prevent patients to keep themselves against COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We used method of descriptive analysis of the published papers with described studies about Corona virus connected with CVD, and, also, Guidelines proposed by World Health Organization (WHO) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and some other international associations which are included in global fighting against COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: After searching current scientific literature we have acknowledged that not any Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) study in the world during last 5 months from the time when first cases of COVID-10 infection was detected. Also, there is no unique proposed ways of treatments and drugs to protect patients, especially people over 65 years old, who are very risk group to be affected with COVID-19.

As physical inactivity is a risk factor for osteoporosis, we investigated the short-term impact of the stay-at-home order on bone health among patients with osteoporosis in our hospital in Kanagawa prefecture. Methods Thirty patients with osteoporosis with no delays in their regular medication who received care at our hospitals osteoporosis outpatient clinic within one month after the end of the state of emergency were included. Lumbar spine and femur proximal bone mineral density (BMD) were measured at the last follow-up date (May 25 to June 30, 2020; 0M) and six (6M) and 12 months (12M) before the last follow-up using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), Tartrate-resistant Acid Phosphatase 5b (TRACP5b), calcium and phosphorus were assessed at the same time points. Results Serum BAP concentrations were significantly lower at 0M than 12M (p=0.040), but were comparable between 0M and 6M (p=0.527). Serum TRACP5b was significantly lower at 6M than 12M (p=0.009), but was similar between 0M and 6M (p=1.000).

According to Thailands second pandemic wave data (17(th) January 2021, to 15(th) February 2021), we find that the epicenter-based strategy is surprisingly the worst allocation strategy, due largely to the negligence of provincial demographics, vaccine efficacy, and overall transmission dynamics that lead to higher number of infectious individuals. We also find that early vaccination seems to significantly contribute to the reduction in the number of infectious individuals, whose effects tend to increase with more vaccine supply.

COVID-19 has taken the lives of more than 2.1 million people worldwide, with a global mortality rate of 2.2%. Current COVID-19 treatment options include supportive respiratory care, parenteral corticosteroids, and remdesivir. Although COVID-19 is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with comorbidities, the vulnerability, clinical course, optimal management, and prognosis of COVID-19 infection in patients with organ transplants has not been well described in the literature. The treatment of COVID-19 differs based on the organ(s) transplanted. Preliminary data suggested that liver transplant patients with COVID-19 did not have higher mortality rates than untransplanted COVID-19 patients. Table 1 depicts a compiled list of current published data on COVID-19 liver transplant patients. Most of these studies included both recent and old liver transplant patients. No distinction was made for early liver transplant patients who contract COVID-19 within their posttransplant hospitalization course. This potential differentiation needs to be further explored. Here, we report 2 patients who underwent liver transplantation who acquired COVID-19 during their posttransplant recovery period in the hospital. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Two patients who underwent liver transplant and contracted COVID-19 in the early posttransplant period and were treated with hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma. This article includes a description of their hospital course, including treatment and recovery. CONCLUSION: The management of post-liver transplant patients with COVID-19 infection is complicated. Strict exposure precaution practice after organ transplantation is highly recommended. Widespread vaccination will help with prevention, but there will continue to be patients who contract COVID-19. Therefore, continued research into appropriate treatments is still relevant and critical. A temporary dose reduction of immunosuppression and continued administration of low-dose methylprednisolone, remdesivir, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma might be helpful in the management and recovery of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in post-liver transplant patients.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, online national survey. SETTING: Responses collected online from 4(th) May 2020 to 11(th) May 2020 across 40 UK medical schools. PARTICIPANTS: Medical students across all years from UK-registered medical schools. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The uses, experiences, perceived benefits and barriers of online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 2721 medical students across 39 medical schools responded. Medical schools adapted to the pandemic in different ways. The changes included the development of new distance-learning platforms on which content was released, remote delivery of lectures using platforms and the use of question banks and other online active recall resources. A significant difference was found between time spent on online platforms before and during COVID-19, with 7.35% students before versus 23.56% students during the pandemic spending >15 hours per week (p<0.05). The greatest perceived benefits of online teaching platforms included their flexibility. Whereas the commonly perceived barriers to using online teaching platforms included family distraction (26.76%) and poor internet connection (21.53%). CONCLUSIONS: Online teaching has enabled the continuation of medical education during these unprecedented times. Moving forward from this pandemic, in order to maximise the benefits of both face-to-face and online teaching and to improve the efficacy of medical education in the future, we suggest medical schools resort to teaching formats such as team-based/problem-based learning.

All infants in Texas are required to have a first newborn screen at 24C48 hours of life and a second at 10C14 days of age. In Texas, there is a single state laboratory that performs all testing;confirmatory testing is left to primary care providers to do alone or in consultation with the metabolic center of their choice. In 2019, Texas screened over 380,000 babies, including over 737,000 specimens, and identified 850 affected infants. The arrival of the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), in 2020 had an immense impact on medical care, resulting in clinic closures, telemedicine expansion, and limited staffing. These changes, as well as delays in other areas of healthcare, raised concerns that the timeliness of newborn screening could also be affected, whether by delays in the state laboratory, slower sample delivery, difficulty scheduling patient evaluations, or parental hesitation to seek care due to exposure risk. We hypothesized that diagnosis of metabolic disease by newborn screening was slowed by the pandemic. Methods: We analyzed all cases referred to our metabolic service at Texas Childrens Hospital for abnormal screening prior to disruption of normal hospital activity by the pandemic (January 1, 2020CMarch 15, 2020) and those referred after disruption of normal hospital activity (March 16, 2020CMay 6, 2020). We excluded patients whose testing was incomplete at the time of the analysis and those that followed up at a different institution. We calculated the time to reporting of the first newborn screen (NBS1) and second newborn screen (NBS2), the number of days from the abnormal NBS to all confirmatory labs drawn (LD), the number of days from LD to the return of all results (RR), and the number of days from the abnormal NBS to diagnosis or clearance (DX) for each patient. We averaged and compared these values for the pre-pandemic group (N = 84) and pandemic group (N = 42) using Microsoft Excel, running an F-test two sample for variance and t-test two sample assuming unequal variance for each category as well as calculating the standard deviation. Results: We found no statistical difference in any category for the patients born prior to the COVID-19 pandemic impacting our clinic activities and those referred afterward (Figure 1). The age at reporting NBS1 was 6.7  2.2 days pre-pandemic, versus 7.2  1.4 in the pandemic group (p = 0.12). For NBS2, the age was 26.9  28.6 days in the pre-pandemic group and 24.5  16.5 in the pandemic group (p = 0.58). The LD was longer in the pandemic group (5.8  8.8 days pre-pandemic vs 10.9  30.1 days during pandemic), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.29). In contrast, the RR was shorter during the pandemic with averages of 9.2  5.1 days pre-pandemic versus 7.5  4.2 during pandemic. This difference was close to but did not meet statistical significance (p = 0.055). Finally, the DX, perhaps the most important parameter we assessed, also did not demonstrate a significant difference with averages of 29.8  23.2 days in the pre-pandemic group and 34.5  35.9 days in the pandemic group (p = 0.47). Conclusions: No significant difference in any measured parameter was noted between newborns born before clinic activities were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic compared to those born afterward. This is reassuring that the newborn screening program in South Texas remained robust, despite no formal or financial relationship between the state laboratory and regional metabolic centers. We acknowledge the limitations of this study, including its conduction at a single center early in the period of clinical activities being impacted. However, we would expect that the most significant difference would have occurred at the beginning of the pandemic, during the limitation of in person visits and prior to the deve opment of alternative strategies and re-opening of clinics and labs. The extended course of newborn screening and confirmatory testing resulted in the exclusion of more patients in the pandemic group as their testing was still pending at the time of data collection, limiting the power in analysis of this group. Significant variability in both groups (as evidenced by the high standard deviations) could mean that significant outliers are skewing the data and that statistically significant differences could exist. Overall, though, it seems that the pandemic did not adversely affect various metrics regarding newborn screening at our center.(Figure Presented)","output":"eP023 Impact of COVID-19 on newborn screening in South Texas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid identification of pathogenic microorganisms plays a crucial role in the timely diagnosis and treatment strategies during a global pandemic, especially in resource-limited area.

Although such vectors are usually gutted and are replication defective, they are subjected to clearance by the host cells by immune recognition and destruction. Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a naturally evolved cyto-protective signaling pathway which is triggered due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in its lumen. The UPR signaling consists of three signaling pathways, namely PKR-like ER kinase, activating transcription factor 6, and inositol-requiring protein-1. Once activated, UPR triggers the production of ER molecular chaperones and stress response proteins to help reduce the protein load within the ER. This occurs by degradation of the misfolded proteins and ensues in the arrest of protein translation machinery. If the burden of protein load in ER is beyond its processing capacity, UPR can activate pro-apoptotic pathways or autophagy leading to cell death. Viruses are naturally evolved in hijacking the host cellular translation machinery to generate a large amount of proteins. This phenomenon disrupts ER homeostasis and leads to ER stress. Alternatively, in the case of gutted vectors used in gene therapy, the excess load of recombinant vectors administered and encountered by the cell can trigger UPR. Thus, in the context of gene therapy, UPR becomes a major roadblock that can potentially trigger inflammatory responses against the vectors and reduce the efficiency of gene transfer.","output":"Cellular unfolded protein response against viruses used in gene therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Researchers in universities are encouraged to produce innovative scientific research and participate in the international scientific community. In Mexico, public policies have intended to promote competitiveness in such social space. However, the lack of funding, researchers, and the polysemic conception of innovation in scientific production, amongst other factors, has scarcely promoted the economic, scientific and social progress in the region. This study (1) analyzes the concept of innovation among researchers in the field of Social Sciences to identify if they share a standard definition of such and if (2) the scholars have the impression that they perform innovations in their scientific production. The study compares researchers conceptions from three higher education institutions of the State of Sonora, Mexico. The Northwestern region of Mexico is significant due to its research production in Physics and Social Sciences, which is mainly generated in Higher Education institutions. We conducted semi-structured interviews and analyzed their views about their scientific production over the last five years. We reflect on the different types of relations scholars tie the concept of innovation. The main results show the different conceptions of innovation, especially its fragmentary character among social science researchers and how this inhibits the development of innovation and competitiveness. This result is a virtual space for policymakers to open a formative space for innovation and is an invitation to investigate the innovative or non-innovative character of scientific production in northwestern Mexico.","output":"Strategic Innovation: Conception of Innovation among Social Sciences Researchers in Higher Education in Northwestern Mxico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medication reviews are effective in improving the quality of medication use among older people. However, they are conducted to various standards resulting in a wide range of outcomes which limit generalisability of findings arising from research studies.

Aim and Hypothesis: Our primary aim is to demonstrate the safety of edoxaban initiation within 5 days of AF related stroke. Our secondary aim is to determine predictors of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after AF related stroke. We hypothesize that the rate of radiological HT will not be increased in patients starting edoxaban within 5 days of AF related stroke, relative to those in whom initiation is delayed. We hypothesize that the risk of HT in patients treated with edoxaban can be predicted using RNA expressed in leukocytes at time of stroke. Methods and Design: LASER (Lixiana Acute Stroke Evaluation Registry) is a randomized controlled trial with an associated registry (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03494530). One hundred and fifty patients with ischemic stroke and AF will undergo baseline Computed Tomography (CT) scan and will be randomized 2:1 within 5 days of symptom onset to early (5 days, n = 100) or delayed (6C14 days, n = 50) edoxaban initiation. Participants will undergo clinical assessment and repeat CT at 7 days and clinical assessment at 90 days. Study Outcomes: The primary outcome is the rate of incident radiological HT. Secondary outcomes include symptomatic HT, recurrent ischemic stroke, recurrent sub-clinical infarcts on follow up CT, systemic hemorrhagic complication rate, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale at day 7 and 90, mortality within 90 days, quality of life assessments at day 90, and predictors of HT, including RNA expression by 6 pre-selected candidate genes. Discussion: Event rates for both HT and recurrent ischemic events, in patients treated with early vs. delayed edoxaban initiation are unknown. The primary study endpoint of LASER is an objective performance criterion relevant to clinical decision making in patients with AF related stroke.

However, the assumption that opportunities to choose are universally available is negated by research evidence. PURPOSE. To review the ideology of \\"choice\\" in occupational therapy theory, and to encourage more critical approaches toward determinants of occupational opportunity and choice. KEY ISSUES. Evidence indicates that within Canada, and throughout the world, opportunities to make occupational choices are inequitably distributed among people of different socioeconomic classes, castes, genders, races, abilities, sexualities, citizenship statuses, and experiences of colonialism. IMPLICATIONS. Because occupation is a determinant of health and well-being, social injustices that create inequitable occupational choices are unfair violations of occupational rights. The occupational therapy profession's espoused aim of enhancing well-being through occupation demands theories that explicitly recognize the socially structured and inequitable shaping of choice, and consequent impact on people's occupational rights.","output":"Making Choices from the Choices we have: The Contextual-Embeddedness of Occupational Choice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic COVID-19 has prompted the government to implement a social distancing policy.

However, the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19, particularly the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host innate immunity, remains unclear. The innate immune system acts as the first line of host defense, which is critical for the initial detection of invading pathogens and the activation and shaping of adaptive immunity. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key sensors of innate immunity that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and activate downstream signaling for pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. However, TLRs may also act as a double-edged sword, and dysregulated TLR responses may enhance immune-mediated pathology, instead of providing protection. Therefore, a proper understanding of the interaction between TLRs and SARS-CoV-2 is of great importance for devising therapeutic and preventive strategies. The use of TLR agonists as vaccine adjuvants for human disease is a promising approach that could be applied in the investigation of COVID-19 vaccines. In this review, we discuss the recent progress in our understanding of host innate immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with particular focus on TLR response.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-three subjects with hemianopia and 33 controls were tested with the CU-VF software on a personal computer and SAP. Hemianopia was defined as the presence of a hemianopic field respecting the vertical meridian on SAP with the corresponding neuroimaging pathology as evaluated by 2 neuro-ophthalmologists. Results of CU-VF were independently evaluated by 2 neuro-ophthalmologists, 1 general ophthalmologist, and 1 general practitioner in terms of the presence of hemianopia. Sensitivity, specificity, and kappa coefficient for inter-observer reliability were calculated. Satisfaction and ease of use were evaluated with a visual analog-scale questionnaire and analyzed using paired t-test. RESULTS: The sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) of the CU-VF to detect hemianopia was 74.42% (58.53C85.96) and 93.94% (78.38C99.94).

The objective of this study was to determine whether the frequency of on-time routine childhood vaccinations among children age 0C2 years was lower following the COVID-19 declaration of emergency in Ontario, Canada, on March 17, 2020, compared to prior to the pandemic. Methods We conducted a longitudinal cohort study of healthy children aged 0C2 years participating in the TARGet Kids! primary care research network in Toronto, Canada. A logistic mixed effects regression model was used to determine odds ratios (ORs) for delayed vaccination (> 30 days vs.  30 days from the recommended date) before and after the COVID-19 declaration of emergency, adjusted for confounding variables. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to explore the relationship between the declaration of emergency and time to vaccination. Results Among 1277 children, the proportion of on-time vaccinations was 81.8% prior to the COVID-19 declaration of emergency and 62.1% after (p < 0.001). The odds of delayed vaccination increased (odds ratio = 3.77, 95% CI: 2.86C4.96), and the hazard of administration of recommended vaccinations decreased after the declaration of emergency (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.60C0.92). The median vaccination delay time was 5 days (95% CI: 4C5 days) prior to the declaration of emergency and 17 days (95% CI: 12C22 days) after.

It is well known that breakthrough infections are common in vaccinated individuals. Depending upon patient age, immunity, comorbidities, drugs, and history of Covid-19, these infections could be mild or severe and, in some cases, may require hospitalization. Objectives: To study the rate of Covid-19 breakthrough infections and associated illness in individuals after receiving mRNA vaccine. Methods: De-identified administrative claims data between December 2020 to March 2021 were used to identify vaccinated individuals (18 years). The study considered vaccines that were available in the US at the time of study duration. The first vaccination date was defined as index. Members were followed for two months post index to identify Covid-19 breakthrough infections (as defined by CDC) occurring 14 days post index. Patients with continuous enrollment for 90 days post-index were included. Evidence of vaccination was identified using pharmacy claims, while medical claims were used to identify a breakthrough and associated acute respiratory illnesses. Descriptive analysis was conducted to identify patient demographics, geographic location and age and sex wise distribution. Results: A total of 772,222 members had at least one claim for Covid-19 vaccination.

A total of 120 patients were included, 71 with influenza and 49 with COVID-19-associated ARDS. Among them, 27 fulfilled the newly published criteria of IPA: 17/71 IAPA (23.9%) and 10/49 CAPA (20.4%). KaplanCMeier curves showed significantly higher 90-day mortality for IPA patients overall (p = 0.032), whereas mortality did not differ between CAPA and IAPA patients. Radiological findings showed differences between IAPA and CAPA, with a higher proportion of features suggestive of IPA during IAPA. Lastly, a wide proportion of IPA patients had low plasma voriconazole concentrations with a higher delay to reach concentrations > 2 mg/L in CAPA vs. IAPA patients (p = 0.045). Severe COVID-19 and influenza patients appeared very similar in terms of prevalence of IPA and outcome. The dramatic consequences on the patients prognosis emphasize the need for a better awareness in these particular populations.","output":"Influenza- and COVID-19-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis: Are the Pictures Different?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: COVID-19 has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation, from severe forms that require hospitalization to less severe forms that can be managed at home. An acute myocardial involvement was demonstrated in a large proportion of patients admitted for COVID-19 and may persist in the long term. We evaluated the possible cardiac involvement using echocardiography, comprehensive of right and left ventricular strain, in patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (hospitalized or home-treated) comparing them with a population of healthy volunteers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-one patients with COVID-19, of which fifteen hospitalized, with no prior heart disease, were compared with 13 healthy volunteers. COVID-19 diagnosis was made by a positive molecular swab. Patients with history of pre-existing heart disease were excluded. The median time from infection to outpatient follow-up was 5.9 months. Numerous echocardiographic parameters were compared by unpaired t-test including left ventricular EF, left ventricular GLS, RV free wall strain, FAC, TAPSE, PAPS, TAPSE/PAPS ratio, RA area, and RV thickness. There was a significant difference in RV free wall strain between hospitalized patients and control (?14.6  2.8% vs. ?22  0.7%; P-value 0.03) and between hospitalized and home-treated patients (?14.6  2.8% vs. ?19.8  0.9%; P-value 0.03), the difference was not significant between control and home-treated patients (?22  0.7% vs. ?19.8  0.8%; P-value 0.09). Between hospitalized and not hospitalized group there was a significant reduction in FAC (38.5  3.2% vs. 44.7  1.3%; P-value 0.03) with an increase of RV end diastolic area (19.9  1.3 cm(2) vs. 16.8  0.7 cm(2); P-value 0.037) and also of end systolic right atrium area (18.2  1.3 cm(2) vs. 15.4  0.5 cm(2); P-value 0.01). No difference was observed between hospitalized and home-treated patients in TAPSE (22.38  1.26 mm vs. 23.02  0.68 mm; P-value 0.6) and PAPS (24.3  1.6 mmHg vs. 20.2  1.4 mmHg; P-value 0.07) but there was a borderline significant decrease in right ventricular coupling evaluated with TAPSE/PAPS ratio (0.97  0.08 mm/mmHg vs. 1.29  0.10 mm/mmHg; P-value 0.056) and a significant increase in RV thickness in hospitalized patients (5.32  0.45 mm vs. 3.69  0.24 mm; P-value 0.0014). No significant differences were found between hospitalized and not hospitalized group in left ventricular EF (57.8  1.9% vs. 59.9  1.0%; P-value 0.3) and left ventricular GLS (?15.2  0.6% vs. ?16.4  0.4%; P-value 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 showed a dysfunction in RV parameters at 6 months follow-up compared to non-hospitalized patients. No difference in RV function was found between home treated patients and healthy volunteers. No significant differences in LV function were found among the three groups. These preliminary data confirm a decrease in RV function in more severe COVID-19 infection requiring hospital admission, possibly related to increased pulmonary afterload.","output":"761 Echocardiographic evaluation in patients recovered from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Iloilo province was singled out as a model province in the Philippines because of its ability to prevent the spread of COVID-19 This study aims to examine the factors that influenced Iloilo residents' adherence to quarantine protocols Design/methodology/approach A total of 334 Iloilo residents joined the survey Using the theory of planned behavior (TPB), the results suggest a significant impact of attitude on adherence to quarantine protocols, while subjective norm, self-efficacy and controllability were not significant Findings This study suggests that attitude predicts adherence to quarantine protocols Further, the results showed that intrinsic motivation mediated the relationship between (1) attitude and adherence to quarantine protocols and (2) subjective norm and adherence to quarantine protocols This implies that intrinsic motivation such as staying alive can encourage a resident to adhere to quarantine protocols Research limitations/implications Subsequent research should also consider how to mitigate the effects of similar public health crises in the future Practical implications The study implies that intrinsic motivation such as staying alive can encourage a resident to follow quarantine protocol given this pandemic Social implications Health campaigns can lead to a more favorable attitude toward quarantine protocols adherence Given the value of subjective norm, campaigns can also frame quarantine protocols adherence as socially responsible behavior This can be used to target provinces with the highest risk of infection within the population These insights can be used by local government units (LGUs), media and other stakeholders to encourage residents to adhere to quarantine protocols Originality/value This study provides insights that can be used by the LGUs, media and other stakeholders to encourage residents to follow quarantine protocols","output":"Adherence to quarantine protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19: the mediating effect of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A retrospective secondary analysis of 4,200 patients was collected from two academic medical centers.

Increased delirium risk was associated with exposed only to artificial light (AL) hazard ratio (HR) 1.84 (95 % CI: 1.66-2.044, P<0.001), physical restraint application 1.11 (95 % CI: 1.001-1.226, P=0.049), and high nursing care requirements (>8 hours per 8-hour shift) 1.18 (95 % CI: 1.048-1.338, P=0.007). Delirium incidence was inversely associated with greater family engagement 0.092 (95 % CI: 0.014-0.596, P=0.012), low staff burnout and anticipated turnover scores 0.093 (95 % CI: 0.014-0.600, P=0.013), non-ICU length-of-stay (LOS)<15 days 0.725 (95 % CI: 0.655-0.804, P<0.001), and ICU LOS 15 days 0.509 (95 % CI: 0.456-0.567, P<0.001). CHAID modeling indicated that AL exposure and age <65 years were associated with a high risk of delirium incidence, whereas SOFA score 11, APACHE IV score >15 and natural light (NL) exposure were associated with moderate risk, and female sex was associated with low risk. More rapid time to delirium onset correlated with baseline sleep disturbance (P=0.049), high nursing care requirements (P=0.019), and prolonged ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS (P<0.001). Delirium recurrence correlated with age >65 years (HR 2.198; 95 % CI: 1.101-4.388, P=0.026) and high nursing care requirements (HR 1.978, 95 % CI: 1.096-3.569), with CHAID modeling identifying AL exposure (P<0.001) and age >65 years (P=0.032) as predictive variables. Development of ICU delirium correlated with application of physical restraints, high nursing care requirements, prolonged ICU and non-ICU LOS, exposure exclusively to AL (rather than natural), less family engagement, and greater staff burnout and anticipated turnover scores. ICU delirium occurred more rapidly in patients with baseline sleep disturbance, and recurrence correlated with the presence of delirium on ICU admission, exclusive AL exposure, and high nursing care requirements.","output":"Risk factors, time to onset and recurrence of delirium in a mixed medical-surgical ICU population: A secondary analysis using Cox and CHAID decision tree modeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a pandemic All COVID-19-affected countries in the world are implementing containment interventions and trying their best to fight against the disease to halt the further spread of the infection and to reduce mortality The public health workforce and healthcare staff in clinical settings are playing a crucial role in the early detection of cases, contact tracing and treatment of patients The availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and their consistent, proper use by healthcare providers and public health professionals is a crucial factor in combating any infectious disease in a crisis The requirement of PPE has exponentially increased, as more and more countries are experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic The rapid spread of the pandemic has created a temporary shortage of PPE in many countries, including India The lack of PPE has affected the morale of healthcare workers (HCWs) and other frontline warriors in fighting the coronavirus disease, as more than 22,000 health workers in 56 countries have suffered from COVID-19 Some of them have succumbed to it across all countries, including India (WHO) We have reviewed the available literature to understand the challenges in ensuring adequate availability and consistent use of PPE and the strategies for the rational use of PPE in India Our study reveals that India has responded swiftly to enhance the accessibility of PPE and put in place strategies for the judicious use of PPE to reduce the incidence of the COVID-19 infection to a bare minimum in healthcare settings In the present article, we report the current status of COVID-19 among HCWs We have reviewed the challenges and the surge strategies adopted by India to produce or procure good-quality PPE and supply it to all service delivery points in adequate quantities","output":"Personal Protective Equipment: Challenges and Strategies to Combat COVID-19 in India: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brain diseases including Down syndrome (DS/TS21) are known to be characterized by changes in cellular metabolism.

From the epidemic perspective, the infected patients number was linked to the hourly time-series of meteorological and pollutant variables, generating new time-series. Nonlinear analysis and the chaos theory formalism was applied to these new time-series, obtaining the largest Lyapunov exponent, correlation dimension, Kolmogorov entropy, Hurst exponent and the Lempel-Ziv complexity. Our preliminary results show meteorological and air pollution variables can be part of the elements fraction that give sustainability to the accumulated growth of infected patients and favor the pandemic spread, making the accumulated sicks curve chaotic and complex. In addition, environmental pollution could worsen disease conditions like coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. For all time-series, the Lempel-Ziv complexity turned out to be between 0 and 1 which is indicative of connectivity and chaos. The largest Lyapunov exponent as well as the Kolmogorov entropy were positive which also exhibits chaos. The Hurst exponent was found to be greater than 0.5 and less than 1 for all time-series, indicating positive long-term autocorrelation.

As we have routinely employed the assay for patients undergoing flow diversion, we elected to explore the relationship between P2Y12 hyporesponse as indicated by a P2Y12 Reaction Units (PRU) value >200 and treatment outcomes, including intraprocedural platelet aggregation and ischemic complications. METHODS All successful intracranial aneurysm Pipeline treatments performed at our institution from November 2011 to May 2019 were included. The rate of P2Y12 hyporesponse and treatment outcomes were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to determine independent predictors of treatment outcomes. RESULTS 333 qualifying treatments were performed in 297 patients. Clopidogrel hyporesponse was initially noted in 24%, falling to 17% by day-of-procedure by dose titration. A glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor was administered prophylactically in 3% of cases for persistent, profound hyporesponse. 27 (8.1%) patients developed acute platelet aggregation; only 6 demonstrated day-of-procedure P2Y12 hyporesponse. Day-of-procedure hyporesponse was not associated with intraprocedural platelet aggregation or ischemic complications. Greater Pipeline embolization device (PED) diameter was associated with a reduced odds of platelet aggregation (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.85; p=0.019). Antiplatelet non-compliance (OR 25.20, 95% CI 3.86 to 164.61; p=0.001) and treatment of posterior circulation aneurysms (OR 5.23, 95% CI 1.22 to 22.33; p=0.026) were the only independent predictors of ischemic complications. CONCLUSIONS P2Y12 hyporesponse was not associated with acute platelet aggregation or ischemic complications in our patients undergoing Pipeline embolization of intracranial aneurysms, possibly due to aggressive management of the hyporesponse using clopidogrel dose titration and/or GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor administration.","output":"The utility of platelet inhibition testing in patients undergoing Pipeline embolization of intracranial aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A study of spinless matter fermions coupled to a constrained $\\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ lattice gauge theory on a triangular ladder is presented. The triangular unit cell and the ladder geometry strongly modify the physics, as compared to previous analysis on the square lattice.

The gauge field dynamics due to the electric coupling is drastically influenced by the absence of periodic boundary conditions, rendering the deconfinement-confinement process a crossover in general and a quantum phase transition (QPT) only for decorated couplings. At finite doping and in the static case, a staggered flux insulator at half filling and vanishing magnetic energy competes with a uniform flux metal at elevated magnetic energy. As for the square lattice, a single QPT into a confined fermionic dimer gas is found versus electric coupling. Dimer resonances in the confined phase are however a second order process only, likely reducing the tendency to phase separate for large magnetic energy.

Public and private decision-making surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic must contend with uncertainty about the probability of infection during activities involving groups of people, in order to decide whether that activity is worth undertaking. We propose a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection probability that can produce estimates of relative risk of infection for diverse activities, so long as those activities meet a list of assumptions, including that they do not last longer than one day (e.g., sporting events, flights, concerts), and that the probability of infection among possible routes of infection (i.e., droplet, aerosol, fomite, and direct contact) are independent. We show how the model can be used to inform decisions facing governments and industry, such as opening stadiums or flying on airplanes; in particular, it allows for estimating the ranking of the constituent components of activities (e.g., going through a turnstile, sitting in one's seat) by their relative risk of infection, even when the probability of infection is unknown or uncertain. We prove that the model is a good approximation of a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks. A linearity assumption governing several potentially modifiable risks factors-such as duration of the activity, density of participants, and infectiousness of the attendees-makes interpreting and using the model straightforward, and we argue that it does so without significantly diminishing the reliability of the model.","output":"Modeling the relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform risk-cost-benefit analyses of activities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hearing of children's experiences and fears can bring back unhappy memories that temporarily paralyze or haunt you [ ]if your program or home is in a neighborhood characterized by violence or poverty, you are likely to experience the same ongoing traumas as the children you teach According to the NCTSN (2011) and the Administration for Children & Families (n d ), the terms STS and compassion fatigue are interchangeable and refer to the same condition Other symptoms resemble those experienced by individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as fear, guilt, anxiety, apathy, sense of hopelessness, sleep disturbances, nightmares and intrusive thoughts, hypervigilance, short-temperedness, and a denial of problems Here are some ideas: * Physical needs: regularly eat nutritiously balanced meals;sleep adequately;exercise regularly;and monitor and attend to your health needs, making and keeping needed doctor and dental appointments and taking any medications as prescribed * Social needs: cultivate and maintain close friendships","output":"Preventing Compassion Fatigue: Caring for Yourself"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Science may be failing to convince a significant number of people about COVID-19 scientific facts and needed public health measures.

METHODS Sixty-three participants with current or previous mild or moderate MDD and self-reported executive deficits were included and randomized to nine sessions of either GMT (two hours, once weekly; n = 35) or computerized cognitive training (one hour, twice weekly; n = 28). Assessments were conducted at baseline (T1), immediately following training (T2), and at six-month follow-up (T3).

It helps the entry of novel coronavirus (n-CoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the host cell. Successful inhibition of the TMPRSS2 can be one of the crucial strategies to stop the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, a set of bioactive molecules from Morus alba Linn. were screened against the TMPRSS2 through two widely used molecular docking engines such as Autodock vina and Glide. Molecules having a higher binding affinity toward the TMPRSS2 compared to Camostat and Ambroxol were considered for in-silico pharmacokinetic analyses. Based on acceptable pharmacokinetic parameters and drug-likeness, finally, five molecules were found to be important for the TMPRSS2 inhibition. A number of bonding interactions in terms of hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions were observed between the proposed molecules and ligand-interacting amino acids of the TMPRSS2. The dynamic behavior and stability of best-docked complex between TRMPRSS2 and proposed molecules were assessed through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Several parameters from MD simulation have suggested the stability between the protein and ligands. Binding free energy of each molecule calculated through MM-GBSA approach from the MD simulation trajectory suggested strong affection toward the TMPRSS2. Hence, proposed molecules might be crucial chemical components for the TMPRSS2 inhibition.

Therefore, it is important to understand the physical properties of TMD-TMD vertical heterostructures for their applications in next-generation electronic devices. However, the conventional synthesis process of TMD-TMD heterostructures has some critical limitations, such as nonreproducibility and low yield. In this paper, we synthesize wafer-scale MoS2-WS2 vertical heterostructures (MWVHs) using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) via penetrative single-step sulfurization discovered by time-dependent analysis. This method is available for fabricating uniform large-area vertical heterostructures (4 in.) at a low temperature (300 C). MWVHs were characterized using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, which revealed their uniform nanoscale polycrystallinity and the presence of vertical layers of MoS2 and WS2. In addition, wafer-scale MWVHs diodes were fabricated and demonstrated uniform performance by current mapping. Furthermore, mode I fracture tests were performed using large double cantilever beam specimens to confirm the separation of the MWVHs from the SiO2/Si substrate. Therefore, this study proposes a synthesis mechanism for TMD-TMD heterostructures and provides a fundamental understanding of the interfacial properties of TMD-TMD vertical heterostructures.","output":"Low-Temperature Synthesis of Wafer-Scale MoS2-WS2 Vertical Heterostructures by Single-Step Penetrative Plasma Sulfurization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long COVID remains a broadly defined syndrome, with estimates of prevalence and duration varying widely.

However, the existing methods for training an image segmentation model have been based on an unrealistic assumption that the training set for each local client is annotated in a similar fashion and thus follows the same image supervision level. To relax this assumption, in this work, we propose a label-agnostic unified federated learning framework, named FedMix, for medical image segmentation based on mixed image labels. In FedMix, each client updates the federated model by integrating and effectively making use of all available labeled data ranging from strong pixel-level labels, weak bounding box labels, to weakest image-level class labels. Based on these local models, we further propose an adaptive weight assignment procedure across local clients, where each client learns an aggregation weight during the global model update. Compared to the existing methods, FedMix not only breaks through the constraint of a single level of image supervision, but also can dynamically adjust the aggregation weight of each local client, achieving rich yet discriminative feature representations. To evaluate its effectiveness, experiments have been carried out on two challenging medical image segmentation tasks, i.e., breast tumor segmentation and skin lesion segmentation.

Yet, traumatic stress reactions to future, indirect trauma exposure, and non-Criterion A events exist, suggesting COVID-19 is also a traumatic stressor which could lead to PTSD symptomology. To examine this idea, we asked a sample of online participants (N = 1,040), in five western countries, to indicate the COVID-19 events they had been directly exposed to, events they anticipated would happen in the future, and other forms of indirect exposure such as through media coverage. We then asked participants to complete the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5, adapted to measure pre/peri/post-traumatic reactions in relation to COVID-19. We also measured general emotional reactions (e.g., angry, anxious, helpless), well-being, psychosocial functioning, and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. We found participants had PTSD-like symptoms for events that had not happened and when participants had been directly (e.g., contact with virus) or indirectly exposed to COVID-19 (e.g., via media). Moreover, 13.2% of our sample were likely PTSD-positive, despite types of COVID-19 exposure (e.g., lockdown) not fitting DSM-5 criteria. The emotional impact of worst experienced/anticipated events best predicted PTSD-like symptoms. Taken together, our findings support emerging research that COVID-19 can be understood as a traumatic stressor event capable of eliciting PTSD-like responses and exacerbating other related mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression, psychosocial functioning, etc.).

DESIGN We performed a laboratory study to assess the ability of 2 commercially available portable GUV devices to inactivate 2 common cold coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on the surface of whole N95 respirators and coupons cut from those respirators. We experimentally contaminated N95 respirators with coronavirus cultures and then assessed viral inactivation after GUV exposure by plaque assay, the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay, and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS We found that GUV could efficiently inactivate coronaviruses on the surface of N95 masks, with an average reduction in viral titers of 5-log for HCoV-229E, 3-log for HCoV-OC43, and 5-log for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the GUV susceptibility of HCoV-229E was similar on coupons and whole N95 respirators. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that diverse human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, are susceptible to GUV inactivation, and 2 scalable portable GUV devices were effective in inactivating coronaviruses on N95 respirators.

Welfare is measured in terms of Sens (Sen, J Public Econ 4:387C403, 1974) index which is inequality (distributional) sensitive. If the authoritys sole target is to lower unemployment, the policy fails miserably because it not only raises unemployment but also worsens welfare. On the contrary, if the policy aims at both rural infrastructure development and additional employment creation, it does not necessarily worsen social welfare. However, the rural employment generation program may turn out to be counterproductive in the latter case provided the urban region is relatively more labour abundant vis-a-vis the entire rural region. Numerical examples are constructed to validate the sufficient and necessary condition leading to the counterproductive outcome.

This work explores how protein states can be manipulated through controllability analysis: the determination of the minimum manipulation needed to drive the cell system to any desired state. Here, we complete a two-part controllability analysis of two protein networks: a host network representing the healthy cell state and an influenza A virus-host network representing the infected cell state. In this context, controllability analyses aim to identify key regulating host factors of the infected cells progression. This knowledge can be utilized in further biological analysis to understand disease dynamics and isolate proteins for study as drug target candidates. RESULTS: Both topological and controllability analyses provide evidence of wide-reaching network effects stemming from the addition of viral-host protein interactions. Virus interacting and driver host proteins are significant both topologically and in controllability, therefore playing important roles in cell behavior during infection. Functional analysis finds overlap of results with previous siRNA studies of host factors involved in influenza replication, NF-kB pathway and infection relevance, and roles as interferon regulating genes. 24 proteins are identified as holding regulatory roles specific to the infected cell by measures of topology, controllability, and functional role. These proteins are recommended for further study as potential antiviral drug targets. CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal outbreaks of influenza A virus are a major cause of illness and death around the world each year with a constant threat of pandemic infection. This research aims to increase the efficiency of antiviral drug target discovery using existing protein-protein interaction data and network analysis methods.

Main outcome methods Data were collected on key characteristics of patients accessing urgent care from 23 March to 3 May 2020. Analysis was with descriptive statistics. Results There were 1,746 patient triages (1,595 telephone and 151 face-to-face), resulting in 1,322 clinical consultations. The most common diagnoses were symptomatic irreversible pulpitis or apical periodontitis. Sixty-five percent of clinical consultations resulted in extractions and 0.8% in an aerosol generating procedure. Patients travelled 25 km on average to access care; however, this reduced as more urgent care centres were established. The majority of patients were asymptomatic of COVID-19 and, to our knowledge, no staff acquired infection due to occupational exposure. Conclusion The urgent dental care centre effectively managed urgent and emergency dental care, with appropriate patient pathways established over the six-week period.

The current state of the art available on textile functionalisation techniques, the improvements obtained by using MS, and the potential of diamond-like-carbon (DLC) coatings on fabrics for medical applications will be discussed in this review in order to contribute to a higher knowledge of functionalized textiles themes.","output":"Carbon-Based Coatings in Medical Textiles Surface Functionalisation: An Overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is a reflective account in which one person who has been around long enough to see a good bit considers how COVID-19 might change the general contours of the world Design/methodology/approachThis paper follows a broadly based and relatively unstructured approach, based on personal understandings and whatever rigor might have been gained by a life spent thinking about research design and the limits of methodology FindingsThe opposite of what many others believe will happen is argued for Things will change more than we wish Most will change for the worse Research limitations/implicationsAccounting research will have a role to play, but to have impact, this study will require that researchers adopt a much more critical perspective about capitalism and its consequences than before Practical implicationsEveryone must do the best they can Everyone must learn to accept the new and not rage to restore that which existed in before times Social implicationsHarsher climate of interpersonal relations will be realized Originality/valueThis paper is more about change than about accounting A 30,000-foot level analysis that does not try to provide many examples An effort to rise above the specifics that vary across the world","output":"Lessons we never wanted to learn: pandemic as pedagogy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite prophylactic anticoagulant treatments, thrombotic complications may develop in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) This study aimed to evaluate the factors influencing anti-factor Xa activity in COVID-19 patients receiving low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) We prospectively evaluated 80 COVID-19 patients, diagnosed using polymerase chain reaction test, who were admitted to our clinic and administered LMWH;LMWH (enoxaparin) was applied according to the weight, D-dimer levels, and clinical condition of patients Anti-factor Xa activity in blood, drawn 4 h after the 3rd dose of LMWH, was measured and an activity of 4%, 6 were in group 1 ((6/13) 46 2%), while 8 were in group 2 ((8/63) 11 9%);(p = 0 009), and all had a D-dimer level &lt; 1 g/mL (p = 0 03) ROC analysis for the presence of anticoagulation at subprophylactic level revealed an area under curve of 0 79 (95% CI: 0 64C0 93);p = 0 001) In conclusion;Elevated eosinophil count is related to lower anti-factor Xa activity in patients with COVID-19 receiving LMWH The clinical significance of the subprophylactic anti-factor Xa activity should be studied in COVID-19 patients (NCT04507282) FAU - Ari, Selma","output":"Elevated eosinophil count is related with lower anti-factor Xa activity in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nCOVID-19 has wreaked our normal lifestyle and has forced us to adopt the protocols under the new normal regime The conventional diagnostic approach is expected to change in the process as well Our research group is proposing an aid to such diagnostic approach The group has proposed in this article the power of using two such diagnostic measures that has been the pivot for many diagnoses to the doctors The art of using natural language processing based symptomatic measure in combination with a machine learning based approach based on medical vitals can collectively reduce the error percentage of detection The approach proposed in this article is a first of its kind and the authors have achieved acceptable results on the accuracy front The other reason of proposing such a technique is the way a fusion algorithm can arrive at the right results from two parallel algorithms doing the same task Another objective of the group was to provide a valuable opinion to the doctor in form of such an architecture The proposed architecture can be used at any point of care facilities without any requirement of escalation of the existing amenities ? 2021 IEEE","output":"A Dual Diagnostic Measure driven pragmatic approach for nCOVID-19 Detection by Pervasive Computing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In connection with a hospital stay, patients have to make important health-related decisions. They need to find, understand, assess and apply health-related information, and therefore, require health literacy. Adequately responding to the needs of patients requires promoting the communication skills of healthcare professionals within healthcare organisations. Health-literate healthcare organisations can provide an environment strengthening professionals' and patients' health literacy. When developing health-literate healthcare organisations, it has to be considered that implementing organisational change is typically challenging. In this study, a communication concept based on previously evaluated communication training is codesigned, implemented and evaluated in four clinical departments of a university hospital. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: In a codesign phase, focus group interviews among employees and patients as well as a workshop series with employees and hospital management are used to tailor the communication concept to the clinical departments and to patients' needs. Also, representatives responsible for the topic of health literacy are established among employees. The communication concept is implemented over a 12-month period; outcomes studied are health literacy on the organisational and patient levels. Longitudinal survey data acquired from a control cohort prior to the implementation phase are compared with data of an intervention cohort after the implementation phase. Moreover, survey data from healthcare professionals before and after the implementation are compared. For formative evaluation, healthcare professionals are interviewed in focus groups. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Oldenburg and is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Study participants are asked to provide written informed consent. The results are disseminated via direct communication within the hospital, publications and conference presentations. If the intervention turns out to be successful, the intervention and implementation strategies will be made available to other hospitals.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional survey of Sydney residents during WHO Phase 5 of pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Members of the public were approached in shopping and pedestrian malls in seven areas of Sydney between 2 May and 29 May 2009 to undertake the survey. The survey was also made available by email. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Perceived personal risk and seriousness of the disease, opinion on the government and health authorities' response, feelings about quarantine and infection control methods, and potential compliance with antiviral prophylaxis. RESULTS Of 620 respondents, 596 (96%) were aware of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, but 44% (273/620) felt they did not have enough information about the situation. More than a third (38%; 235/620) ranked their risk of catching influenza during a pandemic as low. When asked how they felt pandemic influenza would affect their health if they were infected, only a third (33%; 206/620) said \\"very seriously\\". Just over half of the respondents (58%; 360/620) believed the pandemic would be over within a year. Respondents rated quarantine and vaccination with a pandemic vaccine as more effective than hand hygiene for the prevention of pandemic influenza.

This lack of priority results in inadequate and unbalanced food intake in patients and huge amounts of wasted food. OBJECTIVES We evaluate the main factors that are associated with reduced meal intake in hospitalized patients and the differences between geographical regions. DESIGN We conducted a descriptive analysis of data from 9 consecutive, annual, and cross-sectional nutritionDay samples (2006-2014) in a total of 91,245 adult patients in 6668 wards in 2584 hospitals in 56 countries. A general estimation equation methodology was used to develop a model for meal intake, and P-value thresholding was used for model selection. RESULTS The proportion of patients who ate a full meal varied widely (24.7-61.5%) across world regions. The factors that were most strongly associated with reduced food intake on nutritionDay were reduced intake during the previous week (OR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.22), confinement to bed (OR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.55), female sex (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.5, 0.56), younger age (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.85) and older age (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.74; 0.88), and low body mass index (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.90). The pattern of associated factors was homogenous across world regions. CONCLUSIONS A set of factors that are associated with full meal intake was identified and is applicable to patients hospitalized in any region of the world. Thus, the likelihood for reduced food intake is easily estimated through access to patient characteristics, independent of world regions, and enables the easy personalization of food provision.

FBG feedback enhances the stability of P1 oscillations compared to the conventional mirror feedback in the form of P1 microwave linewidth and phase noise reduction and residual noise peaks suppression. In the proposed scheme, the FBG has a narrow bandwidth smaller than the laser relaxation oscillation frequency. Then it effectively suppresses the coherence collapse of the laser by filtered feedback. Hence it can keep the laser in P1 operation even under relatively strong feedback. Besides, a uniform FBG has a comb-filtered reflectivity spectrum with a main lobe surrounded by several side lobes. Hence it can limit the external cavity modes by each lobe. As a result, FBG feedback can reduce microwave linewidth and phase noise by sustaining stronger feedback power and improve side-peak suppression ratio (SPSR) by filtering external cavity modes. The effects of stabilization are enhanced by properly increasing grating bandwidth. By fine-tuning the feedback delay time, the microwave linewidth can be reduced to a local minimum which reveals the optimal locking between P1 frequency and one of the external cavity modes. Increasing the feedback delay time, the local minimum linewidth can be further reduced. FBG feedback reduces the microwave linewidth by up to more than an order of magnitude and improves the SPSR by up to more than two orders of magnitude than mirror feedback using the same delay time.","output":"Stable period-one oscillations in a semiconductor laser under optical feedback from a narrowband fiber Bragg grating"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED Pulse oximetry has been recommended for neonatal screening for critical congenital heart defects (CCHD) and is now performed in several countries where most births take place in hospital.

Methods: This retrospective study included 155 consecutive eyes from 124 patients with at least three-month follow-up who underwent PPV for PDR without neovascularization of the iris or angles and NVG. Demographic data, surgery notes, postoperative hyphema assessment, intraocular pressure (IOP), and the surgical outcome were recorded. Results: Postoperative hyphema occurred in 18 of 155 eyes (11.6%), with 14 of those having hyphema on day 1, and 4 having hyphema on days 7-20. Of the 18 eyes, only 3 (16.7%) had normal IOP, and immediate intraocular hypertension was observed in 15 (83.3%). Seven eyes required anterior chamber paracentesis and five needed anterior chamber irrigation. The average time for absorption of the hyphema was 13.1 days, and IOP was controlled in all cases. There was a significant correlation between membrane removal and the development of hyphema (OR = 5.65 and 95% CI: 1.190-25.203; p = 0.013). No recurrence of hyphema was observed.

India carries the highest share of the global TB burden. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted diagnosis of TB in India, yet there is limited data on how TB case reporting has changed since the pandemic began and which factors determine differences in case notification. METHODS: We utilized publicly available data on TB case reporting through the Indian Central TB Division from January 2017 through April of 2021 (prior to the first COVID-19 related lockdown). Using a Poisson model, we estimated seasonal and yearly patterns in TB case notification in India from January 2017 through February 2020 and extended this estimate as the counterfactual expected TB cases notified from March 2020 through April 2021. We characterized the differences in case notification observed and those expected in the absence of the pandemic by State and Territory. We then performed a linear regression to examine the relationship between the logit ratio of reported TB to counterfactual cases and mask use, mobility, daily hospitalizations/100,000 population, and public/total TB case reporting. RESULTS: We found 1,320,203 expected cases of TB (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 1,309,612 to 1,330,693) were not reported during the period from March 2020 through April 2021. This represents a 63.3% difference (95% UI 62.8 to 63.8) in reporting. We found that mobility data and average hospital admissions per month per population were correlated with differences in TB case notification, compared to the counterfactual in the absence of the pandemic (p > 0.001). CONCLUSION: There was a large difference between reported TB cases in India and those expected in the absence of the pandemic. This information can help inform the Indian TB program as they consider interventions to accelerate case finding and notification once the pandemic related TB service disruptions improve. Mobility data and hospital admissions are surrogate measures that correlate with a greater difference in reported/expected TB cases and may correlate with a disruption in TB diagnostic services. However, further research is needed to clarify this association and identify other key contributors to gaps in TB case notifications in India.

Phytoconstituents from Glycyrrhiza glabra, earlier reported to be anticancerous in nature were used as repurposed drugs against SARS CoV-2 main protease 3Clpro. We analyzed the molecular interactions of protein-phytocompounds, by AutoDock Vina 4.2 tools. The best interactions of each algorithm were subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to have an insight of the molecular dynamic mechanisms involved. Selected phytoconstituents gave a good score for binding affinity with the main protease 6LU7 of SARS CoV-2 as compared to the antiviral drugs already being used in the disease therapy. DehydroglyasperinC(-8.7,-8.1,-6.7,-7.1)kcal/mol, Licochalcone D(-8.4,-8.2,-7.1,-7.9) kcal/mol, Liquiritin(-8.6,-9.0,-7.2,-7.8) kcal/mol have showed energy interactions with 3Clpro better than many FDA approved repurposed drugs; Remdesvir, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine. MD Simulation also corelates our findings for molecular docking studies.","output":"Glossary of phytoconstituents: Can these be repurposed against SARS CoV-2?

This study is an evaluation of the use of PC during the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at a single hospital. METHODS: Fifty patients with AC were admitted as of the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey through June 2020. Patients with pancreatitis, cholangitis, and/or incomplete data were excluded from the study. Data of the remaining 36 patients included in the study were recorded and a descriptive statistical analysis was performed. The patients were divided into three groups: PC (n=14), only conservative treatment with antibiotherapy (OC) (n=14), and LC (n=8). The findings were compared with a group of 70 similar patients from the pre-pandemic period. RESULTS: The mean age of the pandemic period patients was 53 years (range: 26-78 years). The female/male ratio was 1.11. PC was preferred in eight (11%) patients in the same period of the previous year, whereas 14 (39%) patients underwent PC in the pandemic period. Four of the 36 pandemic patients were positive for COVID-19, including one member of the PC group. There was one (7.1%) mortality in the pandemic-period PC group due to cardiac arrest. The length of hospital stay between the groups based on the type of treatment was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: LC is not recommended during the pandemic period; PC can be an effective and safe alternative for the treatment of AC.","output":"Percutaneous cholecystostomy instead of laparoscopy to treat acute cholecystitis during the COVID-19 pandemic period: single center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) is one of major pathogens of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) have been implicated in various biological processes, but they have not been associated with CVA16 infection. In this study, we comprehensively characterized the landscape of IncRNAs of normal and CVA16 infected rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells using RNA-Seq to investigate the functional relevance of IncRNAs. We showed that a total of 760 IncRNAs were upregulated and 1210 IncRNAs were downregulated. Out of these dysregulated IncRNAs, 43.64% were intergenic, 22.31% were sense, 15.89% were intronic, 8.67% were bidirectional, 5.59% were antisense, 3.85% were sRNA host IncRNAs and 0.05% were enhancer. Six dysregulated IncRNAs were validated by quantitative PCR assays and the secondary structures of these IncRNAs were projected. Moreover, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis of an IncRNAs (ENST00000602478) to elucidate the diversity of modification and functions of IncRNAs. In summary, the current study compared the dysregulated IncRNAs profile upon CVA16 challenge and illustrated the intricate relationship between coding and IncRNAs transcripts. These results may not only provide a complete picture of transcription in CVA16 infected cells but also provide novel molecular targets for treatments of HFMD.

Spain has had one of the highest burdens of COVID-19 worldwide. During this period, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Burn Center (Barcelona) has faced a unique challenge: supporting the hospital response against COVID whilst continued offering an optimal care to the burn patient. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of acute burn patients who received urgent health care or admission to the our Burn Center during the mandatory confinement period in Spain forced by the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We analyzed the medical records of burn patients who received urgent care and/or admission to our Burn Center during the mandatory confinement period in Spain (Period 1: from March 14th to May 9th, 2020) and during the same period of the last year (Period 2: from March 14th to May 9th, 2019). Both groups were compared in order to find differences in the epidemiologic profile of burned patients. RESULTS: A total of 350 burns cases were analyzed. A 36% reduction in the number of emergency department visits was identified during Period 1. However, we found an increase in the rate of hospital admissions in Period 1 (20% of the burn cases) compared with Period 2 (13% of the burn cases). Seventy-six burn-related primary admissions were analyzed: 37 patients were admitted during Period 1 and 39 patients during Period 2. No differences were found between the two periods in the proportion of patients that underwent surgical treatment: 59.5% of patients admitted during Period 1 and 61.5% of patients admitted during Period 2. A statistically significant increase was noted in the rate of paediatric (aged 0-16 years old) admissions during Period 1 (40.54%, n = 15) compared to Period 2 (20.5%, n = 8). Among paediatric patients, an increase in the rate of surgical procedures was noted in Period 1 (47% of children), compared with Period 2 (37% of children). Proportion of patients that were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit was higher among burn children admitted during period 1 (46.7%, n = 7) than those admitted during Period 2 (25%, n = 2). Among the 37 patients admitted during the lockdown period, two positive COVID-19 patients were confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives an overview of the clinical and epidemiologic profile of burned patients during the stringent lockdown in Spain forced by the COVID-19 epidemic. Our data shows a stable trend in the number of burn-related admissions and burn related-surgeries during the confinement period. A significant increase in the rate of burn children admitted and an increase in the severity of injuries in this population is noted. These data must be taken in account in the development of strategies to ensure the maintenance of Burn Centers function in extremely situations such as the current epidemic. A lack of effective burn prevention campaigns in our environment has been noted and the development of focused prevention strategies is a priority.","output":"Changes in the epidemiologic profile of burn patients during the lockdown in Catalonia (Spain): A warning call to strengthen prevention strategies in our community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O Projeto de Lei (PL) 9.236/2017 foi aprovado pela Camara dos Deputados no dia 26 de mar?o de 2020 e tudo indica que deve ser rapidamente ratificado pelo Senado Federal, seguindo ent?o para san??o presidencial.

METHOD In a cross-sectional online survey, we collected data on psychiatric morbidity and potential risk factors from 426 Nigerian social media users, who self-identified as participants or non-participants in a recent anti-police protest. RESULTS We found elevated rates of psychiatric morbidity, with worse outcomes for protesters compared to non-protesters (psychological distress [44.2% vs 29.8%], depression [26.0% vs 14.9%], anxiety [51.0% vs 29.8%], post-traumatic stress disorder [7.4% vs 1.8%], current substance use [11.2% vs 4.5%] and suicidal ideation [7.1% vs 4.4%], respectively). After adjusting for the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and previous mental health diagnosis, the predictors of poor mental health among non-protesters were being unmarried (odds ratio = 7.4, p = 0.01) and low resilience (odds ratio range = 4.1-5.4, p < 0.03) while for the protesters, the predictors were low resilience (odds ratio range = 2.9-4.7, p < 0.01), being from Northern Nigeria (odds ratio = 4.7, p < 0.01) or residing in Northern Nigeria (odds ratio = 2.8, p = 0.03), being under-/unemployed (odds ratio range = 2.1-2.5, p < 0.04), holding the view that the protest was caused by the state of the economy (odds ratio = 2.0, p = 0.01), belief that the protest had a direct negative impact on the protester (odds ratio = 2.3, p = 0.04) and willingness to participate in future protests (odds ratio = 4.13, p = 0.02).

The questionnaire link was extensively distributed among the whole population both through popular social media platforms and by nutrition and health workers of health offices and medical universities of all provinces. The questionnaire included questions about socio\\\\demographic characteristics, changes in frequency of fast food consumption as compared with before pandemic, and the reasons for these changes. RESULTS: A total of 21,290 households took part in the study of whom 89.8% were male\\\\headed, and almost 74% were from urban areas. Decrease in fast food consumption was reported by 74.8%, while increase in fast food consumption was reported by 2% of the households during the COVID\\\\19 quarantine. Among those who decreased their fast food consumption, about 82% had completely omitted them from their food baskets. Fear of contamination of fast foods by coronavirus and increase in the number of people at home were the most and the least frequent reasons for decreasing fast food consumption, respectively.

Assessment of verbal STM/WM is critical for identifying and addressing these delays, but standard assessment procedures require face-to-face (FTF) administration. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and validity of remote testing methods (teleassessment) of verbal STM/WM in youth with CIs as a method of addressing COVID-19-related restrictions on FTF test administration. Method Tests of verbal STM/WM for nonwords, digit spans, letter-number sequences, sentences, and stories were individually administered by speech-language pathologists over a teleassessment platform to 28 youth (aged 9-22 years) with CIs and 36 same-aged normal-hearing peers. Examiners, parents, and participants completed quality and satisfaction ratings with the teleassessment procedure. Teleassessment scores were compared to results of tests obtained at FTF visits an average of 1.6 years earlier. Results Quality and satisfaction ratings for teleassessment were high and in almost all cases did not differ between the CI and normal-hearing samples. Youth with CIs scored lower than normal-hearing peers on measures of verbal STM/WM, and scores for digit span and letter-number sequencing did not differbetween teleassessment and FTF methods. Correlations across teleassessment and FTF visits were strong for digit span, letter-number sequencing, and sentence memory, but were more modest for nonword repetition.

Optimal harvest time ensuring target quality for the final product varies in relation to the effect of many intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Therefore, its determination necessitates thorough examination of each case. The present study explores the impact of six harvest times on volatile profile and quality attributes of olive oils from Chondrolia Chalkidikis Greek cultivar. All samples examined were classified Virgin Olive Oils (VOOs) according to findings of acidity, peroxide, and K values. The low values for the principal official quality indices, the high oleic acid percentages (76C78%), the high oxidative stabilities (up to 36 h induction period), and phenols content (606C290 mg/kg) were considered nutritionally promising. Total phenols, carotenoids and chlorophylls contents, as well as oxidative stability (induction period values) decreased with ripening. Harvest time had a strong impact on HS-SPMECGCCMS volatile fingerprint. Optimal volatile profiles were related to intermediate examined ripening stages. Fatty acid composition did not show remarkable trends. Chondrolia Chalkidikis VOOs perform as interesting candidates of high quality. Findings of the study may support existing databases with scientific records for Chondrolia Chalkidikis VOOs, boost their competitiveness in the global market, and encourage worldwide exploitation of VOOs from similar cultivars (table olives oriented).","output":"Volatile profile and quality characteristics of the Greek Chondrolia Chalkidikis virgin olive oils: effect of ripening stage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To test and explore whether more positive coparenting will significantly predict lower COVID-19-related stress across family configurations and dynamics and across both higher- and lower-income mothers, we developed and circulated an online survey among mothers from the U.S. and Canada.

Due to the rapid spread of the (Covid-19), various countries are facing a major health crisis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) an effective way to protect people from Covid-19 is to wear medical masks in public areas. It is very difficult to manually monitor people in public places and detect the face mask in the video. which is mainly because the mask itself acts as an obstruction to the face detection algorithm, because there are no face signs in the mask area. Therefore, automatic face mask detection system helps authorities to identify people who may be susceptible to infections disease. This research aims to use deep learning to automatically detect face masks in videos. The proposed framework consists of two components. The first component is designed for face detection and tracking using OpenCV and machine learning, and in the second component, these facial frames are then processed into our proposed deep transfer learning model MobileNetV2 to identify the mask area. The proposed framework was tested on different videos and images using the smartphone camera. The purpose is to achieve high-precision real-time detection and classification. The model achieved 99.2% accuracy during training and 99.8% validation accuracy. which is better than other recently proposed methods. Experimental results show that the work proposed in this paper can effectively recognize face masks with multiple targets and provide effective personnel surveillance.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the most important predictors of hospital discharge and mortality from measurements at admission for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Electronic records from hospitalized patients. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted between March 3(rd) and August 24(th) with COVID-19 in Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals. EXPOSURES: 216 phenotypic variables collected within 48 hours of admission. MAIN OUTCOMES: We used age-stratified (<60 and >=60 years) random survival forests with competing risks to identify the most important predictors of death and discharge. Fine-Gray competing risk regression (FGR) models were then constructed based on the most important RSF-derived covariates. RESULTS: Of 2212 patients, 1913 were discharged (age 5719, time-to-discharge 911 days) while 279 died (age 7514, time to death 1415 days). Patients >= 60 years were nearly 10 times as likely to die within 60 days of admission as those <60. As the pandemic evolved, the rate of hospital discharge increased in both older and younger patients. Incident death and hospital discharge were accurately predicted by measures of respiratory distress, inflammation, infection, renal function, red cell turn over and cardiac stress. FGR models for each of hospital discharge and mortality as outcomes based on these variables performed well in the older (AUC 080C085 at 60-days) and younger populations (AUC >090 at 60-days). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We identified markers collected within 2 days of admission that predict hospital discharge and mortality in COVID-19 patients and provide prediction models that may be used to guide patient care. Our proposed model suggests that hospital discharge and mortality can be forecasted with high accuracy based on 8C10 variables at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also point to several specific pathways that could be the focus of future investigations directed at reducing mortality and expediting hospital discharge among COVID-19 patients.

Early diagnosis is crucial to ameliorate its prognosis. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) and narrow band imaging (NBI) have been extensively applied in gastroscopy, particularly when it comes to the detection and management of premalignant gastric lesion. Our meta-analysis intends to appraise the diagnostic capability and compare the efficacy of NBI and CLE for focal precancerous state of gastric cancer. METHODS: We performed a literature search up to November 5, 2020 in online databases and major conferences. Two investigators assessed the methodological bias by QUADAS-2, followed by sophisticated study selection and data exaction to make a comparison between sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood values, and diagnostic odds ratio. A symmetric summary receiver-operating curve (sROC) and its area under the curve (AUC) were used to estimate threshold effect. Additionally, we evaluated the publication bias by Deeks' asymmetry test. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Four studies involved 248 patients and 526 lesions. In analysis drawn from every lesion, the NBI's pooled sensitivity and specificity were 87% (95% CI: 0.80-0.92) and 85% (95% CI: 0.75-0.91), and those of CLE were 90% (95% CI: 0.85-0.91) and 87% (95% CI: 0.83-0.91). CLE illustrated that the pooled two were slightly higher than NBI when compared at the level of every lesion. The AUC for NBI and CLE was 0.92 (0.90-0.94) and 0.95 (0.92-0.96), and there might be a threshold effect, according to the shoulder-like distribution of scatter points in the sROC.

This review aimed to examine the treatment gaps and challenges that burden Philippine epilepsy care. MATERIALS & METHODS: Pertinent data on epidemiology, research, health financing and health systems, pharmacologic and surgical treatment options, cost of care, and workforce were obtained through a literature search and review of relevant Philippine government websites. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of epilepsy in the Philippines is 0.9%. Epilepsy research in the Philippines is low in quantity compared with the rest of Southeast Asia (SEA). Inequities in quality and quantity of healthcare services delivered to local government units (LGUs) have arisen because of devolution. Programs for epilepsy care by both government and nongovernment institutions have been implemented. Healthcare expenditure in the Philippines is still largely out-of-pocket, with only partial coverage from the public sector. There is limited access to antiseizure medications (ASMs), mainly due to cost. Epilepsy surgery is an underutilized treatment option. There are only 20 epileptologists in the Philippines, with one epileptologist for every 45,000 patients with epilepsy. In addition, epilepsy care service delivery has been further impeded by the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CONCLUSION: There is a large treatment gap in epilepsy care in the Philippines in terms of high epilepsy disease burden, socioeconomic limitations and inadequate public support, sparse clinico-epidemiologic research on epilepsy, inaccessibility of health care services and essential pharmacotherapy, underutilization of surgical options, and lack of specialists capable of rendering epilepsy care.

While attaching a HEPA filter to the endotracheal tube will protect the anesthesia machine and the gas sampling line from contamination, this contributionto the dead space makes ventilation of these small patients challenging. Direct filtration of the gas sampling line eliminates this problem;however, appropriate filters are not readily available. AIMS: Identify a small filter capable of filtering outparticles of a size similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the gas sampling line. METHODS: We used fluorescence microspheres suspended in a solution for a challenge test to determine the filtration efficiency of various filters. The microspheres varied in diameter (0.02 m, 0.042 m, 0.109 m and 0.989 m). A fluorescence plate reader was used to evaluate the degree of fluorescence intensity in the flow-through from various filters and referenced to the fluorescence intensity of the input. RESULTS: AHEPA filter,as recommended as an anti-viral filter, effectively filtered all the particles tested. The B. Braun PERIFIX Flat Epidural Filter was the second most effective filter, filtering particleslarger than 0.042 m.Other filters tested did not filter fluorescence microspheres equivalent in size to a single coronavirus particle (0.07 m).

For this purpose, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted. The hypothesis proposed suggests that adoption of social distancing practices is an outcome of situational awareness which is achieved by the information sources. Results suggest that information sources, formal (P = .001) and informal (P = 0.007) were found to be significantly related to perceived understanding. Findings also indicate that social distancing is significantly influenced by situational awareness, P = .000.

Therefore, it is imperative to understand the possible outcomes of COVID-19. The aim of our study was to evaluate pulmonary function, exercise capacity, residual radiological changes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at follow-up in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia survivors. Materials and Methods: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and radiologically confirmed lung injury, with no chronic lung disease prior to this infection, were included in the study. Patients' evaluation 2 months after their discharge from hospital included spirometry (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC), determination of lung volume (TLC, VC, RV) and diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO, adjusted for hemoglobin), 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), chest CT scan, and 36-Item Short Form General Health Survey (SF-36). Results: Fifty-one patients (25 men, 26 women) were included. The mean age was 56 years (SD-11,72). Eighteen patients (35.3%) had experienced moderate COVID-19, 21 (41.2%) severe COVID-19, and 12 (23.5%) were critically ill. The mean follow-up visit time after the discharge from hospital was 60 days (SD-17). Pulmonary function at follow-up was impaired in 24 (47.2%) patients. Reduced lung volume was observed in 15 (29.4%) patients, DLCO reduction in 15 (29.4%) patients, and only one patient displayed obstruction. Twelve patients out of 51 (12/51, 27.3%) showed reduced physical capacity in the 6 MWT, and 3/51 (9.1%) showed desaturation, with SO2 < 90%. Different levels of abnormality were found in 49/51 (96,1%) patients on follow-up chest CT; the median radiological score was 10.9 (SD  8.87, possible maximal score, 25). Ground-glass opacity was the most common radiological feature, found in 45 (88.2%) patients. The SF-36 scores demonstrated a reduction in health status across all domains, with the lowest scores for limitations in social activities because of physical problems, vitality, and general health. Conclusion: In the group of COVID-19 pneumonia survivors 2 months after hospital discharge, residual changes in the lungs on chest CT and in lung function and reduced physical and HRQoL status were found in a significant number of patients.

Exposure to frequent and often concurrent epidemics may influence how the public and health professionals perceive and respond to epidemic risks. This review aimed to systematically examine the evidence on risk perceptions of epidemic-prone diseases in countries highly vulnerable to epidemics. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using PRISMA standards. We included peer-reviewed studies describing or measuring risk perceptions of epidemic-prone diseases among the general adult population or health professionals in 62 countries considered highly vulnerable to epidemics. We searched seven bibliographic databases and applied a four-stage screening and selection process, followed by quality appraisal. We conducted a narrative meta-synthesis and descriptive summary of the evidence, guided by the Social Amplification of Risk Framework. RESULTS: Fifty-six studies were eligible for the final review. They were conducted in eighteen countries and addressed thirteen epidemic-prone diseases. Forty-five studies were quantitative, six qualitative and five used mixed methods. Forty-one studies described epidemic risk perceptions in the general public and nineteen among health professionals. Perceived severity of epidemic-prone diseases appeared high across public and health professional populations. However, perceived likelihood of acquiring disease varied from low to moderate to high among the general public, and appeared consistently high amongst health professionals. Other occupational groups with high exposure to specific diseases, such as bushmeat handlers, reported even lower perceived likelihood than the general population. Among health professionals, the safety and effectiveness of the work environment and of the broader health system response influenced perceptions. Among the general population, disease severity, familiarity and controllability of diseases were influential factors. However, the evidence on how epidemic risk perceptions are formed or modified in these populations is limited. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence affords some insights into patterns of epidemic risk perception and influencing factors, but inadequately explores what underlies perceptions and their variability, particularly among diseases, populations and over time. Approaches to defining and measuring epidemic risk perceptions are relatively underdeveloped.

METHODS We identified 50 patients with cancelled surgeries between 16 March 2020 and 24 April 2020. Forty-nine (98%) participants were contacted, with whom the modified WES-Pi questionnaire was filled in during a telephone interview. RESULTS Of the 49 respondents, 28 (57.2%) were aged <65 years. The most often reported problem (85.7%) was an ongoing limitation in basic daily activities. At least moderate sadness was experienced by 65.3% and disappointment by 73.5% of the patients. More than 80% reported concerns about the continuation and 73.5% about the progression of their symptoms. Out of 27 employees (55.1%), 63% could not work due to severe pain or movement limitation (p < .001). The inability to work was associated with anger (p = .037). The work-related impact of the cancellation was associated with stress (p < .0001) and concerns about continuing the symptoms (p = .004). Two-third of patients would undergo immediate surgery despite the current epidemic situation. CONCLUSIONS The cancellations of elective spinal surgeries have a serious psychological impact on patients.

However, until now there has been no systematic analysis of typical characteristics of outbreaks, for which closure was considered necessary. This article presents data on features of such nosocomial epidemics published during the past 40 years in the medical literature. A search of the Outbreak Database (1561 nosocomial outbreaks in file) revealed a total of 194 outbreaks that ended up with some kind of closure of the unit (median closure time: 14 days). Closure rates (CRs) were calculated and stratified for medical departments, for causative pathogens, for outbreak sources, and for the assumed mode of transmission. Data were then compared to the overall average CR of 12.4% in the entire database. Wards in geriatric patient care were closed significantly more frequently (CR: 30.3%; P < 0.001) whereas paediatric wards showed a significantly lower CR (6.1%; P = 0.03). Pathogen species with the highest CR were norovirus (44.1%; P < 0.001) and influenza/parainfluenza virus (38.5%; P < 0.001). If patients were the source of the outbreak, the CR was significantly increased (16.7%; P = 0.03). Infections of the central nervous system were most often associated with closure of the ward (24.2%; P = 001).

One of the most widely adopted means of inference of the reproduction number is via the renewal equation, which uses the incidence of infection and the generation time distribution. In this paper, we derive a multi-type equivalent to the renewal equation to estimate a reproduction number which accounts for heterogeneity in transmissibility including through asymptomatic transmission, symptomatic isolation and vaccination. We demonstrate how use of the renewal equation that misses these heterogeneities can result in biased estimates of the reproduction number. While the bias is small with symptomatic isolation, it can be much larger with asymptomatic transmission or transmission from vaccinated individuals if these groups exhibit substantially different generation time distributions to unvaccinated symptomatic transmitters, whose generation time distribution is often well defined. The bias in estimate becomes larger with greater population size or transmissibility of the poorly characterized group.

This paper systematically reviews the scientific literature regarding whether non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed could introduce or transmit viral pathogens of swine into or within the United States. The purpose of this review is to identify, evaluate, and summarize the relevant scientific knowledge, published through March 2018, and to identify information gaps and research needs, thereby making the available evidence more accessible to policy makers, the swine industry, and the scientific community. A total of 26 documents were selected for the final review process, which included experimental studies, case reports, epidemiological investigations, and scientific opinion, among others. The review found that the scientific literature has addressed some critical experimental questions pertaining to transmission of swine viruses via feed and feed ingredients, but the current body of scientific knowledge lacks conclusive evidence of virus contamination of non-animal origin feed ingredients of commercial swine feed, particularly for imported commodities, and further investigation into the epidemiology of virus transmission via feed to swine under field conditions through natural feeding behavior is warranted. Additional studies of how imported ingredients of commercial swine feed are sourced, processed, transported and, thus, contaminated prior to importation into the United States are needed.

It is common to use meta-analysis to combine analysis results from different studies to make it more reproducible. In this paper, we propose to run multiple analyses on the same set of data to produce a more robust list of risk factors. With our time-to-event survival data, the standard survival analysis were extended in three directions. The first is to extend from tests and corresponding p-values to machine learning and their prediction performance. The second is to extend from single-variable to multiple-variable analysis. The third is to expand from analyzing time-to-decease data with death as the event of interest to analyzing time-to-hospital-release data to treat early recover as a meaningful event as well. Our extension of the type of analyses leads to ten ranking lists. We conclude that 20 out of 30 factors are deemed to be reliably associated to faster-death or faster-recovery.

The overall goal of this paper is to identify key lessons learned to help inform future delivery of remote MI delivery. METHODS: HE perceptions and experiences regarding the transition from in-person to remote delivery of MI for 21 families were captured through a video recorded discussion. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes and subthemes and key learnings from the transition experience. RESULTS: Five themes were identified including: 1) Impact of COVID-19 on families; 2) Scheduling, no-shows, and cancellations; 3) Preference of online video versus phone; 4) Building rapport with remote delivery; 5) HE work satisfaction. Based on these results, several key learnings were identified to improve remote MI-counseling, including using online video platforms versus phone calls, providing families the necessary information and technical support to improve acceptability, using specific strategies to enhance rapport and child engagement, and asking probing questions to elicit deeper reflection. CONCLUSION: Specific considerations regarding rapport building including more frequent check-ins to demonstrate commitment to the family's success, and effective communication strategies including asking more probing questions that elicit complex reflection can support successful transition of MI-counseling from in-person to remote delivery among families with young children. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our practice recommendations based on key learnings from MI practitioners during the transition from in-person to remote MI-counseling can support healthcare professionals looking to transition MI-counseling services to remote delivery.","output":"Transitioning a home-based, motivational interviewing intervention among families to remote delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic: Key lessons learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study evaluates a specialist weight management service and compares outcomes in participants referred to the service undergoing either surgery or non\\\\surgical routes to support weight loss.

The design unconfounded the election outcome announcement from the vote itself, allowing more precise testing of predictions derived from cognitive dissonance theory. As predicted, perceived election legitimacy increased among Democrats, from the first to the second week following Election Day, as their expected Biden win was confirmed, whereas perceived election legitimacy decreased among Republicans as their expected President Trump win was disconfirmed. From the first to the second week following Election Day, Republicans reported stronger negative emotions and weaker positive emotions while Democrats reported stronger positive emotions and weaker negative emotions. The polarized perceptions of election legitimacy were correlated with the tendencies to trust and consume polarized media. Consumption of Fox News was associated with lowered perceptions of election legitimacy over time whereas consumption of other outlets was associated with higher perceptions of election legitimacy over time.

In this study, we aim to identify the determinants of anxiety in physicians on duty in coronavirus wards or quarantine centers. Methods: : We conducted a cross-sectional quantitative survey with an additional qualitative item. Five constructs of workload, exhaustion, family strain, feeling of protection, and anxiety were measured using items from two validated tools. Modifications were made for regional relevance. Factor analysis was performed showing satisfactory Cronbach alpha results. Overall, 103 physicians completed the questionnaire. Results: : T-test results revealed significant associations between gender and anxiety. Structural equation modeling identified that high workload contributed to greater exhaustion (=0.41, R 2 =0.17, p<0.001) and greater family strain (=0.47, R 2 =0.22, p<0.001). Exhaustion (=0.17, p<0.005), family strain (=0.34, p<0.001), and feelings of protection (=-0.30, p<0.001) significantly explained anxiety (R 2 =0.28). Qualitative findings further identified specific needs of physicians with regard to protective equipment, compensation, quarantine management, resource allocation, security and public support, governance improvement, and health sector development. Conclusions: : It is imperative to improve governmental and social support for physicians and other healthcare providers during the corona pandemic.

IFN signaling then requires IRF9 for the expression of the full array of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) ultimately defining the antiviral state of the cell. Other members of the IRF family clearly play a role in mediating or modulating IFN responses, such as IRF1, IRF2 or IRF5, however their relative contribution to mounting a functional antiviral response is much less understood. In this study, we systematically and comparatively assessed the impact of six members of the IRF family on antiviral signaling in alveolar epithelial cells.

APPROACH: The pilot ALiEM Connect event was conceptualized and implemented within a 2-week period in March 2020. The pilot was livestreamed via a combination of Zoom and YouTube and was archived by YouTube. Slack was used as a backchannel to allow interaction with other participants and engagement with the speakers (via moderators who posed questions from the backchannel to the speakers live during the videoconference). OUTCOMES: The RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework was used for program evaluation, showing that 64 U.S. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited emergency medicine residency programs participated in the pilot event, with 1,178 unique users during the event (reach). For effectiveness, 93% (139/149) of trainees reported the pilot as enjoyable and 85% (126/149) reported it was equivalent to or better than their usual academic proceedings. Adoption for ALiEM Connect was fairly good with 64/237 (27%) of invited residency programs registering and participating in the pilot event.

We conducted a systematic review and comparative meta-analysis of VCM and LZD efficacy against proven MRSA pneumonia. METHODS We searched EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and PubMed until November 2019. The outcomes of the meta-analysis were mortality, clinical cure, microbiological evaluation, and adverse events. RESULTS Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1,239 patients and eight retrospective cohort or case-control studies (CSs) with a total 6,125 patients were identified. Clinical cure and microbiological eradication rates were significantly increased in patients treated with LZD in RCTs (clinical cure: risk rate (RR) = 0.81, 95% confidential interval (CI) = 0.71-0.92, microbiological eradication: RR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.62-0.81) and CSs (clinical cure: odds rate (OR) = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.18-0.69).

Early parenting mediates infant experiences from birth, and early intervention can support sensitive and responsive parent practices that optimize infant outcomes via promoting developmental competencies. However, low-income and depressed mothers experience substantial challenges to participating in early intervention. They also have extremely limited access to interventions targeting depression. Interventions targeting maternal depression and parent practices can improve maternal and infant outcomes. Mobile internet-based interventions overcome numerous barriers that low-resource mothers face in accessing home-based interventions. Pandemic-related stressors likely reduce family resources and exacerbate distress of already heavily-burdened mother-infant dyads. During crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence-based remote coaching interventions are paramount. This article reports on a mobile intervention for improving maternal mood and increasing parent practices that promote infant development. An ongoing randomized controlled trial study provided a unique opportunity to monitor progression from referral to intervention initiation between two groups of depressed mothers: those prior to the pandemic and during the pandemic. The study also examines mother and infant characteristics at baseline.

Robotic-assisted surgery may offer potential benefits to this operation. This study describes the comparison of robotic-assisted and conventional laparoscopic ventral rectopexy in terms of clinical parameters, operative details, postoperative complications and short-term outcomes. METHODS Twenty patients operated on for rectal prolapse or intussusception using the Da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale CA, USA) were prospectively followed for 3 months. The cases were pair-matched with laparoscopically operated controls from registry files. RESULTS Mean operating time was 159 min (standard deviation; 37 SD) and 153 min (33 SD) and mean total time in the operating theatre 231 min (39 SD) and 234 min (41 SD) for robotic-assisted and laparoscopic operations, respectively. Mean blood loss was 25 ml (49 SD) in robotic-assisted and 37 ml (50 SD) in laparoscopic procedures. There was one (5 %) significant complication in each group. Mean length of hospital stay was 3.1 (2 SD) and 3.3 (1.3 SD) days for the robotic-assisted and laparoscopic groups, respectively. The subjective benefit rate was the same in both groups: 16/20 (80 %). One patient in the robotic-assisted group continued to have symptoms of obstructed defecation, and there was one recurrence of prolapse in the laparoscopic group. CONCLUSIONS Robotic-assisted laparoscopic ventral rectopexy is safe, feasible and not more time consuming than the laparoscopic technique even at the beginning of the learning curve. The short-term results are comparable with those of laparoscopy.

Given that some irAE are clinically similar to traditional autoimmune diseases, autoantibodies have been suggested as possible biomarkers of irAE. However, there are very little data on autoantibody investigation prior to ICI. Our aim was to determine if specific baseline autoantibodies were associated with irAE and see if changes in autoantibody concentration corresponded with irAE development. METHODS: This study used data from an oncologic clinical trial of adaptive dosing combination ICI therapy in patients with advanced melanoma. Plasma was collected at baseline and 6 weeks after ICI initiation and tested in a microarray of 120 autoantigens commonly associated with autoimmune disease, as well as antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP). Autoantibody concentrations were compared between patients experiencing an organ-specific event versus not. Heatmaps, volcano plots and hierarchical clustering were used to determine autoantibody concentration differences among irAE patient clusters as defined by signal intensity of autoantibodies. Kaplan-Meier curves were created and a log-rank test was performed to assess differences in survival. RESULTS: The microarray analysis demonstrated that patients who experienced specific irAE had fewer differentially expressed autoantibodies at baseline than those that did not have those specific irAE, and a greater fold change (FC) in antibody concentration from baseline to 6 weeks corresponded with specific irAE development. However, no autoantibodies were identified as being predictive of specific events. Time to first irAE was less than 6 weeks in 69% of patients, and these patients had less autoantibodies at baseline. Considering ANA, RF and CCP autoantibodies, there were no significant differences between the seropositive and seronegative patients in irAE development, severity, timing or survival. CONCLUSION: Patients with low autoantibody concentrations at baseline as well as a greater FC in autoantibody concentration over 6 weeks developed more distinct organ-specific irAE. This may suggest differences in the balance of cellular immunity and humoral pathways that are relevant in the pathogenesis of irAE, though further investigation is needed.","output":"Lower baseline autoantibody levels are associated with immune-related adverse events from immune checkpoint inhibition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first case of COVID-19 was announced at the end of year 2019, and later many cases were identified worldwide In Saudi Arabia, the first case was announced on 2 March 2020 To prevent the spread of this pandemic disease, many precautionary actions were taken by Saudi government One of these actions was closing public and private schools and universities and transfer the educational activities to virtual platforms All colleges of Pharmacy in Saudi Arabia, whether the 21 public or the eight private ones, were affected by those sudden transitions and their responses varied according to their preparedness levels Here we shared our experience in king Saud University in the curricular components of pharmacy school that includes classroom teaching, laboratory teaching, experiential training, assessment, and extracurricular activity and student support during COVID-19 compulsory lockdown Lastly, we presented the lesson learned toward pharmacy education from COVID-19 pandemic","output":"COVID-19 Impact on Pharmacy Education in Saudi Arabia: Challenges and Opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic The 3&prime;untranslated region (UTR) of this &beta;-CoV contains essential cis-acting RNA elements for the viral genome transcription and replication These elements include an equilibrium between an extended bulged stem-loop (BSL) and a pseudoknot The existence of such an equilibrium is supported by reverse genetic studies and phylogenetic covariation analysis and is further proposed as a molecular switch essential for the control of the viral RNA polymerase binding Here, we report the SARS-CoV-2 3&prime;UTR structures in cells that transcribe the viral UTRs harbored in a minigene plasmid and isolated infectious virions using a chemical probing technique, namely dimethyl sulfate (DMS)-mutational profiling with sequencing (MaPseq) Interestingly, the putative pseudoknotted conformation was not observed, indicating that its abundance in our systems is low in the absence of the viral nonstructural proteins (nsps) Similarly, our results also suggest that another functional cis-acting element, the three-helix junction, cannot stably form The overall architectures of the viral 3&prime;UTRs in the infectious virions and the minigene-transfected cells are almost identical","output":"The RNA Architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 3-Untranslated Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic highlights the need for global scientific cooperation to advance our understanding of the immunological, molecular and biochemical mechanisms causing infection by this virus.

Nonremoval of the rings has frequently been reported and this technique does not support a routine use. The aim of this experimental study was to assess the feasibility of anastomosis using compression with a device consisting of fragmented rings. METHODS A new compression device, the \\"Anastocom,\\" was compared to standard double-stapled colocolonic anastomosis in 2 groups of 8 pigs. In each group, colocolonic anastomosis was performed with a circular stapler (DST Series EEA Staplers) in 4 pigs and with the Anastocom device for the other 4 pigs. RESULTS The anastomotic rings were expelled between postoperative day 7 and day 13 from the 4 animals sacrificed at day 30. The anastomosis was clean and intact in all pigs. After sacrifice, there was no difference in the bursting pressure at day 7 ( P = .226) or at day 30 ( P = .885) between the 2 types of anastomosis. After sacrifice at day 7, the mean bursting pressure values for the Anastocom and EEA anastomoses were 128.6 mm Hg (range 119-143 mm Hg) and 218.9 mm Hg (range 84-240 mm Hg), respectively. After sacrifice at day 30, the mean bursting pressure values for the Anastocom and EEA anastomoses were 111 mm Hg (range 59-234 mm Hg) and 105 mm Hg (range 81-130 mmHg), respectively.

The threat the pandemic poses as well as associated lockdown measures created challenging times for many. This study aimed to investigate the individual and social factors associated with low mental health, particularly perceived threat and lockdown measures, and factors associated with psychological well-being, particularly sense of control. An online survey was completed by participants (N = 8,229) recruited from 79 countries. In line with pre-registered hypotheses, participants showed elevated levels of anxiety and depression worldwide. This poor mental health was predicted by perceived threat. The effect of threat on depression was further moderated by social isolation, but there was no effect of sense of control. Sense of control was low overall, and was predicted negatively by maladaptive coping, but positively by adaptive coping and the perception that the government is dealing with the outbreak. Social isolation increased with quarantine duration, but was mitigated by frequent communication with close ones. Engaging in individual actions to avoid contracting the virus was associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally. We suggest that early lockdown of the pandemic may have had detrimental psychological effects, which may be alleviated by individual actions such as maintaining frequent social contact and adaptive coping, and by governmental actions which demonstrate support in a public health crisis.

Any eHealth strategy would be ineffective if users eHealth literacy needs are not addressed. A robust measure of eHealth literacy is essential for understanding these needs. On the basis of the eHealth Literacy Framework, which identified 7 dimensions of eHealth literacy, the eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (eHLQ) was developed. The tool has demonstrated robust psychometric properties in the Danish setting, but validity testing should be an ongoing and accumulative process. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate validity evidence based on test content, response process, and internal structure of the eHLQ in the Australian community health setting. METHODS: A mixed methods approach was used with cognitive interviewing conducted to examine evidence on test content and response process, whereas a cross-sectional survey was undertaken for evidence on internal structure. Data were collected at 3 diverse community health sites in Victoria, Australia. Psychometric testing included both the classical test theory and item response theory approaches. Methods included Bayesian structural equation modeling for confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency and test-retest for reliability, and the Bayesian multiple-indicators, multiple-causes model for testing of differential item functioning. RESULTS: Cognitive interviewing identified only 1 confusing term, which was clarified. All items were easy to read and understood as intended. A total of 525 questionnaires were included for psychometric analysis. All scales were homogenous with composite scale reliability ranging from 0.73 to 0.90. The intraclass correlation coefficient for test-retest reliability for the 7 scales ranged from 0.72 to 0.95. A 7-factor Bayesian structural equation modeling using small variance priors for cross-loadings and residual covariances was fitted to the data, and the model of interest produced a satisfactory fit (posterior productive P=.49, 95% CI for the difference between observed and replicated chi-square values ?101.40 to 108.83, prior-posterior productive P=.92). All items loaded on the relevant factor, with loadings ranging from 0.36 to 0.94. No significant cross-loading was found. There was no evidence of differential item functioning for administration format, site area, and health setting. However, discriminant validity was not well established for scales 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7. Item response theory analysis found that all items provided precise information at different trait levels, except for 1 item. All items demonstrated different sensitivity to different trait levels and represented a range of difficulty levels. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence suggests that the eHLQ is a tool with robust psychometric properties and further investigation of discriminant validity is recommended. It is ready to be used to identify eHealth literacy strengths and challenges and assist the development of digital health interventions to ensure that people with limited digital access and skills are not left behind.","output":"Validity Evidence of the eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (eHLQ) Part 2: Mixed Methods Approach to Evaluate Test Content, Response Process, and Internal Structure in the Australian Community Health Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of self-esteem in cancer patients and the potential role of spiritual care programs in its promotion, no interventional study was found in this field in Iran. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the effect of a spiritual care program on the self-esteem of patients with various types of cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was quasi-experimental with two groups using a before and after design which was conducted in 2019 in a selected hospital in Isfahan, Iran. A convenience sample of 64 patients randomly assigned into the experimental (n = 32) and the control group (n = 32). Data collection was conducted through a two-part questionnaire including Demographic characteristics and the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI). The spiritual care program consisted of six sessions based on four domains including individuals' relationship with God, themselves, others, and with the environment. To analyze the data, Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, independent t test, and paired t test were performed. RESULTS: The total self-esteem mean score and its domains were not significantly different between the two groups before the intervention (p > 0.05). However, after conducting the intervention, the total self-esteem mean score and its domains were significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The spiritual care program used in this study was effective in promoting the self-esteem of patients with cancer. It is suggested that similar studies are conducted to provide fertile grounds for using such programs in the oncology clinical area.","output":"The Effect of a Spiritual Care Program on the Self-Esteem of Patients with Cancer: A Quasi-Experimental Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Although there is evidence linking the relationships between smartphone usage with health, stress, and academic performance, there is still inadequate knowledge about the influence on pro-environmental behaviors. This study seeks to bridge this gap by adapting the theory of attribution framework to examine the effects of personal norms, social norms, perceived behavioral control on pro-environmental behavior of smartphone usage in children. METHODS: A total of 225 children aged between 11 to 12 from eight selected public primary schools at the Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park in Taiwan were surveyed. Two distinct groups (excessive versus moderate usage) were purposefully selected for comparison, of which 96 participants were excessive smartphone users while the remaining 129 were moderate smartphone users. RESULTS: Findings revealed significant differences between excessive and moderate smartphone usage children groups in personal norms (p < 0.001), social norms (p = 0.002), perceived behavioral control (p = 0.001), and pro-environmental behavior (p = 0.001). Findings for excessive smartphone usage children showed that social norms ( = 0.428, t = 4.096***, p < 0.001) had a direct predictive impact on pro-environmental behavior. In contrast, while there was no direct path established between personal norms and pro-environmental behavior ( = 0.177, t = 1.580, p > 0.05), as well as social norms and pro-environmental behavior for moderate smartphone usage children ( = 0.181, t = 1.924, p > 0.05), but such a relationship could be developed through the mediating effect of perceived behavioral control ( = 0.497, t = 4.471***, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: The results suggested that excessive smartphone usage children lack positive perceived behavioral control, and their pro-environmental behavior could only be predicted through explicit social norms, whereas pro-environmental behavior of moderate smartphone usage children was implicitly influenced by personal norms through perceived behavioral control.","output":"Determinants of pro-environmental behavior among excessive smartphone usage children and moderate smartphone usage children in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With increasing survival rates of children born extremely preterm (EPT), before gestational week 28, the post-discharge life of these families has gained significant research interest.

This study measured utilization, adequacy, and disparities in uptake of TM in pediatric surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Scheduled outpatient pediatric surgery clinic encounters at a large academic children's hospital from January 2020 through March 2021 were reviewed. Sub-group analysis examined post-operative (PO) visits after appendectomy and umbilical, epigastric, and inguinal hernia repairs. RESULTS: Of 9149 scheduled visits, 87.9% were in-person and 12.1% were TM. TM visits were scheduled for PO care (76.9%), new consultations (7.1%), and established patients (16.0%). Although TM visits were more frequently canceled or no shows (P < 0.001), most canceled TM visits were PO visits, of which 41.7% were canceled via electronic communication reporting the absence of any PO concerns. TM visits were adequate for accomplishing visit goals in 98.2%, 95.5%, and 96.2% of PO, new, and established patient visits, respectively. Patients utilizing TM visits were more frequently of white race, privately-insured, from less disadvantaged neighborhoods, and living a greater distance from clinic (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: TM was adequate for the majority of visits in which it was utilized, including the basic PO visits that occurred via TM. TM was used more by patients with greater travel and less by those of minority race, with public insurance, and from more disadvantaged neighborhoods.

METHODS Eighty-one hemodialysis units were investigated on the incidence and preventive measures for SARS from March to July 2003 by a standardized investigation form. RESULTS (1) Seven hemodialysis patients were diagnosed as SARS clinically and account for 0.24% of total 2885 hemodialysis patients in these units in Beijing. Among the 7 SARS patients, 3 recovered from SARS and 4 died. No case was infected within the hemodialysis units. No SARS case or suspected case was found in the health care workers in hemodialysis units. (2) Additional disinfected measures were carried out in all the hemodialysis units. 98.8% (80/81) of them did not reuse the dialyzer. (3) 98.8% (80/81) of the hemodialysis units developed education about preventing SARS among hemodialysis patients. Before dialysis treatment patients must take temperature, change specific clothes and shoes in over 90% of the hemodialysis units.

Fortunately, with the recent development and widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies like RepRap-class 3-D printers and open source microcontrollers, mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. In this study, after providing a background on ventilators, the academic literature is reviewed to find the existing and already openly-published, vetted designs for ventilators systems. These articles are analyzed to determine if the designs are open source both in spirit (license) as well as practical details (e.g. possessing accessible design source files, bill of materials, assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, firmware and software as well as operation and calibration instructions). Next, the existing Internet and gray literature are reviewed for open source ventilator projects and designs. The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system. There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware. Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach by developing policies, updating regulations, and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings.","output":"A review of open source ventilators for COVID-19 and future pandemics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review explores potential sources of weight bias and stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic, including \\"quarantine-15\\" messages and discussion of obesity in media and public health campaigns.

The results of the study have been shared and discussed with a panel of chief executives of industries, consultancies in the mobility sector and Public Transportation (PT) companies. It has emerged that interpersonal distancing and the reduced level of capacity on board vehicles are seen as effective to prevent the contagion, but are perceived as not sustainable due to the induced increase in operating costs. This is confirmed by the simulation carried out during the study which have showed the need of new urban policies not only limited to the transportation domain (e.g. changes in the times of schools, commerce and industries) in order to manage the demand peaks at the stations and on-board vehicles.","output":"Impacts of interpersonal distancing on-board trains during the COVID-19 emergency: case studies and viewpoints from industry, consultancies and public transportation companies in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper investigates under what conditions it is optimal to exclude some motorists searching for parking from occupying a vacant parking bay.

HYPOTHESIS: Geriatric patients, 75 years or older, with subtrochanteric fractures have worse clinical and functional outcomes than those with pertrochanteric fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study of data prospectively collected by the Spanish Hip Fracture Registry including patients 75 years or older, admitted for extracapsular hip fractures from January 2017 to June 2019. Demographic and baseline status, pre-operative, post-operative and 30-day follow-up data were included. RESULTS: A total of 13,939 patients with extracapsular hip fractures were registered: 12,199 (87.5%) pertrochanteric and 1740 (12.5%) subtrochanteric. At admission, patients with subtrochanteric fractures were younger (86.5  5.8 versus 87.1  5.6 years old), had better pre-fracture mobility (3.7  2.7 versus 3.9  2.8) (1-to-10 scale, 1 being independent) and were more likely to be living at home; those with pertrochanteric fractures had worse cognitive function (Pfeiffer 3.3  3.3 versus 3.8  3.5). The subtrochanteric fracture group showed worse post-fracture mobility (7.3  2.7 versus 6.7  2.7) and greater deterioration of mobility (3.7  3.0 versus 2.9  2.7). Among individuals living at home at baseline, those with subtrochanteric fractures were more likely to remain in an assisted facility at 30-day follow-up. In-hospital mortality during acute admission was higher for the subtrochanteric group (5.6% versus 4.5%) (p = 0.028). To our knowledge, this is the first paper highlighting the differences between these two fracture groups in the geriatric population. CONCLUSIONS: Subtrochanteric fractures in the older population are a different and worse entity, with greater morbimortality and functional decline than pertrochanteric fractures. Despite being younger and fitter at admission, older patients with subtrochanteric fractures have a higher risk of remaining non-weight bearing and undergoing re-operation and institutionalization.

Though research has often examined the predictors of protest participation, there exists little work examining the relationship between different types of wealth and protesting. Drawing on resource-based theories of protest participation and asset-based theories of civic engagement, we construct regression models disentangling relationships between income, liquid assets, investment assets, homeownership, and protesting. Using a national survey administered during the protests, we find that liquid assets are negatively associated, homeownership is positively associated, and investment assets exhibit a non-linear association with protesting. These relationships hold when controlling for income, demographics, and ideology, but largely disappear when controlling for measures of economic vulnerability. These results are consistent across different protest types. This work speaks to the role of protests as a means of political participation for economically marginalized groups, and contributes to our knowledge of the intersection between economic indicators and political behaviors.","output":"Which Side (Of the Balance Sheet) Are You On?

Dynamic arterial elastance (Ea dyn ), the relationship between pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV), has been suggested as a functional assessment of arterial load. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of arterial load changes during acute pharmacological changes, fluid administration, and haemorrhage on Ea dyn . Methods. Eighteen anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated New Zealand rabbits were studied. Arterial load changes were induced by phenylephrine ( n =9) or nitroprusside ( n =9). Thereafter, animals received a fluid bolus (10 ml kg -1 ), followed by stepwise bleeding (blood loss: 15 ml kg -1 ). The influence of arterial load and cardiac variables on PPV, SVV, and Ea dyn was analysed using a linear mixed-effects model analysis. Results. After phenylephrine infusion, mean ( sd ) Ea dyn decreased from 0.89 (0.14) to 0.49 (0.12), P <0.001; whereas after administration of nitroprusside, Ea dyn increased from 0.80 (0.23) to 1.28 (0.21), P <0.0001. Overall, the fluid bolus decreased Ea dyn [from 0.89 (0.44) to 0.73 (0.35); P <0.01], and haemorrhage increased it [from 0.78 (0.23) to 0.95 (0.26), P =0.03]. Both PPV and SVV were associated with similar arterial factors (effective arterial elastance, arterial compliance, and resistance) and heart rate. Furthermore, PPV was also related to the acceleration and peak velocity of aortic blood flow. Both arterial and cardiac factors contributed to the evolution of Ea dyn throughout the experiment. Conclusions. Acute modifications of arterial load induced significant changes on Ea dyn ; vasodilatation increased Ea dyn , whereas vasoconstriction decreased it. The Ea dyn was associated with both arterial load and cardiac factors, suggesting that Ea dyn should be more properly considered as a ventriculo-arterial coupling index.","output":"Effects of arterial load variations on dynamic arterial elastance: an experimental study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inactivating mutations in the Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MECP2) gene are the main cause of Rett syndrome (RTT).

When kidney function deteriorated further, despite persistently absent circulating anti-GBM antibodies, a repeat kidney biopsy was performed, showing crescents in 100% of glomeruli with ongoing endocapillary hypercellularity and strong IgG and IgG4 GBM staining. This case highlights complexities in the diagnosis of anti-GBM disease, with clinical and histological features bridging the atypical to typical anti-GBM disease spectrum. We hypothesise that these findings might be explained by the presence of IgG4 (rather than traditional IgG1 or IgG3) autoantibodies. To our knowledge, this is also the first report of parainfluenza associated with anti-GBM disease.","output":"Antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease with clinical and histological features that bridge the typical to atypical spectrum."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information processing underlying human perceptual decision-making is inherently noisy and identifying sources of this noise is important to understand processing. Ratcliff, Voskuilen, and McKoon (2018) examined results from five experiments using a double-pass procedure in which stimuli were repeated typically a hundred trials later. Greater than chance agreement between repeated tests provided evidence for trial-to-trial variability from external sources of noise. They applied the diffusion model to estimate the quality of evidence driving the decision process (drift rate) and the variability (standard deviation) in drift rate across trials. This variability can be decomposed into random (internal) and systematic (external) components by comparing the double-pass accuracy and agreement with the model predictions. In this note, we provide an additional analysis of the double-pass experiments using the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model. The LBA model does not have within-trial variability and thus it captures all variability in processing with its across-trial variability parameters. The LBA analysis of the double-pass data provides model-based evidence of external variability in a decision process, which is consistent with Ratcliff et al.'s result. This demonstrates that across-trial variability is required to model perceptual decision-making. The LBA model provides measures of systematic and random variability as the diffusion model did. But due to the lack of within-trial variability, the LBA model estimated the random component as a larger proportion of across-trial total variability than did the diffusion model.","output":"A Note on Decomposition of Sources of Variability in Perceptual Decision-making."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efforts to stem the spread of COVID\\\\19 in China hinged on severe restrictions to human movement starting 23 January 2020 in Wuhan and subsequently to other provinces.

The mutation spectrum of OPA1 comprises nonsense, canonical and non-canonical splice site, frameshift and missense as well as copy number variants, but intragenic inversions have not been reported so far. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 33-year-old male with characteristic clinical features of DOA. Whole-genome sequencing identified a structural variant of 2.4 kb comprising an inversion of 937 bp at the OPA1 locus. Fine mapping of the breakpoints to single nucleotide level revealed that the structural variation was an inversion flanked by two deletions. As this rearrangement inverts the entire first exon of OPA1, it was classified as likely pathogenic. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first DOA case harboring an inversion in the OPA1 gene.

However, we understand very little about the effects of this pandemic on families of young children. We used a risk and resilience model to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on mental health in diverse caregivers (N = 286) with children ages birth to 5. We evaluated the hypotheses that (a) pandemic stress and caregiver-reported child psychosocial concerns correlate with caregivers mental health symptoms and (b) caregivers pandemic-related self-efficacy and coping mediate these relationships. Caregivers completed surveys in AprilCMay 2020 assessing pandemic stress (e.g., health, finances, and housing), child psychosocial problems, coping strategies, and self-efficacy to manage family needs. Our primary outcome was caregivers self-reported changes in mental health symptoms since the outbreak. Path analysis revealed that higher pandemic stress was associated with caregivers reduced confidence in meeting their familys needs related to COVID-19, which correlated with worse caregiver mental health symptoms. Greater child psychosocial problems also predicted worse caregiver mental health symptoms. Findings suggest that pandemic stress, child psychosocial problems, and caregiver self-efficacy are interrelated in their influence on caregivers mental health.

However, there is still a lack of comprehensive and systematic evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of QFPD. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of QFPD in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We searched seven databases up to 5 March 2021. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data of interest, and assessed risk of bias. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias of randomized controlled trials. The NewcastleCOttawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias of cohort and non-randomized trials. The Quality Assessment Tool for Before-After (Pre-Post) Studies With No Control Group was adopted for controlled preCpost studies. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) to assess the certainty of evidence. We carried out a random effect meta-analysis using RevMan 5.3. For outcomes that could not be meta-analyzed, we performed a descriptive analysis. Results: We identified 16 studies with 11,237 patients, including one RCT, six non-randomized trials, two cohort studies, and seven preCpost studies. The certainty of evidence was low to very low because of the observational study design. QFPD combined with conventional treatment might decrease the time for nucleic acid conversion (MD = ?4.78 days, 95% CI: ?5.79 to ?3.77), shorten the length of hospital stay (MD = ?7.95 days, 95% CI: ?14.66 to ?1.24), shorten the duration of symptoms recovery of fever (MD = ?1.51 days, 95% CI: ?1.92 to ?1.09), cough (MD = ?1.64 days, 95% CI: ?1.91 to ?1.36) and chest CT (MD = ?2.23 days, 95% CI: ?2.46 to ?2.00), improve the overall traditional Chinese medicine symptom scores (MD = 41.58 scores, 95% CI: 32.67 to 50.49), and change the laboratory indexes, such as WBC, AST, and CRP.

Although vaccines have been used as the principal means of controlling the disease, CD has been reported in vaccinated animals. The hemoagglutinin (H) protein is one of the most important antigens for inducing protective immunity against CD, and antigenic variation of recent CDV strains may explain vaccination failure. In this study, a new CDV isolate (TM-CC) was obtained from a Tibetan Mastiff that died of distemper, and its genome was characterized. Phylogenetic analysis of the H gene revealed that the CDV-TM-CC strain is unique among 20 other CDV strains and can be classified into the Asia-1 group with the Chinese strains, Hebei and HLJ1-06, and the Japanese strain, CYN07-hV. The H gene of CDV-TM-CC shows low identity (90.4 % nt and 88.9 % aa) with the H gene of the classical Onderstepoort vaccine strain, which may explain the inability of the Tibetan Mastiff to mount a protective immune response. We also performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the N, P, and F protein sequences, as well as potential N-glycosylation sites and cysteine residues. This analysis shows that an N-glycosylation site at aa 108-110 within the F protein of CDV-TM-CC is specific for the wild-type strains (5804P, A75/17, and 164071) and the Asia-1 group strains, and may be another important factor for the poor immune response.

Use of an intubation checklist can reduce exposure risk and thus acts as a potential safeguard. Specific, step-by-step guidance to perform safe endotracheal intubation in the setting of COVID-19 are limited. This article outlines the development and refinement of a COVID-19 intubation checklist and operational protocol for ICU staff at a single center in the United States. METHODS: A standard pre-intubation checklist was adapted and refined by consensus using a multidisciplinary and iterative process, then distributed to local staff for clinical use. Subsequent mock intubation training sessions were held using the new checklist to ensure proficiency. Planned debriefing sessions helped identify several previously unanticipated issues, allowing for further refinement of the intubation checklist and inclusion of all stakeholders. RESULTS: A COVID-19 intubation checklist helped optimize safety during a high-risk situation by minimizing aerosolization of secretions, the number of staff required in the room, the time spent in the room, and the frequency of donning/doffing personal protective equipment.

Little is known, however, about the psychosocial aspects of these procedures. This article discusses the psychological considerations of the postoperative bariatric surgery patient who undergoes body contouring surgery. METHODS A review of the psychosocial and physical characteristics of individuals with extreme obesity who undergo bariatric surgery, and the changes in these traits that typically occur postoperatively, is provided. The relationship of body image dissatisfaction to both bariatric and plastic surgery is discussed. The breast reduction literature is reviewed and used to provide a framework with which to understand the psychosocial issues of body contouring patients. RESULTS These related literatures are used as a guide to provide suggestions for future research investigating the physical and psychosocial outcomes following body contouring surgery. Preliminary recommendations for the psychosocial assessment of body contouring patients are provided.

The patients were evaluated using the difficulty score and classified into 3 groups: low, intermediate, and high difficulty. All surgeries were successfully completed without conversion to conventional laparoscopic surgery. A strong relationship was observed between the increasing score and longer surgical time. The mean surgical time was longer and the amount of blood loss was greater in the intermediate-difficulty and high-difficulty groups than in the low-difficulty group. Moreover, the high-difficulty group had a higher rate of insertion of an additional trocar than the low-difficulty group.

Although reducing tumor size by preoperative aspiration or drainage of the contents of the cystic tumor is helpful for liver resection, such procedures have a risk of tumor dissemination. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE After the round ligament was dissected, a 12-Fr drainage catheter was inserted into the tumor via the round ligament under ultrasonography. At that time, close attention was paid to avoid having the catheter deviate outside the round ligament. Through the inserted catheter, fluid was drained from the cystic lesion, and the stump of the round ligament was clipped to avoid fluid leakage. The left Glissonian pedicle was then taped. Laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy was performed under a good operative field because of tumor shrinkage. DISCUSSION Three cases underwent these procedures without any spillage of the contents of the cystic tumor. This method is useful for the reduction of tumor size and has a low risk of intra-abdominal leakage of the contents, resulting in a secure and good operative field.","output":"Useful technique for draining a large cystic tumor through the round ligament in laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses cause the majority of common colds and play a part in more serious respiratory illnesses that lead to increased morbidity and mortality.

Aim: To evaluate patient use of virtual primary care models during COVID-19 in terms of change in uptake, perceived impact on the quality and safety of care, and willingness of future use. Design and setting: An online cross-sectional survey was administered to the public across the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy and Germany. Methods: McNemar tests were conducted to test pre- and post pandemic differences in uptake for each technology. One-way analysis of variance was conducted to examine patient experience ratings and perceived impacts on healthcare quality and safety across demographic characteristics. Results: Respondents (N=6,326) reported an increased use of telephone consultations (+6.3%, P<.001), patient-initiated services (+1.5%, n=98, p<0.001), video consultations (+1.4%, P<.001), remote triage (+1.3, p<0.001), and secure messaging systems (+0.9%, P=.019). Experience rates using virtual care technologies were higher for men (2.39{+/-}0.96 vs 2.29{+/-}0.92, P<.001), those with higher literacy (2.75{+/-}1.02 vs 2.29{+/-}0.92, P<.001), and participants from Germany (2.54{+/-}0.91, P<.001). Healthcare timeliness and efficiency were the quality dimensions most often reported as being positively impacted by virtual technologies (60.2%, n=2,793 and 55.7%, n=2,401, respectively), followed by effectiveness (46.5%, n=1,802), safety (45.5%, n=1,822), patient-centredness (45.2%, n=45.2) and equity (42.9%, n=1,726).

As no effective treatment is known, prediction of disease severity is very important in order to estimate a patients outcome. Aim of this study was to evaluate routine hematology parameters in time after admission. METHODS Data from routine blood analyses from confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to the University Hospital of Leuven in Belgium were collected. COVID-19 patients (n = 197) were assigned to three groups: a 'non-ICU' group, a 'ICU' group and a 'deceased' group. A control group of 60 Influenza A (non-COVID-19) patients was also included. The parameters evaluated were platelet count (PLT, 109/L), hemoglobin concentration (Hb, g/dL), leukocyte count (LEU, 109/L), neutrophil count (NEU, %), eosinophil count (EO, %), lymphocyte count (LYM, %) and monocyte count (MONO, %). RESULTS Deceased COVID-19 patients had significant lower platelet count, higher leukocyte/neutrophil count, and lower eosinophil/lymphocyte/monocyte count compared to recovered patients. Especially lymphocyte count showed important differences; they were significantly lower between day 9 and 12 after admission making this time window important in predicting clinical worsening of a patient.

Psychological distress (Mental Health Inventory, MHI-5), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS), COVID-19 anxiety, and perceived loneliness were also measured. Background factors included socio-demographic variables, instant loan taking, and involvement in social media identity bubbles (Identity Bubble Reinforcement Scale, IBRS-9)Findings: Within the sample, 22.18% were categorized into monthly regular investors only, 3.00% were investors using real-time stock-trading platforms, and 3.48% were crypto-market traders. Real-time stock-trading platform use and cryptocurrency trading were associated with younger age and male gender. Real-time platform users were more involved in social media identity bubbles than non-investors. Cryptomarket traders were more likely to have an immigrant background and have taken instant loans. Both real-time stock-trading platform use and cryptomarket trading were associated with excessive forms of gambling, gaming, and internet use.

METHODS: A search strategy was devised for the MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMed, PEDRO, OT Seeker and Cochrane databases. Search results were title, abstract and full-text reviewed by two independent researchers. Data were extracted from included articles using a custom form and assessed for quality and risk of bias using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies. RESULTS: No studies set in the Hospital at Home environments were identified. 16 hospital inpatient studies met the criteria for inclusion. Older patients managed in inpatient settings that would be eligible for Hospital at Home services spent 6.6% of their day active and undertook only 881.8 daily steps.

Unlike these vasculitis types, patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia can develop cutaneous vasculitis-like lesions and systemic arterial and venous thromboemboli, including cryptogenic strokes and other vasculopathy features. Proposed underlying mechanisms for these severe manifestations have encompassed immune dysregulation, including an anti-phospholipid syndrome-like state, complement activation, viral dissemination with direct systemic endothelial infection, viral RNAaemia with immunothrombosis, clotting pathway activation mediated by hypoxaemia, and immobility. In this Viewpoint, we highlight how imaging and post-mortem findings from patients with COVID-19 indicate a novel thrombosis in the pulmonary venous territory distal to the alveolar capillary bed, a territory that normally acts as a clot filtration system, which might represent an unappreciated nidus for systemic microembolism. Additionally, we suggest that this mechanism represents a novel vasculitis mimic related to COVID-19 that might lead to cryptogenic strokes across multivessel territories, acute kidney injury with haematuria, a skin vasculitis mimic, intestinal ischaemia, and other organ ischaemic manifestations. This finding is supported by pathological reports of extensive pulmonary venular thrombosis and peripheral organ thrombosis with pauci-immune cellular infiltrates. Therefore, severe COVID-19 pneumonia with extensive pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy might help to explain the numerous systemic complications of COVID-19, in which the demonstration of direct organ infection has not adequately explained the pathology.","output":"COVID-19 vasculitis and novel vasculitis mimics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Public cooperation to practise preventive health behaviours is essential to manage the transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. We aimed to investigate beliefs about COVID-19 diagnosis, transmission and prevention that have the potential to impact the uptake of recommended public health strategies. DESIGN: An online cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: A national sample of 1500 Australian adults with representative quotas for age and gender provided by an online panel provider. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of participants with correct/incorrect knowledge of COVID-19 preventive behaviours and reasons for misconceptions. RESULTS: Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 did not qualify, 13 declined and 1500 participated in the survey (response rate 83%). Most participants correctly identified washing your hands regularly with soap and water (92%) and staying at least 1.5 m away from others (90%) could help prevent COVID-19. Over 40% (incorrectly) considered wearing gloves outside of the home would prevent them from contracting COVID-19. Views about face masks were divided. Only 66% of participants correctly identified that regular use of antibiotics would not prevent COVID-19. Most participants (90%) identified fever, fatigue and cough as indicators of COVID-19. However, 42% of participants thought that being unable to hold your breath for 10 s without coughing was an indicator of having the virus. The most frequently reported sources of COVID-19 information were commercial television channels (56%), the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (43%) and the Australian Government COVID-19 information app (31%). CONCLUSIONS: Public messaging about hand hygiene and physical distancing to prevent transmission appears to have been effective.

This study examined the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and their associations with quality of life (QOL) in clinically stable older patients with psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, insomnia, pain, and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. A total of 1063 patients were included. The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and combined depressive and anxiety symptoms were 62.3% (95%CI = 59.4C65.2%), 52.4% (95%CI = 49.3C55.4%), and 45.9% (95%CI = 42.9C48.9%), respectively. Patients with depressive and anxiety symptoms had significantly lower QOL than those without (P < 0.01). Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that having depressive symptoms was positively associated with more severe insomnia (OR = 1.29, P < 0.01) and pain (OR = 1.14, P < 0.01), and was negatively associated with other psychiatric diagnoses (except for major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and organic mental disorder; OR = 0.50, P < 0.01), while having anxiety symptoms was positively associated with severe physical diseases (OR = 1.57, P = 0.02), poor adherence to treatment (OR = 1.50, P < 0.01), and more severe insomnia (OR = 1.15, P < 0.01) and pain (OR = 1.11, P < 0.01).

At the same time, those still working on location had to adjust to a new working environment. Both groups and especially early-career researchers experienced a substantial impact on mental health and work productivity. The aim of the current qualitative study was to assess in-depth the specific challenges faced by young researchers in RO and what constitutes helpful support in case of continuing or future adverse situations. Materials and Methods This study was conducted jointly by researchers in the field of RO and experts in qualitative research. Data was collected using online Focus Groups (oFGs) facilitated by qualitative research experts. Three oFGs were held with 7-11 young RO professionals (total N=25), in which data saturation was reached. Invitations to participate in the oFGs were sent out 30 days prior through the ESTRO newsletter, social media and personal networks. Inclusion criteria to participate were (1) working in RO, (2) in a European institution, and (3) with less than 10 years of research experience. Efforts were made to ensure a diverse panel. The design of the oFGs (Figure 1) comprised two main steps: (1) Deepening the understanding of experienced impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) formulating solutions that could positively address the identified impacts. The oFGs were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analyzed via the qualitative analysis software Atlas (2019) through inductive coding. The coded segments were then translated into themes. $g Results In addition to years of research experience, seven other variables were identified as potentially impacting on the work or personal sphere in a positive and/or negative manner. In total ten main impacts were identified in the personal (2) and work sphere (8), which were either affected directly by the variables or indirectly through other impacts. It was for example found that job title could negatively impact the type of work the researcher had to perform during the pandemic, which in turn negatively impacted his/her mental health. All variables, impacts and how they relate are illustrated in Figure 2. Proposed solutions were mostly technical, illustrating that the most pressing issue was to ensure the possibility to perform one's work. Proposed solutions for social isolation (e.g. virtual social events) were often countered by the presence of zoom fatigue. $g Conclusion Different variables, their impacts and a complex interplay between them have been identified to determine how early-career RO professionals experienced working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond technical solutions to enable remote working, the distinct personal situations must be considered when proposing solutions to support mental health in these situations.","output":"OC-0055 COVID-19 impact on working conditions for researchers in radiation oncology: a qualitative analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Evaluate the correlation between statutory social distancing interventions and Covid-19 mortality independently in both the United States and Europe. The study is presented as a potential methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of statutory social distancing policy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven states in the United States and, separately, 12 European countries were selected which had clearly defined and dated establishment of statewide or national mandates for social distancing measures from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) data. Mandated social distancing measures considered in this study include: School closures, Prohibition on mass gatherings, business closures, stay at home orders, severe travel restrictions, and closure of non-essential businesses. The state/country Covid-19 peak mortality rate (PMR) was defined as the initial averaged normalized maximum during which social distancing mandates were in effect. Mandate-days were defined as the total days legislative mandates were in place to the PMR. RESULTS: The normalized peak mortality rate in the US and in Europe did not demonstrate a statistically significant correlation to the total mandate days (R-squared=0.053, p=0.246, R-squared=2.4E-06, p=0.996). A significant correlation was found between normalized mortality rate and state/country population density (R-squared=0.524, p=0.00002,R-squared=0.397, p=0.0281). DISCUSSION: The analysis appears to suggest no mandate effective reduction in Covid-19 mortality rate to its defined initial peak when interpreting their mean-effect.

METHODS Six latex-injected adult cadaver heads were dissected in five consecutive approaches: transcervical approach with submandibular gland removal, posterior extension of the transcervical approach, transcervical approach with parotidectomy, parotidectomy with lateral mandibulotomy, and parotidectomy with mandibulectomy. The degree of carotid artery exposure attained, external carotid branches, and lower cranial nerves visualized was documented. RESULTS The transcervical approach exposed 1.5 cm (Standard Deviation (SD) 0.5) of internal carotid artery (ICA) and 1.25 cm (SD 0.25) of external carotid artery (ECA). The superior thyroid and facial arteries and cranial nerve XII and XI were identified. The posterior extension exposed 2.9 cm (SD 0.7) of ICA and 2.7 cm (SD 1.0) of ECA. Occipital and ascending pharyngeal arteries were visualized. The transparotid approach exposed 4.0 cm (SD 1.1) of ICA and 3.98 cm (SD 1.8) of ECA. Lateral mandibulotomy exposed the internal maxillary artery, cranial nerve X, the sympathetic trunk, and 4.6 cm (SD 2.4) of ICA.

The receptor-binding is the first step for the viral infection of hosts. To more effectively treat human viral infectious diseases, the hidden virus-receptor interactions must be discovered. However, current computational methods for predicting virus-receptor interactions are limited. RESULT: In this study, we propose a new computational method (IILLS) to predict virus-receptor interactions based on Initial Interaction scores method via the neighbors and the Laplacian regularized Least Square algorithm. IILLS integrates the known virus-receptor interactions and amino acid sequences of receptors. The similarity of viruses is calculated by the Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel. On the other hand, we also compute the receptor GIP similarity and the receptor sequence similarity. Then the sequence similarity is used as the final similarity of receptors according to the prediction results. The 10-fold cross validation (10CV) and leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) are used to assess the prediction performance of our method. We also compare our method with other three competing methods (BRWH, LapRLS, CMF). CONLUSION: The experiment results show that IILLS achieves the AUC values of 0.8675 and 0.9061 with the 10-fold cross validation and leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), respectively, which illustrates that IILLS is superior to the competing methods.

In immunocompromised individuals, conidia can grow out as hyphae that damage lung epithelium. The resulting invasive aspergillosis is associated with devastating mortality rates. Since infection is a race between the innate immune system and the outgrowth of A. fumigatus conidia, we use dynamic optimization to obtain insight into the recruitment and depletion of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. Using this model, we obtain key insights into major determinants of infection outcome on host and pathogen side. On the pathogen side, we predict in silico and confirm in vitro that germination speed is an important virulence trait of fungal pathogens due to the vulnerability of conidia against host defense. On the host side, we found that epithelial cells, which have been underappreciated, play a role in fungal clearance and are potent mediators of cytokine release. Both predictions were confirmed by in vitro experiments on established cell lines as well as primary lung cells. Further, our model affirms the importance of neutrophils in invasive aspergillosis and underlines that the role of macrophages remains elusive. We expect that our model will contribute to improvement of treatment protocols by focusing on the critical components of immune response to fungi but also fungal virulence traits.","output":"Dynamic optimization reveals alveolar epithelial cells as key mediators of host defense in invasive aspergillosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pancreas disease (PD) is a contagious disease caused by salmonid alphavirus (SAV) with significant economic and welfare impacts on salmon farming. Previous work has shown that higher resistance against PD has underlying additive genetic components and can potentially be improved through selective breeding. To better understand the genetic basis of PD resistance in Atlantic salmon, we challenged 4506 smolts from 296 families of the SalmoBreed strain. Fish were challenged through intraperitoneal injection with the most virulent form of the virus found in Norway (i.e., SAV3). Mortalities were recorded, and more than 900 fish were further genotyped on a 55 K SNP array. RESULTS: The estimated heritability for PD resistance was 0.41  0.017. The genetic markers on two chromosomes, ssa03 and ssa07, showed significant associations with higher disease resistance. Collectively, markers on these two QTL regions explained about 60% of the additive genetic variance. We also sequenced and compared the cardiac transcriptomics of moribund fish and animals that survived the challenge with a focus on candidate genes within the chromosomal segments harbouring QTL. Approximately 200 genes, within the QTL regions, were found to be differentially expressed. Of particular interest, we identified various components of immunoglobulin-heavy-chain locus B (IGH-B) on ssa03 and immunoglobulin-light-chain on ssa07 with markedly higher levels of transcription in the resistant animals. These genes are closely linked to the most strongly QTL associated SNPs, making them likely candidates for further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings presented here provide supporting evidence that breeding is an efficient tool for increasing PD resistance in Atlantic salmon populations. The estimated heritability is one of the largest reported for any disease resistance in this species, where the majority of the genetic variation is explained by two major QTL. The transcriptomic analysis has revealed the activation of essential components of the innate and the adaptive immune responses following infection with SAV3. Furthermore, the complementation of the genomic with the transcriptomic data has highlighted the possible critical role of the immunoglobulin loci in combating PD virus.","output":"Identification of genetic loci associated with higher resistance to pancreas disease (PD) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The outbreak of COVID-19 that commenced in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has caused extensive public health concerns and posed substantial challenges to health professionals, especially for those in the center of the epidemic. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence, related factors, and mechanism of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) among health professionals in Wuhan during this critical period. METHODS The study used a cross-sectional design. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the frontline health professionals in Wuhan hospitals from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Mental health related measurements included ASD, depression, anxiety, conflict experiences, hostility, and psychosomatic symptoms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the factors associated with ASD among health professionals. RESULTS A total of 332 frontline health professionals were included in the analysis (mean age 32.218.77 years; 78.0% women). ASD was a prominent mental health problem in the health professionals surveyed, with a prevalence of 38.3%. Anxiety (24.7%) and depression (20.2%) were also common. SEM analyses revealed that emotional distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) fully mediated the association between conflicts with ASD (the standardized indirect coefficient =0.47, p=0.016). The most common reported symptom was chest pain (51.2%). ASD was significantly associated with psychosomatic symptoms. The majority (67.8%) reported being easily annoyed or irritated and ASD was associated with hostility. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 outbreak, a substantial number of health professionals in Wuhan suffered from ASD. Furthermore, ASD was found to be associated with psychosomatic symptoms as well as the hostility. The poor mental health of health professionals has detrimental impacts both on the wellbeing of staff in healthcare systems and may adversely affect the quality of patient care.

OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to investigate the value and impact that the health caf organized by the primary care physician, brings to the visitors, the clinic, and the community. METHODS: Conversations between the author (YO), who belongs to a medical clinic that has been operating for many years in Shizuoka City, and visitors of the health caf were qualitatively analyzed using Steps for Coding and Theorization (SCAT), which is a sequential and thematic qualitative analysis technique consisting of 4 steps. RESULTS: Sixteen people participated in the study. The values and impacts of holding a health caf were social support, opportunities for cognitive and behavioral changes, complementary functions to outpatient care, advantages for medical care, the creation of encounters with diverse individuals, connections with local community organizations, and motivating visitors to become proactive actors. CONCLUSION: It was considered valuable for physicians in community-based medical clinics to have opportunities to interact with patients and local residents outside the clinical settings. Because they can potentially enhance their role as primary care physicians in the community. In addition, the impact on the community is that local residents can receive social support, increase community ties, and make people more proactive about their health.","output":"The Value and Impact of a Health Caf Organized by Primary Care Physician, On Visitors, Clinics, and the Community: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Residential construction is the largest segment and accounts for 75% of the building stock in the EU-27, of which 36% is multi-family. It is generally accepted that the building sector is one of the largest energy consumers in Europe and residential buildings are responsible for the majority of energy consumption (more than 65% of energy is used for heating). A significant proportion of today's social housing in Europe was built between the 1950s and 1970s, when post-war reconstruction and heavy immigration flows to the most industrialised areas required an immediate response to housing shortages. In many cases, solutions were adopted that were very different from those of the first working-class neighbourhoods, which were built in the early 1900s primarily to address health emergencies and had deficiencies related to outdated building types and poor performance, lack of services, distance to work, and social degradation. This chapter demonstrates how the necessary energy refurbishment required by current regulations provides an opportunity to modernise housing to meet new needs and regenerate suburban areas. New housing models, small temporary apartments associated with multifunctional spaces, represent the latest requirements that characterise a new type of users and families. The recent emergency in Covid 19 has highlighted that this type of accommodation is not able to respond to ever-changing needs and requires flexibility to fulfil functions not strictly related to housing. The examples provided in this chapter are evidence of good practice in reviewing outdated models of existing housing stock. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Energy Retrofit of Suburban Districts: An Opportunity for Social Regeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of paediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide Children in low-income countries are disproportionately affected This is in large part due to limitations in healthcare resources and medical technologies Mechanical ventilation can be a life-saving therapy for many children with acute respiratory failure The scarcity of functioning ventilators in low-income countries results in countless preventable deaths Some hospitals have attempted to adapt to this scarcity by using hand-bag ventilation, as either a bridge to a mechanical ventilator, or until clinical improvement occurs rendering mechanical ventilation no longer necessary In instances of hand-bag ventilation, an endotracheal tube is first placed Family members are then asked to play the role of a ventilator, manually compressing a bag repeatedly to inflate the childs lungs This approach is fraught with numerous ethical challenges A careful examination of the data and a nuanced approach to the ethical considerations are imperative Ethical arguments in support of and in opposition to allowing parental hand-bag ventilation are explored, including the best interests of the child, the childs right to an open future, beneficence and parental protection, legitimising substandard care, and finally, contextual concerns An algorithmic, potentially ethically permissible approach to parental participation in manual ventilation is proposed","output":"Parental manual ventilation in resource-limited settings: an ethical controversy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work reviews nuclear compartments, defined broadly to include distinct nuclear structures, bodies, and chromosome domains.

We also produce scenarios obtained through the estimation of a time-dependent contact rate, with the main assumption that the dynamic of the disease is determined by the mobility and social activity of the population during holidays and other important calendar dates. First, historical changes in the effective contact rate on predetermined dates are estimated. Then, this information is used to forecast scenarios under the assumption that the trends of the effective contact rate observed in the past will be similar on the same but future key calendar dates. All other conditions are assumed to remain constant in the time scale of the projections. One of the main features of the methodology is that it avoids the necessity of fixing values of the dynamic parameters for the whole prediction period.

AngII levels can be modulated by ACE2 in tissues where the enzyme is highly expressed, such as the kidney. In the kidney, ACE2 has the potential to regulate the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which can impact blood pressure and renal injury. Thus, in disease states where the RAS is often upregulated, the function of ACE2 plays a particularly important role. This review highlights the results of recent studies that demonstrate the interplay between ACE2 and the kidney under normal and pathological conditions. RECENT FINDINGS ACE2 has been reported to play a key role in renal and cardiovascular function. Recent studies have implicated shedding of the membrane-bound ectodomain of ACE2 as one way in which the enzyme can be regulated and enzymatic activity altered. This posttranslational modification releases a fragment which retains enzymatic activity, and thus provides a novel mechanism by which the RAS can be altered in response to physiological stimuli. Decreased ACE2 activity is associated with increased blood pressure, diabetes, and oxidative stress, whereas, increased levels of ACE2 appear to be renoprotective. SUMMARY A growing body of evidence, involving both experimental and human studies, points out the crucial role that ACE2 plays on the modulation of renal injury. Thus, therapeutic targets aiming to increase ACE2 activity and the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-MasR axis could potentially become clinically relevant, especially in disease states where the renal RAS is upregulated.","output":"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and the kidney."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Following the recent COVID-19 lockdown, a reduction in emergency healthcare visits was reported. Infectious diseases were less often diagnosed, while it was not clear if this was due to a decrease in prevalence or a decrease in emergency healthcare visits due to fear of COVID-19. METHODS: This study comprises a follow-up from a recently finished randomised controlled trial, to gain insight into the prevalence of asthma exacerbation and fear of COVID-19 in patients with moderate-severe asthma and controls in the Netherlands. Participants, patients with asthma and controls, were invited to fill out a short survey by email or post. Exacerbation frequencies until 1 July 2020 were verified with the hospitals' and general practitioners' medical records, pharmacies and patient interviews. RESULTS: In quarter 2 of 2020, mean exacerbation frequency per patient was significantly lower (&#967;2(3)=9.91, p=0.019) compared with quarter 2 in previous years. Patients with asthma were more likely to avoid (38.8%; controls, 0.0%, p<0.01) or delay (24.5%; controls, 0.0%, p=0.02) essential medical visits due to fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection at medical facilities.

As a result, each government has proposed emergency public health measures that are critical to delay the transmission and spread of the virus and mitigate its impacts. In Brazil, the outbreak triggered many cases of people infected with COVID-19. Considering there are no drugs or vaccines proven to be effective to treat the disease, analyzing the data of infection cases and their mathematical interpretation are essential for supporting and guiding governmental measures to suppress and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. This means that estimates with mathematical models to assess the development potential of sustained human-human transmission are needed. Since the disease has its own biological characteristics, the models need to be adapted to the variability of the regions characteristics and the decision-making by both the government and the population, in order to be able to deal with real situations. Thus, in the present paper, we analyzed the official data of COVID-19 in Brazil and used the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation to predict the evolution of the disease. The model indicates that a nucleation rate is of fourth order, which indicates that Brazilians are crowding with no respect to measures of social distance and disease prevention.

If statistical heterogeneity was 50%, the results were derived from the fixedeffects model otherwise the random-effects model. Results: Overall, 1064 patients [mean age 66 years, 618 males] were included in the final analysis reviewing six investigations. The cumulative in-hospital rate of COVID-19 patients complicated by acute HF ranged between 6.9 to 63.4% among the studies reviewed. A random effect model revealed a pooled incidence of COVID-19 patients complicated by acute HF in 20.2% of cases (95% CI: 11.1-33.9%, p<0.0001 I2=94.4%) (Figure 1, Panel A).

We demonstrated that SM934 treatment alleviate the severity of arthritis in CIA mice with established manifestations. The therapeutic benefits were associated with ameliorated joint swelling and reduced extent of bone erosion and destruction. Further, administration of SM934 diminished the development of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and Th17 cells and suppressed the production of pathogenic antibodies, without altering the proportion of germinal center B cells. Ex vivo, SM934 treatment inhibited the bovine type II collagen (CII) induced proliferation and inflammatory cytokines secretion of CII -reactive T cells.

In particular for subpleural non-fibrotic ILAs, the risk of progression over time and the risk factors for progressive behavior are still largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine the age band prevalence of ILAs and the risk of radiological progression of subpleural non-fibrotic ILAs over time in a large health check-up population, and to identify how reticulation contributes to the risk of radiological progression. METHODS: Based on ILAs definition by the Fleischner Society, low-dose chest CT images from community-dwelling population undergone health check-up were evaluated for ILAs. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the risk of radiological progression. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 155,539 individuals, 3,300 (2.1%) were confirmed to have ILAs: the vast majority (81.7%) were defined as subpleural non-fibrotic ILAs. The prevalence of ILAs increased linearly with age (P for trend<0.0001). Of 454 individuals with subpleural non-fibrotic ILAs, 198 (43.6%) had radiological progression over 4 years. The presence of reticulation on initial imaging was an independent predictor of radiological progression (OR 1.9; 95%CI 1.2-3.0, P=0.0040). No difference in radiological progression was identified between subpleural non-fibrotic ILAs with extensive reticulation and subpleural fibrotic ILAs (73.0% vs. 68.8%, P=0.7626). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ILAs increases linearly with age. Nearly half of subpleural non-fibrotic ILAs progress radiologically over 4 years.

This paper takes the emergency care system in Taiwan as the research context, where first-aid hospitals are ranked to three levels, advanced, intermediate, and general, and, currently, emphasizes on a general emergency responsibility hospital. Having limited capacity and capability, a general emergency responsibility hospital treats minor and moderate injuries, from which the majority of earthquake-induced casualties suffer. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of this group of earthquake-induced non-urgent patients on the performance of a hospital. A patient flow model was built to represent patients paths throughout emergency care. Based on the model, discrete event simulation was applied to simulate patients trajectories and states of a hospital under four seismic scenarios, where patient visits are 1.4, 1.6, 1.9, and 2.3 times the normal number. A healthcare performance index, Crowdedness Index (CI), is proposed to measure crowdedness on a daily basis, which is defined as the ratio of the average waiting time for treatment to the recommended maximal waiting time. Results of simulations rendered the establishment of empirical equations, describing the relation between the maximum CIs and the patient growth ratios. In the most severe case in this study, the maximum CI exceeds 92 and it takes 10 days to recover from the quality drop. This highlights the problem a general emergency responsibility hospital may encounter if no emergency response measure is implemented. Findings are provided pertaining to the predication of a recovery curve and the alarming level of patient increase, which are supportive information for preparedness planning as well as response measure formulation to improve resilience.","output":"A challenge for healthcare system resilience after an earthquake: The crowdedness of a first-aid hospital by non-urgent patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic period, container computed tomography (CT) scanners were developed and used for the first time in China to perform CT examinations for patients with clinically mild to moderate COVID-19 who did not need to be hospitalized for comprehensive treatment, but needed to be isolated in Fangcang shelter hospitals (also known as makeshift hospitals) to receive some supportive treatment.

A monovalent inactivated H1N1pdm09 vaccine was licensed in Brazil in 2014. However, there are concerns about its efficacy due to the limited vaccine cross-protection against heterologous viruses and the potential for exacerbated reactions against vaccine strains. Thus, monitoring SIAVs subtypes/lineages that are circulating in the Brazilian swine population is important, by applying a fast and efficient diagnostic test in herd field samples. A RT-PCR assay was developed, using primers specific for HA subtyping of Brazilian SIAV, and was used to evaluate the occurrence of subtypes from samples collected between 2012 and 2019. From 167 field samples positive for influenza A, 117 were subtyped by nested RT-PCR assay. A higher occurrence of H1N1pdm was observed from 2012 to 2015, H3N2 in 2017, and H1hu in 2017 to 2019. A hemagglutination inhibition test was performed in serum samples received from 2017 to 2019, confirming these data.

Quantitative RT-PCR showed that JHMV RNA decreased from approximately 2 ng/ug total brain RNA at day 6 post-inoculation (PI) to 0.1 pg/ug total brain RNA at 360 days PI. Double-stranded viral RNA could be detected up to day 20 PI.

A number of viral labeling methods have been utilized for tracking viral infection process, but most of them are laborious or decreasing viral activity. Herein we explored a lipid biosynthetic labeling strategy for dynamical tracking the infection of H5N1 pseudotype virus (H5N1p) in host. Biotinylated lipids (biotinyl Cap-PE) were successfully incorporated into viral envelope when it underwent budding process by taking advantage of host cell-derived lipid metabolism. Biotin-H5N1p virus was effectively in situ-labeled with streptavidin-modified near-infrared quantum dots (NIR SA-QDs) using streptavidin-biotin conjugation with well-preserved virus activities. Dual-labeled imaging obviously shows that H5N1p viruses are primarily taken up in host cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In animal models, Virus-conjugated NIR QDs displayed extraordinary photoluminescence, superior stability, and tissue penetration in lung, allowing us to long-term monitor respiratory viral infection in a noninvasive manner. Importantly, the co-localization of viral hemagglutinin protein and QDs in infected lung further conformed the dynamic infection process of virus in vivo.

This project aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of TeleNP in a pediatric clinical population and disseminate clinical decision-making procedures to guide best practices for pediatric TeleNP. METHOD: This project conducted during the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic reflects the largest clinical cohort to date of TeleNP in a pediatric population (N = 129). Data were gathered retrospectively from patients who were rescheduled from in-person assessment to TeleNP between March to June 2020. RESULTS: TeleNP was an accessible option for most patients and families, with no differences in demographic variables in patient appointment attendance, whether testing was conducted, and whether the patient was referred for face-to-face follow-up. Patients using laptops/desktops were more likely to undergo remote test administration in comparison with patients using phones/tablets (&#967;2 = 23.83, p < .002).

TeleNP screening as standard practice for patients who do not require a full, traditional neuropsychological battery may provide a more efficient care model, with more patients able to be seen using shorter batteries with less wait time.","output":"Pediatric Teleneuropsychology: Feasibility and Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current COVID-19 crisis, teaching is difficult. The demands from students, parents, the government, and school administrators may be overwhelming. Many Malaysian teachers are experiencing growing mental strain, and they are reluctant to seek help due to social stigma. This quantitative study explored the impact of coworker and supervisor support on stress among primary and secondary school teachers in Malaysia. In addition, the study examined the spill-over impact of stress on teachers turnover intention. A sample of 250 Malaysian school teachers completed a questionnaire. The data were analysed using correlation and regression analyses. Results re-emphasized the positive impact of coworker support on reducing teachers stress, but not supervisor support. Furthermore, it was found that teacher stress was linked to a higher likelihood of turnover. Therefore, it is important for school administrators and policymakers to strengthen the role of coworkers in reducing stress among Malaysian school teachers. ?Authors","output":"The Impact of Coworker and Supervisor Support on Stress among Malaysian School Teachers during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2, a positive-sense single-stranded RNA Coronavirus, is a global threat to human health. Thus, understanding its life cycle mechanistically would be important to facilitate the design of antiviral drugs. A key aspect of viral progression is the synthesis of viral proteins by the ribosome of the human host. In Coronaviruses, this process is regulated by the viral 5? and 3? untranslated regions (UTRs), but the precise regulatory mechanism has not yet been well understood. In particular, the 5?-UTR of the viral genome is most likely involved in translation initiation of viral proteins. Here, we performed inline probing and RNase V1 probing to establish a model of the secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 5?-UTR. We found that the 5?-UTR contains stable structures including a very stable four-way junction close to the AUG start codon. Sequence alignment analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants 5?-UTRs revealed a highly conserved structure with few co-variations that confirmed our secondary structure model based on probing experiments.","output":"Secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 5-UTR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the generalized spatial modulation (GSM) is applied to visible light communication (VLC), radio frequency (RF) technologies, such as constellation designs, should be modified for the ergodic VLC channel, which is different from that in typical RF environments.

Telecardiology has the advantage of reducing patient's access time to the hemodynamics units. Data from literature show a reduction in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a low number of studies on the impact of telecardiology during the pandemic. Methods. Our telecardiology system is composed of a Hub-and-Spoke network of hospitals and ambulances that ensures a rapid exchange of information allowing STEMI patients to be treated in the shortest time possible. We compared data from electrocardiogram (ECG) transmissions and STEMI diagnosis collected between February and April 2020 with the data from the same period of 2019. Results. Despite a significant reduction of ECG transmissions from the telecardiology network was observed, the number of diagnosed STEMI during 2020 was stable and did not show any significant difference compared to 2019. The total number of STEMI diagnosis in the months under examination during 2019 were 47 out of 7463 ECGs (0.63%), while in 2020 were 48 out of 5797 ECGs (0.83%). Conclusions. The efficiency of our telecardiology system along with the low spread of the infection in our region contributed to maintaining the number of STEMI diagnosis and patient's care in line with the past even during the pandemic.","output":"Covid-19 and stemi: The role of telecardiology in the management of stemi diagnosis during the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Where graphs are used for modelling and specifying systems, consistency is an important concern. To be a valid model of a system, the graph structure must satisfy a number of constraints. To date, consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property: a graph either is or is not consistent with respect to a set of graph constraints. This has enabled the definition of notions such as constraint-preserving and constraint-guaranteeing graph transformations. Many practical applicationsfor example model repair or evolutionary searchimplicitly assume a more graduated notion of consistency, but without an explicit formalisation only limited analysis of these applications is possible. In this paper, we introduce an explicit notion of consistency as a graduated property, depending on the number of constraint violations in a graph. We present two new characterisations of transformations (and transformation rules) enabling reasoning about the gradual introduction of consistency: while consistency-sustaining transformations do not decrease the consistency level, consistency-improving transformations strictly reduce the number of constraint violations. We show how these new definitions refine the existing concepts of constraint-preserving and constraint-guaranteeing transformations. To support a static analysis based on our characterisations, we present criteria for deciding which form of consistency ensuring transformations is induced by the application of a transformation rule. We illustrate our contributions in the context of an example from search-based model engineering.","output":"Graph Consistency as a Graduated Property: Consistency-Sustaining and -Improving Graph Transformations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The trajectory of critical ethical reflection on technology has been from big issues (eighteenth century arguments for social revolution responding to the evils of the industrial revolution) to small ones (particular issues associated with the practices of engineers).

It has a social dimension and is shaped by various social factors. DATA We employ original data from a large survey (N = 20,632) conducted in China from April 21 to 23, 2020, which provide us with a rare opportunity to investigate COVID-19-induced worry among ordinary Chinese citizens. RESULTS We find individuals' socioeconomic status, family characteristics, sense of community, and perceived strictness of lockdown measures all have significant influences on worry about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS First, individuals with higher socioeconomic status such as better education, better income, and more prestigious occupations have richer resources in coping with COVID-19 and are thus less worried. Second, the high human-to-human transmissibility of COVID-19 and increased family obligations during the pandemic imply that larger family size can be a worry-inducing burden. Individuals living with larger families are more worried. Third, a greater sense of community lowers worry as it buffers against the stressor and may enhance individuals' faith in the community's efficacy in containing the virus. Last, stringent lockdown measures may actually have positive psychological effects. They provide real and perceived protection and increase individuals' perceived distance from the disease, thereby reducing public worry.","output":"Social factors and worry associated with COVID-19: Evidence from a large survey in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this communication is to describe the preliminary evaluation of the Virginia Fresh Match (VFM) financial incentive program for fresh fruits and vegetables for Virginia Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program shoppers and to determine if there were differences in incentive outcomes by race.

Persistent postsurgical pain (PPP) has an incidence of up to 30C50% and has negative outcome of quality of life and negative burden on individuals, family, and society. The 2016 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidelines states that enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) forms an integral part of Perioperative Surgical Home (PSH) and is now recommended to use a multimodal opioid-sparing approach for management of postoperative pain. As such, dexmedetomidine is now being used as part of ERAS protocols along with regional nerve blocks and other medications, to create a satisfactory postoperative outcome with reduced opioid consumption in the Post anesthesia care unit (PACU). RECENT FINDINGS: Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha(2) agonist, possesses analgesic effects and has a different mechanism of action when compared with opioids. When dexmedetomidine is initiated at the end of a procedure, it has a better hemodynamic stability and pain response than ropivacaine. Dexmedetomidine can be used as an adjuvant in epidurals with local anesthetic sparing effects. Its use during nerve blocks results in reduced postoperative pain. Also, local infiltration of IV dexmedetomidine is associated with earlier discharge from PACU.

This is likely to harm the development of new therapeutic strategies and their translation into the clinic in the long term. Recently, the need to maintain continuity in research activities in those fields has assumed even greater importance due to the accumulation of data concerning the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the musculoskeletal system. This study is aimed at the identification of a series of safe handling practices against COVID-19 diffusion to apply in a research environment, thus allowing the maintenance of research lab activities. METHODS: The control measures to apply to mitigate the COVID-19 risk were identified and categorized utilizing the Hierarchy of Controls. We also compared our analysis with that assessed before the pandemic to consider the additional risk of COVID-19. RESULTS: Results highlighted that the most relevant implemented measures to control SARS-CoV-2 were based on protecting people through engineering (e.g., ventilation and social distancing), and administrative (e.g., hand sanitization, work shifts) measures or Personnel Protective Equipment, rather than eliminating hazards at the source (e.g., smart working). CONCLUSIONS: Work continuity in research labs during the COVID-19 emergency should be guaranteed by ensuring the protection of researchers in the workplace and considering the physical environment, the type of operators and work activity, and the proven ability of workers to face biological risks.

But it is not possible to talk about technology without talking about digital transformation. The technology applied to medicine provides health professionals with greater access to information and tools that convey evidence-based medicine are essential. Among them we can mention databases such as Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and UpToDate platform. The COVID 19 pandemic has further accelerated this digital transformation process, instituting changes that are here to stay. Objectives: Today in Brazil, we have an average of 7,000 oncologists and 3,000 hematologists. We know that access to information in a foreign language, even English, is still a problem. The excess of information, and the difficulty of reading scientific publications critically, are another obstacle in medical education in a developing country. The objective of this project is to expand access to information, in continues medical education model, to improve public and private health in the area of hematology. Methods: The hematology team at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein (HIAE), associated with the HIAE digital transformation laboratory, developed a healthtech platform, called hematolog.app, aiming to make available several updated technical content in different formats: podcasts, videos, discussion of clinical cases, analysis of scientific articles in the form of visual abstracts, reviews of relevant topics in text format. The initiative is supported by the most important national hematology Societies. Discussion: We know that healthtech platforms have transformed medical practice. An online survey of clinicians at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital described the following effects among UpToDate users: 95% reported that UpToDate was integral for making decisions, 94% reported that they had changed diagnosis, 95% reported that UpToDate led to a change in patient management, 97% said UpToDate helps them provide the best care for their patients, 90% reported that UpToDate makes them a better doctor, 96% reported made them more comfortable with their decisions. PubMed makes it possible to identify references and summaries of articles from the Medline database, maintained by the National Library of Medicine. PubMed provides several tools to make the search more efficient, unknown to most doctors. Conclusion: The development of hematolog.app aims to create a digital platform that integrates specialists in the area, creating a continuous process of education, and integrating professionals in a developing country, seeking to standardize medical practice in different regions and health services in Brazil, creating an interconnected social network and practicing evidence-based medicine.

METHODS: A population-based, age-structured economic model was used to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of vaccination against influenza, pertussis, herpes zoster, and pneumococcal disease among US adults aged 50 years and older, accounting for aging of the population. The model used separate decision trees for each disease to project the discounted number of vaccinated individuals, number of disease cases, and direct medical and indirect costs (2018 US$) over a 30-year period. Benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) and net present values were calculated for two primary analyses comparing current vaccination coverage versus no vaccination and comparing increased coverage versus current coverage. Key parameter values were varied in deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Current adult vaccination coverage (vs. no vaccination) is estimated to result in nearly 65 million averted disease cases, $185 billion averted costs of cases, and $136 billion in incremental vaccination costs over a 30-year period from a societal perspective (BCR = 1.4). Increased vaccination coverage (vs. current coverage) is associated with over 33 million additional averted disease cases, $96 billion additional averted costs of cases, and nearly $83 billion in incremental vaccination costs, resulting in a societal BCR of 1.2 over 30 years. Deterministic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that results were most sensitive to disease incidence, vaccine efficacy, and productivity costs for time required for vaccination.

Therefore, we compared the complications and technical effectiveness of renal RFA guided by ultrasound alone versus combined CT and ultrasound guidance. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed outcomes and complications of percutaneous renal RFA in two groups of patients for whom RFA was guided by either ultrasound alone (group 1) or combined CT and ultrasound (group 2). The sole factor in determining the method of guidance was preablation imaging. All other technical factors were consistent between the two groups. RESULTS There were 28 masses in 27 patients in group 1 and 32 masses in 29 patients in group 2. There was an overall major complication rate of 3.3% (2/60). Major complications occurred equally in group 2 (3.1% [1/32]) compared with group 1 (3.6% [1/28]). Overall ablative effectiveness was 93% (26/28) in group 1 and 84% (27/32) in group 2. There was no statistical difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION In proper hands, sonography guidance alone is a safe and effective method for performance of renal RFA in preselected cases and can decrease CT utilization. The use of CT is reserved for situations in which pretreatment RFA imaging suggests difficulty in ultrasound mass visualization or when the mass is in close proximity to structures that may be injured by thermal ablation.","output":"Pretreatment imaging can be used to select imaging guidance, ultrasound alone versus CT plus ultrasound, for percutaneous renal radiofrequency ablation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disorder of the tears and ocular surface accompanied by ocular discomfort, visual disturbance, tear film instability, and ocular surface inflammation. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate for the treatment of DED. METHODS: Experimental models of DED were generated in Sprague Dawley rats using a combination of benzalkonium chloride (BAC) with atropine sulfate and in New Zealand White rabbits using BAC. The animals were treated twice daily with eye drops of vehicle, imatinib (0.01%C0.3%), or a positive control (Restasis). The improvement in DED due to imatinib was assessed by staining with fluorescein, lissamine green, impression cytology, and histological analysis. In addition, immunofluorescence staining was performed at the end of the study to evaluate the inflammatory response in the ocular surface. RESULTS: Topical application of imatinib significantly reduced ocular surface damage compared with vehicle-treated animals. Imatinib restored the morphology and structure of the conjunctival epithelium and reduced the recruitment of immune cells in the corneal epithelium. Furthermore, imatinib significantly reduced the impression cytology score, thus demonstrating that imatinib prevents the loss of goblet cells in DED animal models. The therapeutic efficacy of imatinib was similar to or better than that of cyclosporine treatment.

Then, multiple regression was used to establish the relationship model between the overall performance of the system and the main elements. Three key service nodes of the system (medical specialist support, patient tracking management and personalized intervention) were determined according to the weight of the regression model. The regression coefficients of the above three main elements show a similar impact on the overall performance of the system, but the key service nodes under each major element have relative differences, including medical specialist support, patient tracking management and personalized intervention. Finally, to establish a chronic disease management system with multiple departmental continuous care for chronic diseases, it is necessary to improve the chronic disease management system from three aspects of medical specialty support, patient tracking management and personalized intervention.

The stepped-wedge randomization implies that all dyads receive the intervention, but the timing is determined by randomization. The control group constitutes the dyads waiting for the intervention. The multicomponent intervention was developed in collaboration with user-representatives, researchers and stakeholders to meet the requirements from the national Dementia Plan 2020. During the 6-month intervention period, the participants will be allocated to a municipal coordinator, the core feature of the intervention, responsible for regular contact with the dyads to facilitate L: Learning, I: Innovation, V: Volunteering and E: Empowerment (LIVE). The primary outcome is resource utilization. This is measured by the Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) instrument and the Relative Stress Scale (RSS), reflecting that resource utilization is more than the actual time required for caring but also how burdensome the task is experienced by the caregiver. DISCUSSION: We expect the implementation of LIVE to lead to a pathway for dementia treatment and care which is cost-effective, compared to treatment as usual, and will support high-quality independent living, at home.

None of these has proven superiority compared with the classical clamp-crushing technique. This randomized clinical trial compared the effectiveness and safety of stapler transection with that of clamp-crushing during open liver resection. METHODS Patients admitted for elective open liver resection between January 2010 and October 2011 were assigned randomly to stapler transection or the clamp-crushing technique. The primary endpoint was the total amount of intraoperative blood loss. Secondary endpoints included transection time, duration of operation, complication rates and resection margins. RESULTS A total of 130 patients were enrolled, 65 to clamp-crushing and 65 to stapler transection. There was no difference between groups in total intraoperative blood loss: median (i.q.r.) 1050 (525-1650) versus 925 (450-1425) ml respectively (P = 0279). The difference in total intraoperative blood loss normalized to the transection surface area was not statistically significant (P = 0092). Blood loss during parenchymal transection was significantly lower in the stapler transection group (P = 0002), as were the parenchymal transection time (mean(s.d.) 30(21) versus 9(7) min for clamp-crushing and stapler transection groups respectively; P < 0001) and total duration of operation (mean(s.d.) 221(86) versus 190(85) min; P = 0047). There were no significant differences in postoperative morbidity (P = 0863) or mortality (P = 0684) between groups. CONCLUSION Stapler transection is a safe technique but does not reduce intraoperative blood loss in elective liver resection compared with the clamp-crushing technique.

This narrative review aims to shed light on the optimal diagnosis and management of patients with or suspected to have PCa. RECENT FINDINGS: Faecal-oral or aerosol transmission is possible during prostate procedures;caution must be in place when performing digital rectal examinations, transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies and prostate surgeries requiring general anaesthesia. Patients must also be triaged using preoperative polymerase chain reaction tests for COVID-19. COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), reducing the need for prostate biopsy unless when absolutely indicated, and the risk of COVID-19 spread can be reduced. Combined with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density, amongst other factors, multiparametric MRI could reduce unnecessary biopsies in patients with little chance of clinically significant PCa. Treatment of PCa should be stratified by the risk level and preferences of the patient. COVID-19 has accelerated the development of telemedicine and clinicians should utilise safe and effective teleconsultations to protect themselves and their patients. SUMMARY: COVID-19 transmission during prostate procedures is possible. Patients with a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) of <3 and PSA density <0.15ng/ml/ml are <3 and PSA density <0.15 ng/ml/ml or are deemed low-risk are safe to undergo surveillance without MRI-targeted biopsy. Intermediate- or high-risk patients should be offered definitive treatment within four months or 30 days of diagnosis to avoid compromising treatment outcomes;three-month courses of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy can be considered when a delay of surgery is anticipated.","output":"Implications and effects of COVID-19 on diagnosis and management of prostate cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CLINICAL RELEVANCE The synchronous hybrid learning environment is associated with increased time spent by students working with VDT and increased prevalence of dry eye symptoms in a university-based population. BACKGROUND To assess the prevalence of dry eye symptoms using the ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire in university students and to identify whether factors such as the synchronous hybrid learning environment as a preventive measure of COVID-19, video display terminal use, gender or contact lens wear influence dry eye symptomatology. METHODS This study was performed using a web-based questionnaire that was distributed to university students to assess questions related to class attendance, to the use of video display terminals, the need for optical correction and, finally, the OSDI questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 676 university students with an average age of 20.7  2.9 years completed the questionnaire, of which 72.6% (491) were females and 27.4% (185) were males. Only 10.2% of the participants attended face to face classes. Of the participants, 35.5% were contact lens wearers. The mean OSDI score of the study population was 27.68  20.09 and the prevalence of symptomatic dry eye disease (OSDI score above 22) was 51.8%. Female gender (X2(3) = 38.605, p < 0.001), online class attendance (X2(1) = 20.31; p < 0.001), increased hours of online class attendance (X2(2) = 26.84, p < 0.001) and contact lens wear (X2(2) = 15.264, p < 0.05) were associated with a higher incidence of symptomatic dry eye disease. CONCLUSION The synchronous hybrid learning environment increases the time students spend working with video display terminals and the prevalence of dry eye symptoms.

As witnessed by the psychiatric and medical literature in the last decades, in fact, the Holocaust survivors (HS) appear to suffer from several Shoah-related late-onset diseases impacting their survival, such as internal illnesses and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cancer represents a further severe pathology which seems to be connected with the Holocaust experience. Our aim was to review the existing knowledge of Holocaust-related cancer in HS in order to assess its real incidence and clinicoprognostic significance. MATERIALS AND METHODS We systematically reviewed the literature dealing with Israeli Jewish and non-Jewish non-Israeli HS developing cancer. We also reviewed and analyzed the cancer data of noted Jewish HS not resident or having resided in Israel available as public information. RESULTS We found 16 and 15 studies on Israeli Jews and non-Jewish non-Israeli survivors, respectively. A statistically significant association between the Holocaust and development of late-onset cancer in HS was seen in most studies with cancer adversely impacting the survival. We also selected 330 noted Jewish non-Israeli HS: genocide-related late-onset cancer resulted to be a significant and independent risk factor of poor prognosis (p<0.0001) imparting shorter survival in affected versus non-cancer subjects (57 versus 64 years, respectively, p=0.0001). CONCLUSION Although 76 years have passed, our review shows how the Holocaust keeps on burdening its survivors. Moreover, we offered the first analysis of Jewish HS not resident or having resided in Israel in terms of genocide-related late-onset diseases focusing on cancer. Further studies on Jewish non-Israeli HS are needed in order to corroborate our findings on late-onset cancer occurring in this targeted population.","output":"The Holocaust Is a Significant and Independent Risk Factor of Late-Onset Cancers: A Systematic Review of the Literature and Original Data on Jewish Israeli, Jewish Non-Israeli and Non-Jewish Non-Israeli Survivors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the original publication of the article, the section heading \\"Conclusion\\" was placed before the sentence \\"The assessment of changes in cardiac output\\" in page 2 instead of the sentence \\"From home to ICUs, innovations in\\" in the last paragraph of the page 2 The correct section is given below","output":"Correction to: COVID-19: Pulse oximeters in the spotlight"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autophagy is an essential process for physiological homeostasis, but its role in viral infection is only beginning to be elucidated. We show here that the Atg5-Atg12 conjugate, a key regulator of the autophagic process, plays an important role in innate antiviral immune responses. Atg5-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were resistant to vesicular stomatitis virus replication, which was largely due to hyperproduction of type I interferons in response to immunostimulatory RNA (isRNA), such as virus-derived, double-stranded, or 5'-phosphorylated RNA. Similar hyperresponse to isRNA was also observed in Atg7-deficient MEFs, in which Atg5-Atg12 conjugation is impaired. Overexpression of Atg5 or Atg12 resulted in Atg5-Atg12 conjugate formation and suppression of isRNA-mediated signaling. Molecular interaction studies indicated that the Atg5-Atg12 conjugate negatively regulates the type I IFN production pathway by direct association with the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and IFN-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) through the caspase recruitment domains (CARDs). Thus, in contrast to its role in promoting the bactericidal process, a component of the autophagic machinery appears to block innate antiviral immune responses, thereby contributing to RNA virus replication in host cells.","output":"The Atg5 Atg12 conjugate associates with innate antiviral immune responses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study conceptualized digital competence in line with self-determined theory (SDT) and investigated how it alongside help-seeking and learning agency collectively preserved university students psychological well-being by assisting them to manage cognitive load and academic burnout, as well as increasing their engagement in online learning during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Moreover, students socioeconomic status and demographic variables were examined. Partial least square modeling and cluster analysis were performed on the survey data collected from 695 students. The findings show that mental load and mental effort were positively related to academic burnout, which was significantly negatively associated with student engagement in online learning. Digital competence did not directly affect academic burnout, but indirectly via its counteracting effect on cognitive load. However, help-seeking and agency were not found to be significantly negatively related to cognitive load. Among the three SDT constructs, digital competence demonstrated the greatest positive influence on student engagement. In addition, female students from humanities and social sciences disciplines and lower-income families seemed to demonstrate the weakest digital competence, lowest learning agency, and least help-seeking behaviors. Consequently, they were more vulnerable to high cognitive load and academic burnout, leading to the lowest learning engagement.

It has become very urgent and important to develop a bivalent vaccine that is able to target these two infectious diseases simultaneously. In this study, we generated three attenuated replicating recombinant VSV (rVSV) vaccine candidates. These rVSV-based vaccines co-express SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant spike protein (SP) or the receptor binding domain (RBD) and four copies of the highly conserved M2 ectodomain (M2e) of influenza A fused with the Ebola glycoprotein DC-targeting/activation domain. Animal studies have shown that immunization with these bivalent rVSV vaccines induced efficient but variable levels of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza M2e protein. Significantly, our vaccine candidates induced production of high levels of neutralizing antibodies that protected cells against SARS-CoV-2 Delta and other SP-pseudovirus infections in culture. Furthermore, vaccination with the bivalent VSV vaccine via either intramuscular or intranasal route efficiently protected mice from the lethal challenge of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and significantly reduced viral load in the lungs. These studies provide convincing evidence for the high efficacy of this bivalent vaccine to prevent influenza replication and initiate robust immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants. Further investigation of its efficacy to protect against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants will provide substantial evidence for new avenues to control two contagious respiratory infections, COVID-19 and influenza.","output":"Development and Characterization of Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (rVSV)-based Bivalent Vaccine Against COVID-19 Delta Variant and Influenza Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the interest in new software tools to monitor the computer-based activities of employees working remotely (teleworking), and the demand for better analytics functionalities to be offered, focusing on employeesperformance and work-life balance. In this paper, we aim to analyze the habits of teleworking employees based on their interaction with the computer: how the employees are involved in different types of activities (actual work, recreation, documentation), and which are the most intensive periods. A conceptual framework for workforce analytics was developed for this purpose, together with tools and applications, that can provide useful information on different categories of activities where employees are involved. Knowledge generation is performed in four phases: collecting, processing, organizing, and analyzing the data to create valuable insights for the organization. Based on this framework, we developed a case study in an IT company, where two categories of employees, developers and software consultants, were monitored for 114 days, with 3.5 million events being generated and processed. The results showed different habits for consultants and developers, in terms of working activity structure, working schedule, inactivity time and interaction with the computer. Differences were also identified when we compared our results with previous research that monitored software developers working in-house: remote workers tend to organize their program for a longer period during the day, and spend less time on meetings but longer time for programming. On the other hand, both categories of employees (in-house and teleworkers) show highly fragmented work, switching windows after very short periods of activity, with a potential negative impact on productivity, progress on tasks, and quality of output.

We were keen to explore the plant-based product against RdRp and analyze its inhibitory potential to treat COVID-19. A unique collection of 248 plant compounds were selected based on their antiviral activity published in previous literature and were subjected to molecular docking analysis against the catalytic sub-unit of RdRp. The docking study was followed by a pharmacokinetics analysis and molecular dynamics simulation study of the selected best-docked compounds. Tellimagrandin I, SaikosaponinB2, Hesperidin and (-)-Epigallocatechin Gallate were the most prominent ones that showed strong binding affinity toward RdRp. All the compounds mentioned showed satisfactory pharmacokinetics properties and remained stabilized at their respective binding sites during the Molecular dynamics simulation. Additionally, we calculated the free-binding energy/the binding properties of RdRp-ligand complexes with the connection of MM/GBSA.

It has previously been suggested that for much of the Pliocene, no such modern analogs exist for the herbivore communities associated with hominins in eastern Africa. This study aims to determine whether the ungulate community associated with A. afarensis at the Pliocene site of Laetoli, Tanzania, shares similarities with extant communities or whether it lacks a modern analog. Our multiproxy approach using mesowear, hypsodonty, and stable carbon isotopes of tooth enamel to infer the diets of ungulates in the Upper Laetolil Beds shows that this community is dominated by browsers and mixed feeders and has a very low prevalence of grazers and frugivores. This dietary guild composition distinguishes the Upper Laetolil Beds from modern African communities and suggests either that the Upper Laetolil Beds had a unique vegetation structure which was able to support a higher diversity of browsing ungulates than that exists in African ecosystems today or that it retained an ungulate community that was resilient to environmental change. The Upper Laetolil Beds ungulate community is also unique relative to other mid-Pliocene communities in eastern Africa, some of which are similar to extant communities, while others, such as Laetoli, lack modern counterparts. This suggests that A. afarensis was a eurytopic species that inhabited a variety of ecosystems, including those with and without modern analogs. The co-occurrence of both analog and nonanalog communities in the Pliocene suggests that the transformation toward ungulate communities of modern aspect occurred asynchronously in eastern Africa.","output":"A nonanalog Pliocene ungulate community at Laetoli with implications for the paleoecology of Australopithecus afarensis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral respiratory tract infections are the most common illness in humans. Infection of the respiratory viruses results in accumulation of viral replicative double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is one of the important components of infecting viruses for the induction of lung epithelial cell apoptosis and innate immune response, including the production of interferon (IFN). In the present study, we have investigated the regulation of dsRNA-induced airway epithelial cell apoptosis by IFN. We found that transcription factor Runx3 was strongly induced by type-II IFN, slightly by type-III IFN, but essentially not by type-I IFN in airway epithelial cells. IFN-induced expression of Runx3 was predominantly mediated by JAK-STAT1 pathway and partially by NF-B pathway. Interestingly, Runx3 can be synergistically induced by IFN with a synthetic analog of viral dsRNA polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] or tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) through both JAK-STAT1 and NF-B pathways. We further found that dsRNA poly(I:C)-induced apoptosis of airway epithelial cells was mediated by dsRNA receptor toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and was markedly augmented by IFN through the enhanced expression of TLR3 and subsequent activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Last, we demonstrated that upregulation of Runx3 by IFN promoted TLR3 expression, thus amplifying the dsRNA-induced apoptosis in airway epithelial cells. These novel findings indicate that IFN promotes dsRNA-induced TLR3-dependent apoptosis via upregulation of transcription factor Runx3 in airway epithelial cells. Findings from our study may provide new insights into the regulation of airway epithelial cell apoptosis by IFN during viral respiratory tract infection.","output":"Interferon- promotes double-stranded RNA-induced TLR3-dependent apoptosis via upregulation of transcription factor Runx3 in airway epithelial cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The strengthening or substitution of intravenous cytotoxic chemotherapy cycles by oral targeted anticancer therapies, such as protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs), has provided impressive clinical benefits and autonomy as well as a better quality of life for patients with cancer. Despite these advances, adverse event management at home and medication adherence remain challenging. In addition, PKI plasma concentrations vary significantly among patients with cancer receiving the same dosage, which could explain part of the observed variability in the therapeutic response. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this optimizing oral targeted anticancer therapies (OpTAT) study is to optimize and individualize targeted anticancer treatments to improve patient care and self-monitoring through an interprofessional medication adherence program (IMAP) combined with measurement PKI plasma concentrations. METHODS: The OpTAT study has two parts: (1) a 1:1 randomized medication adherence program, in which the intervention consists of regular motivational interviewing sessions between the patient and the pharmacist, along with the delivery of PKIs in electronic monitors, and (2) a systematic collection of blood samples and clinical and biological data for combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis. On the basis of the electronic monitor data, medication adherence will be compared between groups following the three operational definitions: implementation of treatment during the persistent period, persistence with treatment and longitudinal adherence. The implementation will be described using generalized estimating equation models. The persistence of PKI use will be represented using a Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Longitudinal adherence is defined as the product of persistence and implementation. PKI pharmacokinetics will be studied using a population approach. The relationship between drug exposure and efficacy outcomes will be explored using Cox regression analysis of progression-free survival. The relationship between drug exposure and toxicity will be analyzed using a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model and by logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analyses will be applied to evaluate the best exposure threshold associated with clinical benefits. RESULTS: The first patient was included in May 2015. As of June 2021, 262 patients had participated in at least one part of the study: 250 patients gave at least one blood sample, and 130 participated in the adherence study. Data collection is in process, and the final data analysis is planned to be performed in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The OpTAT study will inform us about the effectiveness of the IMAP program in patients with solid cancers treated with PKIs. It will also shed light on PKI pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, with the aim of learning how to adapt the PKI dosage at the individual patient level to increase PKI clinical suitability. The IMAP program will enable interprofessional teams to learn about patients needs and to consider their concerns about their PKI self-management, considering the patient as an active partner.

In addition, the bone formation and mineral apposition rates are similar between genotypes, indicating a defect in osteoclast-specific function in vivo. Lack of CD13 led to exaggerated in vitro osteoclastogenesis as indicated by significantly enhanced fusion of bone marrow-derived multinucleated osteoclasts in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL, resulting in abnormally large cells containing remarkably high numbers of nuclei.

We investigated the effectiveness of regdanvimab, an anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 monoclonal antibody approved in Korea, in the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients who were admitted to a COVID-19 designated hospital during the study period of February 1 to June 31 and met the indications for administration of regdanvimab were reviewed to assess baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes such as supplemental oxygen requirements, mortality, and length of hospitalization. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with requiring supplemental oxygen. Subgroup analysis was performed according to the presence of pneumonia confirmed on a chest X-ray. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-eight COVID-19 patients were included in the study, and 65 (16.3%) of them were administered regdanvimab. The proportion of patients requiring supplemental oxygen was significantly lower in the regdanvimab group than in the control group (6.2% vs. 20.1%, P = 0.007). There was no significant difference in mortality (0% vs. 1.5%, P >0.999) and the length of hospitalization (median: 10 days vs. 10 days, P = 0.267) between two groups. The multivariable analysis demonstrated that administration of regdanvimab was independently associated with lower oxygen supplement [odds ratio (OR): 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06 - 0.55, P = 0.004] after adjustment of potential risk factors related to supplemental oxygen including age, sex, chest X-ray abnormality, and underlying chronic kidney disease. Among the patients with pneumonia radiologically, administration of regdanvimab was also associated with lower risk of oxygen supplement (OR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.02 - 0.46, P = 0.007).

In China, involvement of heavy vehicles in overall and fatal crashes are prevalent, even though heavy vehicles only constitute a small proportion of overall registered motor vehicles. However, vehicle weight is rarely considered in the existing traffic conflict risk prediction and assessment models because of the unavailability of required data. METHOD: Novel risk indicators for the diagnosis of traffic conflict risk map, considering the effect of vehicle weight, are proposed, with the advantage of comprehensive traffic flow characteristics and vehicle weight data using Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) technique. Weight-incorporated risk level (WRL) and weight integrated risk level (WIRL) are established to quantify the traffic conflict risk, at an instant and over a specified time period, respectively, by extending the conventional traffic conflict risk measures including time-to-collision (TTC) and modified potential collision energy (PCE). Then, a microscopic traffic simulation model is adopted to estimate the traffic conflict risk map along a highway segment that has partial lane closure. The traffic conflict risk performances, between the risk indicators with and without considering the vehicle weight, are compared. RESULTS: The traffic conflict risks estimated using conventional risk indicators without considering the vehicle weight are generally lower than that based on WRL and WIRL. The difference is more profound when the proportion of heavy vehicles in the traffic stream increases. CONCLUSIONS: The finding is indicative to remedial engineering measures including variable message sign, speed limit, and ramp metering that can mitigate the real-time crash risks on highways, especially in adverse environmental and weather conditions, with due consideration of vehicle composition and crash worthiness of vehicles.","output":"A novel traffic conflict risk measure considering the effect of vehicle weight"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

The analysis was conducted by classifying users of one of the following types of food assistance as food assistance users and other users as non-users: eating on site (e.g., children's cafeteria), receiving food at a specific location (e.g., food pantry), or having food delivered to their home (e.g., emergency home food delivery). A multiple logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval (CI)) for the association between food assistance use and changes in socioeconomic status, which was assessed based on the employment status and household monthly income just before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.Results The number of users of food assistance was 3,071 (9.3%).

These modifications are signatures of \\"self\\" in higher eukaryotes, whereas unmodified cap0-RNA is recognized as foreign and, therefore, potentially harmful to the host cell.

Although murine Ifit1 is similar to human IFIT1 in its cap0-RNA-binding selectivity, the roles of Ifit1b and Ifit1c are unknown.

This process involves rearrangement and destruction of actin filaments, while microtubules become protected throughout the infection. Here the focus is on the intracellular egress pathway, as well as its impact on the properties and release of progeny virions. By colocalization with cellular marker proteins and specific modulation of the pathways through over-expression of variant effector genes transduced by recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors, we show that progeny PV particles become engulfed into COPII-vesicles in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are transported through the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Besides known factors like sar1, sec24, rab1, the ERM family proteins, radixin and moesin play (an) essential role(s) in the formation/loading and targeting of virus-containing COPII-vesicles. These proteins also contribute to the transport through ER and Golgi of the well described analogue of cellular proteins, the secreted Gaussia luciferase in absence of virus infection. It is therefore likely that radixin and moesin also serve for a more general function in cellular exocytosis. Finally, parvovirus egress via ER and Golgi appears to be necessary for virions to gain full infectivity through post-assembly modifications (e.g. phosphorylation). While not being absolutely required for cytolysis and progeny virus release, vesicular transport of parvoviruses through ER and Golgi significantly accelerates these processes pointing to a regulatory role of this transport pathway.","output":"Vesicular Transport of Progeny Parvovirus Particles through ER and Golgi Regulates Maturation and Cytolysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 12th, 2020 the Norwegian government announced what later became known as the lockdown' of Norway due to the outbreak of COVID-19.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute and short-term performance of the WEB II device regarding the immediacy, degree, and durability of aneurysm occlusion in two patients. METHODS The WEB II device was implanted in one patient with an unruptured MCA trifurcation aneurysm and one patient with an unruptured basilar tip aneurysm. The degree of intra-aneurysmal flow disruption was graded based on serial digital subtraction aneurysm angiography performed over 30 min immediately following device implantation and at 8 weeks. Immediate and 8-week post-treatment CT and 3-T MRI studies were also performed. RESULTS Delivery and deployment of the WEB II device was technically straightforward and achieved without complications. Neither device required retrieval or repositioning after full deployment. There were no peri-procedural thrombembolic or hemorrhagic complications. In both cases, complete aneurysm occlusion was observed within minutes of device deployment. Short-term angiographic follow-up confirmed stable complete occlusion at 8 weeks. CONCLUSION Early technical and clinical results from the first WEB II cases have been encouraging and suggest that the intra-saccular deployment of self-expanding, compliant, cylindrical, high-density, braided metallic mesh constructs may represent a feasible approach for the endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms.","output":"The Woven EndoBridge cerebral aneurysm embolization device (WEB II): initial clinical experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of life of Latin American orthopedic trauma surgeons during the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America. METHODS: A total of 400 orthopedic trauma surgeons from 14 Latin American countries were invited to complete an electronic survey aiming to understand the general situation of COVID-19 in each country and how COVID-19 had impacted life's participant financially and psychosocially. The relationship between the occurrence of the disease and the existence of legal regulations on the medical activity in the respondent's country, protocols for tracking the disease among patients hospitalized in an emergency basis due to skeletal trauma, and personal protective equipment to deal with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who need orthopedic trauma surgery was investigated, as well as the financial and psychosocial impact caused by the disease. Data was statistically analyzed with significance p < 0.05. RESULTS: 220 respondents completed the survey. 21 respondents were diagnosed with COVID-19. Local regulation was decisive in terms of increasing the risk for COVID-19 disease (p = 0.001). 91.8% of the respondents reported being concerned about their financial health and 57.7% described a state of feeling emotionally overextended. 75.0% believe that pandemic can change their professional activity. CONCLUSION: The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America has negatively impacted the professional, financial, and psychosocial health of orthopedic trauma surgeons. It seems reasonable to state that the combination of psychosocial distress and deprivation together with financial uncertainty and decreased revenue can be straightly related to development of burnout symptoms among doctors.","output":"The hidden impact of rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in professional, financial, and psychosocial health of Latin American orthopedic trauma surgeons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a respiratory virus whose primary route of transmission is airborne.

We sought to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission within US households and estimate the household secondary infection rate (SIR) to inform strategies to reduce transmission. METHODS: We recruited laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and their household contacts in Utah and Wisconsin during March 22CApril 25, 2020. We interviewed patients and all household contacts to obtain demographics and medical histories. At the initial household visit, 14 days later, and when a household contact became newly symptomatic, we collected respiratory swabs from patients and household contacts for testing by SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We estimated SIR and odds ratios (OR) to assess risk factors for secondary infection, defined by a positive rRT-PCR or ELISA test. RESULTS: Thirty-two (55%) of 58 households had evidence of secondary infection among household contacts. The SIR was 29% (n = 55/188; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 23C36%) overall, 42% among children (<18 years) of the COVID-19 patient and 33% among spouses/partners. Household contacts to COVID-19 patients with immunocompromised conditions had increased odds of infection (OR: 15.9, 95% CI: 2.4C106.9). Household contacts who themselves had diabetes mellitus had increased odds of infection (OR: 7.1, 95% CI: 1.2C42.5).

This has resulted in an urgent need to obtain information regarding its pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical manifestations. More specifically, skin manifestations, seldom reported initially, have been increasingly described. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a literature search in the PubMed database, regarding cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19. This article describes the clinical and histological findings of the main skin lesions observed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. DISCUSSION Cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been described in multiple retrospective and prospective studies, case series and case reports. The reported incidence reached 20.4%. Although there was substantial heterogeneity in terms of clinical patterns, the main ones include: erythematous/maculopapular, urticarial, papulovesicular, and purpuric/petechial eruptions, chilblain-like lesions and livedoid/acro-ischemic lesions. In the vast majority, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are not fully understood, although histopathological findings and biomolecular studies can add relevant data. CONCLUSION The recognition of cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 is of utmost importance. They may help establishing an early diagnosis, namely in oligosymptomatic patients or when confirmatory tests are impossible to perform. Moreover, chilblain-like lesions and acro-ischemia, also seem to play an important role in terms of prognosis.","output":"[Cutaneous Manifestations Associated with COVID-19: A Narrative Review]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information dissemination in the media, specifically social media, is one of the critical channels of information related to the COVID-19 outbreak sought by the public The information presented has been related to accurate and reliable situation reports and false information in various forms, not only text-based but also audio and visual The chaos of data, coupled with a central response that seemed unprepared, shaped the Indonesian community's perceptions of the COVID-19 outbreak This fact related to the massive number of internet users in Indonesia is one aspect of the government's decision, in this case BNPB (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana;officially National Disaster Management Authority), to engage strong social media influencers The government collaborated with some influencers to enable public engagement through online social media platforms in the context of COVID-19-two of them being @dr tirta and @rachelvennya The platforms also gained more visibility after being appointed COVID-19 influencers They updated information about COVID-19 on their social media accounts with picture posts and Instagram stories, either individually or in collaboration with others This study aims to analyse the practice of the Indonesian government's agency using micro-celebrity to deploy a risk communication frame and the delivery of the message by a celebrated person","output":"Micro-celebrity participation and risk communication in Indonesia A content analysis of @dr.tirta and @rachelvennya Instagram posts during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic has forced closures of primary schools resulting in loss of learning time on a global scale. In addition to face coverings, social distancing, and hand hygiene, an efficient testing method is important to mitigate spread of COVID-19 in schools. We evaluated the feasibility of a saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing program on 18 primary schools in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Qualitative results show that children 4 to 5 years had difficulty producing an adequate saliva specimen compared to those 6 to 12 years.

With 2016 to 2020 data, we find that during the first lockdown, regions with a previously lower academic performance actively increased their searches more in Google about e-learning tools than their counterparts, higher-performing regions. Analysing school administrative and survey data before the pandemic, we find that both teachers and students in lower performing regions were using no less e-learning tools than higher performing ones. These two findings suggest that the COVID-19 shock widened the e-learning usage gap between academically lower and higher-performing regions. We next exploit the regional variation in school closure mandates introduced in the 2020/2021 academic year. After corroborating that Google Trends provides a good measure of the change in e-learning usage, we report that the patterns detected after the first lockdown were no longer present in the subsequent academic year.

Using nationally representative data from the U.S., we assess whether religious/spiritual struggles are associated with a higher risk of suicidal ideation. We also focus on two aspects of religiosity that may modify the relationship between R/S struggles and suicidal ideation: beliefs in divine control and religious attendance. Results from regression analyses suggest that greater R/S struggles were associated with higher suicidal ideation, adjusting for psychological distress, economic hardship due to the pandemic, and several key demographic characteristics. Perceptions of divine control, but not religious attendance, were protective against higher suicidal ideation for people experiencing R/S struggles. While the longer term effects to well-being of the COVID-19 pandemic are only beginning to emerge, this study suggests that there are already significant and meaningful associations between greater R/S struggles and suicidal ideation.

Whether adults with obesity can achieve weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed. METHODS In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater (27 in persons with 1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions. RESULTS The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.9% in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.4% with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -13.4 to -11.5; P<0.001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 [4.9%]) at week 68 (P<0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.6 kg in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, -12.7 kg; 95% CI, -13.7 to -11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a greater increase in participant-reported physical functioning from baseline than those who received placebo. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common adverse events with semaglutide; they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and subsided with time.

RESULTS: We propose several innovative solutions including the flipped classroom model, online practice questions, teleconferencing in place of in-person lectures, involving residents in telemedicine clinics, procedural simulation, and the facilitated use of surgical videos. Although there is no substitute for hands-on learning through operative experience and direct patient care, these may be ways to mitigate the loss of learning exposure during this time.

Here, we highlight how COVID-19 threatens to jeopardize the tremendous gains made over the last few decades on improving childrens health globally. RECENT FINDINGS: In contrast to adults, children with COVID-19 are less likely to develop severe disease requiring hospitalization or die as a direct result of infection. However, the pandemic will likely have other important health impacts disproportionately affecting vulnerable children globally. Possible effects include worsening of poverty and food insecurity; disruption of already strained routine child health services; damage to already imperiled healthcare workforces; a wave of mental health challenges; interruption of education; and increased risks of violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect. These challenges notwithstanding, the response to COVID-19 may also provide opportunities, such as for health system strengthening, that could improve child health after the pandemic. SUMMARY: The negative impacts of COVID-19 on global child health may be substantial. However, these are not foregone conclusions and much can be done to mitigate the worst outcomes.

Critical care nurses play a pivotal role in developing models of care that are effective, flexible, and safe. OBJECTIVES: We report on the accelerated development of a critical care nursing surge model responsive to escalating needs for intensive care capacity. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory prospective observational cohort study that included (i) a self-assessment and survey of learning needs of noncritical care nurses identified as candidate groups for redeployment in the intensive care unit and (ii) a pilot implementation of a team nursing model evaluated by individual questionnaires and the conduct of focus groups. We used descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis to analyse the exploratory findings. RESULTS: We surveyed 147 noncritical care nurses; 99 (67.3%) self-assessed at the lowest level of critical care competency, whereas 33 (24.3%) reported feeling able to help care for a critically ill patient under the direction of a critical care nurse. Identified learning needs included appropriate use of personal protective equipment in the intensive care unit (n = 123, 83.7%), use of specialised equipment (n = 103, 85.1%), basic mechanical ventilation, and vasoactive medication.

Another 100 AIS patients who visited the emergency department from April to October 2019 were selected as the intervention group and received the integrated emergency care model based on FMEA. The total time spent from admission to completion of each emergency procedure [total time spent from admission to emergency physician reception (T(0?1)), total time spent from admission to stroke team reception (T(0?2)), total time spent from admission to imaging report out (T(0?3)), total time spent from admission to laboratory report out (T(0?4)), and total time spent from admission to intravenous thrombolysis (T(0?5))] was recorded for both groups. The clinical outcome indicators (vascular recanalization rate, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage incidence, mortality rate) were observed for both groups. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and Barthel score were evaluated for both groups after the intervention. The treatment satisfaction rate of the patients was investigated for both groups. RESULTS: The total time of T(0?1), T(0?2), T(0?3), T(0?4), T(0?5) in the intervention group (0.55  0.15, 1.23  0.30, 21.24  3.01, 33.30  5.28, 44.19  7.02) min was shorter than that of the control group (1.22  0.28, 4.01  1.06, 34.12  4.44, 72.48  8.27, 80.31  9.22) min (P < 0.05). The vascular recanalization rate in the intervention group (23.00%) was higher than that in the control group (12.00%) (P < 0.05). There was no statistical significance in the symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage incidence and mortality rate in the two groups (P > 0.05).

Research Question Is portable chest radiography an effective exclusionary test for future adverse clinical outcomes in patients suspected of COVID-19? Study Design and Methods Charts of consecutive patients suspected of COVID-19 at five emergency departments in New York City between March 19, 2020 through April 23, 2020 were reviewed. Patients were categorized based on absence of findings on initial chest radiography (CXR). The primary outcomes were hospital admission, mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and mortality. Results 3245 adult patients, 474 (14.6%) with a negative initial CXR, were reviewed. Among all patients, a negative initial CXR is associated with a low probability of future adverse clinical outcomes, with negative likelihood ratios of 0.27 (95% CI 0.23-0.31) for hospital admission, 0.24 (95% CI 0.16-0.37) for mechanical ventilation, 0.19 (95% CI 0.09-0.40) for ARDS, and 0.38 (95% CI 0.29-0.51) for mortality. Among the subset of 955 patients younger than 65 years old and with a duration of symptoms of at least 5 days, no patients with a negative CXR died and the negative likelihood ratios were 0.17 (95% CI 0.12-0.25) for hospital admission, 0.09 (95% CI 0.02-0.36) for mechanical ventilation, and 0.09 (95% CI 0.01-0.64) for ARDS. Interpretation Initial chest radiography in adult patients suspected of COVID-19 is a strong exclusionary test for hospital admission, mechanical ventilation, ARDS, and mortality.

Additional questionnaires about sociodemographic factors, personal and family histories of OCRD, COVID-19 related events, compulsivity and impulsivity traits, schizotypal symptoms, and the severity of depression, anxiety and stress levels, were also used. Participants reported that OCD, hoarding disorder (HD) and skin picking disorder (SPD) symptoms significantly worsened during the pandemic along with increased disability, more affective symptoms and reduced quality of life. Female gender, a higher number of COVID-19 related stressful events, and higher pre-COVID-19 fear of harm and symmetry symptoms predicted more severe OCD symptoms during the pandemic, whereas lack of a HD diagnosis by a mental health professional and more severe schizotypal symptoms predicted worsened hoarding symptoms. Greater compulsivity traits were associated with more severe COVID-19 pandemic obsessive-compulsive and hoarding symptoms.

This patient Is a 30- year-old female healthcare worker with a past medical history of ITP, pancreatitis, GERD, anxiety and recurrent pneumonia. She presented in March 2020 with fever, nasal congestion, and dry cough. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 in March 2020, via PCR through employee health. She was treated with a course azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. Symptoms resolved, however in June 2020, SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were negative. Seven months later in October, she once again developed symptoms which were milder. She was found to have a decreased level of mannose binding lectin, normal immunoglobulin levels, and normal streptococcus pneumonia IgG antibodies. On immune work-up after recovery, she was found to have a decreased level of mannose binding lectin (<50 ng/mL), normal immunoglobulin levels, and protective Streptococcus pneumoniae IgG antibodies with appropriate vaccine response. Her SARS-CoV-2 IgG returned back as positive 8 weeks after her second infection.

METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature published through March 31, 2020 was performed to estimate the mortality rate among hospitalized patients in China with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19. Hospital mortality rates were estimated using an inverse variance-weighted random-effects meta-analysis model. Funnel plot symmetry was evaluated for small-study effects, a one-study removed sensitivity analysis assessed the influence of individual studies on the pooled mortality rate, and metaregression assessed the association of potential confounding variables with mortality rates. RESULTS: The review included 16 observational studies involving 1832 hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of Covid-19. The surveillance period among studies ranged from December 16, 2019 to February 23, 2020. The median patient age was 53 years and 53% were males. A total of 38.5% of patients presented with at least 1 comorbidity, most commonly hypertension (24.0%), cardiac disease (15.1%), and diabetes mellitus (14.4%). Fever and cough, reported in 84.8% and 61.7% of patients respectively, were the most common patient symptoms. The pooled mortality rate was 9.9% (95% confidence interval 6.1% to 14.5%). Funnel plot asymmetry was not observed and the meta-analysis results were not substantially influenced by any single study since the pooled mortality rate ranged from 8.9% to 11.1% following iterative removal of one study at a time. Substantial heterogeneity in the mortality rate was identified among studies (Ia??=a??87%; Pa??<a??.001). In a metaregression that included demographics, patient risk factors, and presenting symptoms, only a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus was associated with a higher mortality rate (Pa??=a??.03). CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis of hospitalized patients in China with a diagnosis of Covid-19, the mortality rate was 9.9% and a higher diabetes mellitus prevalence was independently associated with a worse prognosis.

COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop clinical symptoms that are often confused with the infections of other respiratory pathogens. Sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 with the ability to discriminate from other viruses is urgently needed for COVID-19 diagnosis. Herein, we streamlined a highly efficient CRISPR-Cas12a-based nucleic acid detection platform, termed Cas12a-linked beam unlocking reaction (CALIBURN). We show that CALIBURN could detect SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses and influenza viruses with little cross-reactivity. Importantly, CALIBURN allowed accurate diagnosis of clinical samples with extremely low viral loads, which is a major obstacle for the clinical applications of existing CRISPR diagnostic platforms. When tested on the specimens from SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative donors, CALIBURN exhibited 73.0% positive and 19.0% presumptive positive rates and 100% specificity. Moreover, unlike existing CRISPR detection methods that were mainly restricted to respiratory specimens, CALIBURN displayed consistent performance across both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, suggesting its broad specimen compatibility. Finally, using a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we demonstrated that CALIBURN allowed detection of coexisting pathogens without cross-reactivity from a single tissue specimen.

Although great achievements have been made in COVID-19 research and many antiviral drugs have shown good therapeutic effects against COVID-19, a simple oral antiviral drug for COVID-19 has not yet been developed. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the improvement in mortality or hospitalization rates and adverse events among COVID-19 patients with three new oral antivirals (including molnupiravir, fluvoxamine and Paxlovid). METHODS: We searched scientific and medical databases, such as PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library for relevant articles and screened the references of retrieved studies on COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of eight studies were included in this study. The drug group included 2440 COVID-19 patients, including 54 patients who died or were hospitalized. The control group included a total of 2348 COVID-19 patients, including 118 patients who died or were hospitalized. The overall odds ratio (OR) of mortality or hospitalization was 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22C0.49) for COVID-19 patients in the drug group and placebo group, indicating that oral antiviral drugs were effective for COVID-19 patients and reduced the mortality or hospitalization by approximately 67%. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that three novel oral antivirals (molnupiravir, fluvoxamine and Paxlovid) are effective in reducing the mortality and hospitalization rates in patients with COVID-19. In addition, the three oral drugs did not increase the occurrence of adverse events, thus exhibiting good overall safety.

Changes in the platelet transcriptome and the specific impact of immature platelets on the platelet transcriptome remain unclear. Thus, this study sought to address whether and how elevated levels of immature platelets affect the platelet transcriptome in patients with sepsis. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from patients with sepsis requiring vasopressor therapy (n = 8) and from a control group of patients with stable coronary artery disease and otherwise similar demographic characteristics (n = 8). Immature platelet fraction (IPF) was determined on a Sysmex XE 2100 analyser and platelet function was tested by impedance aggregometry. RNA from leukocyte-depleted platelets was used for transcriptome analysis by Next Generation Sequencing integrating the use of unique molecular identifiers. RESULTS: IPF (median [interquartile range]) was significantly elevated in sepsis patients (6.4 [5.3C8.7] % vs. 3.6 [2.6C4.6] %, p = 0.005). Platelet function testing revealed no differences in adenosine diphosphate- or thrombin receptor activating peptide-induced platelet aggregation between control and sepsis patients. Putative circular RNA transcripts were decreased in platelets from septic patients. Leukocyte contamination defined by CD45 abundance levels in RNA-sequencing was absent in both groups. Principal component analysis of transcripts showed only partial overlap of clustering with IPF levels. RNA sequencing showed up-regulation of 524 and down-regulation of 118 genes in platelets from sepsis patients compared to controls. Upregulated genes were mostly related to catabolic processes and protein translation. Comparison to published platelet transcriptomes showed a large overlap of changes observed in sepsis and COVID-19 but not with reticulated platelets from healthy donors. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sepsis appear to have a less degraded platelet transcriptome as indicated by increased levels of immature platelets and decreased levels of putative circular RNA transcripts.

Healthcare workers maintained positive changes over time despite their prolonged exposure to an emergency and the possibility of retraumatization at the onset of a new emergency phase, irrespective of their working place. Healthcare workers who were treated in the first wave showed at the beginning of the second emergency wave less vulnerability and more resilience than those who were treated only in the second wave. Pre-treatment scores of healthcare workers affected by COVID-19 are discussed. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 had a significant impact on the well-being of healthcare workers who were working in hospitals. Psychological support in case of emergency is needed.","output":"Promoting Mental Health in Healthcare Workers in Hospitals Through Psychological Group Support With Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing During COVID-19 Pandemic: An Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper deals with the micro-macro derivation of virus models coupled with a reaction diffusion models that generates the dynamics in space of the virus particles.

The \\"Love and Sex in the Time of COVID-19\\" survey was conducted online from April 2020 to May 2020. GBMSMs were recruited through paid banner advertisements featured on social networking platforms, resulting in a sample size of 696. The analysis considers differences in responses to two scales: the Perceived Severity of HIV Infection and the Perceived Severity of COVID-19 Infection. Participants perceived greater seriousness for HIV infection (mean 46.67, range 17-65) than for COVID-19 infection (mean 38.81, range 13-62). Some items reflecting more proximal impacts of infection (anxiety, loss of sleep, and impact on employment) were similar for HIV and COVID-19. Those aged over 25 and those who perceived higher prevalence of COVID-19 in the United States or their state were more likely to report COVID-19 as more severe than HIV. There is a need to develop nuanced public health messages for GBMSMs that convey the ongoing simultaneous health threats of both HIV and COVID-19.","output":"Contrasting the Perceived Severity of COVID-19 and HIV Infection in an Online Survey of Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex With Men During the U.S. COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artificial blood is an innovative concept of transfusion medicine where specifically designed compounds perform the task of transport and delivery of oxygen in the body to replace this function of allogenic human blood transfusion. Several molecules have been developed in the past few decades to achieve this objective and continous refinements are being continuously made in the quest of the ideal blood substitute. Currently, available technology manufactures artificial blood from haemoglobin obtained from outdated human/bovine blood (Haemoglobin Based Oxygen Carriers) or utilizing Perfluorocarbons. These synthetic blood substitutes are advantageous in that they do not require compatibility testing, are free from blood borne infections, have prolonged shelf life and do not require refrigeration. Artificial blood is projected to have a significant impact on the development of medical care in the future. It can complement the current blood products for transfusion and create a stable supply of safe and effective products.

However, in programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting(2), a specific subversion of frame maintenance takes place, wherein the ribosome is forced to shift one nucleotide backwards into an overlapping reading frame and to translate an entirely new sequence of amino acids. This process is indispensable in the replication of numerous viral pathogens, including HIV and the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome(3), and is also exploited in the expression of several cellular genes(4). Frameshifting is promoted by an mRNA signal composed of two essential elements: a heptanucleotide slippery sequence(5) and an adjacent mRNA secondary structure, most often an mRNA pseudoknot(6). How these components operate together to manipulate the ribosome is unknown. Here we describe the observation of a ribosomeCmRNA pseudoknot complex that is stalled in the process of -1 frameshifting. Cryoelectron microscopic imaging of purified mammalian 80S ribosomes from rabbit reticulocytes paused at a coronavirus pseudoknot reveals an intermediate of the frameshifting process. From this it can be seen how the pseudoknot interacts with the ribosome to block the mRNA entrance channel, compromising the translocation process and leading to a spring-like deformation of the P-site transfer RNA. In addition, we identify movements of the likely eukaryotic ribosomal helicase and confirm a direct interaction between the translocase eEF2 and the P-site tRNA. Together, the structural changes provide a mechanical explanation of how the pseudoknot manipulates the ribosome into a different reading frame.

RECENT FINDINGS: SAP-E sets targets for the implementation of evidence-based preventive actions and stroke services to 2030. A recent mapping of stroke care in Europe has documented massive inequalities and even in high-income European countries access to reperfusion therapy and mortality after ischaemic stroke varies significantly. Organized stroke care providing stroke unit care and access to reperfusion therapies reduces mortality and long-term disability. Stroke prevention and care are highly cost-effective. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged organized care, diverged attention from stroke and necessitated a novel approach to the implementation program because of the continued need for social distancing and reduced travelling. Consequently, meetings, training and engagement will be handled by online resources. SUMMARY: Stroke can be prevented and treated but there remain massive inequalities in Europe. SAP-E has set targets for development of stroke care. COVID-19 pandemic has led to further challenges for stroke care and implementation of the Action Plan will rely on online meetings and resources as it is yet unforeseeable when things will return to normal.

OBJECTIVE: This study documented and characterized COVID-19 cases reported in individuals receiving treatment with Pfizer pharmaceutical products and cases that reported use of Pfizer pharmaceutical products for COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: This retrospective observational review leveraged the Pfizer safety database containing adverse event data collected in association with use of Pfizer products between 1 October, 2019, and 25 June, 2020; the database includes worldwide adverse event data from various sources. Selected Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA(?)) Preferred Terms and subsequent clinical review were used to characterize COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Over 1500 relevant cases were identified over an 8-month period. In cases that reported COVID-19, immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents, followed by anticoagulant/antithrombic agents and corticosteroids, were the most frequently reported agents. The frequent reporting of immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents among cases of COVID-19 suggests increased vulnerability to infection among treated patients, either because of immunosuppressive effects of certain agents or the nature of the underlying treated condition. In cases involving off-label pharmacotherapy use for the treatment of COVID-19-related conditions, the most frequently reported therapeutic classes included antibiotics, antimalarial agents, antivirals/antiretroviral agents, immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and immunoglobulin/interferons. The most frequently reported pharmacotherapeutic agents were azithromycin and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, followed by lopinavir-ritonavir, ceftriaxone, and tofacitinib. The most frequently reported clinical adverse events associated with azithromycin (as sole therapy or combined with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine) include electrocardiogram QT prolonged, drug interaction, hepatitis, diarrhea, and hepatitis acute. Regarding cardiac-related events, 19% (120/645) of azithromycin cases reported events associated with QT prolongation/torsade de pointes (which included seven fatal cardiac events). The most frequently reported clinical adverse events associated with other commonly used agents are also presented.

Therefore, contemporary research is required to determine the current pandemic's psychological impact on older populations. Soon after the COVID-19 outbreak, several narrative reviews and guidelines were released to support older adult's psychological wellbeing. However, a lack of data from original studies was reported until May 2020. AIM: To identify studies published from May 2020 until January 2021 that quantitatively assessed the mental health impact of COVID-19 on older adults using validated psychometric tools. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search of original research articles was conducted using specific terms. The screening procedure was conducted stepwise. RESULTS: Among the 18 included studies, cross-sectional online surveys indicated that older adults were less psychologically distressed than younger ones. A longitudinal study revealed that COVID-19 did not have a major impact on loneliness and satisfaction with life. On the contrary, studies comparing pre- with peri-pandemic data revealed that older adults experienced more severe depressive/anxiety/stress symptoms and loneliness during the pandemic. Several studies reported though only subclinical symptoms, as well as low loneliness levels during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Research studies suggested that older age may buffer against the COVID-19-related impact on mental health. Despite evidence against generalised perceptions of vulnerability, older adults' ability to adapt to adversity may be uneven, depending on cultural, social, economic and other individual factors. Taken together, the impact, moreover the long-term impact of COVID-19, is expected to vary across countries and older subpopulations, and remains to be evaluated by prospective, longitudinal studies.","output":"A review on the COVID-19-related psychological impact on older adults: vulnerable or not?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) previously known as Wegeners granulomatosis is one of the forms of idiopathic systemic vasculitis.

This study aims to build on past research by evaluating the UVGI decontamination efficiency of influenza-contaminated FFRs in the presence of soiling agents using an optimized UVGI dose. METHODS: Twelve samples each of 15 N95 FFR models were contaminated with H1N1 influenza (facepiece and strap), then covered with a soiling agentartificial saliva or artificial skin oil. For each soiling agent, 3 contaminated FFRs were treated with 1 J/cm(2) UVGI for approximately 1 minute, whereas 3 other contaminated FFRs remained untreated. All contaminated surfaces were cut out and virus extracted. Viable influenza was quantified using a median tissue culture infectious dose assay. RESULTS: Significant reductions (3 log) in influenza viability for both soiling conditions were observed on facepieces from 12 of 15 FFR models and straps from 7 of 15 FFR models. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that FFR decontamination and reuse using UVGI can be effective.

First of all, while they are often discussed in relation to each other, it is often not clear what these concepts are examples of. It is sometimes argued that all of them are examples of misleading content online. This is quite a one-sided picture, as it excludes the vast amount of content online, namely when these techniques are used for memes, satire and parody, which is part of the foundation of todays online culture. Second of all, because of this conceptual confusion, much research and practice is focusing on how to prevent and detect audiovisual media content that has been tampered with, either manually or through the use of AI. This has recently led to a ban on deepfaked content on Facebook. However, we argue that this does not address problems related to the spread of misinformation.

Notably, the esterase linkage in remimazolam permits rapid hydrolysis to inactivate metabolites by non-specific tissue esterase and induces a unique and favorable pharmacological profile, including rapid onset and offset of sedation and a predictable duration of action. Similar to other BDZs, its sedative effects can be reversed using flumazenil, a BDZ antagonist. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of remimazolam are characterized by relatively high clearance, small steady-state volume of distribution, short elimination half-life, short context-sensitive half-life, and fast onset and recovery, indicating rapid elimination, minimal tissue accumulation, and good control. In addition, remimazolam possesses a superior safety profile, including low liability for cardiorespiratory depression and injection pain, making it a preferred hypnotic agent in various clinical settings. Early clinical investigations suggest that remimazolam is well tolerated and effective for procedural sedation and for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. To date, however, the clinical use of remimazolam has been confined to a few volunteer studies and a limited number of clinical investigations.

Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a novel noninvasive method of ASL perfusion that allows simultaneous estimation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), bolus arrival time (BAT), and tissue T1 map in a single scan of <4 minutes. Here, we evaluated the utility of MRF-ASL in patients with ischemic stroke in terms of detecting hemodynamic and structural damage and predicting neurological deficits and disability. METHODS A total of 34 patients were scanned on 3T magnetic resonance imaging. MRF-ASL, standard single-delay pseudo-continuous ASL, T2-weighted, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging were performed. Regions of interest of lesion and contralateral normal tissues were manually delineated. CBF (with 2 different compartmental models), BAT, and tissue T1 parameters were quantified. Cross-sectional linear regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between MRF-ASL parameters and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to determine the utility of MRF-ASL in the classification of stroke lesion voxels. RESULTS MRF-ASL derived parameters revealed a significant difference between stroke lesion and contralateral normal regions of interest, in that lesion regions manifested a lower CBF1-compartment (P<0.001), lower CBF2-compartment (P<0.001), longer BAT (P=0.002), and longer T1 (P<0.001) compared with normal regions of interest. NIHSS scores at acute stage revealed a strong association with lesion-normal differences in CBF1-compartment,diff (=-0.11, P=0.008), CBF2-compartment,diff (=-0.16, P=0.003), and T1,diff (=0.008, P=0.001). MRF-ASL parameters were also predictive of NIHSS score and modified Rankin Scale scale measured at a later stage, although the degree of the associations was weaker. These associations tended to be even stronger when the MRF-ASL data were acquired at the acute/subacute stage. Compared with standard pseudo-continuous ASL, the multiparametric capability of MRF-ASL yielded higher area under curve values in the receiver operating characteristic analyses of stroke voxel classifications.

COVID-19-associated myocarditis seems to be a notable extrapulmonary manifestation, which may result in the need for a different treatment. There has been no positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of SARS-CoV-2 in heart specimens, thus far. CASE SUMMARY: A 48-year-old male patient presented with fever, dyspnoea, and haemoptysis. Laboratory findings showed highly elevated inflammatory and cardiac damage markers. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral, patchy peripheral ground-glass opacities with a crazy-paving pattern, focal consolidations, and mild pleural effusions. Cardiac imaging with echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected a reduced biventricular function. MRI additionally showed myocardial oedema and late gadolinium enhancement. Lung and heart biopsies were performed, revealing alveolitis with necrosis and acute lymphocytic myocarditis. Testing for usual cardiotropic viruses was negative, and no aspects of vasculitis or granuloma could be found. Due to fulfilling the criteria, the patient was diagnosed with rheumatic vasculitis. Treatment with cyclophosphamide and steroids was initiated. Later, the patient reported a history of travel to Tyrol in mid January. Consequently, PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed, which was positive in the heart specimen. Immunosuppressive treatment was discontinued. During a follow-up visit at the end of April, the patients recovery was stable. DISCUSSION: In COVID-19 infections, myocardial inflammation can be present as an extrapulmonary manifestation. Positive PCR testing confirms myocardial invasion of the virus. Imaging and laboratory studies correlate with the histopathological findings, and thus should be performed in COVID-19 patients who are suspicious for myocarditis.

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted considering different study designs (search period up until 12 July 2021). The risk of bias in the studies was determined using a risk of bias procedure. A descriptive-narrative synthesis of the results was performed. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included, and the overall risk of bias was estimated to be high in all primary studies. There are some indications from the included surveys that children, adolescents, and their teachers in (pre)schools perceived facial expression processing as impaired due to mask wearing, which were confirmed by several experimental studies. Two studies reported psychological symptoms like anxiety and stress as well as concentration and learning problems due to wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, multiple reports of break-through infections and of waning antibody titers have raised concerns on the durability of the vaccine, and current discussions on vaccination strategies are centered on evaluating the opportunity of a third dose administration. Here, we monitored T cell responses to the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in 71 healthy donors vaccinated with the PfizerCBioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) for up to 6 months after vaccination. We find that vaccination induces the development of a sustained anti-viral memory T cell response which includes both the CD4+ and the CD8+ lymphocyte subsets. These lymphocytes display markers of polyfunctionality, are fit for interaction with cognate cells, show features of memory stemness, and survive in significant numbers the physiological contraction of the immune response. Collectively, this data shows that vaccination with BNT162b2 elicits an immunologically competent and potentially long-lived SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell population. Understanding the immune responses to BNT162b2 provides insights on the immunological basis of the clinical efficacy of the current vaccination campaign and may instruct future vaccination strategies.","output":"The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine induces polyfunctional T cell responses with features of longevity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After a pilot study, we tested 443 cadavers using OraQuick Ebola rapid diagnostic tests during surveillance after the 10th Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Various studies have been conducted amongst medical students in different countries and have shown varying levels of anxiety and depression in them. Hence this study was designed to assess the prevalence of the same in the medical students of Punjab. Method: This was an observational, cross sectional study conducted amongst 267 undergraduate medical students on World Mental Health Day 10th October 2020 using an online questionnaire comprising of the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scale questions. Outcome: A total of 267 students participated in the online survey out of which 170(63.6%) were females and 97(36.3%) were males. According to the scoring obtained using the GAD-7 scale, some levels of anxiety were prevalent in 181 students i.e.67.7% with scores more than five, which came out to be statistically significant with a p- value of 0.018 for the study population. A significant positive correlation was seen between the levels of anxiety and depression with the Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.72.Interpretation: The present study implies that substantial efforts are required to promote good mental health and reduce the stigma that plagues these topics.

There is no study related to the patients preference for systemic therapy during this pandemic. We have conducted a prospective study to analyze that aspect. METHODS: All consecutive patients who visited during the lockdown period from April 1-10, 2020, for systemic chemotherapy were included in the study for a questionnaire-based survey to evaluate the willingness to continue chemotherapy during this pandemic and factors influencing the decisions. RESULTS: A total of 302 patients were included (median age, 56 years; range, 21-77 years). Most common sites of cancer were breast (n = 114), lung (n = 44), ovary (n = 34), and colon (n = 20). Home address was within the city for 125 patients (42%), outside the city for 138 (46%), and outside the state for 37 (12%). Treatment was curative in 150 patients and palliative in 152. Educational status was primary and above for 231 patients and no formal schooling for 71. A total of 203 patients wanted to continue chemotherapy, 40 wanted to defer, and 56 wanted the physician to decide. Knowledge about COVID-19 strongly correlated with intent of treatment (P = .01), disease status (P = .02), knowledge about immunosuppression (P < .001), home location (P = .02), and education status (P = .003). The worry about catching SARS-CoV-2 was high in those with controlled disease (P = .06) and knowledge about immunosuppression (P = .02). Worry about disease progression was more with palliative intent (P < .001). CONCLUSION: This study shows that oncology patients in our country are more worried about disease progression than the SARS-CoV-2 and wish to continue chemotherapy during this pandemic.

So we focused on cases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), United Arab of Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and Qatar. For this aim, we accessed the time-series real-datasets collected from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). The timeline of our data is from 22 January 2020 to 25 January 2021. We have implemented the proposed model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with ten hidden units (neurons) to predict COVID-19 confirmed and death cases. From the experimental results, we confirmed that KSA and Qatar would take the most extended period to recover from the COVID-19 virus, and the situation will be controllable in the second half of March 2021 in UAE, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain. Also, we calculated the root mean square error (RMSE) between the actual and predicted values of each country for confirmed and death cases, and we found that the best values for both confirmed and death cases are 320.79 and 1.84, respectively, and both are related to Bahrain. While the worst values are 1768.35 and 21.78, respectively, and both are related to KSA. On the other hand, we also calculated the mean absolute relative errors (MARE) between the actual and predicted values of each country for confirmed and death cases, and we found that the best values for both confirmed and deaths cases are 37.76 and 0.30, and these are related to Kuwait and Qatar respectively.

We propose to use this method in future ventilation standards to complement existing ventilation criteria based on the perceived air quality and pollutant removal. The proposed method makes it possible to calculate the required ventilation rate at a given probability of infection and quanta emission rate. Present work used quanta emission rates for SARS-CoV-2 and consequently the method can be applied for other respiratory viruses with available quanta data. The method was applied to case studies representing typical rooms in public buildings. To reduce the probability of infection, the total airflow rate per infectious person revealed to be the most important parameter to reduce the infection risk. Category I ventilation rate prescribed in the EN 16798-1 standard satisfied many but not all type of spaces examined. The required ventilation rates started from about 80 L/s per room. Large variations between the results for the selected case studies made it impossible to provide a simple rule for estimating the required ventilation rates.

Previous studies have investigated the impact of exercise, with evidence suggesting that breath VOCs reflect exercise-induced metabolic activity. However, these studies have yet to investigate the impact of maximal exercise to exhaustion on breath VOCs, which was the main aim of this study. Two-litre breath samples were collected onto thermal desorption tubes using a portable breath collection unit. Samples were collected pre-exercise, and at 10 and 60 min following a maximal exercise test (VO(2MAX)). Breath VOCs were analysed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using a non-targeted approach. Data showed a tendency for reduced isoprene in samples at 10 min post-exercise, with a return to baseline by 60 min. However, inter-individual variation meant differences between baseline and 10 min could not be confirmed, although the 10 and 60 min timepoints were different (p = 0.041). In addition, baseline samples showed a tendency for both acetone and isoprene to be reduced in those with higher absolute VO(2MAX) scores (mL(O(2))/min), although with restricted statistical power. Baseline samples could not differentiate between relative VO(2MAX) scores (mL(O(2))/kg/min).

Concurrent measurement of blood pressure, pulse, and expired CO2 showed no changes during this process. CONCLUSION Administration of intravenous indocyanine green resulted in a transient desaturation by oximetry during transpupillary thermotherapy for children with retinoblastoma under anesthesia because of the fluorescent dye's absorption of red light in a manner similar to that of deoxygenated hemoglobin, thereby leading to transient instrument misinterpretation and miscalculation of arterial oxygenation.","output":"Intravenous injection of indocyanine green results in an artificial transient desaturation by pulse oximetry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aims to shed new lights on the lead-lag relationships between the financial sector (RFSI) and economic growth (GDP) in the midst of global economic policy uncertainty (GEPU) shocks for BRICS economies. Hence, the bivariate, partial, and wavelet multiple correlations techniques are employed. From the bivariate analysis, we document positive bi-directional causality between the RFSI and economic growth over the sample period. The partial wavelet reveals that GEPU shocks distort the significance and directional comovements between the RFSI and GDP. Moreover, the outcome from the wavelet multiple cross correlations (WMCC) indicates that the RFSI is a first mover at most time scales for the BRICS economies. This is followed by GEPU which either leads or lags for most scales, especially for South Africa. The impact of GEPU on RFSI and GDP is worst for South Africa in about four cases in the medium-, and long-terms. This signifies that South Africas financial markets and economic growth are vulnerable to GEPU. However, the impetus for GEPU to drive the comovements between the financial sector and economic activity was less pronounced in the pre-COVID analysis conducted with the WMCC.

Each viral RdRP contains a 500C600 residue catalytic module with palm, fingers, and thumb domains forming an encircled human right hand architecture. Seven polymerase catalytic motifs are located in the RdRP palm and fingers domains, comprising the most conserved parts of the RdRP and are responsible for the RNA-only specificity in catalysis. Functional regions are often found fused to the RdRP catalytic module, resulting in a high level of diversity in RdRP global structure and regulatory mechanism. In this review, we surveyed all 46 RdRP-sequence available virus families of the positive-strand RNA viruses listed in the 2018b collection of the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) and chose a total of 49 RdRPs as representatives. By locating hallmark residues in RdRP catalytic motifs and by referencing structural and functional information in the literature, we were able to estimate the N- and C-terminal boundaries of the catalytic module in these RdRPs, which in turn serve as reference points to predict additional functional regions beyond the catalytic module. Interestingly, a large number of virus families may have additional regions fused to the RdRP N-terminus, while only a few of them have such regions on the C-terminal side of the RdRP. The current knowledge on these additional regions, either in three-dimensional (3D) structure or in function, is quite limited. In the five RdRP-structure available virus families in the positive-strand RNA viruses, only the Flaviviridae family has the 3D structural information resolved for such regions. Hence, future efforts to solve full-length RdRP structures containing these regions and to dissect the functional contribution of them are necessary to improve the overall understanding of the RdRP proteins as an evolutionarily integrated group, and our analyses here may serve as a guideline for selecting representative RdRP systems in these studies.","output":"A Structure-Function Diversity Survey of the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases From the Positive-Strand RNA Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: As cities densify, researcher and policy focus is intensifying on which green space types and qualities are important for health.

We aimed to examine the health systems and contextual factors that might have contributed to the substantial decline in maternal mortality between 1997 and 2014. We chose to focus on western China because poverty, ethnic diversity, and geographical access represent particular challenges to ensuring universal access to maternal care in the region. METHODS: In this systematic assessment, we used data from national census reports, National Statistical Yearbooks, the National Maternal and Child Health Routine Reporting System, the China National Health Accounts report, and National Health Statistical Yearbooks to describe changes in policies, health financing, health workforce, health infrastructure, coverage of maternal care, and maternal mortality by region between 1997 and 2014. We used a multivariate linear regression model to examine which contextual and health systems factors contributed to the regional variation in maternal mortality ratio in the same period. Using data from a cross-sectional survey in 2011, we also examined equity in access to maternity care in 42 poor counties in western China. FINDINGS: Maternal mortality declined by 89% per year between 1997 and 2014 (geometric mean ratio for each year 091, 95% CI 091C092). After adjusting for GDP per capita, length of highways, female illiteracy, the number of licensed doctors per 1000 population, and the proportion of ethnic minorities, the maternal mortality ratio was 118% higher in the western region (218, 144C328) and 41% higher in the central region (141, 099C201) than in the eastern region. In the rural western region, the proportion of births in health facilities rose from 419% in 1997 to 984% in 2014. Underpinning such progress was the Government's strong commitment to long-term strategies to ensure access to delivery care in health facilitieseg, professionalisation of maternity care in large hospitals, effective referral systems for women medically or socially at high risk, and financial subsidies for antenatal and delivery care. However, in the poor western counties, substantial disparity by education level of the mother existed in access to health facility births (44% of illiterate women vs 100% of those with college or higher education), antenatal care (17% vs 69%) had at least four visits), and caesarean section (8% vs 44%). INTERPRETATION: Despite remarkable progress in maternal survival in China, substantial disparities remain, especially for the poor, less educated, and ethnic minority groups in remote areas in western China. Whether China's highly medicalised model of maternity care will be an answer for these populations is uncertain. A strategy modelled after China's immunisation programme, whereby care is provided close to the women's homes, might need to be explored, with township hospitals taking a more prominent role.

The use of LPS did not show any significant effect on the course of PCV2 infection, nor did in the evolution of the immunological parameters evaluated. Ex vivo responses were detected as early as 1 day post-infection (PI) and consisted of an elevation of the plasmatic levels of interleukin (IL)-8 in PCV2-inoculated pigs followed by an increase on plasmatic IFN- at day 5 PI. Regarding IL-10, only one PCV2-inoculated pig was positive (day 7 PI); this pig was the only one in which viremia persisted until the end of the study. In vitro cytokine determination showed that, regardless of the treatment administrated to the pigs, an IL-10 release was observed when peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultures were stimulated with PCV2. Seroconvertion to PCV2 measured by an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) occurred between 7 and 14 days PI, whereas neutralizing antibodies (NA) did not appear until day 29 PI. PCV2 DNA was first detected in serum at day 7 PI, reaching the peak of viremia between days 14 and 21 PI, followed by a drop in viral load that was found coincident with the appearance of PCV2-specific IFN--secreting cells (PCV2-IFN--SC) and NA. Results from the present work suggest that viral clearance might be mediated by the development of PCV2-IFN--SC in contribution to the PCV2-specific NA.","output":"Development of cell-mediated immunity to porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived piglets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To investigate the associations between demographic characteristics, perceived threat, perceived stress, coping responses and adherence to COVID\\\\19 prevention measures in Chinese Healthcare students.

The participants completed the questionnaire with six scales: Social Distancing Scale; Personal Hygiene Scale; Empathic Responding Scale; Wishful Thinking Scale; Perceived Stress Scale and Perceived Threat Scale. Path analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the preventive measures outcomes. p value < .05 was considered as statistical significance. RESULTS: The participants reported high compliances to both social distancing (SoD) and personal hygiene measures (PHM).

The -1-6-glucan, pustulan, induced an up-regulation of MHC class II (MHCII) cell surface expression, potentiated a strong proinflammatory cytokine response, and increased endocytosis in a cation-dependent manner. Ex vivo co-culture of peripheral blood monocytes from IBV-immunised chickens, and BM-DCs pulsed with pustulan-adjuvanted recombinant IBV N protein (rN), induced a strong recall response. Pustulan-adjuvanted rN induced a significantly higher CD4(+) blast percentage compared to either rN, pustulan or media. However, the CD8(+) and TCRæ(+) blast percentage were significantly lower with pustulan-adjuvanted rN compared to pustulan or media. Thus, pustulan enhanced the efficacy of MHCII antigen presentation, but apparently not the cross-presentation on MHCI. In conclusion, we found an immunopotentiating effect of pustulan in vitro using chicken BM-DCs. Thus, future in vivo studies might show pustulan as a promising glycan-based adjuvant for use in the poultry industry to contain the spread of coronaviridiae as well as of other avian viral pathogens.","output":"Pustulan Activates Chicken Bone Marrow-Derived Dendritic Cells In Vitro and Promotes Ex Vivo CD4(+) T Cell Recall Response to Infectious Bronchitis Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Male-specific Y-chromosome (chrY) polymorphisms are interesting components of the DNA for population genetics. While single nucleotide polymorphisms (Y-SNPs) indicate distant evolutionary ancestry, short tandem repeats (Y-STRs) are able to identify close familial kinships. Detailed chrY analysis provides thus both biogeographical background information as paternal lineage identification. The rapid advancement of high-throughput massive parallel sequencing (MPS) technology in the past decade has revolutionized genetic research. Using MPS, single-base information of both Y-SNPs as Y-STRs can be analyzed in a single assay typing multiple samples at once. In this study, we present the first extensive chrY-specific targeted resequencing panel, the CSYseq, which simultaneously identifies slow mutating Y-SNPs as evolution markers and rapid mutating Y-STRs as patrilineage markers. The panel was validated by paired-end sequencing of 130 males, distributed over 65 deep-rooted pedigrees covering 1,279 generations. The CSYseq successfully targets 15,611 Y-SNPs including 9,014 phylogenetic informative Y-SNPs to identify 1,443 human evolutionary Y-subhaplogroup lineages worldwide. In addition, the CSYseq properly targets 202 Y-STRs, including 81 slow, 68 moderate, 27 fast and 26 rapid mutating Y-STRs to individualize close paternal relatives. The targeted chrY markers cover a high average number of reads (Y-SNP = 717, Y-STR = 150), easy interpretation, powerful discrimination capacity and chrY specificity. The CSYseq is interesting for research on different time scales: to identify evolutionary ancestry, to find distant family and to discriminate closely related males. Therefore, this panel serves as a unique tool valuable for a wide range of genetic-genealogical applications in interdisciplinary research within evolutionary, population, molecular, medical and forensic genetics.","output":"CSYseq: The first Y-chromosome sequencing tool typing a large number of Y-SNPs and Y-STRs to unravel worldwide human population genetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The success of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) depends on solving the nexus challenge: how can positive interactions between SDGs be optimised, and negative interactions minimised, in order to create co-benefits and reduce trade-offs? Due to their varying impacts on the SDGs, the economic activities undertaken by organisations present a key lever for operationalising this SDG-nexus. Yet the interactions between individual economic activities and the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development have not been systematically assessed, thus creating a vital operational bottleneck to achieving the SDGs. This paper conducts a systematic review of 876 articles published between 2005 and 2019 to study the nexus between individual economic activities, sustainable development in general, and the SDGs in specific. It finds that studies on agricultural, industrial, and manufacturing activities predominantly report negative impacts on environmental development, while literature on services activities highlight economic and social contributions. Overall, economic activities are expected to positively impact industrialisation, infrastructure, and innovation [SDG 9], economic productivity [SDG 8], housing and transport [SDG 11], energy [SDG 7], and waste management [SDG 6]. However, negative impacts are widespread, afflicting ecosystems [SDGs 14 and 15], climate change [SDG 13] and human health [SDG 3]. We synthesise positive and negative interactions between individual economic activities and SDG targets and discuss implications for: integrated (nexus) governance approaches to the SDGs; the role of the private sector in promoting sustainable development; and for improving statistical classifications to monitor economic activities SDG impacts.","output":"Towards nexus-based governance_ defining interactions between economic activities and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus was detected in self-collected throat washings.

In the present review, we discuss VALI in relation to assisted MV strategies, such as volume assist-control ventilation, pressure assist-control ventilation, pressure support ventilation (PSV), airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), APRV with PSV, proportional assist ventilation (PAV), noisy ventilation, and neurally adjusted ventilatory assistance (NAVA). In summary, we suggest that assisted MV can be used in ARDS patients in the following situations: (1) Pao(2)/Fio(2) >150 mm Hg and positive end-expiratory pressure  5 cm H(2)O and (2) with modalities of pressure-targeted and time-cycled breaths including more or less spontaneous or supported breaths (A-PCV [assisted pressure-controlled ventilation] or APRV). Furthermore, during assisted MV, the following parameters should be monitored: inspiratory drive, transpulmonary pressure, and tidal volume (6 mL/kg).

This study examined change in mental health from before to during the pandemic among predominantly Hispanic/Latinx adolescents. METHOD: 322 young adolescents (Mage = 11.99, 55% female), with a racial/ethnic composition of 72.7% Hispanic/Latinx, 9.3% Black or African American, 5.9% Multiple Races, 5.0% Asian, 1.6% White, and 1.2% American Indian, completed a mental health screening measure prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and at three points during the pandemic. A subsample also completed a survey about their experience at home during COVID-19. Repeated measures mixed ANCOVA was used to evaluate change in each mental health domain, and whether youth who had elevated symptoms at baseline differed in their level of change, controlling for age and gender. RESULTS: For youth who had elevated levels of mental health problems pre-pandemic, symptoms were significantly reduced across domains during the pandemic. Reductions in internalizing, externalizing, and total problems were clinically significant. For other youth, there were statistically significant reductions in internalizing and total problems, and no change in attention or externalizing problems. Post-hoc analyses revealed that better family functioning was consistently related to lower mental health symptoms in youth during COVID-19 follow-ups.

In the absence of systemic immunodeficiency, decision of NTM lung disease treatment must relies on a careful risk/benefit assessment, given the requirement of long-term administration of multidrug therapies supported by limited evidence. The primary objective was to identify the factors associated with anti-NTM treatment initiation. Clinical and radiological outcome upon treatment were studied. METHODS: This retrospective, single center study (2013C2016, 45 months) addressed the criteria supporting treatment decision among adults with NTM lung disease without systemic immunodeficiency at our institution, with the assigned goal to harmonize the practice. All patients matched the current international definitions of NTM lung disease according to the American Thoracic Society criteria. Factors associated with anti-NTM treatment were investigated by conditional logistic regression. Clinical and radiological outcomes of treated and untreated NTM-disease cases were examined. Mortality rate was assessed. An expert radiologist conducted a blinded computed tomography (CT)-scan review of the treated and untreated patients. RESULTS: Among 51 cases of NTM lung diseases, 25 (49%) received anti-NTM treatment. In univariate analysis, a body mass index (BMI) < 18 kg/m(2) (odds ratio (OR), 4.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2C15.2]; p = 0.042), hemoptysis (OR, 11.8 [95% CI 1.35C12.9]; p = 0.026), excavation(s) (OR, 4.8 [95% CI 1.4C16.4], p = 0.012), prior anti-NTM treatment (OR, 5.65 [95% CI 1.06C29.9]; p = 0.042), Aspergillus spp. co-infection (OR, 6.3 [95% CI 1.8C22.2]; p = 0.004) were associated with treatment initiation. In multivariate analysis, Aspergillus spp. co-infection was the only independent determinant of treatment initiation (OR, 5.3 [95% CI 1.1C25.4]; p = 0.036). Twenty-one (81%) patients received 3 anti-NTM drugs. Median treatment duration and follow-up were 36.3 (interquartile range [IQR], 13.1C64.4) weeks and 17.1 (IQR, 8.7C27.1) months, respectively. Regarding radiological outcome, 85 CT-scans were reviewed, showing similar rates of regression or stabilization in treated and untreated patients.

An important feature of syndecan-1 related to its role in pathologies is that it can be shed from the surface of cells as an intact ectodomain composed of the extracellular core protein and attached heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains. Shed syndecan-1 remains functional and impacts cell behavior both locally and distally from its cell of origin. Shedding of syndecan-1 is initiated by a variety of stimuli and accomplished predominantly by the action of matrix metalloproteinases. The accessibility of these proteases to the core protein of syndecan-1 is enhanced, and shedding facilitated, when the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan-1 have been shortened by the enzymatic activity of heparanase. Interestingly, heparanase also enhances shedding by upregulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases. Recent studies have revealed that heparanase-induced syndecan-1 shedding contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of cancer and viral infection, as well as other septic and non-septic inflammatory states.

The control COVID-19 pregnant women were selected from 3 of 9 level III maternity centers between March 15 and April 20, 2020. Univariate statistics were used to look at differences between groups. Cluster dendrograms were used to look at the correlations between clinical and laboratory findings in the groups. A value of p <.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Fifteen COVID-19 infected women with ARDS were compared to 29 COVID-19 positive and ARDS negative control (moderate: (n = 26) 89.7% and severe: (n = 3)10.3%). The mean maternal age (35.6 vs. 29.4 years; p = .002) and diagnosis of chronic hypertension (20.0% vs. 0%, p = .034) were significantly higher in the ARDS group.

Considering the impacts of epidemic and associated control policies, this study analyzes the relationship between COVID-19, travel of residents, Point of Interest (POI), and social activities from the perspective of taxi travel. First, changes in the characteristics of taxi trips at different periods were analyzed. Next, the relationship between POIs and taxi travels was established by the Geographic Information System (GIS) method, and the spatial lag model (SLM) was introduced to explore the changes in taxi travel driving force. Then, a social activities recovery level evaluation model was proposed based on the taxi travel datasets to evaluate the recovery of social activities. The results demonstrated that the number of taxi trips dropped sharply, and the travel speed, travel time, and spatial distribution of taxi trips had been significantly influenced during the epidemic period. The spatial correlation between taxi trips was gradually weakened after the outbreak of the epidemic, and the consumption travel demand of people significantly decreased while the travel demand for community life increased dramatically. The evaluation score of social activity is increased from 8.12 to 74.43 during the post-epidemic period, which may take 3-6 months to be fully recovered as a normal period.

Since then, the virus has spread rapidly worldwide, with sharp daily increase in the numbers of infected persons and deaths. COVID-19 spreads via airborne transmission, which renders dental treatment a potential source of virus transmission. Dental treatments require the use of handpieces, ultrasonic devices, and/or air-water syringes, which generate considerable amounts of aerosols. Jordan, being one of the affected countries, instituted preventive lockdown measures from 17 March 2020. Emergency dental treatments were only allowed in dental clinics of the Royal Medical Services of Jordan Armed Forces and Ministry of Health and were prohibited in other sectors such as private clinics and universities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the dental treatments performed in three military hospitals during the 44-day lockdown period in Jordan. The investigation explores the impact of COVID-19 on the number of patients and types of performed dental treatments. METHODS: Data such as number of patients, patients' age and gender, and performed dental treatments were collected retrospectively from the hospital records and were analysed. RESULTS: Our results showed a 90% decrease in patient visits during the lockdown period compared to regular days. Total number of treatments (1689) during lockdown period varied between endodontic (877/1689, 51.9% cases), extraction and other surgical (374/1689, 22.1% cases), restorative (142/1689, 8.4% cases), and orthodontic treatments (4/1689, 0.2% cases) and other procedures (292/1689, 17.3%). The differences in gender and age group among all clinics were statistically significant (P<.001 and P=.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on the number of patients seeking dental treatments. It also affected the types of treatments performed.

Pudilanxiaoyan oral liquid (PDL), an effective drug of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), is considered to be an effective and alternative means for clinical prevention of COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to identify potential active constituents of PDL, and explore its underlying anti-COVID-19 mechanism using network pharmacology. Integration of target prediction (SwissTargetPrediction and STITCH database) was used to elucidate the active components of PDL. Protein-protein interaction network analyses, gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses, network construction, and molecular docking were applied to analyze the prospective mechanisms of the predicted target genes. Our results showed that the key active ingredients in PDL were luteolin, apigenin, esculetin, chrysin, baicalein, oroxylin A, baicalin, wogonin, cymaroside, and gallic acid. A majority of the predicted targets were mainly involved in the pathways related to viral infection, lung injury, and inflammatory responses. An in vitro study further inferred that inhibiting the activity of nuclear factor (NF)-B signaling pathway was a key mechanism by which PDL exerted anti-COVID-19 effects.

As these phenomena directly affect our lives and seemingly more and more as our societies and communication channels evolve it becomes ever so important for us to understand the intricacies of opinion dynamics in the modern era. Here we extend an existing echo chambers model with activity driven agents onto a bi-layer topology and study the dynamics of the polarised state as a function of interlayer couplings. Different cases of such couplings are presented - unidirectional coupling that can be reduced to a mono-layer facing an external bias, symmetric and non-symmetric couplings. We have assumed that initial conditions impose system polarisation and agent opinions are different for both layers. Such a pre-conditioned polarised state can sustain without explicit homophilic interactions provided the coupling strength between agents belonging to different layers is weak enough. For a strong unidirectional or attractive coupling between two layers a discontinuous transition to a radicalised state takes place when mean opinions in both layers are the same. When coupling constants between the layers are of different signs the system exhibits sustained or decaying oscillations. Transitions between these states are analysed using a mean field approximation and classified in the framework of bifurcation theory.","output":"Transitions between polarization and radicalization in a temporal bilayer echo chambers model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The uses of bivalve molluscs in environmental biomonitoring have recently gained momentum due to their ability to indicate and concentrate human pathogenic microorganisms.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with hematologic neoplasms diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 17th to June 8th2020 was conducted. Subjects included were censored at last point of contact. Variables collected included age, gender, race/ethnicity, hematologic diagnosis, cancer treatment status, baseline and follow-up COVID-19 testing, neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count at time of diagnosis. Associations between hematologic diagnosis, cancer treatment status, age, gender, race/ethnicity, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and overall survival (OS) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method with logrank test. Results: A total of 102 subjects with hematologic neoplasms and COVID-19 infection treated in Montefiore Health system were identified (Table 1). Thirty-nine (38%) subjects were undergoing active treatment, including 17 (16%) receiving conventional chemotherapy agents, 12 (12%) targeted therapy, and 10 (10%) combination therapy. Of those subjects, twenty (50%) experienced delay or discontinuation of treatment due to COVID-19 infection. Four subjects (4%) showed persistent infection by PCR at median duration of 25.1 days after initial diagnosis. Ten subjects (9.8%) showed clearance of the virus by PCR with median time-to-clearance of 51.8 days. Of 9 subjects with serologic testing, 8 tested positive for COVID-19 IgG antibody at median time of 62 days after initial COVID-19 diagnosis. Forty-seven (47%) subjects expired as a result of COVID-19 disease at the time of analysis. Disease type, treatment status, race/ethnicity, age, and gender showed no significant association with mortality. Patients older than 70 had worse outcomes than the younger population (p = 0.0082). Median neutrophil and lymphocyte count at time of diagnosis was 4500 and 900, respectively. NLR greater than 9 was associated with worse survival when compared to NLR less than 9 (p=0.0067). Conclusions: COVID-19 infection has adverse effects on patients with hematological neoplasms. Subjects older than 70 years had a significantly worse prognosis. Notably, subjects actively being treated with chemotherapy did not have worse outcomes than those not being treated in our cohort, supporting the notion than active COVID-19 infection per se should not result in treatment delays. In addition, high NLR correlates with worsened survival, suggesting that this could be a potential prognostic factor for COVID-19 mortality in the hematologic neoplasms population.

Recent studies revealed previously unappreciated roles of CD71+ erythroid cells (CECs) in regulation of the immune response. CECs physiologically reside in the bone marrow where erythropoiesis takes place. Under stress conditions, CECs are enriched in some organs outside of the bone marrow as a result of extramedullary erythropoiesis. However, the role of CECs goes well beyond the production of erythrocytes. In neonates, increased numbers of CECs contribute to their vulnerability to infectious diseases. On the other side, neonatal CECs suppress activation of immune cells in response to abrupt colonization with commensal microorganisms after delivery. CECs are also enriched in the peripheral blood of pregnant women as well as in the placenta and are responsible for the regulation of feto-maternal tolerance. In patients with cancer, anemia leads to increased frequency of CECs in the peripheral blood contributing to diminished antiviral and antibacterial immunity, as well as to accelerated cancer progression. Moreover, recent studies revealed the role of CECs in HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. CECs use a full arsenal of mechanisms to regulate immune response. These cells suppress proinflammatory responses of myeloid cells and T-cell proliferation by the depletion of ?-arginine by arginase. Moreover, CECs produce reactive oxygen species to decrease T-cell proliferation. CECs also secrete cytokines, including transforming growth factor ? (TGF-?), which promotes T-cell differentiation into regulatory T-cells. Here, we comprehensively describe the role of CECs in orchestrating immune response and indicate some therapeutic approaches that might be used to regulate their effector functions in the treatment of human conditions.","output":"The role of CD71+ erythroid cells in the regulation of the immune response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of video-assisted thoracic surgery in reaching a specific diagnosis in patients with interstitial lung disease.

To investigate this question, we perform an online survey, retrieving 1583 questionnaires, and scrutinize the perception of NEVs at the nexus with car-sharing.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study evaluated patients from BRIM-3, a phase III trial comparing vemurafenib and dacarbazine in 675 patients with BRAFV600 mutated advanced melanoma. ctDNA was measured using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction, and cHGF was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Partitioning analysis was used to group patients into risk categories. RESULTS: Patients with elevated levels of baseline BRAFV600 ctDNA had significantly shorter median OS than those with undetectable levels of ctDNA (vemurafenib arm, 9.9 v 21.4 months, respectively, and dacarbazine arm: 6.1 v 21.0 months, respectively). Median OS was also shorter in patients with high levels of cHGF compared with those with low cHGF (vemurafenib arm, 11.9 v 17.3 months, respectively, and dacarbazine arm, 6.1 v 14.4 months, respectively).

Patient demographic and clinical variables such as age, RVP results, length of stay (LOS), and deaths were abstracted. Relationship between RVP testing and positivity and LOS, highest temperature (Tmax), hypotension and intensive care unit (ICU) admission were compared using Wilcoxon rank sums, chi-square, or Fisher's exact tests adjusting for age, sex, bacteremia, and diagnosis. RESULTS The 404 patients identified had 787 total FN admissions. RVPs were sent in 38% of admissions and were positive in 59%. Patients with RVPs sent were younger (median 5.5 vs 8.0 years, P < .0001) with higher Tmax (39.2 vs 39.1, P = .016). The most common virus identified was rhinovirus/Enterovirus (61%). There were no significant differences in highest temperature or lowest blood pressure based on RVP positivity. Patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to have RVPs sent (odds ratio [OR] = 3.19, P < .002); however, neither having RVP testing nor RVP positivity were significantly associated with increased LOS or death.

METHODS: In this study, we enrolled 681 patients with confirmed cases of severe COVID-19. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected. RESULTS: The median age of the study participants was 65 years, 53.2% were male, and 104 (15.3%) died. Age, Neutrophil-To-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), acute myocardial injury, and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CD3 T cells counts were independently associated with death, while arbidol and ribavirin were protective from death. The combination of NLR and acute myocardial injury on admission (AUC = 0.914) predicted mortality better than NLR, CRP, LDH, and acute myocardial injury. There were 312 (45.8%) patients with cardiovascular disease, of whom 23.4% died. ?-blockers, ACEI/ARB, arbidol, and ribavirin might have a beneficial effect for severe COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSION: The combination of NLR and acute myocardial injury on admission was highly predictive of mortality and survival. Clinicians should adopt more aggressive strategies for patients with a high NLR (>6.66) combined with myocardial injury. ?-blockers and ACEI/ARB, as well as arbidol and ribavirin, were effective in

2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has resulted in widespread transmission and death Understanding how this viral pneumonia causes acute lung injury is evolving, but it typically manifests as peripheral bilateral ground glass on chest imaging We report a unique case of a COVID-19 patient who presented with a new isolated left pleural effusion that is likely a sequela of the infection CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old female with no co-morbidities was seen in ED at another hospital for flu-like symptoms and found to have COVID-19 At that time, her chest radiograph showed hazy opacities overlying left greater than right lung lobes consistent with multifocal pneumonia She was discharged home on doxycycline Patient felt better following discharge but then presented to our hospital four weeks later with left sided pleuritic chest pain of two weeks duration She denied any fever, cough, recent travel, or sick contacts Vital signs were: T 99 4 F, HR 97, BP 109/76, RR 20, and 96 % O2 saturation on room air Physical exam was significant for decreased air entry at left lung base A comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, troponins, BNP, and LDH were within normal limits However, D-dimer was elevated Both chest radiograph and CT chest angiogram showed a new moderate left pleural effusion, but in addition CT showed ground glass opacities in the left upper and right lower lung lobes noted on the CT Patient was started on empiric antibiotics Her symptoms improved after 700 cc of serous pleural fluid was drained via a pigtail catheter Pleural fluid analysis showed an overtly exudative fluid with protein ratio of 0 74 and LDH ratio of 3 08 with fluid LDH of 719 Other pertinent fluid analysis revealed: pH 7 5, WBC 9744 with 60% neutrophils, with no organisms on gram stain or culture Fluid cytology showed numerous acute and chronic inflammatory cells and few macrophages admixed with degenerated cells Patient underwent repeat COVID-19 testing via the nasal swab and pleural fluid PCR, which were both negative DISCUSSION: Pleural effusions can be related to diseases of the lungs and heart or to a systemic disease To treat pleural effusions, it is important to determine the etiology In this case, given the patients history of COVID-19 infection and exclusion of all other causes, the exudative predominantly neutrophilic pleural effusion most likely reflected a parapneumonic effusion CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 can present with non-specific imaging findings;however, to our knowledge, an isolated pleural effusion has not been reported in patients

history. We speculated that the COVID-19 lockdown regulations (travel restriction and alcohol ban) would affect trauma patterns. OBJECTIVES: To compare the burden and nature of trauma over the COVID-19 lockdown period with the equivalent period over the past 5 years using routinely collected data from the Pietermaritzburg Metropolitan Trauma Service in KwaZulu-Natal Province, SA. METHODS: All trauma patients admitted to Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg between 23 March 2015 and 31 May 2020 were identified and reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 8 859 trauma patients were admitted over the 6-year period, with a total of 1 676 admitted during the periods 23 March - 31 May. These 1 676 formed the study cohort. Of these patients, 998 had sustained blunt trauma, 665 penetrating trauma, and 13 a combination of blunt and penetrating trauma. A total of 14 categories of blunt trauma were reviewed, of which the three most common were assault, motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) and pedestrian vehicle accidents (PVAs). Between 23 March and 31 May 2020, a total of 23 patients were victims of blunt assault. The median number of assault victims over the equivalent period during the previous 5 years was 48. The 5 preceding years had a median of 56 MVAs and 33 PVAs, compared with 23 and 10 during the lockdown. The median number of gunshot wound (GSW) victims for the preceding years was 41, compared with 30 during the lockdown. During the lockdown, 24 stab wound victims were admitted, compared with a median of 73 for the preceding years. The proportion of females who sustained penetrating trauma and blunt assault increased significantly during the lockdown. The proportion of females sustaining a GSW or blunt trauma secondary to an MVA remained constant. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that during the period of lockdown in SA there was a significant decrease in MVAs, PVAs and interpersonal violence. Assaults involving a knife seemed to decrease dramatically, but the rate of GSWs remained constant.","output":"Trauma patterns during the COVID-19 lockdown in South Africa expose vulnerability of women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) exhibit training pathologies that can lead to convergence-related degenerative behaviors, whereas spatially-distributed, coevolutionary algorithms (CEAs) for GAN training, e.g. Lipizzaner, are empirically robust to them. The robustness arises from diversity that occurs by training populations of generators and discriminators in each cell of a toroidal grid. Communication, where signals in the form of parameters of the best GAN in a cell propagate in four directions: North, South, West, and East, also plays a role, by communicating adaptations that are both new and fit. We propose Lipi-Ring, a distributed CEA like Lipizzaner, except that it uses a different spatial topology, i.e. a ring. Our central question is whether the different directionality of signal propagation (effectively migration to one or more neighbors on each side of a cell) meets or exceeds the performance quality and training efficiency of Lipizzaner Experimental analysis on different datasets (i.e, MNIST, CelebA, and COVID-19 chest X-ray images) shows that there are no significant differences between the performances of the trained generative models by both methods. However, Lipi-Ring significantly reduces the computational time (14.2%. . . 41.2%).

Recent experience with developing and testing viral vaccine candidates can inform expectations regarding the development of safe and effective vaccines. OBJECTIVE: To estimate timelines and probabilities of success for recent vaccine candidates. DESIGN: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to identify trials testing viral vaccines that had not advanced to phase 2 before 2005, and the progress of each vaccine from phase 1 through to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure was tracked. Trial characteristics were double-coded. (Registration: Open Science Framework [https://osf.io/dmuzx/]). SETTING: Trials launched between January 2005 and March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Preventive viral vaccine candidates for 23 emerging or reemerged viral infectious diseases. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was the probability of vaccines advancing from launch of phase 2 to FDA licensure within 10 years. RESULTS: In total, 606 clinical trials forming 220 distinct development trajectories (267 343 enrolled participants) were identified. The probability of vaccines progressing from phase 2 to licensure within 10 years was 10.0% (95% CI, 2.6% to 16.9%), with most approvals representing H1N1 or H5N1 vaccines. The average timeline from phase 2 to approval was 4.4 years (range, 6.4 weeks to 13.9 years). The probabilities of advancing from phase 1 to 2, phase 2 to 3, and phase 3 to licensure within the total available follow-up time were 38.2% (CI, 30.7% to 45.0%), 38.3% (CI, 23.1% to 50.5%), and 61.1% (CI, 3.7% to 84.3%), respectively. LIMITATIONS: The study did not account for preclinical development and relied primarily on ClinicalTrials.gov and FDA resources. Success probabilities do not capture the varied reasons why vaccines fail to advance to regulatory approval.

However, there is limited data and evidence on their effectiveness, especially in rural areas as compared to urban areas. Therefore, we examined the association between stay\\\\at\\\\home order implementation and the incidence of COVID\\\\19 cases in rural and urban counties. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted an interrupted time series analysis using a mixed effects zero\\\\inflated Poisson model with random intercept by county and standardized by population, which examined the association between stay\\\\at\\\\home orders and 14\\\\day lagged county\\\\level counts of daily new COVID\\\\19 cases in rural vs. urban counties between 1/22/2020 and 6/10/2020. To further bolster our findings, the association between stay\\\\at\\\\home orders and mobility in rural vs. urban counties was assessed using Google Community Mobility Reports. POPULATION STUDIED: We examined the COVID\\\\19 daily incident and stay\\\\at\\\\home orders for all 3142 United States counties. Each county was categorized as urban or rural using the 2013 county\\\\level RuralCUrban Continuum Codes per federal standards. There are 1976 rural and 1166 urban counties in the United States. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: As of June 10, 2020, there were 1,786,886 cases of COVID\\\\19 in the U.S., of which 9.0% (N = 161,452) were in rural counties. During the study period, 1854 (93.8%) rural counties and 1075 (92.2%) urban counties were covered by a stay\\\\at\\\\home order. Stay\\\\at\\\\home orders were implemented later (median March 30 vs. March 28) and were shorter (median 35 vs. 54 days) in rural than urban counties. Indoor mobility was, on average, 2.6C6.9% higher in rural than urban counties during and after stay\\\\at\\\\home orders. Compared to the pre\\\\stay\\\\at\\\\home baseline period, the number of new COVID\\\\19 cases increased under stay\\\\at\\\\home by IRR 1.60 (95% CI, 1.57C1.64) in rural and 1.36 (95% CI, 1.30C1.42) in urban counties. For each day under stay\\\\at\\\\home orders, the number of new cases changed by a factor of 0.982 (95% CI, 0.981C0.982) in rural and 0.952 (95% CI, 0.951C0.953) in urban counties. Each day after stay\\\\at\\\\home orders expired, the number of new cases changed by a factor of 0.995 (95% CI, 0.994C0.995) in rural and 0.997 (95% CI, 0.995C0.999) in urban counties. CONCLUSIONS: Stay\\\\at\\\\home orders decreased mobility and slowed the spread of COVID\\\\19 less effectively in rural than urban counties. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY OR PRACTICE: As states are considering implementing a new round of stay\\\\at\\\\home orders, our findings reveal several ways to improve the implementation, enforcement, and adherence. First, they should be implemented earlier and maintained longer for optimal effectiveness. There was marked heterogeneity in the timing and duration of stay\\\\at\\\\home orders and our data reinforces the need for multi\\\\jurisdictional, ideally federal, infection control mandates. Any new stay\\\\at\\\\home orders should be gradually implemented to avoid the pre\\\\stay\\\\at\\\\home surge of mobility and subsequent spike in COVID\\\\19 cases.

The oxygenation improvement coupled with lung and diaphragm protection produced by non-invasive support may help to avoid endotracheal intubation, which prevents the complications of sedation and invasive mechanical ventilation. However, spontaneous breathing in patients with lung injury carries the risk that vigorous inspiratory effort, combined or not with mechanical increases in inspiratory airway pressure, produces high transpulmonary pressure swings and local lung overstretch. This ultimately results in additional lung damage (patient self-inflicted lung injury), so that patients intubated after a trial of noninvasive support are burdened by increased mortality. Reducing inspiratory effort by high-flow nasal oxygen or delivery of sustained positive end-expiratory pressure through the helmet interface may reduce these risks. In this physiology-to-bedside review, we provide an updated overview about the role of noninvasive respiratory support strategies as early treatment of hypoxemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit. Noninvasive strategies appear safe and effective in mild-to-moderate hypoxemia (PaO(2)/FiO(2) > 150 mmHg), while they can yield delayed intubation with increased mortality in a significant proportion of moderate-to-severe (PaO(2)/FiO(2)  150 mmHg) cases. High-flow nasal oxygen and helmet noninvasive ventilation represent the most promising techniques for first-line treatment of severe patients. However, no conclusive evidence allows to recommend a single approach over the others in case of moderate-to-severe hypoxemia. During any treatment, strict physiological monitoring remains of paramount importance to promptly detect the need for endotracheal intubation and not delay protective ventilation.","output":"Non-invasive ventilatory support and high-flow nasal oxygen as first-line treatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Bacterial infection (BI), both community-acquired (CA-BI) and hospital-acquired (HAI), might present as a severe complication in patients with bronchiolitis.

Patients with BI had higher BROSJOD score, PRISM III, and required invasive mechanical ventilation and inotropic support more frequently (p < 0.001). BI was independently associated with BROSJOD higher than 12 (OR 2.092, 95%CI 1.168C3.748) CA-BI was associated to BROSJOD > 12 (OR 2.435, 95%CI 1.379C4.297) and bacterial co-infection (OR 2.294 95%CI 1.051C5.008). Concerning HAI, an independent association was shown with mechanical ventilation longer than 7 days (OR 5.139 95%CI 1.802C14.652). Infants with BI had longer PICU and hospital stay (p < 0.001), Mortality was higher in patients with HAI. CONCLUSIONS: A quarter of infants with severe bronchiolitis developed BI. A BROSJOD > 12 may alert the presence of CA-BI, especially pneumonia. Patients with BI have higher morbidity and mortality.

Vaccine passport is a digital or paper document that may serve as proof of the COVID-19 vaccine, thereby allowing entry to public venues, sporting events, air travel, and unrestricted access to other facilities. This study explores how the COVID-19 passport is being discussed and perceived on Twitter and the prominent entities involved in the early discourse on the issue. Twitter messages were theoretically analyzed for Health Belief Model (HBM) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) variables, as well as message source, engagement, and attitudes towards vaccination certificates. Using quantitative content analysis, tweets were coded on nine dimensions: account type, tweeter profile, tweet content, tweet modality, attitude, self-efficacy, perceived barriers, benefits, and action cues. Most of the tweets originated from personal accounts, followed by media organizations, media-related personalities, politicians, and the travel industry. A significant number of tweets were from male Twitter users. Our analysis revealed that most tweeters had a favorable attitude towards the COVID-19 passports. Unfavorable attitudes toward the COVID-19 passport were based on reasons such as a lack of common standard or consensus, and personal freedoms & human rights. Tweets highlighting the benefits of COVID-19 passports cited travel as the primary reason. Based on a combination of technical, legal, and ethical practices, our study offers a set of vital recommendations for governments, health organizations, and businesses that may help stimulate the acceptance of vaccine passports.","output":"Conflicting attitudes: Analyzing social media data to understand early discourse on COVID-19 passports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a highly suspicious case of COVID-19 infection, incidentally found on F-FDG PET/CT images.

Six had PjqPCR-positive induced sputa less than 3 days after the NPA procedure, and five were diagnosed with pneumocystis pneumonia (four with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders and one AIDS patient). In all six available pairs quantification of P. jirovecii DNA showed fewer copies in NPA than in induced sputum and three PjqPCR-negative NPAs corresponded to PjqPCR-positive bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, underscoring the fact that a negative PjqPCR screen does not exclude a diagnosis of pneumocystosis.

The impact of global online search trends and online discussion on local approaches to coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between online search trends using Google Trends and the rate of appropriate venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis and anticoagulation therapy in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary hospital in Ireland. METHODS: A retrospective audit of anticoagulation therapy and VTE prophylaxis among patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to a tertiary hospital was conducted between February 29 and May 31, 2020. Worldwide Google search trends of the term COVID-19 and anticoagulation synonyms during this time period were determined and correlated against one another using a Spearman correlation. A P value of <.05 was considered significant, and analysis was completed using Prism, version 8 (GraphPad). RESULTS: A statistically significant Spearman correlation (P<.001, r=0.71) was found between the two data sets, showing an increase in VTE prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 with increasing online searches worldwide.

Here, we examine the possibility that the multivalent RNA-binding nucleocapsid protein (N) from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) compacts RNA via protein-RNA liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and that N interactions with host RNA-binding proteins are mediated by phase separation. To this end, we created a construct expressing recombinant N fused to a N-terminal maltose binding protein tag which helps keep the oligomeric N soluble for purification. Using in vitro phase separation assays, we find that N is assembly-prone and phase separates avidly. Phase separation is modulated by addition of RNA and changes in pH and is disfavored at high concentrations of salt. Furthermore, N enters into in vitro phase separated condensates of full-length human hnRNPs (TDP-43, FUS, and hnRNPA2) and their low complexity domains (LCs). However, N partitioning into the LC of FUS, but not TDP-43 or hnRNPA2, requires cleavage of the solubilizing MBP fusion. Hence, LLPS may be an essential mechanism used for SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viral genome packing and host protein co-opting, functions necessary for viral replication and hence infectivity.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation stimulated by RNA and partitions into phases of human ribonucleoproteins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The massive global consumption and discarded face masks drove by the ongoing spread of COVID-19.

However, the low typical solubility of traditional melanins does not allow the production of good quality thin films. In this sense, soluble compounds obtained via alternative synthetic routes, for instance, via levodopa (L-DOPA) oxidation in sulfonated solvents (S-melanins), can be considered interesting technological materials. Despite this, the structural and electronic features of these compounds are not fully understood. In this context, here we present a theoretical study on the local reactivities of S-melanin building blocks to better understand possible mechanisms involved in its synthesis and propose extended structures of this material. For this purpose, condensed-to-atoms Fukui indices were evaluated in the framework of the density functional theory (DFT). The obtained results show that the different side groups present in S-melanins do not significantly influence the reactivity of the compound in relation to non-functionalized melanins, indicating that both materials can present similar macroscopic structures.","output":"Sulfonated melanin derivatives: theoretical evaluation of local reactivities and chemical structures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To examine associations between sociodemographic and mental health characteristics with household risk for food insecurity during the COVID-19 outbreak.

The LiCa3ZnV3O12 (x = 0) phosphor showed an efficient self-activated bluish-green emission due to the V5+-O2- charge transfer transition of the [VO4]3- groups, and possessed an intense broad excitation spectrum in the 250-400 nm wavelength range. Together with the [VO4]3- emission, the red emission of Eu3+ ions was also observed in LiCa3(1-x)ZnV3O12:Eu3+ phosphors. The energy transfer from the [VO4]3- groups to the Eu3+ ions was studied. Importantly, the emission colors of LiCa3(1-x)ZnV3O12:Eu3+ phosphors varied from greenish-blue to whitish and then to red with increasing Eu3+ content and the white-light emission was realized in the single-phase phosphor of LiCa3ZnV3O12:0.003Eu3+ by combining the [VO4]3--emission and the Eu3+-emission.

Herein, the 3CLpro from the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, an enteropathogenic CoV, was used as a model to identify novel crucial residues for enzyme activity. First, we established a rapid, sensitive, and efficient luciferase-based biosensor to monitor the activity of PDEV 3CLpro in vivo. Using this luciferase biosensor, along with confirming the well-known catalytic residues (His41 and Cys144), we identified 4 novel proteolytically inactivated mutants of PDEV 3CLpro, which was also confirmed in mammalian cells by biochemical experiments. Our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that the hydrogen bonding interactions occurring within and outside of the protease's active site and the dynamic fluctuations of the substrate, especially the van der Waals contacts, were drastically altered, a situation related to the loss of 3CLpro activity. These data suggest that changing the intermolecular dynamics in protein-substrate complexes eliminates the mechanism underlying the protease activity. The discovery of novel crucial residues for enzyme activity in the binding pocket could potentially provide more druggable sites for the design of protease inhibitors.

As a part of sustainable development strategy, the European Union adopted a general policy on the transition to a circular economy.

For that reason, a set of empirical data (20 indicators) has been compiled;cluster, classification, and parametric analyses have been conducted. As a result, three clusters of the EU countries have been obtained and six indicators, included into combinations that make all clusters different, have been identified.

This paper bridges inter-city traffic and spa-tial economics, provides a theoretical contribution, and verifies the necessity of a lockdown from an empirical point of view.","output":"The Impact of Inter-city Traffic Restriction on Covid-19 Transmission from Spatial Econometric Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the timely adaption of both published WHO E-gene protocol and commercially available LightMix Modular E-gene assay to the test platform (ABI 7900 Fast real-time analyzer and TaqMan Fast One-step Virus Master Mix) available in an accredited tertiary hospital laboratory with an on-going evaluation to ensure the provision of quality service within the time constraint.

After decades of intense efforts to improve neonatal intensive care and survival of critically ill newborns, the focus today is an improved long-term neurological outcome through brain-focused care. The goal of neuroprotection in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is the prevention of new or worsening NBI in premature and term newborns. As a result, the neonatal neurocritical care unit (NNCU) has been emerging as a model of care to decrease NBI and improve the long-term neurodevelopment in critically ill neonates. PURPOSE: Neurocritical care (NCC) Sicilian project includes three academic sites with NICU in Sicily (Catania, Messina, and Palermo), and its primary goal is to develop neurocritical neonatal care unit (NNCU). METHODS: In 2018, the three NICUs created a dedicated space for neonates with primary neurological diagnosis or at risk for neurological injuriesNNCU. Admission criteria for eligible patients and treatment protocols were created. Contact with parents, environmental protection, basic monitoring, brain monitoring, pharmacological therapy, and organization of the staff were protocolized. RESULTS: Evaluation of the efforts to establish NNCU within existing NICU, current protocols, and encountered problems are shown. Implications for Practice. Our outcome confirmed the need for dedicated NNCU for neuroprotection of critically ill neonates at risk for a neurological injury. Although the literature on neonatal neurocritical care is still scarce, we see the value of such targeted approach to newborn brain protection and therefore we will continue developing our NNCU, even though there have been problems encountered. The project of building NNCU will continue to be closely monitored. CONCLUSIONS: The development of our neonatal neurocritical model of care is far from being completed. Although it is currently limited to the Sicilian area only, the goal of this paper is to share the development of this multicenter interdisciplinary project focused on a newborn brain protection. After evaluating our outcome, we strongly believe that a combined expertise in neonatal neurology and neonatal critical care can lead to an improved neurodevelopmental outcome for critically ill neonates, from the extremely preterm to those with brain injuries.","output":"From Neonatal Intensive Care to Neurocritical Care: Is It Still a Mirage?

Ebola in West Africa and Zika in Latin America had gendered effects that were evident during the crises, yet governments and international organizations failed to prioritize a gender-inclusive response. There is the same risk that gender-inclusive responses and knowledge will continue to be neglected during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we examine the drivers of gender exclusion in health emergency response. We ask: where can we locate institutional responsibility for taking gender seriously to inform and improve sustainable disease control? The article addresses this question by turning to feminist institutional theory to explain why gender inclusion in decision-making processes is vital for effective response and post-crisis recovery. We argue that the institutional responsibility to recognize gender within the global health emergency regime lies with the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO has neglected to mainstream gender in the policies and practices that it promotes for the prevention and detection of, and response to, infectious disease outbreaks. WHO is in a position to support gender-inclusive practices, but this requires the technical agency to recognize the value of having a gender-inclusive framework to inform outbreak response, financial models, and recovery.

Based on an extensive corpus of tweets (produced between 20th March and 1st July 2020) first we show how the topics associated with the development of the pandemic changed through time, using topic modeling. Second, we show how the sentiment polarity of the language used in the tweets changed from a relatively positive valence during the first lockdown, toward a more negative valence in correspondence with the reopening. Third we show how the average subjectivity of the tweets increased linearly and fourth, how the popular and frequently used figurative frame of WAR changed when real riots and fights entered the discourse.","output":"Covid-19 Discourse on Twitter: How the Topics, Sentiments, Subjectivity, and Figurative Frames Changed Over Time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND COVID-19 infection significantly increased mortality risk and the burden of disability in most survivors, regardless of symptom severity at onset. The rehabilitation needs of people infected are receiving growing attention, as evidenced by the increasing number of publications, including those addressing the chronic consequences of infection. OBJECTIVES This rapid living systematic review reports the evidence published in November and December 2020 and summarises the entire body of literature on rehabilitation in COVID-19 patients published in 2020. METHODS This update was performed using the methodology reported by the second edition conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER Action. We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro databases. Papers related to COVID-19 and rehabilitation were retrieved and summarised descriptively. RESULTS The search retrieved 4441 studies. After the removal of duplicates and the screening for title and abstract, we retained 105 studies. Of these, we included 54 in the qualitative synthesis of this update. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence Table, most studies (64.8%) fall within the category of Level 4 evidence. Up to 40.7% of papers included COVID-19 patients in the post-acute phase. In 2020, our rapid living systematic review included 230 studies; most of these (73.9%) were Level 4 studies, 25.7% were Level 3, and only one study was Level 2. The evidence level improved over time. While most studies (44.8%) included patients with acute COVID-19, we observed a gradual increase in the number of reports about chronic symptoms and the long-term consequences of the infection. CONCLUSIONS The update of the rapid living systematic review by Cochrane Rehabilitation Field demonstrates an increase in the level of evidence of studies addressing the rehabilitation needs associated with COVID-19 infection. Although most studies are still case reports/series, there is a trend towards conducting prospective investigations of the early natural history of the disease (first months post- onset). High-quality-level studies on the efficacy of rehabilitation, and long-term monitoring of the disease and its sequelae are yet to emerge.","output":"Rehabilitation and COVID-19: a rapid living systematic review by Cochrane Rehabilitation Field updated as of December 31st, 2020 and synthesis of the scientific literature of 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technology use in Government School Libraries in Medellin, Colombia\\" by Wilson Casta?o Mu?oz and Sandra Patricia Bedoya is a case study in their home country illustrating that the digital divide continues to be with us School librarians have, and perhaps more will be, losing their jobs leaving a void where students cannot obtain the benefits from a school librarian devoted entirely to them as in many schools in Medellin The authors also investigate reliance on open source software and teachers misgivings concerning mobile technologies - topics also relatable to our members in various countries \\"Designing Lessons and Programs that Motivate Students\\" by Sherry Crow and Judy Henning provides us with not only a theoretical framework for fostering motivation but also \\"specific practical principles that can help school librarians design activities that will motivate students to read and seek information on their own","output":"School Libraries and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To identify the weakest skill areas perceived by participants among key skills highly demanded during emergencies and to explore factors influencing the self-rated overall skill proficiency of public health emergency responders.

The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) (identifying the COVID-19 pandemic as a specific traumatic life event) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) also formed part of the survey. Out of 98 participants, 45% revealed from mild to severe psychological impact from COVID-19 according to IES-R. A lower percentage, instead, complained of significant levels of depression (14%), anxiety (11%) or stress (6%) according to DASS-21. Higher education, being unemployed, number of perceived COVID-19 physical symptoms, concerns about risk of contracting COVID-19 and the pandemic situation in Italy, and needing additional information to prevent COVID-19 infection were positively associated to a higher risk of negative psychological impact. Moreover, among the participants, female gender, age, fewer years from HIV diagnosis and not being aware of their own viremia were associated to a higher risk of negative psychological outcomes. Almost half of our PLWH sample experienced significant levels of distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite their clinical relevance, interhemispheric motor control systems have not been completely defined in the developing brain. The objective of this study was to examine the developmental profile of transcallosal inhibition in healthy children and adolescents. Nineteen typically developing right-handed participants were recruited. Two transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigms assessed transcallosal inhibition: ipsilateral silent periods (iSP) and paired-pulse interhemispheric inhibition (IHI). TMS was applied to the motor hotspot of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. Resting motor threshold (RMT), iSP latency, duration and suppression strength, and paired-pulse IHI were measured from both hemispheres. The Purdue Pegboard Test assessed unimanual motor function. Hemispheric differences were evident for RMT and iSP latency and suppression strength, where the left hemisphere had a lower RMT, prolonged latency, and greater suppression strength. iSP duration showed hemispheric symmetry. RMT and iSP latency decreased with age, whereas iSP suppression strength increased. Girls showed shorter iSP latency. Children typically displayed IHI, although hemispheric differences were observed. iSP suppression strength was uniquely associated with IHI within individuals. iSP duration correlated with motor performance. TMS can characterize transcallosal inhibition in normal children and adolescents with effects of age, directionality, sex, and motor performance.

The effectiveness and acceptability of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy-based (CBT-based) treatment for insomnia in adolescents is established for High Income Countries, but unknown for African settings. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of CBT-based intervention among in-school adolescents with sleep difficulties in Southern Nigeria. METHODS: This was a pilot controlled trial involving 50 adolescents with highest ranked scores on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) recruited from four schools (two government and two privately owned). Balloting was used to assign two schools (public and private) with 25 participants to the intervention group, and the other two schools (public and private) with 25 participants as waiting-list controls. The two groups were dyad-matched for baseline ISI scores, gender, and type of school to reduce baseline differences. The treatment group received weekly group-based manualised CBT-based intervention over 5 weeks. Primary outcome was ISI score at 6th week. Secondary outcomes were sleep onset latency (SOL), Total sleep duration (TSD), depressive symptoms, sleep hygiene, and knowledge about sleep. RESULTS: Participants were aged 13C17 years (M = 14.9, SD = 1.16) and consisted of 18 males and 32 females. Controlling for baseline scores, the intervention group showed significantly lower post-intervention insomnia scores compared with the control group {F (1, 34) = 1.10, p = 0.0001, (p(2) = 0.59}, shorter SOL {F (1, 33) = 1.41, p = 0.0001, p(2) = 0.39}, longer TSD {F (1, 33) = 1.03, p = 0.0001, p(2) = 0.47}, lower depressive symptoms {F (1, 31) = 1.32, p = 0.002 (p(2) = 0.34}, higher knowledge of sleep {F (1, 34) = 1.02, p = 0.001, p(2) = 0.36}, but no significant change in sleep hygiene {F (1, 32) = 1.08, p = 0.08, p(2) = 0.15}.

Setting: The online platform Prolific, collected in October 2021. Participants: A representative sample of 1110 members of the public in the UK. Interventions: Participants were presented with a scenario describing a positive COVID-19 test result and then presented with one of eight scenarios describing a Long COVID diagnosis. Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures: Various outcome measures relating to illness expectations were captured including: symptom severity, symptom duration, quality of life, personal control, treatment control and illness coherence. Results: We ran a series of 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVAs on the outcome variables. We found a main effect of illness description: individuals reported longer symptom duration and less illness coherence when the illness was described as Long COVID (compared to ongoing COVID-19 recovery). There was a main effect of illness uncertainty: when uncertainty was emphasised, participants reported longer expected symptom duration, less treatment control, and less illness coherence than when uncertainty was not emphasised. There was also a main effect of efficacy of support: participants reported higher personal control and higher treatment control when support was enhanced (compared to basic support). We also found an interaction between illness description and efficacy of support: when support was enhanced, participants reported less illness coherence for Long COVID (compared to ongoing COVID-19 recovery). Conclusions: Communications around Long COVID should not emphasise symptom uncertainty and should provide people with information on how they can facilitate their recovery and where they can access additional support.

Physical activity levels decline throughout primary school emphasising a need for effective strategies to promote more activity in children. Children have rarely been involved in the intervention development process. This gap is an important omission and there is much to be learnt from existing qualitative studies with children, which could serve as a starting point for specific projects. This systematic review aimed to synthesise qualitative studies with primary school children in the United Kingdom to identify children's perspectives on why physical activity is important, the factors that influence their physical activity and what they like when it comes to physical activity. METHODS: A search of seven databases (conducted in October 2019) identified 26 papers for inclusion. Data extraction and synthesis were conducted using qualitative thematic synthesis. The quality of papers was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for qualitative research. RESULTS: Across the diverse range of studies, several key themes were identified in relation to the three research questions. Children have a comprehensive understanding of the various benefits of physical activity, including benefits for health, fitness and skills development. A range of social agents and practical issues influence children's physical activity, with friend and peer influences being particularly salient. Most children like to have choice over the activities they undertake and the opportunities for creative physical play such as making up active games. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that future interventions should utilize peer relationships, ensure a variety of activities are offered to cater to a broad range of children's physical activity preferences and incorporate child-led activities where possible. The included studies also highlight a need for more diversity in qualitative research in this area, particularly in terms of ethnicity and age, and combining traditional qualitative methods with creative methods, such as photography, may provide richer insights than when using a single mode of data collection. We also highlight several methodological challenges, and in particular, the need for greater acknowledgement of the role of the researcher in qualitative work with children.","output":"Children's Voices in Physical Activity Research: A Qualitative Review and Synthesis of UK Children's Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout history, humanity has been threatened by countless epidemic and pandemic outbreaks of infectious diseases, from the Justinianic Plague to the Spanish flu to COVID\\\\19.

No study has correlated MPD size and malignancy considering the anatomic site of the gland (head versus body-tail). Our aim was to analyze the significance of MPD in pancreatic head/body-tail as a predictor of malignancy in main-duct/mixed IPMNs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of resected patients between 2009-2018. Malignancy was defined as high-grade dysplasia and invasive carcinoma. MPD diameter was measured with magnetic resonance imaging. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was utilized to identify optimal MPD cut-off for malignancy. Independent predictors of malignancy were searched. RESULTS: Malignancy was detected in 74% of 312 identified patients. 213 patients (68.3%) had IPMNs of the pancreatic head and 99 (31.7%) of the body-tail. ROC analysis identified 9 and 7 mm as the optimal MPD cut-offs for malignancy in IPMNs of head and body-tail of the pancreas, respectively. Multivariate analysis confirmed that MPD &#8805;9 mm (pancreatic head), and &#8805;7 mm (body-tail) were independent predictors of malignancy along with macroscopic solid components, positive cytology and elevated CA 19-9.

Even though these tools are popular in the underground markets, they have not received enough attention by researchers. In this paper, we report on the first evaluation of four underground, commercial, and research anti-fingerprinting browsers and highlight their high success rate in bypassing browser fingerprinting. Despite their success against well-known fingerprinting methods and libraries, we show that even slightest variation in the simulated fingerprint compared to the real ones can give away the presence of anti-fingerprinting tools. As a result, we provide techniques and fingerprint-based signatures that can be used to detect the current generation of anti-fingerprinting browsers.","output":"Short Paper - Taming the Shape Shifter: Detecting Anti-fingerprinting Browsers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading rapidly around the world, resulting in a massive death toll.

Both top leaders and government agencies have been active in advocating for a new discourse on various international occasions. Previously, China has been reluctant to join the debate in international affairs, and been instead preoccupied with domestic affairs since the late 1970s. The situation has changed since 2009 because of Chinas rapid rise to become the worlds second largest economy. With regard to the motivations behind the Chinese governments support for discursive power, the dominant explanation is based on the rise of China argument. However, this argument does not explain the causal relationship between Chinas rise and its discursive power strategy. So, this paper aims to clarify the motivation behind Chinas discursive power strategy through document reviews and interviews with mainstream scholars. It concludes that a discursive power strategy has been the fundamental principle of the Communist Party of China since its establishment in 1921. Since Chinas adoption of an opening-up policy in 1978, this tradition has been suppressed but not eliminated entirely by top leaders. As China continues to rise on the world stage, the principle will drive China to create a new political model rather than be a mere follower of the established political order.","output":"Chinas Rise and its Discursive Power Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the duration of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is important to controlling the current pandemic.

To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control actions on the chemical composition, size distribution, and mixing state of individual particles, real-time individual particles in the urban atmosphere of the Northern China were analyzed using single particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS) during January 16 to February 4, 2020. The results showed that the concentrations of PM2.5, NOx, and CO were lower during DP (during the pandemic) than those during BP (before the pandemic), while O3concentration increased by about 40.9% during DP due to a lower concentration of NO2restrainting the decomposition of O3via the reation of NO with O3. The number count of carbonaceous particles during DP decreased by 20.2% compared to that during BP due to the sharp reduction of factory production and vehicular transportation during DP. Dust particles during DP exhibited weaker23Na+,56Fe+, and79PO3Csignals than those during BP, suggesting that dust particles during DP were mostly derived from mineral dust rather than industrial sources. The total particles during DP peaked at a larger size than those during BP, due to the higher fraction of secondary inorganic ions through the enhanced heterogeneous aqueous oxidation. The unscaled size distribution of total particles peaked at 0.50 m during BP and at 0.66C0.70 m during DP, suggesting that particles remained for a long time in the atmosphere and went through a strong aging process during DP.

Sex, age and comorbidities have been associated with worse outcome in the general population. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a severe, autoimmune disease with frequent multi-organ involvement. Objectives: To assess the impact of COVID-19 and to determine factors associated with worse outcome in SSc patients from the European Scleroderma Trial and Research (EUSTAR) database. Methods: SSc patients from the EUSTAR database with COVID-19 were prospectively collected between 15.03.-31.12.2020. Two outcomes were chosen: (1) hospitalization;and (2) severe outcome defined as either non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or death. General risk factors assessed were sex, age and number of comorbidities. SSc related risk factors were SSc subtype, autoantibodies, disease duration, SSc associated organ manifestations including interstitial lung disease (ILD), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), cardiac, gastrointestinal (GI), and musculoskeletal involvement;digital ulcers (DU), CRP at last visit, renal disease (scleroderma renal crisis and SSc associated renal insufficiency), modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) and immunosuppressive treatment. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were applied. Results: In total, 178 European SSc patients with COVID-19 were registered with a median observation time of 5.5 weeks (Table 1). 95 patients (53%) could recall SAR-Cov-2 contact, while 47 (26%) had no contact. 156 (88%) were symptomatic at COVID-19 onset with fever, cough, malaise and dyspnea being most prevalent. Over the disease course, 63 (36%) developed pneumonia. In total, 67/176 (38%) were hospitalized which were in 84% due to COVID-19. 41/170 (24%) had a severe outcome including 21 (12%) deaths. 128 (72%) recovered completely, while 14 (8%) complained of sequela, with 7 (50%) stating respiratory complications. Age, non-SSc comorbidities, presence of ILD, PAH and SSc associated renal or cardiac disease were numerically associated with hospitalization and severe outcome (Table 1). Univariable logistic analyses for hospitalization and severe outcome are shown in Figure 1. In multivariable logistic regression, age (OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01-1.07, p=0.019), presence of non-SSc comorbidities (OR 2.52, 95%CI 1.16-5.47, p=0.019) and SSc-related renal disease (predicting success perfectly) were associated with hospitalization and for severe outcome age (OR 1.05, 95%CI 1.01-1.08). Conclusion: SSc patients at older age, with non-SSc comorbidities, SSc related renal disease or ILD are at risk of a more severe outcome and should follow precautions to avoid COVID-19 infections and need careful monitoring in case of COVID-19.","output":"The impact and outcome of COVID-19 on systemic sclerosis patients from the european scleroderma trial and research group (EUSTAR)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 globally impacted the humanity causing tragic outcomes; costing millions of lives, destroying economies and demolishing public health infrastructures.

Based on 1,314 epidemiological-survey cases from February 29 to May 25, 2020, we found that the synchronized approach of implementing multi-dimensional interventional policies, such as a centralized quarantine and nucleic acid testing (NAT), flight service adjustment and border closure, effectively facilitate early identification of infected case. Specifically, the implementation of the international flight service reduction was found to be associated with a reduction of the mean intervals of diagnosis from arrival to lab-confirmation by 0.44 days maximally, and the border closure was associated with a reduction of the diagnosis interval of imported cases by 0.69 days, from arrival to laboratory confirmation.

The results of our analyses support separation of the traditional Sarea difformis s.lat. and Sarea resinae s.lat. into two distinct genera, Sarea and Zythia. Sarea as circumscribed is shown to conservatively comprise three phylospecies, with one corresponding to Sarea difformis s.str. and two, morphologically indistinguishable, corresponding to the newly combined Sarea coeloplata. Zythia is provisionally maintained as monotypic, containing only a genetically and morphologically variable Z. resinae. The new genus Atrozythia is erected for the new species A. klamathica. Arthrographis lignicola is placed in this genus on molecular grounds, expanding the concept of Sareomycetes by inclusion of a previously unknown type of asexual morph.

The need to optimize resources and minimize the personnel in the operating room (OR) led us to develop a novel technique to reduce TL fracture-dislocations (AO type-C) using an orthopedic distractor device (ODD). METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care spine center with a study duration from March 2020 to May 2020 coinciding with the nationwide lockdown and travel restrictions imposed in view of the COVID-19 crisis. Only patients with AO type C fracture-dislocation managed using the ODD operated by a single surgeon were included in the study. RESULTS: Of 12 cases, the most commonly affected level was D12-L1. Nine patients were American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) A at presentation, two patients were AIS B, and one AIS C. The mean operative time was 125 min and mean blood loss was 454 ml. Eight patients remained AIS A, one patient improved from AIS B to C. Two patients became independent walkers, one remained AIS B.

Identifying patients with the highest potential diagnostic yield may help to avoid morbidity in patients unlikely to benefit from the procedure. We sought to determine which patient factors, specifically chest computed tomography (CT) findings, affected diagnostic yield of BAL. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of immunocompromised patients who underwent FOB with BAL from 01/01/2010 to 12/31/2011 at an academic medical center was performed. The lung lobe lavaged, characteristics of pulmonary infiltrate on radiograph, patient symptoms, and diagnostic yield were collected. A positive diagnostic yield was defined as a positive microbiological culture, finding on cytopathologic staining, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, alveolar eosinophilia or a positive immunologic or nucleic acid assay. RESULTS: The overall diagnostic yield was 52.6%. Infiltrates that were predominantly reticular or nodular by CT had a lower diagnostic yield than predominantly consolidated, ground-glass, or tree-in-bud infiltrates (36.5% vs. 61.2%, P = 0.0058).

METHODS: This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19.

After 60 days of treatment, testosterone (T) and cholesterol (CHOL) concentrations, catalase (CAT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 3?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3?-HSD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the testes along with myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities and nitrite concentrations (NO) in the serum and testes as well as sperm quality were measured. RESULTS: T and CHOL concentrations along with 3?-HSD activity were significantly higher in the animals treated with the low dose than in those treated with the high dose of the chloroform extract (P<0.05). Furthermore, the chloroform extract was more effective than the methanol extract that had the most marginal effect on T level at the high dose and the H-EtOH extract that was only effective at the medium dose. LDH activity was dose-dependently increased by the extracts in all groups. The CAT-SOD antioxidant system was increased in the treated animals at all doses compared to the control values, but the increase in glutathione level reached significant level in those treated with the low dose H-EtOH aqueous ethanol extract (P<0.05). Only the high dose of chloroform extract had significant inhibitory effects on MPO activity (P<0.05). Serum NO concentration was decreased at all doses of the extracts. The inhibitory effects of the extracts on testicular NO concentrations follow this order, chloroform extract > H-EtOH > methanol. Although all extracts at all doses showed excellent stimulatory effects on sperm quality (count, motility and morphology), the methanol extract at the high dose was the most effective on sperm count (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The chloroform extract of A. djalonensis has better androgen-like and anti-inflammatory effects whereas the methanol extract has the best effect on sperm count.","output":"Evaluation of Effect of Anthocleista djalonensis A.

METHOD: Participants in the EAT 2010-2018 (Eating and Activity over Time) study were invited to complete the C-EAT (COVID-19 EAT) survey in April-May 2020. There were 720 respondents to the survey (age: 24.7  2.0 years). Psychological distress, stress, stress management, financial difficulties, and food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic were examined as cross-sectional correlates of disordered eating in 2020. Open-ended questions assessed the perceived impact of the pandemic on eating behaviors. RESULTS: Low stress management was significantly associated with a higher count of extreme unhealthy weight control behaviors (UWCBs). Food insecurity, higher depressive symptoms, and financial difficulties were significantly associated with a higher count of less extreme UWCBs. Higher stress and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with greater odds of binge eating. Six themes pertaining to disordered eating during the pandemic emerged: (a) mindless eating and snacking; (b) increased food consumption; (c) generalized decrease in appetite or dietary intake; (d) eating to cope; (e) pandemic-related reductions in dietary intake; and (f) re-emergence or marked increase in eating disorder symptoms. DISCUSSION: Psychological distress, stress management, financial difficulties, and abrupt schedule changes may have contributed to disordered eating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions that target stress management, depressive symptoms, and financial strain and provide tools to develop a routine may be particularly effective for emerging adults at risk of developing disordered eating during public health crises.","output":"Disordered eating in a population-based sample of young adults during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Facing the social panic and substantial shortage of medical resources during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, providing psychological first-aid to inpatients is essential for their rehabilitation and the orderly operating of medical systems. However, the closed-ward environment and extreme shortage of onsite mental health workers have limited the use of traditional face-to-face diagnosis and psychological interventions. Aim To develop a mental health intervention model for inpatients that can be applied during a widespread epidemic, such as COVID-19. Methods In a medical team stationed in Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China, we integrated onsite and online psychological support resources to implement a graded psychological intervention system. The onsite psychiatrist established trust with the patients and classified them into categories according to their symptom severity. While face-to-face evaluation and intervention are critical for effective online support, the online team effectively extended the scope of the 'first-aid' to all patients. Conclusion This integrated onsite and online approach was effective and efficient in providing psychological interventions for inpatients during the crisis. Our model provides a realistic scheme for healthcare systems in or after the COVID-19 epidemic and also could be adopted in areas of the world with insufficient mental healthcare resources.","output":"Development of a psychological first-aid model in inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early reports of COVID-19 often inaccurately presented the virus as a serious concern only among older adults.

Pupillary responses were measured using a pupillometry system. Dynamic pupil parameters (i.e., pupil contraction amplitude, pupil dilatation latency, pupil contraction latency, pupil dilatation duration, pupil dilatation velocity, pupil contraction duration, pupil contraction velocity, resting pupil diameter [PD]) and static pupil parameters (i.e., mesopic PD, scotopic PD, high photopic PD, and low photopic PD) were registered. RESULTS: Although high photopic and scotopic PDs were significantly higher in patients recovering from COVID-19 than in healthy controls (P = 0.04 and P = 0.002), no statistically significant difference was found in mesopic and low photopic PD (P = 0.19 and P = 0.41). Regarding dynamic pupillometry parameters, resting PD and pupil contraction velocity (P = 0.04 and P = 0.02, respectively) were significantly higher in patients recovering from COVID-19 than in healthy controls (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively), whereas pupil dilatation latency and pupil contraction duration were lower in these patients than in healthy controls (P = 0.01 and P = 0.008, respectively).

Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and toxins have been shown to bind to the immobilized heparin in a similar way to the interaction with heparan sulfate on the cell surface. This binding is nonreversible and as such, the pathogens are removed from the bloodstream. In this review, we describe the pathophysiological basis and rationale for using heparin for pathogen removal from the blood as well as exploring the technology behind the adaptation of heparin to deprive it of its systemic anticoagulant activity. In addition, we summarize the in vitro data as well as the available preclinical testing and published clinical reports.

Stress responses are particularly important in stem cells that provide lifetime support for tissue formation and repair, but how these protective systems are integrated into developmental programs is poorly understood. Here we used myoblast differentiation to identify the E3 ligase CUL2FEM1B and its substrate FNIP1 as core components of the reductive stress response. Reductive stress, as caused by prolonged antioxidant signaling or mitochondrial inactivity, reverts the oxidation of invariant Cys residues in FNIP1 and allows CUL2FEM1B to recognize its target. The ensuing proteasomal degradation of FNIP1 restores mitochondrial activity to preserve redox homeostasis and stem cell integrity. The reductive stress response is therefore built around a ubiquitin-dependent rheostat that tunes mitochondrial activity to redox needs and implicates metabolic control in coordination of stress and developmental signaling.","output":"A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background-Communities played a key role in preventing the spread of coronavirus, not only during the threshold period of the epidemic but also in the normal stage of prevention.

Methods-Based on data envelopment analysis (DEA), this article used community worker data to evaluate the matching of service supply and demand during the epidemic period and used co-word analysis to analyze the content and the residents' demands for community service from the threshold period to the normal period of the epidemic. Results-According to the results of the DEA model, early in the epidemic, 13 of the 15 districts' DEA values were invalid, indicating that there was a shortage in community workers in Wuhan. The results of public opinion analysis showed that from the threshold to the normal period of the epidemic, the emphasis on community service gradually transformed from epidemic prevention to an integrated service, which effectively met the composite service needs of community residents for both prevention and life. Conclusions-In the face of public health emergencies, the government should ensure an adequate number of service personnel, mobilize the service resources, refine the service content, and adjust the incentive policy, which can help to improve the quality of residents' lives and the coordination degree of the prevention and control as part of the epidemic control in the emergency period and the social and economic recovery after the epidemic.","output":"Exploration of the Evaluation and Optimization of Community Epidemic Prevention in Wuhan Based on a DEA Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Small bowel obstruction is a common surgical emergency which can lead to bowel necrosis, perforation and death. Plain abdominal X-rays are frequently used as a first-line test but the availability of immediate expert radiological review is variable. The aim was to investigate the feasibility of using a deep learning model for automated identification of small bowel obstruction. METHODS: A total of 990 plain abdominal radiographs were collected, 445 with normal findings and 445 demonstrating small bowel obstruction. The images were labelled using the radiology reports, subsequent CT scans, surgical operation notes and enhanced radiological review. The data were used to develop a predictive model comprising an ensemble of five convolutional neural networks trained using transfer learning. RESULTS: The performance of the model was excellent with an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.961, corresponding to sensitivity and specificity of 91 and 93% respectively. CONCLUSION: Deep learning can be used to identify small bowel obstruction on plain radiographs with a high degree of accuracy. A system such as this could be used to alert clinicians to the presence of urgent findings with the potential for expedited clinical review and improved patient outcomes.

Methods In this prospective cross-sectional, group comparison study, the development of 41 HE and 40 HU infants (mean age=8.4 months, SD=2.1 months) from a low-income context was assessed. Caregivers were interviewed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (Vineland-3) to evaluate infants' development. Results Most HE participants had age-appropriate overall development (90.2%;n=37). Some HE participants, however, presented with delays in domains of communication (9.8%;n=4), daily living skills (2.4%;n=1), socialisation (19.5%;n=8), and motor development (7.3%;n=3). HU participants also demonstrated some domain-specific delays, thus delays were present in both groups. No statistically significant between-group differences regarding development were found. Conclusion Findings were reassuring and suggested that HE and HU participants had similar development. Developmental differences may, however, only emerge with age, therefore large-scale longitudinal research is recommended.

NE is a complex disease and predisposing factors that compromise gut integrity are required to facilitate C. perfringens proliferation and toxin production.

METHODS: Based on an observational, prospective and longitudinal cohort study 1,800 participants visiting the ED of the Jewish General Hospital (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) were recruited between September and December 2017. ER(2) assessment determined three risk-levels (i.e., low, medium and high) for short-term ED undesirable outcomes. The rate of ER(2) digital form completed, the time to fill ER(2) items and obtain ER(2) risk-levels, the LOS in ED and in hospital, and hospital admission were used as outcomes.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between cytokine profiles and lung injury in COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in COVID-19 patients. Demographic characteristics, symptoms, signs, underlying diseases, and laboratory data were collected. The patients were divided into COVID-19 with pneumonia and without pneumonia. CT severity score and PaO2/FiO2 ratio were used to assess lung injury. RESULTS: 106 patients with 12 COVID-19 without pneumonia and 94 COVID-19 with pneumonia were included. Compared with COVID-19 without pneumonia, COVID-19 with pneumonia had significantly higher serum interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;. Correlation analysis showed that CT severity score and PaO2/FiO2 were significantly correlated with age, presence of any coexisting disorder, lymphocyte count, procalcitonin, IL-2R, and IL-6.

Purpose To assess the incidence, patterns, and severity of injuries in victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, compared with the prior three years. Materials and Methods The demographics, clinical presentation, injuries, and radiological findings of patients reporting physical abuse arising from IPV during the statewide COVID-19 pandemic between March 11th and May 3rd, 2020 were compared with the same period over the past three years. Pearson's chi-squared and Fischer's exact have been used for analysis. Results 26 physical IPV victims from 2020 (37+/-13 years, 25 women) were evaluated and compared with 42 physical IPV victims (41+/-15 years, 40 women) from 2017-2019. While the overall number of patients reporting IPV decreased during the pandemic, the incidence of physical IPV was 1.8 times greater (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 3.0, p = 0.01). The total number of deep injuries was 28 during 2020 versus 16 from 2017-2019; the number of deep injuries per victim was 1.1 during 2020 compared with 0.4 from 2017-2019 (p<0.001). The incidence of high-risk abuse defined by mechanism was greater by 2 times (95% CI 1.2 to 4.7, p = 0.01). Patients with IPV in during the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to be ethnically white, 17 (65%) victims in 2020 were ethnically white compared to 11 (26%) in the prior years (p=0.007). Conclusion There was a higher incidence and severity of physical intimate partner violence (IPV) during the COVID 19 pandemic compared with the prior three years. These results suggest that IPV victims delayed reaching out to health care services until the late stages of the abuse cycle during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Exacerbation of Physical Intimate Partner Violence during COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The large volume and suboptimal image quality of portable chest X-rays (CXRs) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could post significant challenges for radiologists and frontline physicians. Deep-learning artificial intelligent (AI) methods have the potential to help improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy for reading portable CXRs. PURPOSE: The study aimed at developing an AI imaging analysis tool to classify COVID-19 lung infection based on portable CXRs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Public datasets of COVID-19 (N = 130), bacterial pneumonia (N = 145), non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia (N = 145), and normal (N = 138) CXRs were analyzed. Texture and morphological features were extracted. Five supervised machine-learning AI algorithms were used to classify COVID-19 from other conditions. Two-class and multi-class classification were performed. Statistical analysis was done using unpaired two-tailed t tests with unequal variance between groups. Performance of classification models used the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: For the two-class classification, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 100%, 100%, and 100% for COVID-19 vs normal; 96.34%, 95.35% and 97.44% for COVID-19 vs bacterial pneumonia; and 97.56%, 97.44% and 97.67% for COVID-19 vs non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia. For the multi-class classification, the combined accuracy and AUC were 79.52% and 0.87, respectively. CONCLUSION: AI classification of texture and morphological features of portable CXRs accurately distinguishes COVID-19 lung infection in patients in multi-class datasets. Deep-learning methods have the potential to improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy for portable CXRs.","output":"Machine-learning classification of texture features of portable chest X-ray accurately classifies COVID-19 lung infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Slimme brillen: je leest er steeds vaker over.

However, to date, a paucity of robust, reliable immune-related biomarkers has been identified that are capable of estimating prognosis in HNSCC patients. METHODS High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed in tumors and matched adjacent tissues from five HNSCC patients, and the immune signatures expression of 730 immune-related transcripts selected from the nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel were assessed. Survival analyzes were performed in a training cohort, consisting of 416 HNSCC cases, retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A prognostic signature was built, using elastic net-penalized Cox regression and backward, stepwise Cox regression analyzes. The outcomes were validated by an independent cohort of 115 HNSCC patients, using tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry staining. Cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) was also used to estimate the relative fractions of 22 immune-cell types and their correlations coefficients with prognostic biomarkers. RESULTS Collectively, 248 immune-related genes were differentially expressed in paired tumors and normal tissues using RNA sequencing. After process screening in the training TCGA cohort, four immune-related genes (PVR, TNFRSF12A, IL21R, and SOCS1) were significantly associated with overall survival (OS). Integrating these genes with Path_N stage, a multiplex model was built and suggested better performance in determining 5 years OS (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, area under the curve (AUC)=0.709) than others. Further protein-based validation was conducted in 115 HNSCC patients. Similarly, high expression of PVR and TNFRSF12A were associated with poor OS (Kaplan-Meier p=0.017 and 0.0032), while high expression of IL21R and SOCS1 indicated favorable OS (Kaplan-Meier p<0.0001 and =0.0018). The integrated model with Path_N stage still demonstrated efficacy in OS evaluation (Kaplan-Meier p<0.0001, ROC AUC=0.893). Besides, the four prognostic genes were significantly correlated with activated CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, follicular helper T cells and regulatory T cells, implying the possible involvement of these genes in the immunoregulation and development of HNSCC. CONCLUSIONS The well-established model encompassing both immune-related biomarkers and clinicopathological factor might serve as a promising tool for the prognostic prediction of HNSCC.","output":"Prognostic value of novel immune-related genomic biomarkers identified in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes substantial morbidity. Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, might improve outcomes by mitigating inflammation. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of patients admitted to the University of Washington Hospital system with COVID-19 and requiring supplemental oxygen. Outcomes included clinical improvement, defined as a two-point reduction in severity on a 6-point ordinal scale or discharge, and mortality within 28 days. We used Cox proportional-hazards models with propensity score inverse probability weighting to compare outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Results We evaluated 43 patients who received tocilizumab and 45 who did not. Patients receiving tocilizumab were younger with fewer comorbidities but higher baseline oxygen requirements. Tocilizumab treatment was associated with reduced CRP, fibrinogen, and temperature, but there were no meaningful differences in Cox models of time to clinical improvement (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.38-2.22) or mortality (aHR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.21-1.52).

Here, we investigated quality of romantic relationships among 313 participants as movement restrictions were implemented and subsequently phased out cross-nationally. Participants completed self-report questionnaires over a period of seven weeks, where we predicted relationship quality and change in relationship quality using machine learning models that included a variety of potential predictors related to psychological, demographic and environmental variables.On average, our machine learning models predicted 29% (linear models) and 22% (non-linear models) of the variance with regard to relationship quality. Here, the most important predictors consisted of attachment style (anxious attachment being more influential than avoidant), age, and number of conflicts within the relationship. Interestingly, environmental factors such as the local severity of the pandemic did not exert a measurable influence with respect to predicting relationship quality. As opposed to overall relationship quality, the change in relationship quality during lockdown restrictions could not be predicted accurately by our machine learning models when utilizing our selected features.In conclusion, we demonstrate cross-culturally that attachment security is a major predictor of relationship quality during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, whereas fear, pathogenic threat, sexual behavior, and the severity of governmental regulations did not significantly influence the accuracy of prediction.","output":"Securing your relationship: Quality of intimate relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic can be predicted by attachment style"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The optimal management of COVID-19 in transplant patients is not defined so far The major concern is the ability of transplant patients to generate a sufficient antiviral response under immunosuppressive treatment Methods: Here, we analysed T-cell immunity directed against Spike, Membrane and Nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in a small cohort of 6 transplant patients (TP) with COVID-19 in comparison to 28 non-immunosuppressed patients (NIP) Results: The median patient age of transplant cohort (3 renal transplant, 1 lung, and 1 combined liver-kidney and 1 pancreas-kidney) as well as gender did not differ from NIP We also did not find statistical differences for the time between the diagnosis of COVID-19 and analysis of T-cell immunity between the two cohorts Notably, despite immunosuppressive therapy, we were able to detect a strong antiviral response in transplant patients TP generated SARSCoV-2 reactive T-cells against all three proteins with predominance of CD4 + T cells with pro-inflammatory Th1 phenotype Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were able to produce multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines demonstrating their potential protective capacity Of interest, the frequencies and cytokine production patterns of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cells did not show any differences between TP and NIP Conclusion: A strong polyfunctional T-cell response directed against all three SARS-CoV-2 proteins can be generated in transplant despite immunosuppressive treatment In comparison to non-immunosuppressed patients, the antiviral immunity is non-inferior Since the dosage of immunosuppression in analysed patients was reduced, further studies are required to assess the antiviral immunity under standard immunosuppression","output":"Transplant patients are able to mount sars-cov-2-reactive t-cell response with the magnitude and functionality comparable to non-immunosuppressed patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The entire world is faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, which is also accompanied by an infodemic.

Hyper\\\\inflammation and cytokine storm cause lung damage. This study aimed to compare the low\\\\dose and high\\\\dose effects of tocilizumab, an IL\\\\6 receptor antagonist. METHOD: Patients with severe pneumonia and hyper\\\\inflammation signs because of COVID\\\\19 were included in this retrospective study. Patients receiving tocilizumab <200 mg intravenously were classified as the low\\\\dose group, and receiving 200 mg as the high\\\\dose group, and those not treated with tocilizumab as the control group. Demographic and clinical data of patients who died and survived in both low\\\\high dose and control patients were compared. According to symptom day and radiological infiltration, patients with tocilizumab were also evaluated in two groups as early and late periods at tocilizumab administration time. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients were included in the study; 70 were treated with a low dose and 50 with high\\\\dose tocilizumab. Forty patients were in the control group. Age, comorbidity and clinical features were similar in the control, low\\\\dose tocilizumab and high\\\\dose tocilizumab groups. The mortality rate (12.9%, 30.0%, 37.5, P = .008) was less in the low\\\\dose tocilizumab group. The secondary infection rate was higher in the high\\\\dose group than in the low\\\\dose tocilizumab and control groups (44.0%, 10.0%, 10.0%, P < .001). Distinguishing between those patients who died and survived, age (OR: 1.1589, P < .001), higher APACHE II scores (OR: 1.225, P = .001) and needs for non\\\\invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 14.469, P < .001) were the most critical risk factors.

It affects individuals from the order Artiodactyla, such as cattle, swine, sheep, wild animals from this order, and a few non-cloven hoofed species, such as mice and elephants. FMD causes large-scale economic losses for agricultural production systems; morbidity is almost 100% in an affected population, accompanied by a high mortality rate in young animals due to myocarditis or an inability to suckle if a mother is ill. The aetiological agent is an Aphthovirus from the family Picornaviridae, having seven serotypes: A, O, C, SAT1, SAT2, SAT3, and Asia 1. Serotype variability means that an immune response is serospecific and vaccines are thus designed to protect against each serotype independently. A hosts adaptive immune response is key in defence against pathogens; however, this virus uses successful strategies (along with most microorganisms) enabling it to evade a hosts immune system to rapidly and efficiently establish itself within such host, and thus remain there. This review has been aimed at an in-depth analysis of the immune response in cattle and swine regarding FMD virus, the possible evasion mechanisms used by the virus and describing some immunological differences regarding these species. Such aspects can provide pertinent knowledge for developing new FMD control and prevention strategies.","output":"A Comprehensive Review of the Immunological Response against Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Infection and Its Evasion Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study focuses on changes in gynecologic surgical activity at Hospital Foch, Paris, France during the first French COVID lockdown in 2020. Additional goals include the evaluation the extent of the postponement suffered for each type of surgery and estimate the possible negative impact for patients. STUDY DESIGN: Single-center, retrospective, chart-review cohort study in the gynecology department of Hospital Foch. Comparison of all patients scheduled, postponed and operated during the first COVID lockdown (March 14, to May 11, 2020) versus the same period in 2019. Postponed surgeries were classified into 4 scheduling interval categories according to the Society of Gynecology Oncology (SGO) recommendations: urgent (without delay), semi-urgent (1-4 weeks), non-urgent (>4-12 weeks) and elective (>3 months) and evaluated to determine whether COVID-19-related delays of surgeries fell within guidelines. The potential loss of chance or medical risk associated with postponed surgeries was estimated according to a composite criterion including death, aggravation of expected tumor stages/grades in cancers, increase in surgical complexity compared to that initially planned, need for preoperative transfusions, start of morphine consumption during preoperative treatment for opiate-naive patients, additional hospitalization or consultations in emergency room and delay in treatment when surgery was urgent. RESULTS: During the 2020 French COVID lockdown, 61 patients had a surgical procedure and 114 were postponed; in the comparator 2019 group, 232 patients underwent surgical procedures, indicating an overall decrease of 65% of activity. Analysis of differences between the two years revealed a reduction of 64% in emergency procedures, 90% of functional pathologies, and 13% of cancers. According to SGO guidelines, the only type of surgical procedures that had excessive delay was the semi-urgent group, where time to surgery was 6.7 weeks [range 5.4-10 weeks] instead of the recommended interval of 1-4 weeks. Among postponed surgeries there were 10 patients (8.7%) with a potential loss of chance according to the composite criteria, all included in the semi-urgent group. CONCLUSION: The COVID 19 pandemic was responsible for a significant decrease of activity in the surgical department of Hospital Foch. Difficulty of rescheduling surgeries was responsible for an increased delay in semi-urgent operations. In almost 9% of postponed surgeries, there was a potential loss of chance, which likely represents only the tip of iceberg of collateral damages due to COVID 19 pandemic in this surgical unit. These data show the importance of continuing to treat pathologies requiring urgent or semi-urgent surgery during pandemics.","output":"Collateral damage of COVID-19 pandemic: The impact on a gynecologic surgery department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Widespread adoption of green vehicles in urban logistics may contribute to the alleviation of problems such as environmental pollution, global warming, and oil dependency. However, the current adoption of green vehicles in the last mile logistics is relatively low despite many actions taken by public authorities to overcome the negative externalities of distributing goods in cities. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on studies investigating the adoption of green vehicles in urban freight transportation, paying specific attention to e-commerce. To shed light on the adoption of green vehicles in city logistics, the paper conducts a systematic review of the empirical literature on the topic. The 159 articles reviewed were classified into the following: (a) Optimization and scheduling (67 papers);(b) policy (55 papers);(c) sustainability (37 papers). Among the 159 articles, a further selection of 17 papers dealing with e-commerce, i.e., studies that highlight the most relevant aspects related to the integration of green vehicles in e-commerce urban logistics, was performed. Our findings indicate that green vehicles are competitive in urban deliveries characterized by frequent stop-and-go movements and low consolidation levels while incentives are still necessary for their adoption.

COVID-19 BSS [IgG/IgM]; SIENNA&#8482; COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette; NG-Test? IgG-IgM COVID-19). Detectable IgG or IgM reactivities could be observed in 31 (3.43%) of the 902 IgG and IgM bands of the 3 RDTs used with all pre-epidemic sera. The frequencies of IgG/IgM reactivities were similar for European (3.20%) and African (3.55%) sera. IgM reactivities were observed in 9 European and 14 African sera, while IgG reactivity was observed in only 1 African serum (15.1% vs. 0.66%). The test NG-Test?

Most cases of IE are due to bacteria although other atypical micro-organisms can also be involved. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker that is used in the diagnosis of bacterial infections. CASE SUMMARY: We present the case of a 54-year-old patient with bacterial endocarditis who has been regularly visiting his cardiologist for follow-up on a mitral valve prolapse and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) for the last 11 years. During his last visit, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a previously non-existent structure on the posterior mitral valve leaflet with severe MR. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans. On admission, he had elevated levels of PCT and C-reactive protein which returned to normal values after 4 weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy. His follow-up blood cultures, taken after normalization of PCT, did not show bacterial growth; however, on TTE he had severe mitral regurgitation and a persistent vegetation which had slightly increased in size after completion of the full antibiotic course. He was referred for mitral valve replacement surgery. DISCUSSION: Normalization of procalcitonin levels may correlate with negative blood cultures in cases of IE with residual vegetations. The optimal time for surgery in such patients is difficult to define but even in circumstances with less infective organisms such as S. viridans and late in the course of the disease residual vegetations remain a serious risk factor for embolic events. Randomized controlled clinical trials are needed in order to have better recommendations with solid evidence regarding prophylaxis and treatment in IE.","output":"Normal procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and negative blood cultures in infective endocarditis with a massive residual vegetation: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to safeguard the country in the face of the global COVID-19 outbreak , The Trinidad and Tobago , Ministry of Health continues to provide up-to-date information of the country&#039;s response to the situation","output":"Trinidad and Tobago COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus) Update #5"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus pneumonia in 17 city (Hubei) provinces was analyzed by using the principle of thermodynamics.

RESULTS 352 adolescents were referred with a mean age of 15.6  1.4, 69% female, 38% Hispanic, and 78% had non-commercial insurance. The median baseline weight was 135 kilograms and body mass index (BMI) was 48 kg/m2; 42% had a BMI > 50. Seventy-nine (22%) underwent LSG while 273 (78%) did not complete MBS primarily due to lack of interest. LSG patients had 21% total weight loss and 22% total BMI loss at 24 months while NoLSG patients had 4% total weight gain and 3% BMI gain (p < 0.01).

Several guidelines for the management of PBC have been published, including the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Clinical Practice Guidelines, which include goals for standards of PBC care. However, recent audits have identified deficiencies in real-world PBC care. In addition, the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has generally reduced access to care, diminished healthcare resources and accelerated the use of remote patient management. There is therefore a need for simple, actionable guidance that physicians can implement in order to maintain standards of care in PBC in the new environment. AIMS: A working group of ten PBC specialists from Europe and Canada were convened by Intercept Pharmaceuticals in January 2020 with the aim of defining key criteria for the care of patients with PBC. METHODS: Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on these criteria, a smaller working group of six PBC specialists developed practical recommendations to assist physicians in maintaining standards of care and to guide remote management of patients. RESULTS: The working group defined five key criteria for care in PBC, encompassing PBC diagnosis, initiation of first line therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), risk stratification on UDCA, symptom management, and initiation of 2L therapy. The group developed 21 practical recommendations for the management of patients with PBC in the COVID-19 environment including modality, frequency and timing of investigations and monitoring.

The virome, as a part of the microbiome, is characterized by a constant change in composition related to the type of diet, environment, and our genetic code, and other incalculable factors.

However, at the onset of the novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, differing national measures highlighted the fragmentation within the European Union (EU) in its various approaches to combating the pandemic. To assess the consequences of the pandemic in the EMR border area, the aim of this study was to analyze the effects and lessons learned regarding cross-border collaboration in EMS and IHT. METHOD: A qualitative study with 22 semi-structured interviews was carried out. Experts from across the EMR area, including the City of Aachen, the City region of Aachen, the District of Heinsberg (Germany), South Limburg (The Netherlands), and the Province of Limburg, as well as Lige (Belgium), took part. The interviews were coded and analyzed according to changes in cross-border collaboration before and during the pandemic, as well as lessons learned and recommendations. RESULTS: Each EU member country within the EMR area, addressed the pandemic individually with national measures. Cross-border collaboration between regional actors was hardly or not at all addressed at the national level during political decision- or policymaking. Previous direct communication at the personal level was replaced by national procedures, which made regular cross-border collaboration significantly more difficult. The cross-border transfer regulations of patients with COVID-19 proved to be complex and led, among other things, to patients being transported to hospitals far outside the border region. Collaboration continues to be seen as valuable and Euregional emergency services including hospitals work well together, albeit to different degrees. The information and data exchange should, however, be more transparent to use resources more efficiently. CONCLUSION: Effective Euregional collaboration of emergency services is imperative for public safety in a multi-border region with strong economic, cultural, and social cross-border links. Our findings indicate that existing (pre-pandemic) structures which included regular meetings of senior managerial staff in the region and a number of thematic working groups were helpful to deal with and to compensate for the disruptions during the crisis. Regional cross-border agreements that are currently based on mutual but more or less informal arrangements need to be formalized and better promoted and recognized also at the national and EU level to increase resilience. The continuous determination of synergies and good and best practices are further approaches to support cross-border collaboration especially in preparation for future crises.","output":"Impacts and Lessons Learned of the First Three COVID-19 Waves on Cross-Border Collaboration in the Field of Emergency Medical Services and Interhospital Transports in the Euregio-Meuse-Rhine: A Qualitative Review of Expert Opinions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

These malignancies account for 0.1 to 1% of gastric malignancies. When small cell is found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the stomach is the least common site of presentation. If symptoms are present, it is usually epigastric pain or dysphagia. Herein, is a case of this rare carcinoma. Case Description/Methods: The patient is a 55-year-old male with no reported medical history who developed abdominal pain early in 2020 but did not seek treatment due to the ongoing Covid pandemic. He continued to have symptoms and eventually went to an outside hospital where he was admitted for his newly diagnosed anemia. A computed topography (CT) scan showed fluid within a non-distended stomach and gastric wall thickening. He underwent an initial EGD which showed an ulcerated mass (Figure 1A, 1C);biopsies were unremarkable. Due to high suspicion for malignancy, he underwent a repeat EGD with biopsies that showed malignancy favoring lymphoma. Positron emission topography (PET) scan revealed disease in the medial and posterior aspects of the upper stomach. Ultimately, he underwent a third EGD to obtain additional diagnostic material for ancillary testing. Pathology showed small cell neuroendocrine tumor (Figures 1B and 1D). He was referred for surgical evaluation and had extensive surgical resection including the left lobe of liver, small bowel and stomach followed by chemotherapy. He is currently doing well. Discussion: Small cell carcinoma is a rare carcinoma, specifically with the primary site in the stomach. When it is found, it is often misdiagnosed until the time of surgical resection. In this case, initially pathology favored lymphoma. It was not until the third EGD, that the correct diagnosis was made. This patient delayed seeking care due to the Covid pandemic, which delayed his diagnosis and subsequent treatment by several months..","output":"A rare case of gastric small cell carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has brought the world to a standstill, impacting negatively on human mortality and morbidity. Currently, most countries are on a national lockdown as a way of curbing the rapid spread of the virus.

The participating staff recommended five key strategies that were thematically analysed, which are as follows: a) improved communication;b) provision of efficient ICT infrastructure;c) consideration of compensatory academic measures;d) on-campus COVID-19 risk management strategy;and e) provision of online and on-campus psychological services. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the historically disadvantaged universities should consider implementing strategies for enhancing the staff's wellbeing and administration of academic activities. However, whether the suggested strategies could yield positive results, post-implementation evaluation research may be needed.

Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is especially critical to protect vulnerable populations who require frequent interactions with caretakers. Rapid COVID-19 tests have been proposed as an attractive strategy for surveillance, however a limitation of most rapid tests is their low sensitivity. Low-sensitivity tests are comparable to high sensitivity tests in detecting early infections when two assumptions are met: (1) viral load rises quickly (within hours) after infection and (2) viral load reaches and sustains high levels (>10(5)C10(6) RNA copies/mL). However, there are no human data testing these assumptions. In this study, we document a case of presymptomatic household transmission from a healthy young adult to a sibling and a parent. Participants prospectively provided twice-daily saliva samples. Samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR and we measured the complete viral load profiles throughout the course of infection of the sibling and parent. This study provides evidence that in at least some human cases of SARS-CoV-2, viral load rises slowly (over days, not hours) and not to such high levels to be detectable reliably by any low-sensitivity test.

The mass media coverage and widespread eruption of illnesses have been associated with adverse mental health outcomes.1 Cancer patients represent an already-compromised population with elevated levels of anxiety and distress; the introduction of the COVID-19 pandemic places this vulnerable group at an even higher risk for mental health consequences. The purpose of this quality improvement initiative was to identify lung cancer patients in our care who demonstrated increased levels of anxiety and distress directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic and to facilitate the acquisition of appropriate care to address their mental health needs. This initiative was designed to aid in the reduction of stress and anxiety in an already burdened population. Methods: The sample included 441 patients undergoing treatment for or surveillance of lung cancer who were screened from April 2020 to July 2020 through the Lung Cancer Evaluation Center. Using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer, patients were called and asked a series of questions regarding their distress levels in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NCCN tool uses a numeric scale from 0 to 10 to quantify level of distress, with 0 representing no distress and 10 indicating severe distress. Any patient scoring a 6 or greater was referred to the cancer center social worker. The social worker evaluated the patients' needs and formulated a plan. Any patient who reported a distress level between 3 and 5 was counseled by the nurse practitioner to evaluate further needs. Patients reported reasons for distress as fear of delayed testing, contracting the virus, and changes in their lifestyle (not seeing family, isolation, etc.). Results: We found that screening all patients during the pandemic yielded a higher than normal percentage of individuals who were in need of some level of mental health services. Cancer patients, particularly lung cancer patients, have increased fear due to the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. After completion of this quality improvement initiative, we have incorporated distress assessment and triage protocols into our practice for all patients. Importance and Implications: Patients with underlying medical conditions including cancer know that they are at increased risk of complications from the COVID-19 virus. This may cause them increased anxiety, distress, and fear. Screening this population with phone calls can effectively identify patients at risk, and with the implementation of this initiative, we can ensure that those who feel isolated or experience heightened levels of distress receive the appropriate care they need.","output":"An Assessment of Distress Levels of Patients Undergoing Lung Cancer Treatment and Surveillance During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We seek to evaluate the detection performance of a rapid primary screening tool of Covid-19 solely based on the cough sound from 8,380 clinically validated samples with laboratory molecular-test (2,339 Covid-19 positives and 6,041 Covid-19 negatives).

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive placebo, 2.4 g of REGN-COV2, or 8.0 g of REGN-COV2 and were prospectively characterized at baseline for endogenous immune response against SARS-CoV-2 (serum antibody-positive or serum antibody-negative). Key end points included the time-weighted average change in viral load from baseline (day 1) through day 7 and the percentage of patients with at least one Covid-19-related medically attended visit through day 29. Safety was assessed in all patients. RESULTS: Data from 275 patients are reported. The least-squares mean difference (combined REGN-COV2 dose groups vs. placebo group) in the time-weighted average change in viral load from day 1 through day 7 was -0.56 log10 copies per milliliter (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.02 to -0.11) among patients who were serum antibody-negative at baseline and -0.41 log10 copies per milliliter (95% CI, -0.71 to -0.10) in the overall trial population. In the overall trial population, 6% of the patients in the placebo group and 3% of the patients in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups reported at least one medically attended visit; among patients who were serum antibody-negative at baseline, the corresponding percentages were 15% and 6% (difference, -9 percentage points; 95% CI, -29 to 11). The percentages of patients with hypersensitivity reactions, infusion-related reactions, and other adverse events were similar in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups and the placebo group.

Importantly, inhibition of contact activation also prevented death from S. aureus-induced lethal systemic inflammatory response syndrome in nonhuman primates. The contact system is likely dispensable for hemostasis, and may not be needed for host immunity, suggesting it to be a reasonably safe target that will not result in immunosuppression or bleeding.

Indigo-dyed textiles were widely traded along the legendary Silk Road that linked China to Europe. Today, due to the labor-intensive nature of indigo extraction at the household level, lifestyle changes and the widespread availability of commercially produced indigo paste, traditional indigo extraction methods have declined in villages. Yet Li textile weavers on Hainan Island are internationally recognized as producers of indigo-dyed textile using warp ikat techniques. In contrast, Hainan Miao weavers produce indigo-dyed textiles using batik (wax resist) techniques. The aim of this study was to document the indigenous knowledge on indigo-yielding plant species used by both Hainan Miao and Li people on Hainan Island, China. METHOD: Ethnic uses were documented during three field surveys, through a questionnaire survey of 193 respondents, comprising 144 Hainan Miao and 49 Li traditional dyers. Mention index (QI), Availability index (AI), and Preference ranking (PR) of each indigo-yielding plant species were calculated to screen out plant resources with potential development value. RESULTS: Five indigo-yielding plant species (from four plant families and four genera) were historically used by Hainan Miao and Li dyers. However, just four species are still in use. Strobilanthes cusia was the main indigo source for Hainan Miao dyers. Li dyers also commonly use Indigofera species (I. tinctoria and I. suffruticosa) for indigo extraction. Wrightia laevis is less commonly used as a contemporary indigo source. Indigo extraction by steeping in water to which lime is added to increase the pH is sharing by the five indigo-yielding plant species. Strobilanthes cusia had the highest QI, AI and PR values in Hainan Miao villages. Indigofera tinctoria had the highest QI and AI values, but Indigofera suffruticosa was preferred by Li dyers. CONCLUSION: In the process of modernization and urbanization, some Hainan Miao and Li dyers retain the traditional indigo extraction methods. We found that Strobilanthes cusia and Indigofera tinctoria have the most potential for sustainable indigo production in the future. Furthermore, this study documents the details of extraction method from Wrightia laevis for the first time and the use of Ricinus communis seeds in that process.

Primary human lung cells are physiologically relevant but cannot be cultured in vitro long term and, although engineered organoids are an attractive choice, they do not phenotypically recapitulate the lung parenchyma; overall, these models do not allow for the generation of reliable disease models. Recently, we described a new cell culture platform based on H441 cells that are grown at the air-liquid interface to produce the SALI culture model, for studying and correcting the rare interstitial lung disease surfactant protein B (SPB) deficiency. Here, we report the characterization of the effects of SALI culture conditions on the transcriptional profile of the constituent H441 cells. We further analyze the transcriptomics of the model in the context of surfactant metabolism and the disease phenotype through SFTPB knockout SALI cultures. By comparing the gene expression profile of SALI cultures with that of human lung parenchyma obtained via single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that SALI cultures are remarkably similar to human alveolar type II cells, implying clinical relevance of the SALI culture platform as a non-diseased human lung alveolar cell model.","output":"RNA-seq analysis of the human surfactant air-liquid interface culture reveals alveolar type II cell-like transcriptome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Deaths by COVID-19 have left behind nearly 12 million recent bereaved individuals worldwide and researchers have raised concerns that the circumstances of COVID-19 related deaths will lead to a rise prevalence of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) cases. However, to date, no studies have examined the prevalence of PGD among people bereaved due to COVID-19. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of PGD and investigated demographic and loss-related factors associated with prolonged grief symptoms among Chinese individuals bereaved due to COVID-19. Methods: : This was a cross-sectional online survey conducted between September 1 and October 3, 2020. A total of 422 Chinese participants (55.5% males;32.73 [9.31] years old) who lost a close person due to COVID-19 participated in the study. Demographic and loss-related information was collected, and self-reported prolonged grief symptoms were measured by a 13-item International Prolonged Grief Disorder Scale (IPGDS: 1C65) and a 17-item Traumatic Grief Inventory Self Report (TGI-SR: 1C85). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the associated factors of levels of grief symptoms. Results: : Prevalence of PGD was 37.8% screened by IPGDS and 29.3% by TGI-SR. No difference was found in levels of grief symptoms between participants whose close one died more than 6 months ago and those who experienced the loss less than 6 months ago. More severe prolonged grief symptoms assessed by IPGDS was associated with losing a close person by COVID-19 rather than complications (B: 5.35;95% CI: 0.54C10.05), losing a partner (B: 7.80;95% CI: 3.24C12.37), child (B: 8.15;95% CI: 1.03C15.26), and parent (B: 5.49;95% CI: 1.49C9.48) rather than losing a relative or a person with other relationship, feeling more traumatic about the loss (B: 1.71;95% CI: 0.52C2.90), being closer with the deceased (B: 1.60;95% CI: 0.34C2.86).

METHODS A systematic search of electronic databases and grey literature was undertaken from August 2018 to October 2018. Studies were included if participants (cancer survivors) were over 18 years of age and had received a TS, and if outcomes for TS could be separated from other survivorship interventions.

RESULTS Seven studies (one prospective cohort and six cross-sectional studies) met the inclusion criteria. The impact of TS was assessed using widely varied outcomes in these studies. Overall, receipt of a TS was related to greater patient understanding and perception of the quality of care provided.

In this study, we investigated the effects of cocaine on a special subtype of neuronal nAChR, (3)(4)-nAChR expressed in native SH-SY5Y cells. (3)(4)-nAChR-mediated currents were recorded using whole-cell recordings. Drugs were applied using a computer-controlled U-tube drug perfusion system. We showed that bath application of nicotine induced inward currents in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC(50) value of 20 M. Pre-treatment with cocaine concentration-dependently inhibited nicotine-induced current with an IC(50) of 1.5 M. Kinetic analysis showed that cocaine accelerated (3)(4)-nAChR desensitization, which caused a reduction of the amplitude of nicotine-induced currents. Co-application of nicotine and cocaine (1.5 M) depressed the maximum response on the nicotine concentration-response curve without changing the EC(50) value, suggesting a non-competitive mechanism. The cocaine-induced inhibition of nicotine response exhibited both voltage- and use-dependence, suggesting an open-channel blocking mechanism. Furthermore, intracellular application of GDP-S (via recording electrode) did not affect cocaine-induced inhibition, suggesting that cocaine did not alter receptor internalization. Moreover, intracellular application of cocaine (30 M) failed to alter the nicotine response. Finally, cocaine (1.5 M) was unable to inhibit the nicotine-induced inward current in heterologous expressed (6)/(3)(2)(3)-nAChRs and (4)(2)-nAChRs expressed in human SH-EP1 cells. Collectively, our results suggest that cocaine is a potent blocker for native (3)(4)-nAChRs expressed in SH-SY5Y cells.","output":"Cocaine potently blocks neuronal (3)(4) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in SH-SY5Y cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we present data on the proteome of human neuroblastoma cells stably overexpressing Neuroglobin (NGB).

This study intends to gather the available evidence with respect to diagnosing NTM cervicofacial lymphadenitis. METHODS A review protocol was developed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)-statement (www.prisma-statement.org). A comprehensive search was performed in the bibliographic databases PubMed, Embase.com and Wiley/Cochrane Library. 10 Articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Assessing risk of bias of the articles was done using the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy (QUADAS-2) tool. RESULTS This systematic review shows that diagnostic studies of high methodological quality are scarce. Diagnostic accuracy of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, skin testing, auramine staining, Ziehl-Neelsen staining, and immunodiagnostic assays was studied. Culture sensitivity proved to be 41,8%, while polymerase chain reaction has a sensitivity of 71,6%. Both methods showed a specificity of 100%. Sensitivity of Immunodiagnostic assays ranged between 87,5% and 100% and specificity between 81% and 100%. Overall sensitivity of skin tests containing purified protein derivative (PPD-S) was 70% (95% CI [62%-78%]) with an overall specificity of 94% (95% CI [88%-100%]). CONCLUSIONS In patients with a high clinical suspicion for NTM cervicofacial lymphadenitis, a positive PPD-S skin is indicative for the diagnosis of NTM cervicofacial lymphadenitis. Either PCR or culture is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Interferon- release assays with purified protein derivative stimulation appear to provide good sensitivity and specificity as a non-invasive pre-operative test, but the evidence is weak.

However, household person-to-person transmission studies are limited. Households participating in an ongoing cohort study of influenza incidence and prevalence in rural Egypt were followed. Baseline enrollment was done from August 2015 to March 2017. The study protocol was amended in April 2020 to allow COVID-19 incidence and seroprevalence studies. A total of 290 households including 1598 participants were enrolled and followed from April to October 2020 in four study sites. When a participant showed respiratory illness symptoms, a serum sample and a nasal and an oropharyngeal swab were obtained. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. If positive, the subject was followed and swabs collected on days three, six, nine, and 14 after the first swab day and a serum sample obtained on day 14. All subjects residing with the index case were swabbed following the same sampling schedule. Sera were collected from cohort participants in October 2020 to assess seroprevalence. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR. Sera were tested by Microneutralization Assay to measure the neutralizing antibody titer. Incidence of COVID-19, household secondary attack rate, and seroprevalence in the cohort were determined. The incidence of COVID-19 was 6.9% and the household secondary attack rate was 89.8%. Transmission within households occurred within two-days of confirming the index case. Infections were asymptomatic or mild with symptoms resolving within 10 days. The majority developed a neutralizing antibody titer by day 14 post onset. The overall seroprevalence among cohort participants was 34.8%. These results suggest that within-household transmission is high in Egypt. Asymptomatic or mild illness is common.

Using a sample of 1,168 participants engaged in multiple industries in China, we identified three profiles of inclusion, with a largest proportion feeling a moderate level of inclusion (69.5%), a smaller proportion feeling a high level of inclusion (22.7%), and a tiny proportion feeling a low level of inclusion (7.8%). The three profiles differ significantly on key variables, demonstrating that the group feeling more included tends to be more aged and tenured, hold a higher educational degree, work in the high-tech sector, and come from a developed area. Such a group also shows more engagement in their work but less exhaustion, feels that they have more opportunities for development, and gains more support from colleagues and supervisors.

Urbanized estuaries often experience eutrophication under strong anthropogenic activities. Eutrophication can enhance phytoplankton abundance, leading to carbon dioxide (CO2) consumption in the water column. Only a few studies have evaluated the relationship between GHGs and eutrophication in estuaries. Here we assessed the concentrations and fluxes of CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in combination with a suite of biogeochemical variables in four sampling campaigns over two years in a highly urbanized tropical estuary in Southeast Asia (the Saigon River Estuary, Vietnam). The impact of eutrophication on GHGs was evaluated through several statistical methods and interpreted by biological processes. The average concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O at the Saigon River in 2019-2020 were 3174a?a?1725a?gC-CO2 L-1, 5.9a?a?16.8a?gC-CH4 L-1 and 3.0a?a?4.8a?gN-N2O L-1, respectively. Their concentrations were 13-18 times, 52-332 times, and 9-37 times higher than the global mean concentrations of GHGs, respectively. While CO2 concentration had no clear seasonal pattern, N2O and CH4 concentrations significantly differed between the dry and the rainy seasons. The increase in eutrophication status along the dense urban area was linearly correlated with the increase in GHGs concentrations. The presence of both nitrification and denitrification resulted in elevated N2O concentrations in this urban area of the estuary. The high concentration of CO2 was contributed by the high concentration of organic carbon and mineralization process. GHGs fluxes at the Saigon River Estuary were comparable to other urbanized estuaries regardless of climatic condition. Control of eutrophication in urbanized estuaries through the implantation of efficient wastewater treatment facilities will be an effective solution in mitigating the global warming potential caused by estuarine emissions.","output":"Does eutrophication enhance greenhouse gas emissions in urbanized tropical estuaries?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microelectronic devices with reconfigurable three-dimensional (3D) microarchitecture that can be repetitively switched among different geometrical and/or working states have promising applications in widespread areas.

Different antagonistic strategies have been identified, and the mechanism by which PEDV infection impairs the production of interferon (IFN) and delays the activation of the IFN response to escape host innate immunity has been determined, but the pathogenic mechanisms of PEDV infection remain enigmatic. Our preliminary results revealed that endogenous F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBXW7), the substrate recognition component of the SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is downregulated in PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells, according to the results from an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analysis. Overexpression of FBXW7 in target cells makes them more resistant to PEDV infection, whereas ablation of FBXW7 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly promotes PEDV infection. In addition, FBXW7 was verified as an innate antiviral factor capable of enhancing the expression of RIG-I and TBK1, and it was found to induce interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which led to an elevated antiviral state of the host cells. Moreover, we revealed that PEDV nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) interacts with FBXW7 and targets FBXW7 for degradation through the K48-linked ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Consistent with the results proven in vitro, FBXW7 reduction was also confirmed in different intestinal tissues from PEDV-infected specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs. Taken together, the data indicated that PEDV has evolved with a distinct antagonistic strategy to circumvent the host antiviral response by targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of FBXW7. Our findings provide novel insights into PEDV infection and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE To counteract the host antiviral defenses, most viruses, including coronaviruses, have evolved with diverse strategies to dampen host IFN-mediated antiviral response, wither by interfering with or evading specific host regulators at multiple steps of this response. In this study, a novel antagonistic strategy was revealed showing that PEDV infection could circumvent the host innate response by targeted degradation of endogenous FBXW7 in target cells, a process that was verified to be a positive modulator for the host innate immune system. Degradation of FBXW7 hampers host innate antiviral activation and facilitates PEDV replication.

Results In 2020, 55 % of the scheduled procedures were deferred, which was 11 times higher than in 2019; the main reasons were directly related to COVID-19.

Sepsis and hypovolemia are the 2 most frequent etiologies of AKI in intensive care units and frequently coexist in critically ill patients. Effective fluid resuscitation is crucial for the stabilization of sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion or septic shock. However, the lack of a goal-directed therapy targeting kidney oxygenation prevents from optimization of the fluid therapy with regard to improvement of renal oxygen delivery and extraction. Similarly, fluid administration as all therapeutic actions carries adverse effects such as the activation of cytokines, disruption of the capillary glycocalyx, and adverse effects on kidney metabolism and oxygenation. Moreover, a positive fluid balance is associated with an increased risk of AKI and is a negative predictor for recovery of renal function. The role of fluid resuscitation on kidney injury stems from the high renal vulnerability to hypoxemic injury. Indeed, fluids have a poor oxygen solubility and hemodilution decreases blood viscosity both promoting intrarenal shunting and heterogeneity with a decreased capillary density and enhanced intrarenal cortex and medullary hypoxia.

METHODS: In this prospective, single-center study, we enrolled ambulatory outpatients with COVID-19 confirmed by a molecular method who received hydroxychloroquine. The patients were divided into low- and moderate-risk groups based on the Tisdale risk score for drug-associated QT prolongation, and the QT interval was corrected for heart rate using the Bazett formula (QTc). The QTc interval was measured by electrocardiography both pretreatment (QTc1) and 4 h after the administration of hydroxychloroquine (QTc2). The difference between the QTc1 and QTc2 intervals was defined as the &#916;QTc. The QTc1 and QTc2 intervals and &#916;QTc values were compared between the two risk groups. RESULTS: The median and interquartile range (IQR) age of the patients was 47.0 (36.2-62) years, and there were 78 men and 74 women. The median (IQR) QTc1 interval lengthened from 425.0 (407.2-425.0) to 430.0 (QTc2; 412.0-443.0) milliseconds (ms). However, this was not considered an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia associated with a prolonged QTc interval requiring drug discontinuation, because none of the patients had a &#916;QTc of >60 ms or a QTc2 of >500 ms. Moreover, the median (quartiles; minimum-maximum) &#916;QTc value was higher in patients in the moderate-risk group than those in the low-risk group (10.0 [-4.0-18.0; -75.0-51.0] vs. 7.0 [-10.5-23.5; -53.0-59.0 ms]) (p = 0.996).

Here we present key position statements including observations about the pathophysiology of (ARF). In terms of the pathophysiology of pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 can be divided into 3 phases. Pulmonary damage in advanced COVID-19 often differs from the known changes in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Two types (type L and type H) are differentiated, corresponding to early- and late-stage lung damage. This differentiation should be taken into consideration in the respiratory support of ARF. The assessment of the extent of ARF should be based on arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions, and it needs to include the calculation of oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, hemoglobin level, the corrected values of Hfner's factor, and cardiac output). Aerosols can cause transmission of infectious, virus-laden particles. Open systems or vented systems can increase the release of respirable particles. Procedures in which the invasive ventilation system must be opened and endotracheal intubation carried out are associated with an increased risk of infection. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should have top priority because fear of contagion should not be a primary reason for intubation. Based on the current knowledge, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow therapy (NHF), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can be performed without an increased risk of infection to staff if PPE is provided. A significant proportion of patients with ARF present with relevant hypoxemia, which often cannot be fully corrected, even with a high inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) under NHF. In this situation, the oxygen therapy can be escalated to CPAP or NIV when the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not met. In ARF, NIV should be carried out in an intensive care unit or a comparable setting by experienced staff. Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly. For this reason, continuous monitoring and readiness for intubation are to be ensured at all times. If the ARF progresses under CPAP/NIV, intubation should be implemented without delay in patients who do not have a \\"do not intubate\\" order.","output":"Position Paper for the State-of-the-Art Application of Respiratory Support in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM) was constructed containing 11 SARS-CoV-2, 5 SARS-1, 5 MERS, and 12 seasonal coronavirus recombinant proteins.

The tool is based on available knowledge of different wildlife taxa traded in the Asia-Pacific Region and known to carry highly virulent and transmissible viruses combined with relative risks associated with different broad categories of market types and trade chains.","output":"A tool for rapid assessment of wildlife markets in the Asia-Pacific Region for risk of future zoonotic disease outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in the long term is fundamental to achieve better outcomes. However, most patients may find it difficult to maintain healthy lifestyle behavior after ambulatory CR program. We aimed to investigate the feasibility on remote CR support program (Remote-CR) in older patients with cardiac disease. METHODS: Between October 2020 and February 2021, we enrolled older patients with cardiac disease after at least over 5 months of ambulatory CR program. The study was conducted as a randomized controlled case series to compare Remote-CR vs. center-based CR (CB-CR) after ambulatory CR in older patients with cardiac disease. The core component of Remote-CR is a web application, which evaluates vital sign and receives feedback through real-time video consultation once a week. We evaluated the satisfaction of Remote-CR, and impact of Remote-CR on adherence to exercise and physical activity management. Moreover, we assessed the change in functional status using handgrip strength, usual gait speed, short physical performance battery (SPPB), and Kihon checklist (KCL) before the intervention, at the end of the 4-week intervention, and cardiovascular-related hospital discharge within 6 months after completion of ambulatory CR. RESULTS: Eleven patients were enrolled (six for Remote-CR and five for CB-CR). All participants completed the intervention without serious adverse event in each group. After the on-site initial remote system set up, all the patients completed the Remote-CR session without on-site assistance. Patients satisfaction with Remote-CR was generally high. Remote-CR helps to maintain healthy lifestyle behavior. In addition, Remote-CR and CB-CR seem to be equally successful in maintaining functional status and preventing cardiovascular-related hospital readmission. CONCLUSIONS: This trial suggested the Remote-CR comprising a hybrid of information and communication technology and strategy for health behavior change may be a feasible and safe intervention option in selected older patients with cardiac disease after completion of ambulatory CR.","output":"Remote Cardiac Rehabilitation in Older Cardiac Disease: A Randomized Case Series Feasibility Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Melancholy in the elderly in times of COVID-19","output":"Melancholie bij ouderen in tijden van COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The application of nanomedicines is increasing rapidly with the promise of targeted and efficient drug delivery. Nanomedicines address the shortcomings of conventional therapy, as evidenced by several preclinical and clinical investigations indicating site-specific drug delivery, reduced side effects, and better treatment outcome. The development of suitable and biocompatible drug delivery vehicles is a prerequisite that has been successfully achieved by using simple and functionalized liposomes, nanoparticles, hydrogels, micelles, dendrimers, and mesoporous particles. A variety of drug delivery vehicles have been established for the targeted and controlled delivery of therapeutic agents in a wide range of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia, asthma, pulmonary tuberculosis, Parkinsons disease, and Alzheimers disease. After successful outcomes in preclinical and clinical trials, many of these drugs have been marketed for human use, such as Abraxane?, Caelyx?, Mepact?, Myocet?, Emend?, and Rapamune?. Apart from drugs/compounds, novel therapeutic agents, such as peptides, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), and genes have also shown potential to be used as nanomedicines for the treatment of several chronic ailments. However, a large number of extensive clinical trials are still needed to ensure the short-term and long-term effects of nanomedicines in humans.

This study aimed to determine the clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with Covid-19. METHODS In this retrospective analysis from five hospitals, we included pregnant women with Covid-19 from January 1 to February 20, 2020. The primary composite endpoints were admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary endpoints included the clinical severity of Covid-19, neonatal mortality, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of pregnant women and newborns. RESULTS Thirty-three pregnant women with Covid-19 and 28 newborns were identified. One (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. No pregnant women admitted to the ICU. There were no moralities among pregnant women or newborns. The percentages of pregnant women with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms were 13 (39.4%),19(57.6%), and 1(3%). One (3.6%) newborn developed ARDS and was admitted to the NICU. The rate of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.6%. CONCLUSIONS This report suggests that pregnant women are not at increased risk for severe illness or mortality with Covid-19 compared with the general population.

Identifying the culprit drug is essential; however, despite numerous methods being published, there are no consensus guidelines. Objectives: Conduct a scoping review to identify all published methods of culprit drug identification for cutaneous drug eruptions, compare the methods, and generate hypotheses for future causality assessment studies. Eligibility criteria: Peer-reviewed publications involving culprit drug identification methods. Sources of evidence: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Charting methods: Registered PRISMA-ScR format protocol on Open Science Forum. Results: In total, 135 publications were included comprising 656,635 adverse drug events, most of which were cutaneous. There were 54 methods of culprit drug identification published, categorized as algorithms, probabilistic approaches, and expert judgment. Algorithms had higher sensitivity and positive predictive value, but lower specificity and negative predictive value. Probabilistic approaches had lower sensitivity and positive predictive value, but higher specificity and negative predictive value. Expert judgment was subjective, less reproducible, but the most frequently used to validate other methods. Studies suggest that greater accuracy may be achieved by specifically assessing cutaneous drug eruptions and using combinations of causality assessment categories. Conclusions: Culprit drug identification for adverse drug reactions remains a challenge. Many methods have been published, but there are no consensus guidelines. Using causality assessment methods specifically for cutaneous drug eruptions and combining aspects of the different causality assessment categories may improve efficacy.

Here, we characterize the oral mycobiome, including mycobiome-bacteriome interactions, in the setting of remission-induction chemotherapy (RIC) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Oral samples (n = 299) were prospectively collected twice weekly from 39 AML patients during RIC until neutrophil recovery. Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene (V4) and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequencing were used to determine bacterial and fungal diversity and community composition. Intrakingdom and interkingdom network connectivity at baseline (T1) and at midpoint (T3) and a later time point (T6) were assessed via SPIEC-EASI (sparse inverse covariance estimation for ecological association inference). In this exploratory study, mycobiome -diversity was not significantly associated with antibiotic or antifungal receipt. However, postchemotherapy mycobiome -diversity was lower in subjects receiving high-intensity chemotherapy. Additionally, greater decreases in Malassezia levels were seen over time among patients on high-intensity RIC compared to low-intensity RIC (P = 0.003). A significantly higher relative abundance of Candida was found among patients who had infection (P = 0.008), while a significantly higher relative abundance of Fusarium was found among patients who did not get an infection (P = 0.03). Analyses of intrakingdom and interkingdom relationships at T1, T3, and T6 indicated that interkingdom connectivity increased over the course of IC as bacterial -diversity diminished. In (to our knowledge) the first longitudinal mycobiome study performed during AML RIC, we found that mycobiome-bacteriome interactions are highly dynamic. Our study data suggest that inclusion of mycobiome analysis in the design of microbiome studies may be necessary to optimally understand the ecological and functional role of microbial communities in clinical outcomes.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Siblings of children with congenital heart disease aged 8C17 years old were interviewed via video call technology between September 2020 and February 2021. We conducted reflexive thematic analysis of these interviews to generate themes. FINDINGS: Interviews took place with 17 siblings, predominantly of white ethnicity n = 15 (86%). Most siblings interviewed were first born in the family n = 15 (88%), and most children with CHD were the youngest n = 15(88%). Four themes were generated; My sibling is vulnerable, what does this mean for my family, I have a responsibility to protect my brother or sister, our family time during the pandemic and adjustment and adaptations to pandemic life. CONCLUSIONS: Siblings identified difficult aspects of the pandemic and these related to concerns about their brother's or sister's vulnerability, family impact, and keeping their sibling safe. They also identified adjustments they made to keep their family functioning throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the worry and uncertainty siblings experienced, they valued increased family cohesion which helped to mitigate some challenges of the restrictions imposed in the UK.

This study aimed to provide quantitative data towards an effective risk-to-benefit analysis for the justification of radiological studies in COVID-19 diagnosis to guide policy and decision makers. Methods: . The analysis was performed in terms of mortality rate per age group. COVID-19 mortality was extracted from epidemiological data across 159,107 patients in Italy. For radiological risk, the study considered 659 Chest-CT performed in adult patients. Organ doses were estimated using a Monte Carlo method and then used to calculate the Risk Index that was converted into a related 5-year mortality rate (SEER, NCI). Results: . COVID-19 mortality showed a rapid rise for ages >30 years old (min:0.30%;max:30.20%), whereas only 1 death was reported in the analyzed patient cohort for ages <20 years old. The rates decreased for radiation risk across age groups. The median mortality rate across all ages for Chest-CT and Chest-Radiography were 0.72% (min:0.46%;max:1.10%) and 0.03% (min:0.02%;max:0.04%), respectively. Conclusions: . COVID-19, Chest-Radiography, and Chest-CT mortality rates showed different magnitudes and trends across age groups. In higher ages, COVID-19 risk far outweighs that of radiological exams. Based on risk comparison alone, Chest-Radiography and Chest-CT for COVID-19 care is justified for patients older than 30 and 50 years old, respectively.","output":"A comparison of COVID-19 and imaging radiation risk in clinical patient populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The newly designed polythiophene chemosensors (PT1 and PT2) were synthesized via the SuzukiCMiyaura polymerization with appropriate yields.

Displacement was calculated by subtracting CT1 fracture displacement from CT2 displacement for each rib. Given anatomic and clinical characteristics, ribs were grouped (1C2, 3C6, 7C10, 11C12), averaged, and analyzed for displacement. Secondary outcome included number of missed RF on CT1. Non-parametric sign test and paired t test were used for analysis. Significance was set at p < 0.002. RESULTS: 78 of 477 patients with RF on CT1 had CT2 during the study period: primarily male (76%) and age 55.8  20.1 with blunt mechanism of injury (99%). Median Injury Severity Score was 21 (IQR, 13C27) with Chest Abbreviated Injury Score of 3 (IQR, 3C4). Median time between CT1 and CT2 was 6 days (IQR, 3C12). Missed RF rate for CT1 was 10.1% (p = 0.11). Average fracture displacement was significantly increased for all rib groupings except 11C12 in all planes (p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: RF become more displaced over time. Pain regimens and SSRF considerations should be adjusted accordingly.","output":"Rib fracture displacement worsens over time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This qualitative investigation, inspired by a social media post on a Facebook group devoted to pandemic pedagogy and the storm of responses from educators, proposes a new theoretical approach to the persistent problem of plagiarism Integrative Social Contract Theory describes the formal and informal social contracts embedded in understandings of academic integrity and plagiarism Although the COVID-19 crisis has elevated the issue of plagiarism through social isolation and forced distanced learning, the findings of this piece persist beyond the current situation and reaffirm that ensuring all those engaging in academic work hold the same norms to validate the social contract","output":"COVID-19 Elevating the Problem of Plagiarism: The Implied Social Contract of Academic Integrity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe four SARS-CoV-2 re-infections with a B.1.351 variant in 2021, in healthcare workers (HCWs) previously infected in 2020, before detection of this variant in Europe.

STUDY DESIGN Systematic search of randomized and nonrandomized studies assessing early mobilization-based physical therapy in critically ill children under 18 years of age in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, the National Institutes of Health, Evidence in Pediatric Intensive Care Collaborative, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, and the Mobilization-Network. We extracted data to identify the types of mobility-based interventions and definitions for early, as well as barriers, feasibility, adverse events, and efficacy outcomes (mortality, morbidities, and length of stay). RESULTS Of 1199 titles found, we included 11 studies (2 pilot trials and 9 observational studies) and 1 clinical practice guideline in the analyses. Neurodevelopmentally appropriate increasing mobility levels have been described for critically ill children, and \\"early\\" mobilization was defined as either a range (within 48-72 hours) from admission to the pediatric intensive care unit or when clinical safety criteria are met. Current evidence suggests that early mobilization is safe and feasible and institutional practice guidelines significantly increase the frequency of rehabilitation consults, improve the proportion of patients who receive early mobilization, and reduce the time to mobilization. However, there were inconsistencies in populations and interventions across studies, and imprecision and risk of bias in included studies that precluded us from pooling data to evaluate the efficacy outcomes of early mobilization. CONCLUSIONS The definition of early mobilization varies, but seems to be feasible and safe in critically ill children.

Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the full-length VP1 of 19 CVA9 isolates was 906 bases encoding 302 amino acids. The combination of the thresholds of the phylogenetic tree and nucleotide divergence of different genotypes within the same serotype led to a value of 15-25%, and enabled CVA9 worldwide to be categorized into ten genotypes: A-J. The phylogenetic tree showed that the prototype strain was included in genotype A, and that the B, C, D, E, H, and J genotypes disappeared during virus evolution, whereas the F, I, and G genotypes showed co-circulation. Lineage G was the dominant genotype of CVA9 and included most of the strains from nine countries in Asia, North America, Oceania, and Europe. Most Chinese strains belonged to the G genotype, suggesting that the molecular epidemiology of China is consistent with that observed worldwide. The 165 partial VP1 strains (723 nt) showed a mean substitution rate of 3.27  10-3 substitution/site/year (95% HPD range 2.93-3.6  10-3), dating the tMRCA of CVA9 back to approximately 1922 (1911-1932).

Social workers are working at the front lines responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in a variety of health care practice settings, including nursing homes, however it is unclear how social workers perceive their preparedness during this time. METHODS: This study employed a cross-sectional survey to nursing home social workers via social media on feelings of preparedness for COVID-19, what has been most professionally helpful for social workers during these times in their role in COVID-19, as well as demographic questions. Demographic data were analyzed using SPSS and qualitative data were analyzed using the rigorous and accelerated data reduction (RADaR) technique. RESULTS: Data are based on a sample of 63 (N=63) nursing home social workers. Findings revealed that while some social workers felt prepared for the coronavirus, many respondents stated that they were unprepared to meet the demands and challenges they were facing. Moreover, participants shared that professional support was critically important to get through COVID-19. DISCUSSION: These findings are important, as social workers are tasked with ensuring each resident attains their highest level of psychosocial well-being, which can be achieved only when nursing home staff are supported. Findings from the present study suggest that additional support for nursing home staff ought to include peer mentoring and mutual support.

PROCEDURES: Twenty-seven patients (29 imaging studies) with diagnosed or suspected liver malignancies who underwent [(68) Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT, liver PET/MRI, and [(18)F]FDG PET/CT between September 2020 and June 2021 were retrospectively analysed. MRI findings were used as the reference standard for diagnosis. RESULTS: The 27 patients had a median age of 68 years (interquartile range: 60C74 years; 21 men). Primary intrahepatic tumours were reported in 13 patients (15 imaging studies) with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and in 14 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). All intrahepatic lesions detectable on MRI were also detected on [(68) Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT giving a sensitivity of 100% (19/19), whereas the sensitivity of [(18)F]FDG PET/CT was 58% (11/19). All intrahepatic lesions were detected on [(68) Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT, on which they showed higher activity (median SUVmax: 15.61 vs. 5.17; P < .001) and higher target-to-background ratio (TBR; median, 15.90 vs. 1.69, P < .001) than on [(18)F]FDG, especially in patients with CCA (median TBR, 21.08 vs. 1.47, respectively; P < .001). The uptake positivity rate in regional node metastasis was 100% (12/12) on [(68) Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT compared with 58% (7/12) on [(18)F]FDG PET/CT. All patients with distant metastasis (100%, 14/14) were detected on both [(18)F]FDG and [(68) Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT imaging, although more distant metastatic lesions were detected on [(68) Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT than on [(18)F]FDG (96% (42/44) vs. 89% (39/44), respectively).

Studies were meta-analyzed for mortality by the subgroups of ICU status and statin usage before and after COVID-19 hospitalization. Studies reporting an odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Thirteen cohorts, reporting on 110,078 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Individuals who used statins before their COVID-19 hospitalization showed a similar risk of mortality, compared to those who did not use statins (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.28; OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.03).

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study involved 549 older patients undergoing their third cleavage-stage embryo or blastocyst transfer over a 5-year period (January 2015CDecember 2020) at Northwest Womens and Childrens Hospital after in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles. Patients with known endometriosis or adenomyosis were excluded from the study. The patients were divided into three groups according to the endometrial preparation protocol: the natural cycle (NC) group (n = 65), the HRT group (n = 194), and the GnRH agonist downregulation combined with HRT cycle (GnRH agonistCHRT) group (n = 290). The primary outcome was the live birth rate, and the secondary outcomes were the clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and ongoing pregnancy rates. RESULTS: The live birth rate in the GnRH agonistCHRT group (36.55%) was higher than that in the HRT group (22.16%) and NC group (16.92%) (P < 0.0001). Similarly, a logistic regression model adjusting for potential confounders showed that the live birth rate was higher in the GnRH agonistCHRT group than in the HRT group (odds ratio, 0.594; 95% confidence interval, 0.381C0.926; P = 0.021) and NC group (odds ratio, 0.380; 95% confidence interval, 0.181C0.796; P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: The GnRH agonistCHRT protocol improves the live birth rate in frozenCthawed embryo transfer cycles for patients of advanced reproductive age with RIF. We hypothesize that the GnRH agonistCHRT protocol enhances implantation-related factors and promotes optimal endometrial receptivity, leading to an improved live birth rate.

METHODS: This system extracted features from transfer learning of AlexNet, VGG19, and ResNet50 networks before reducing this problem into multiple binary sub-problems using error-correcting coding. The learners were trained using the support vector machine (SVM) method. The outputs of these classifiers were combined and compared to the true class codes for the final prediction. RESULTS: Despite the superior performance of VGG19-SVM, with mean  standard deviation accuracy and sensitivity of 80.68%  2.00% and 80.86%  0.45%, respectively, this model required a long training time. There were also false-negative cases using both the VGGNet-SVM and ResNet-SVM models. AlexNet-SVM was more efficient in terms of running speed and prediction consistency.

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a polyphenolic compound from green tea that exerts antiviral activity against diverse viruses. This study aimed to report an uncharacterized mechanism of how EGCG restricted PRRSV proliferation. EGCG showed no significant effects on cell viability, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis in porcine alveolar macrophages and MARC-145 cells. The treatment of cells with EGCG attenuated the replication of both highly pathogenic and less pathogenic PRRSV in vitro. The viral life cycle analysis demonstrated that EGCG affected PRRSV replication and assembly, but not viral attachment, entry, or release. Interestingly, EGCG treatment abrogated the increased lipid droplets formation and lipid content induced by PRRSV infection. We further demonstrated that EGCG blocked PRRSV-stimulated expression of the key enzymes in lipid synthesis. In addition, EGCG attenuated PRRSV-induced autophagy that is critical for PRRSV proliferation. The supplementation of oleic acid restored PRRSV replication and assembly under EGCG treatment. Together, our results support that EGCG inhibits PRRSV proliferation through disturbing lipid metabolism. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped single-positive-stranded RNA virus that causes acute respiratory distress in piglets and reproductive failure in sows, resulting in huge economic losses to the global swine industry. Several lines of evidence have suggested the crucial roles of lipids in PRRSV proliferation. Our previous report demonstrated that PRRSV activated lipophagy to facilitate viral replication through downregulating the expression of N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 1. The manipulation of lipid metabolism may be a new perspective to prevent PRRSV spread. In the present study, we reported that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major component of green tea catechins, significantly attenuated PRRSV infection through inhibiting lipid synthesis and autophagy. Given that natural products derived from plants have helped in the prevention and treatment of various infectious diseases, EGCG has a great potential to serve as a safe and environmentally friendly natural compound to treat PRRSV infection.","output":"EGCG Restricts PRRSV Proliferation by Disturbing Lipid Metabolism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been a year since the Indonesian government announced its first COVID-19 identified in Jakarta.

However, its relatively short half-life may limit its clinical use. Therefore, we designed, constructed, and expressed a recombinant protein, FL-EK1, which consists of a modified fibronectin type III domain (FN3) with albumin-binding capacity, a flexible linker, and EK1. As with EK1, we found that FL-EK1 could also effectively inhibit infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, as well as HCoV-OC43. Furthermore, it protected mice from infection by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant and HCoV-OC43. Importantly, the half-life of FL-EK1 (30 h) is about 15.7-fold longer than that of EK1 (1.8 h).

The main TCS degradation pathway in both nitrification and denitrification systems were the metabolism of heterotrophic bacteria, only a little TCS was degraded by the co-metabolism of heterotrophic or nitrifying bacteria, and higher NH4+-N or NO3--N concentration contributed to more TCS degradation. Moreover, denitrification system had stronger TCS removal capacity (0.11 and 0.65 mg TCS/g SS) than nitrification system (0.83 and 1.12 mg TCS/g SS). DNA-SIP assay further revealed that active TCS degrading bacteria in both systems belonged to Sphingomonadaceae family. Furthermore, the oligotype TATGCC, TAATCA and GCCCCG of Sphingomonadaceae played important roles in degrading TCS in both systems. Moreover, reactor performance and mixed liquor suspended solids might play important roles in shaping the ecotypes of Sphingomonadaceae, which caused the difference in degrading TCS between nitrification and denitrification systems.

The baseline data and assessment results of examinees, the rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and the discharge survival rate of IHCA patients in 2019 and 2020 were compared. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the baseline data of examinees at each stage (p > 0.05). As time went on, the results of the four practical examinations were significantly improved (pairwise comparison, p < 0.05). The number of problems in examinations was significantly higher for physicians than for nurses. After guidance in department relearning, the incidence of related problems was significantly reduced, but the mastery of the frequency and depth of extracorporeal cardiac compression were not always up to standard. The proportion of critically ill patients and the incidence of IHCA in the hospital in 2020 was higher than in 2019 (p < 0.05), and the ROSC rate was also significantly higher than it was in 2019 (p < 0.05), but the difference in the survival rate at discharge was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).

Here, we described a glycoside hydrolase 16 (GH16) family laminarinase from a marine algae-associated flavobacterium at the biochemical and structural levels. We found that the endolytic enzyme cleaved laminarin with a preference for ?-1,3-glycoside linkages and showed transglycosylation activity across a broad range of acceptors. We also solved and compared high-resolution crystal structures of laminarinase in the apo form and in complex with ?-1,3-tetrasaccharides, revealing an expanded catalytic cleft formed following substrate binding. Moreover, structure and mutagenesis studies identified multiple specific contacts between the enzyme and glucosyl residues essential for the substrate specificity for ?-1,3-glucan. These results provide novel insights into the structural requirements for substrate binding and catalysis of GH16 family laminarinase, enriching our understanding of bacterial utilization of algal laminarin.IMPORTANCE Heterotrophic bacterial communities are key players in marine biogeochemical cycling due to their ability to remineralize organic carbon.

Studies were included in the final list if they measured outcomes of telehealth interventions in the perioperative period for patients > 65 years old. Disagreements were settled by a third reviewer, and results were compiled from the final list of articles. Due to heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not pursued.

Four studies found that there was a postoperative benefit following perioperative telehealth interventions. Specifically, the interventions improved subjective perceptions of recovery and symptom severity. Though not statistically significant, patients in all included studies had improvements in physical functioning. There was a consistent pattern of steady improvement from baseline in all health areas in older patients. A notable limitation in one study was that participants experienced technical difficulties and required ongoing technical support.

In simulations of low to medium (0.1% to 3%) prevalence, all NAC matrices were superior to the DS strategy, measured by fewer repeated tests required. At very high prevalence levels (10%), the DS matrix was marginally superior, although both group testing approaches performed poorly at high prevalence levels. This strategy maximizes the proportion of samples resolved after a single round of testing, allowing prompt return of results to HCWs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Seven patients were treated using this technique, in three patients as a bailout option after failed posterior tibial vein puncture and in four as a first option. Antegrade popliteal venous access was performed according to the usual technique using duplex ultrasound (DUS) guidance and thrombolysis (CDT), or thrombectomy (PMT) was performed. Following this, the retrograde sheath was placed under DUS guidance, a tibial vein was selectively catheterized and CDT, and/or a PMT was performed. RESULTS Three patients underwent isolated CDT, another three had associated PMT, and one patient underwent iliofemoral PMT and catheter thromboaspiration of the popliteal and calf veins. Median thrombolysis duration was 72 h (24-72 h). SIR grade III thrombolysis was achieved in six patients and grade II in one patient.

METHODS: We extracted data regarding non-communicable disease, particularly cardiovascular disease, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and healthy life expectancy (HALE) from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2017. We obtained data of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and tests from the Our World in Data database as of May 28, 2020. Potential confounders of pandemic outcomes analyzed include institutional lockdown delay, hemispheric geographical location, and number of tourists. We compared all countries according to GBD classification and World Bank income level. We assessed the correlation between independent variables associated with COVID-19 caseload and mortality using Spearman's rank correlation and adjusted mixed model analysis. FINDINGS: High-income had the highest, and the Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania region had the least cases per million population (3050.60 vs. 63.86). Sub-saharan region has reported the lowest number of COVID-19 mortality (1.9). Median delay to lockdown initiation varied from one day following the first case in Latin America and Caribbean region, to 34 days in Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania. Globally, non-communicable disease DALYs were correlated with COVID-19 cases (r=0.32, p<0.001) and deaths (r=0.37, p<0.001).

METHODS: An electronic survey was distributed to explore the pandemics perceived impact on neurocritical care delivery between June 2020 and March 2021. Variables were stratified by World Bank country income level, presence of a dedicated neurocritical care unit (NCCU) and experiencing a COVID-19 patient surge. RESULTS: Respondents from 253 hospitals (78.3% response rate) from 47 countries (45.5% low/middle income countries; 54.5% with a dedicated NCCU; 78.6% experienced a first surge) participated in the study. Independent of country income level, NCCU and surge status, participants reported reductions in NCCU admissions (67%), critical care drug shortages (69%), reduction in ancillary services (43%) and routine diagnostic testing (61%), and temporary cancellation of didactic teaching (44%) and clinical/basic science research (70%). Respondents from low/middle income countries were more likely to report lack of surge preparedness (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-5.8) and struggling to return to prepandemic standards of care (OR, 12.2; 95% CI, 4.4-34) compared with respondents from high-income countries. Respondents experiencing a surge were more likely to report conversion of NCCUs and general-mixed intensive care units (ICUs) to a COVID-ICU (OR 3.7; 95% CI, 1.9-7.3), conversion of non-ICU beds to ICU beds (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.8-6.5), and deviations in critical care and pharmaceutical practices (OR, 4.2; 95% CI 2.1-8.2). Respondents from hospitals with a dedicated NCCU were less likely to report conversion to a COVID-ICU (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9) or conversion of non-ICU to ICU beds (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9).

Here we characterize an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate from the pandemic recovered in April, 2020. Objective: To describe the isolation and characterization of an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate from the epidemic in Colombia. Materials and methods: A nasopharyngeal specimen from a COVID-19 positive patient was inoculated on different cell lines. To confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on cultures we used qRT-PCR, indirect immunofluorescence assay, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and next-generation sequencing. Results: We determined the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells by the appearance of the cytopathic effect three days post-infection and confirmed it by the positive results in the qRT-PCR and the immunofluorescence with convalescent serum. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy images obtained from infected cells showed the presence of structures compatible with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, a complete genome sequence obtained by next-generation sequencing allowed classifying the isolate as B.1.5 lineage. Conclusion: The evidence presented in this article confirms the first isolation of SARSCoV-2 in Colombia. In addition, it shows that this strain behaves in cell culture in a similar way to that reported in the literature for other isolates and that its genetic composition is consistent with the predominant variant in the world. Finally, points out the importance of viral isolation for the detection of neutralizing antibodies, for the genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the strain and for testing compounds with antiviral potential.","output":"[Aislamiento y caracterizacin de una cepa temprana de SARS-CoV-2 durante la epidemia de 2020 en Medelln, Colombia]./ [Aislamiento y caracterizacin de una cepa temprana de SARS-CoV-2 durante la epidemia de 2020 en Medelln, Colombia]./ Isolation and characterization of an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate from the 2020 epidemic in Medelln, Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) caused the global pandemic of COVID-19 since December 2019.

Previous publications have validated the patient factors that increase the risk of mortality; however, it is currently a rare event. The development of a metabolic acuity score (MAS) to augment the body mass index might allow for accurate preoperative assessment and optimal treatment of patients. The present study has proposed a MAS for decreasing major complications. METHODS Prospectively collected outcomes of 2416 patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 1821) or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (n = 595) in a community hospital were evaluated for the incidence of major complications, readmissions, and reoperations. Beginning in August of 2006, 1072 patients were divided into MAS groups of 1-4 according to age, body mass index, weight, history of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, sleep apnea, diabetes, hypertension, immobility, heart disease, and psychological classification. The acuity groups were compared with each other and with 1344 patients who underwent treatment before the MAS was implemented. RESULTS A significant decrease occurred in the readmission rates within 30 days after the MAS was put into practice (8.5% before MAS versus 1.7% after MAS, P <.001) for the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients. The postoperative infection rates were lower after implementing the MAS (3.5% before MAS, .7% after MAS, P <.001). After adjusting for random and fixed effects of covariates, the implementation of the MAS significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative internal hernias, infections, deep vein thrombosis, readmissions, and reoperations.

Nevertheless, how immune response participates in the pathogenesis of PF progression is not well defined. To investigate that question, 12 patients with severe COVID-19 were included in the study. Peripheral mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected shortly after their admission and proceeded for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). After 14 days of discharge, the patients were revisited for chest CT scan. PF index (FI) was computed by AI-assisted CT images. Patients were categorized into FIhi and FIlo based on median of FI. By scRNA-seq analysis, our data demonstrated that frequency of CD4+ activated T cells and Treg cells were approximately 3-fold higher in FIhi patients compared with FIlo ones (p < 0.034 for all). By dissecting the differentially expressed genes, we found an overall downregulation of IFN-responsive genes (STAT1, IRF7, ISG15, ISG20, IFIs, and IFITMs) and S100s alarmins (S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, etc.) in all T-cell clusters, and cytotoxicity-related genes (GZMB, PRF1, and GNLY) in CTLs and æ T cells in the FIhi cohort, compared with FIlo subjects. The GSEA analysis illustrated decreased expression of genes enriched in IFN signaling, innate immune response, adaptive immune response in T cells, NK cells, and monocytes in FIhi patients compared with FIlo ones.

As neurological examination is often unreliable in sedated patients, additional neuromonitoring is needed. However, the value of electroencephalogram (EEG) in adult ECMO patients has not been well assessed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of electroencephalographic abnormalities in patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and their association with 3-month neurologic outcome. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing venousCvenous (VCV) or venousCarterial (VCA) ECMO with a concomitant EEG recording (April 2009CDecember 2018), either recorded intermittently or continuously. EEG background was classified into four categories: mild/moderate encephalopathy (i.e., mostly defined by the presence of reactivity), severe encephalopathy (mostly defined by the absence of reactivity), burst-suppression (BS) and suppressed background. Epileptiform activity (i.e., ictal EEG pattern, sporadic epileptiform discharges or periodic discharges) and asymmetry were also reported. EEG findings were analyzed according to unfavorable neurological outcome (UO, defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale < 4) at 3 months after discharge. RESULTS: A total of 139 patients (54 [41C62] years; 60 (43%) male gender) out of 596 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. VenoCarterial (VCA) ECMO was used in 98 (71%); UO occurred in 99 (71%) patients. Continuous EEG was performed in 113 (81%) patients. The analysis of EEG background showed that 29 (21%) patients had severe encephalopathy, 4 (3%) had BS and 19 (14%) a suppressed background. In addition, 11 (8%) of patients had seizures or status epilepticus, 10 (7%) had generalized periodic discharges or lateralized periodic discharges, and 27 (19%) had asymmetry on EEG. In the multivariate analysis, the occurrence of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage (OR 4.57 [1.25C16.74]; p = 0.02) and a suppressed background (OR 10.08 [1.24C82.20]; p = 0.03) were independently associated with UO. After an adjustment for covariates, an increasing probability for UO was observed with more severe EEG background categories.

RESULTS: Independent of the assist level, a wide range of respiratory rates (16-35br/min) was observed when patients' effort was within the accepted range. Changing the assist level resulted in paired changes in inspiratory effort and rate of the same tendency (increase or decrease) in all but four patients. Increasing the level in assist resulted in a 31 % (8-44 %) decrease in inspiratory effort and a 10 % (0-18 %) decrease in respiratory rate.

The patient had neurological impairment associated with poor oral tolerance. Initial laboratory examinations were C-reactive protein in 363.5 mg/L, serum sodium of 128.42 mmol/L and urine sodium was 83 meq/L. Osmolality in plasma was 266.15 mOsm/Kg and urine osmolality was 420 mOsm/Kg. Thyroid function tests as well as cortisol levels were in normal range. Our patient was diagnosed as SIAD by hyponatremia, osmolality in plasma <275 mOsm / kg, urine osmolality > 100 mOsm / kg, urine sodium > 40 mEq / l, euvolemic state and exclusion of cortisol and thyroid hormone deficiency. Treatment of hyponatremia was initiated and rapidly elevate plasma sodium by 4 meq/l in the first 6 hours. There was clinical improvement. Blood sodium levels ranged from 115 to 135 mmol/L with bolus therapy of hypertonic solutions in 72 hours. Intravenous boluses of hypertonic saline should be administered to rapidly elevate plasma sodium by 4 to 6 mEq/L in the first 6 hours. The data shows that fluid bolus therapy is more effective in acutely elevating plasma sodium than traditional low-dose hypertonic saline infusion that may lead to avoidable deaths according to recent guidelines.

We also found through qualitative analysis that important team culture factors such as communication and social connection had been affected. For example, the simple phrase\\"How was your weekend?\\"had become a subtle way to show peer support. In our second survey, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the team cultural factors that emerged from our first survey to understand the prevalence of the reported changes. From 608 developer responses, we found that 74% of these respondents missed social interactions with colleagues and 51% reported a decrease in their communication ease with colleagues. We used data from the second survey to build a regression model to identify important team culture factors for modeling team productivity. We found that the ability to brainstorm with colleagues, difficulty communicating with colleagues, and satisfaction with interactions from social activities are important factors that are associated with how developers report their software development team's productivity. Our findings inform how managers and leaders in large software companies can support sustained team productivity during times of crisis and beyond.","output":"\\"How Was Your Weekend?\\"Software Development Teams Working From Home During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first two cases of COVID-19 in Ghana were recorded on March 12th 2020. As a guideline, government issued directives on physical distancing and the use of face masks to curb community spread of the disease. Given that public transport has been identified as a high-risk environment for transmission, it was of interest to ascertain user and operator compliance to guidelines for public transport operations during the period, as a measure of its risk level. A roadside observer survey, of over 850 of the most popular paratransit (trotro) buses was carried out on one of the major roads in Kumasi. Compliance to the policy on physical distancing was determined using guidelines from the Ministry of Transport, while compliance to the policy on face masks was determined by the researchers themselves based on the number of commuters with/without face masks per bus. The results suggest that majority (98.0%) of buses comply with the social distancing guidelines established by the Ministry of transport, however the policy on face masks was complied with only partially in most vehicles. About 12.6% of the vehicles had fewer than three commuters without face masks, while 21.3% of buses that had fewer than 3 people with face masks. The results suggest public transport remains an area of high risk in the fight against COVID-19. It is recommended that operators are given additional directives that restrict them from allowing commuters without face masks on board their vehicles, and as well, that police enforce the policy through fines.","output":"Adherence to social distancing and wearing of masks within public transportation during the COVID 19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy (LRN) has become the standard technique for radical nephrectomies for T1 renal tumors (7 cm or less). We extended our experience with LRN to T2 renal tumors (greater than 7 cm) and compared the efficacy and long-term oncologic outcomes with those of open radical nephrectomy (ORN) for T2 clear renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the same period. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the data from 33 patients who underwent LRN and 35 patients who underwent ORN in our institution from January 2003 to June 2006 for T2N0M0 RCC. We compared long-term oncologic outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS The median follow-up periods were 60.0 months (range, 48.0-77.0 months) and 65.6 months (range, 56.0-77.0 months) in the LRN and ORN groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the patients' demographic data. There were no significant differences in the 5-year overall survival rate, the cancer-specific survival rate, or the recurrence-free survival rate.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Male Syrian hamsters weighting 80-100 g were infected by intranasal administration of culture SARS-CoV-2 at dose 4  104 TCID50/ml (TCID is tissue culture infectious dose). Animals were euthanatized on 3, 7 and 14 days after infection, with gravimetric registration. The viral load in lungs was measured using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Right lung and trachea tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and according to Mallory. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The highest viral replicative activity in lungs was determined 3 days after the infection. After 7 days, on a background of the decrease of the viral load in lungs, a pathologically significant increase of the organ's gravimetric parameters was observed. Within 3 to 14 days post-infection, the lung histologic pattern had been showing the development of inflammation with a succession of infiltrative-proliferative, edematousmacrophagal and fibroblastic changes. It was found that initial changes in respiratory epithelium can proceed without paranecrotic interstitial inflammation, while in the formation of multiple lung parenchyma lesions, damage to the epithelium of bronchioles and acinar ducts can be secondary. The appearance of epithelioid large-cell metaplastic epithelium, forming pseudoacinar structures, was noted as a pathomorphological feature specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters. CONCLUSION As a result of the study, the specific features of the pathology of the respiratory system in SARSCoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters were described. These findings are of practical importance as reference data that can be used for preclinical studies to assess the effectiveness of vaccines and potential drugs.","output":"[Specific features of the pathology of the respiratory system in SARS-CoV-2 (Coronaviridae: Coronavirinae: Betacoronavirus: Sarbecovirus) infected Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus)]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a complex transcriptome characterised by multiple, nested sub genomic RNAs used to express structural and accessory proteins.

Our previous study demonstrated that Thai H1N1 SIVs possessed the classical swine H1 and avian\\\\like swine N1 genes (Takemae et al., Proceedings of the Options for the Control of Influenza VI.2007;350C353). Objectives In the present study, we genetically characterized 12 SIVs including those of H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes isolated between 2000 and 2005. Methods We determined the entire nucleotide sequences of the eight gene segments of those isolates. Results Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of nine distinct genotypes amongst the Thai SIVs. These genotypes arose from multiple introductions of classical swine, avian\\\\like swine and human viruses. The existence of two distinct sublineages within classical swine H1 and NS, avian\\\\like swine PA and M and human H3 and N2 genes of the Thai SIVs suggested that introduction of viruses of classical swine, avian\\\\like swine and human origins occurred twice respectively into the Thai pig population. The predominance of avian\\\\like swine genes amongst the Thai SIVs was evident. In particular, three polymerase (PB1, PB2 and PA) and matrix genes of avian\\\\like swine origin were retained in all the Thai SIVs examined.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 differs by one's level of trust in government. DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis using the Japan COVID-19 and Society Internet Survey (JACSIS) conducted in August and September 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A nationally representative sample of Japanese individuals aged 15 through 79 years. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was the composite score for COVID-19 preventive measures, defined as the percentage of preventive measures an individual reported to be practicing (out of nine measures: social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding closed spaces, avoiding crowded spaces, avoiding close contact settings, hand washing, avoiding touching one's face, respiratory hygiene, and surface disinfection). The secondary outcomes were (1) support for stay-at-home requests, (2) use of a contact-tracing app, and (3) receipt of the influenza vaccine in the previous season. KEY RESULTS: Our analysis included a total of 25,482 individuals. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that individuals with high trust in government were likely to practice preventive measures more frequently compared to those with low trust (adjusted composite scores, 83.8% for high- vs. 79.5% for low-trust individuals; adjusted difference, +4.3 percentage points [pp]; 95% CI, +2.4 to +6.2pp; P<0.001).

We analyzed the leak rates from published series to help in demonstrating a potential cause. METHODS The study was institutional review board (IRB) approved retrospectively. A Medline search using the key words sleeve gastrectomy and bariatric surgery obtained 54 articles. Attention was restricted to 11 articles written in English that listed numbers of gastrectomy procedures and leaks. Poisson regression assessed the possibility that patients who received buttressing materials had a reduced rate of leaks. RESULTS Thirty-five patients were evaluated from Greece (15) and the United States (20); two patients developed staple line leaks that appeared to be related to problems associated with buttressing materials. Eleven prior studies and the present series yielded 1,589 procedures, 15 (0.94%) of which were complicated by leaks. The leak rate for patients who were known to have received reinforcement of some sort was 1.45 (95% confidence interval 0.41-3.43) times that for other patients.

However, the mechanism by which CD133+ HPCs affect the malignancy of human breast cancer has not been reported. METHODS CD133+ HPCs were isolated and purified from human umbilical cord blood (UCB). We used in vitro culture of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, and MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in nude mice to evaluate whether CD133+ HPCs affected the apoptosis, proliferation, invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition EMT of breast cancer cells. RESULTS Co-culture with CD133+ HPCs, but not UCB CD133- cells, promoted the proliferation of human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, accompanied by reducing in vitro spontaneous apoptosis. Co-administration of these two lines with CD133+ HPCs significantly enhanced the growth of implanted breast cancer in vivo. Furthermore, co-culture with CD133+ HPCs, enhanced the invasion of breast cancer cells, N-cadherin and Vimentin expression, but reduced E-cadherin expression in breast cancer cells.

Exposure to 5 and 10 mg/L QNC reduced the fresh biomass by 26.6% and 33.9%, respectively, compared to the control. The presence of 50 and 250 mg/L nZVI alleviated the QNC toxicity, but the nZVI toxicity was aggravated by the coexist of QNC. Root length was enhanced upon exposure to low or medium doses of both QNC and nZVI, whereas root length was inhibited under high-dose coexposure. Both nZVI and QNC, either alone or in combination, significantly inhibited the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, and the inhibition rate increased with elevated nZVI and QNC concentration. It was indicated that nZVI or QNC can affect the plant photosynthesis, and there was a significant interaction between the two treatments. Effects of QNC on the antioxidant response of Oryza sativa L. differed in the shoots and roots; generally, the introduction of 50 and 250 mg/L nZVI alleviated the oxidative stress (POD in shoots, SOD and MDA in roots) induced by QNC. However, 750 mg/kg nZVI seriously damaged Oryza sativa L. seedlings, which likely resulted from active iron deficiency.

In particular, managing hypertensive disorders in pregnancy can be problematic because antihypertensive medications may interact pharmacologically with drugs used to treat COVID-19. This review focuses on the safety of drug treatment for COVID-19 in pregnant women treated with antihypertensive medication. METHODS AND RESULTS: Several databases were searched to identify relevant literature. A few antihypertensive drugs and antithrombotic treatments are known for having a beneficial effect in the management of hypertension and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.

By keeping a fixed average connectivity, but allowing different transmissibilities along internal and bridge links, we theoretically derive different power-law asymptotic behaviors of the total fraction of the recovered R in the final state as r goes to zero, for different combinations of internal and bridge link transmissibilities. We also find crossover points where R follows different power-law behaviors with r on both sides when the internal transmissibility is below but close to its critical value for different bridge link transmissibilities. All of these power-law behaviors can be explained through different mechanisms of how finite clusters in each community are connected into the giant component of the whole system, and enable us to pick effective epidemic strategies and to better predict their impacts.","output":"Role of bridge nodes in epidemic spreading: Different regimes and crossovers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Quality-assured antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) depends upon the knowledge and skills of laboratory staff. In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Pakistan, such types of knowledge and skills are limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use openaccess online courses to improve the knowledge of laboratory staff involved in the detection and reporting of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). METHODOLOGY: Seven online modules comprising 22 courses aimed at strengthening the laboratory detection of Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) were developed. The courses were uploaded onto the website www.parn.org.pk. Participants had an option of selecting courses of their interest. Online registration and completion of a pre-course assessment (pre-test) were essential for enrolment. However, participation in post-course assessment (post-test) was optional. The number of registered participants and the proportion of participants who completed each course were computed. A paired t-test was used to assess the increase between mean pre- and post-test scores. The association between the participants working in public vs. private laboratories and course completion rates were determined using the chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 227 participants from Pakistan (March 2018 to June 2020) were registered. The largest number of registered participants and the highest completion rate were noted for AST and biosafety courses, while quality-related courses attracted a lower interest. A comparison of pre- and post-test performance using the paired mean score for the individual courses showed a statistically significant (the value of p < 0.05) improvement in 13/20 assessed courses. A higher course completion rate was observed in participants from public vs. private sector laboratories (56.8 vs. 30.8%, the value of p = 0.005).

In addition, rising case numbers reflect an increase in coronavirus transmission some time previously, so timing of response measures is highly important. Australia experienced a second wave from June 2020 onwards, confined to greater Melbourne, with initial social distancing measures failing to reduce rapidly increasing case numbers. We conducted a detailed analysis of this outbreak, together with an evaluation of the effectiveness of alternative response strategies, to provide guidance to countries experiencing second waves of SARS-Cov-2 transmission. An individual-based transmission model was used to (1) describe a second-wave COVID-19 epidemic in Australia; (2) evaluate the impact of lockdown strategies used; and (3) evaluate effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies. The model was calibrated using daily diagnosed case data prior to lockdown. Specific social distancing interventions were modelled by adjusting person-to-person contacts in mixing locations. Modelling earlier activation of lockdown measures are predicted to reduce total case numbers by more than 50%. Epidemic peaks and duration of the second wave were also shown to reduce. Our results suggest that activating lockdown measures when second-wave case numbers first indicated exponential growth, would have been highly effective in reducing COVID-19 cases. The model was shown to realistically predict the epidemic growth rate under the social distancing measures applied, validating the methods applied. The timing of social distancing activation is shown to be critical to their effectiveness. Data showing exponential rise in cases, doubling every 7C10 days, can be used to trigger early lockdown measures. Such measures are shown to be necessary to reduce daily and total case numbers, and the consequential health burden, so preventing health care facilities being overwhelmed. Early control of second wave resurgence potentially permits strict lockdown measures to be eased earlier.","output":"A modelling analysis of the effectiveness of second wave COVID-19 response strategies in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Social Prescribing (SP) is an innovative strategy to respond to the non-clinical health needs of the population. A Social Prescribing Local System (SPLS) can be defined as a set of joined community, health, and social organizations to foster SP-oriented activities. This study aimed to develop and assess the feasibility of an SPLS implemented in a Mediterranean country, to promote health and wellbeing and contribute to active and healthy aging. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was followed, including three sequential components: 1) Cross-sectional online survey targeting health professionals (HP) working in a primary health care cluster, Portugals southern region; 2) Pilot study implementing an on-the-job training program for HP, designed to meet identified training needs in the survey; 3) Focus group (FG) with the HP who participated in the pilot study, two individual interviews, with an elderly patient and a community provider for assessing the satisfaction with the pilot test. RESULTS: Sixty-five HP completed the survey; of these, 13 completed the theoretical part of the on-the-job training program; and six (out of these 13) completed the full program. Five HP participated in the FG, one patient and one community provider were interviewed. The surveyed HP perceived as facilitators to implement SP: an automatic system of notifications to prompt the use of SP, contribute to patient satisfaction, human and community resources stability. The survey also highlighted barriers to SP implementation: length of appointments, shortage of human resources, data records confidentiality, low patient adherence rates, bureaucratic issues, time constraints, and financial costs. Participants were satisfied with the training. Identified SPLS implementation benefits were grouped into four dimensions (from the qualitative approach): gains for patients health and wellbeing, support for the health services, sustainability of the community resources, and HP professional satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our study took the first steps towards the implementation of an SPLS. Findings reinforce that training HP in SP and on-the-job training seems feasible. This approach was well received and appears to represent a suitable and sustainable strategy.

The lockdown had vast socioeconomic consequences for the society. The aim of this study was to investigate how COVID-19 affected Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) providers practice, financial situation, recommendations to patients, and how they perceived their future practice as CAM providers. METHOD: Data were collected in this cross-sectional survey using a self-administrated electronic questionnaire. A total of 581 CAM providers completed the questionnaire, which was designed to describe consequences for CAM providers and their clinical practice caused by the nationwide lockdown. Descriptive statistics were carried out using frequency analyses to describe the demographics and consequences of the lockdown. Between group differences (gender and age) were analyzed using Pearson chi-square tests and Fishers exact tests for categorical variables, and ANOVA tests and t-tests for continuous variables. Significance level was defined as p < 0.05 without adjustment for multiple comparisons. RESULT: During the nationwide lockdown of Norway, 38.4% of the respondents were able to provide CAM treatment to their patients. Of those, the majority (96.4%) had reorganized their clinical practice in accordance with COVID-19 hygiene regulations, offered video consultations (57.4%) or telephone consultations (46.6%). To manage financially during the lockdown, half of the providers spent their savings (48.7%). More than one third (35.1%) was supported by their partner, and 26.7% received compensation from the Norwegian state. A total of 26.3% of the CAM providers had other paid work that provided them with income. Nearly a fifth (18.6%) borrowed money from friends and family, changed their loan terms, or took out new bank loans. More than half (62.7%) expressed uncertainty about the future of their practice. CAM providers who had reorganized their practice to online consultations were more optimistic. CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID-19 on CAM providers was considerable. It adversely affected their clinical practice, financial situation, and view on their future practice. To ensure that the health needs of the Norwegian population regarding CAM use are met during pandemic times like COVID-19, it is recommended to support and train CAM providers in the development of online CAM services, as well as efficient implementation of infection prevention and control measures.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on complementary and alternative medicine providers: a cross-sectional survey in Norway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) has become the reason for the world to declare it as a global pandemic, which has already taken many lives from all around the world.

This study aimed to determine the levels of anxiety and burnout and related risk factors in the healthcare workers and assistant personnel at a tertiary referral university hospital. Method: Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and a sociodemographic questionnaire were delivered online to all employees of our hospital. 683 individuals were to the study who completed and returned the forms between April 15-30, 2020. Results: Stress, depression and anxiety levels were significantly higher in nurses. Emotional burnout and depersonalization symptoms were higher and personal accomplishment scores were lower in resident physicians and nurses in comparison to the other groups. Being single, having a child and living away from home were factors underlying the burnout severity. Frontline work in the Covid-19 clinics did not affect the levels of anxiety, stress and depression. On the basis of the cut off points of the HADS scores;anxiety disorder (OR: 7.19) and depression (OR 3.43) were the most relevant risk factors for emotional exhaustion. Anxiety disorder was also the main risk factor for depersonalization. Depersonalization was 2.7- fold more among the nurses complaining of being overworked. Social support from the work environment and the family was protective against depersonalization. Conclusion: Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected the wellbeing of healthcare workers. The presence of depression and anxiety increased the risk of burnout. Social support can be expected to protect against burnout.

Some of these drugs proved to be harmful besides drug-drug interactions can be occurred particularly in old-age groups or patients with chronic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the effects of several drugs on the survival outcome of COVID19 patients hospitalized in a single medical center in Erbil, Iraq. 204 patients (128 men and 76 women) with COVID-19 were recruited from the West Erbil Emergency hospital between August 10 and November 20, 2020. The primary outcome measures were the survival rate during the course of illness taking into consideration the number and the generic name of prescribed drugs, the percentage of saturated blood oxygen (sPO2), and the age. A total number of sixty-four patients died. Non-survivors are characterized by having a significantly lower percentage of sPO2 and used a significantly high mean value of a number (4-5) of drugs during the course of treatment. The percentage of non survivors who used fluoroquinolones was significantly higher than the corresponding percentage of survivors (37.5 vs 21.4, p=0.016). The cumulative odds ratio (> 1.0) was observed significantly (chi 2=6.286, p=0.012) in patients who used five-drug items despite the sPO2 >= 90%. We conclude that drug combinations of more than three drugs are harmful in old-age group patients, and dexamethasone, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones should be not prescribed as empiric therapy.","output":"Assessment of some prescribed drugs in the management of COVID-19 on the survival function: A preliminary report from a single center in Iraq"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: An occupational disease is any disease developing primarily as a result of exposure to risk factors arising from work activity and contributing to a significant portion of work-related diseases. Although COVID-19 is not dermatotropic, prolonged contact with personal protective equipmentthat is, goggles, face shields, N95 respirators, double-layered gloves, etc.may cause various dermatoses. Several dermatoses due to PPE have been well documented, but facial dermatoses specifically due to the use of face masks remain a relatively uncharted entity. In this study, we report preliminary data on individuals experiencing various facial dermatoses due to the use of face masks. Objective: The aim was to study the various facial dermatoses associated with the use of a face mask. Materials and Methods: After obtaining informed consent, individuals using a face mask were enrolled in this single-institution, questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study. Results: A total of 364 participants were enrolled for the study, among which 59.3% revealed to have worn a face mask for more than six months. A majority used ear-looped N95 masks. Nine problem areas were identified in the study. Among the facial dermatoses observed, acne was the most frequently reported, followed by redness. Conclusion: In spite of contact dermatitis arising due to masks, it is recommended to use well-fitted and comfortable masks for sufficient periods of time to reduce the risk of transmission, ensure safety, and reduce maskrelated side effects.

All anomaly detection activities are aimed at identifying cases of unusual behavior compared to most observations. There are many methods to deal with this issue, which are applicable depending on the size of the data set, the way it is stored, and the type of attributes and their values. Most of them focus on traditional datasets with a large number of quantitative attributes. The multitude of solutions related to detecting outliers in quantitative sets, a large and still has a small number of research solutions is a problem detecting outliers in data containing only qualitative variables. This article was designed to compare three different categorical data clustering algorithms: K- [Formula: see text] algorithm taken from MacQueens K- [Formula: see text] algorithm and the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] algorithms. The comparison concerned the method of dividing the set into clusters and, in particular, the outliers detected by algorithms. During the research, the authors analyzed the clusters detected by the indicated algorithms, using several datasets that differ in terms of the number of objects and variables. They have conducted experiments on the parameters of the algorithms. The presented study made it possible to check whether the algorithms similarly detect outliers in the data and how much they depend on individual parameters and parameters of the set, such as the number of variables, tuples, and categories of a qualitative variable.","output":"Qualitative Data Clustering to Detect Outliers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been evolving since early 2020 with high critical care mortality and morbidity.

EVIDENCE: Health and vaccine literacy encompass people's knowledge, motivation, and competence to access, understand, appraise and apply health information in order to make judgements and take decisions in everyday life concerning health care, disease prevention and health promotion. FINDINGS: Appropriate vaccine communication, which depends greatly on personal and contextual determinants, as well as on societal and environmental circumstances, is essential to reassure people about vaccine efficacy, safety, and possible side effects. However, vaccine confidence is not solely a question of trust in the vaccine's efficacy, safety. and individual protective benefit of vaccination. It also encompasses the mechanism(s) of vaccine activity, immunization schedules, organization and trust in the healthcare system that promotes and delivers the vaccines, and at what costs. When healthcare professionals as science brokers of vaccine knowledge attempt to increase vaccine knowledge and confidence, they must adjust their communication to the educational or health literacy level of their intended audience. Even if their messages are apparently clear and simple, they absolutely need to verify that they are properly understood. RELEVANCE: Specific vaccine communication training appears essential to increase vaccine communication skills among healthcare providers. Moreover, further randomized controlled studies are warranted to improve vaccine empowerment among different populations, from a variety of educational backgrounds.","output":"Education, Healthy Ageing and Vaccine Literacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The school-based sexuality education programmes in South Africa aim to improve the sexual and reproductive health of school-going adolescents. However, the high rate of unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections among learners in some schools in rural areas of King Cetshwayo district suggests that the programmes in these schools might not be effective due to certain learner-centred factors. METHOD: This qualitative study explored lived experiences of 84 learners from nine public schools in 2020 through focus group interviews. Data was analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. RESULTS: Learner-centred barriers to effective school-based sexuality education identified in this study were attitudes, age disparity, psychological status, peer pressure, socio-economic status, the exploratory attitude of learners, media, lack of role models, previous experiences, socio-economic status, and lack of parental love. These factors could reduce good sexual health. Learner-targeted interventions such as campaigns, using guest professionals, condom distribution, videos, on-site family planning, formal demonstrations, and on-site counselling could address these barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Addressing these barriers and implementing the proposed interventions will enhance school-based sexuality education and consequently improve adolescents sexual health. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: The findings could guide programming, implementation, and delivery of school-based sexuality education leading to improved adolescents sexual and reproductive health.","output":"Addressing Learner-Centred Barriers to Sexuality Education in Rural Areas of South Africa: Learners Perspectives on Promoting Sexual Health Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To develop a risk model to predict 30-day mortality after emergency department treatment for COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS Observational retrospective cohort study including 2511 patients with COVID-19 who came to our emergency department between March 1 and April 30, 2020. We analyzed variables with Kaplan Meier survival and Cox regression analyses. RESULTS All-cause mortality was 8% at 30 days. Independent variables associated with higher risk of mortality were age over 50 years, a Barthel index score less than 90, altered mental status, the ratio of arterial oxygen saturation to the fraction of inspired oxygen (SaO2/FIO2), abnormal lung sounds, platelet concentration less than 100 000/mm3, a C-reactive protein concentration of 5 mg/dL or higher, and a glomerular filtration rate less than 45 mL/min. Each independent predictor was assigned 1 point in the score except age, which was assigned 2 points. Risk was distributed in 3 levels: low risk (score of 4 points or less), intermediate risk (5 to 6 points), and high risk (7 points or above). Thirty-day risk of mortality was 1.7% for patients who scored in the low-risk category, 28.2% for patients with an intermediate risk score, and 67.3% for those with a high risk score.

This high mortality rate leads many providers to feel that the treatment of pTBI is futile. Contrary to this point of view, several studies have shown that victims of pTBI who present with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) &#8805;6 have a reasonable chance of a meaningful outcome. This study sought to investigate outcomes of pTBI patients based on GCS score who underwent neurosurgical intervention (craniotomy or craniectomy) and compare them with patients who did not undergo surgical intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study represents a secondary analysis of the data that were collected from 2006 to 2016 from 17 institutions as part of a multi-center study, investigating clinical outcomes for adult patients sustaining pTBI and surviving >72 h. Patients were divided into those with GCS 3-5 and those with GCS &#8805;6. Within these groups, patients were stratified by whether they received surgical intervention, compared with standard non-surgical care. Patient level data (age and gender), clinical data (Injury Severity Score and Abbreviated Injury Score), GCS on admission, post-op infection rates, and outcomes data (mortality, length of stay [LOS], intensive care unit LOS) were collected. Both groups were compared using independent sample t-test or chi-squared test. RESULTS: Seven hundred twenty patients with pTBI were identified over 11 y, out of which 336 (46.7%) underwent surgery. The mean Injury Severity Score and Abbreviated Injury Score on admission were higher in the surgical intervention group than their non-surgical counterpart in patients with a GCS &#8805;6 (P < 0.0001). Patients with GCS of 3-5 with surgical intervention demonstrated a higher survival rate than non-surgical patients (P < 0.0001). In the GCS &#8805;6 group, surgical intervention did not impact near-term mortality. Intensive care unit LOS was significantly longer in the surgical intervention group in patients with GCS &#8805; 6 (P < 0.0001) and GCS of 3-5 (P < 0.0001), as was total hospital LOS (P < 0.0001). Patients with a GCS 3-5 and &#8805;6 who underwent surgical intervention were more likely to develop a central nervous system infection (P = 0.016; P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical intervention in pTBI patients with GCS 3-5 results in improved mortality but comes at a cost of increased resource utilization in the form of longer LOS and higher infection rate. On the other hand, in patients with GCS &#8805;6, surgery does not provide significant benefits in patient survival. Future prospective studies providing insight as to the impact of surgery on the resource utilization and quality of survival would be beneficial in determining the need for surgical intervention in this population.","output":"Management of Penetrating Traumatic Brain Injury: Operative versus Non-Operative Intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autoimmune phenomena and clinically apparent autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis, are increasingly been reported not only after natural infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but also after vaccination against it. We report the case of a 63-year old man without a history of autoimmunity or SARS-CoV-2 natural infection who experienced acute severe autoimmune-like hepatitis seven days after the first dose of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Liver histology showed inflammatory portal infiltrate with interface hepatitis, lobular and centrilobular inflammation with centrilobular necrosis, in absence of fibrosis and steatosis.

However, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) referral networks are often undermined by systemic inefficiencies. If equitable access to essential surgical services is to be achieved, sound evidence is needed to ensure efficient patient care pathways. The aim of this scoping review was to investigate current knowledge regarding inter-hospital surgical referral systems in LMICs to identify the main obstacles to their functioning and to critically assess proposed solutions. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases and grey literature were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. The search generated 2261 unique records, of which 14 studies were selected for inclusion in the review. The narrative synthesis of retrieved data is based on a conceptual framework developed though a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS Multiple shortages in surgical infrastructure, equipment and personnel, as well as gaps in surgical and decision-making skills of clinicians at sending hospitals, act as obstacles to safe and appropriate referrals. Comprehensive protocols for surgical referrals are lacking in most LMICs and established patient pathways, when in place, are not correctly followed. Interventions to improve coordination and communication between different level facilities may enhance efficiency of referral pathways. Strengthening capacity of referring hospitals to manage more surgical conditions locally could improve outcomes, decrease the need for referral and reduce the burden on tertiary facilities. DISCUSSION The field of surgical referrals is still an uncharted territory and the limited empirical evidence available is of low quality. Developing strategies for assessing functionality and effectiveness of referral systems in surgery is essential to improve access, coverage and quality of services in resource-limited settings, as well as overall health systems performance.","output":"Surgical referral systems in low- and middle-income countries: A review of the evidence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A simplified susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model and a small-world model are applied to analyse the spread and control of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) for Hong Kong in early 2003.

A simple way to evaluate the development and efficacy of control is described and shown to provide a useful measure for the future evolution of an epidemic. This may contribute to improve strategic response from the government. The evaluation process here is universal and therefore applicable to many similar homogeneous epidemic diseases within a fixed population. A novel model consisting of map systems involving the Small-World network principle is also described.

The aim of this paper was to validate the Self-evaluation of Negative Symptoms (SNS) in a large European sample coming from 12 countries. We wanted to demonstrate: (1) good convergent and divergent validities; (2) relationships between SNS scores and patients' functional outcome; (3) the capacity of the SNS compared to the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) to detect negative symptoms; and (4) a five-domain construct in relation to the 5 consensus domains (social withdrawal, anhedonia, alogia, avolition, blunted affect) as the best latent structure of SNS. Methods: Two hundred forty-five subjects with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia completed the SNS, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the BNSS, the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), and the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale. Spearman's Rho correlations, confirmatory factor analysis investigating 4 models of the latent structure of SNS and stepwise multiple regression were performed. Results: Significant positive correlations were observed between the total score of the SNS and the total scores of the PANSS negative subscale (r = 0.37; P < 0.0001) and the BNSS (r = 0.43; p < 0.0001). SNS scores did not correlate with the level of insight, parkinsonism, or the total score of the PANSS positive subscale. A positive correlation was found between SNS and CDSS (r = 0.35; p < 0.0001). Among the 5 SNS subscores, only avolition subscores entered the regression equation explaining a lower functional outcome. The 1-factor and 2-factor models provided poor fit, while the 5-factor model and the hierarchical model provided the best fit, with a small advantage of the 5-factor model. The frequency of each negative dimension was systematically higher using the BNSS and the SNS vs. the PANSS and was higher for alogia and avolition using SNS vs. BNSS. Conclusion: In a large European multicentric sample, this study demonstrated that the SNS has: (1) good psychometric properties with good convergent and divergent validities; (2) a five-factor latent structure; (3) an association with patients' functional outcome; and (4) the capacity to identify subjects with negative symptoms that is close to the BNSS and superior to the PANSS negative subscale.","output":"European Validation of the Self-Evaluation of Negative Symptoms (SNS): A Large Multinational and Multicenter Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore whether hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 and neurologic symptoms have evidence of CNS infection, inflammation and injury using CSF biomarker measurements. METHODS: We assessed CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA along with CSF biomarkers of intrathecal inflammation (CSF white blood cell count, neopterin, ?2-microglobulin (?2M) and immunoglobulin G-index), blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity (albumin ratio), and axonal injury (CSF neurofilament light chain protein [NfL]) in 6 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms who had undergone a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Neurologic symptoms and signs included features of encephalopathies (4/6), suspected meningitis (1/6) and dysgeusia (1/6). SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by rtPCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the plasma of 2 patients (Cycle threshold [Ct] value 35.0-37.0) and in CSF at low levels (Ct 37.2, 38.0, 39.0) in 3 patients in one but not in a second rtPCR assay.

Rehabilitation clinics are already offering cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an effective treatment for long COVID and post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome based on the claims that it is effective for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)the most common post-infectious syndromeas no study into the efficacy of CBT for post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome has been published. Re-analyses of these studies, however, showed that CBT did not lead to objective improvements in heterogeneous groups of ME/CFS patients, nor did it restore the ability to work. The group of patients with long COVID and post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome, on the other hand, is homogeneous. We therefore analysed the Dutch Qure study, as it studied the efficacy of CBT in a homogeneous group of patients who developed Q-fever fatigue syndromewhich affects up to 30% of patientsafter the largest reported outbreak of Q-fever, to see if CBT might potentially be an effective treatment for long-haulers after COVID-19 infection. Our reanalysis found that the Qure study suffered from many serious methodological problems, which included relying on one subjective primary outcome in a study without a control group for the non-blinded CBT treatment group, using a post hoc definition of improvement, waiting 2 years before publishing their objective actometer results and ignoring the null effect of said results. Moreover, only 10% of participants achieved a clinically meaningful subjective improvement in fatigue as a result of CBT according to the studys own figures. Consequently, CBT has no subjective clinically meaningful effect in nine out of every ten patients that are treated with it. Additionally, the subjective improvement in fatigue was not matched by an improvement in disability, even though the disability was fatigue related according to the researchers. On top of this, CBT did not lead to an objective improvement in physical performance. Therefore, it cannot be said that CBT is an effective treatment for Q-fever fatigue syndrome either. It seems therefore unlikely that CBT will reduce disability or lead to objective improvement in long COVID or in post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome.","output":"Could Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Be an Effective Treatment for Long COVID and Post COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome?

OBJECTIVES: The pharmacological activity of 4-PSQ in depressive-like behavior associated with memory impairment induced by acute restraint stress (ARS) in male Swiss mice was evaluated. METHODS: ARS is an unavoidable stress model that was applied for a period of 240 min. Ten minutes after ARS, animals were intragastrically treated with canola oil (10 ml/kg) or 4-PSQ (10 mg/kg) or positive controls (paroxetine or donepezil) (10 mg/kg). Then, after 30 min, mice were submitted to behavioral tests. Corticosterone levels were evaluated in plasma and oxidative stress parameters; monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A and MAO -B isoform activity; mRNA expression levels of kappa nuclear factor B (NF-B); interleukin (IL)-1, IL-18, and IL-33; phosphatidylinositol-se-kinase (PI3K); protein kinase B (AKT2), as well as acetylcholinesterase activity were evaluated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. RESULTS: 4-PSQ attenuated the depressive-like behavior, self-care, and memory impairment caused by ARS. Based on the evidence, we believe that effects of 4-PSQ may be associated, at least in part, with the attenuation of HPA axis activation, attenuation of alterations in the monoaminergic system, modulation of oxidative stress, reestablishment of AChE activity, modulation of the PI3K/AKT2 pathway, and reduction of neuroinflammation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that 4-PSQ exhibited an antidepressant-like effect and attenuated the memory impairment induced by ARS, and it is a promising molecule to treat these comorbidities.","output":"Prospecting for a quinoline containing selenium for comorbidities depression and memory impairment induced by restriction stress in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Several publications described neurological manifestations caused by SARS-CoV-2. Immune-mediated neurological damages caused by COVID-19 are increasingly recognized. Case report A young male presented in March 2020 with a new-onset seizure.

Nasal PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, but the serology was positive, raising the suspicion of immune-mediated encephalitis. Elevated cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin G with two oligoclonal bands were also seen. The patient received IV immunoglobulin and showed improvement in headache. Follow-up MRIs of the brain revealed complete resolution of the lesion. Discussion Neurological complications from COVID-19 have been increasingly recognized. The proposed pathophysiology is either direct damage of neurological tissues, or indirectly through immune-mediated mechanisms. The timeline of the patient's presentation with seizure, as well as the lesion on the brain MRI with complete resolution after the IV immunoglobulin, strongly suggest that the patient had immune-mediated encephalitis after exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

WeCareAdvisor provides caregivers with disease information, daily tips, and a systematic approach for describing behaviors, investigating underlying causes, creating tailored strategies, and evaluating their effectiveness (DICE). The trial will enroll 326 caregivers nationwide, randomly assign them to immediately receive WeCareAdvisor (treatment), or a 3-month waitlist (control) and evaluate short (1- and 3-month) and long-term (6-month) outcomes for caregiver distress with and confidence managing BPSD, and BPSD occurrences. We will also evaluate utilization patterns with different prompting conditions: high-intensity (telephone and email reminders), low-intensity (email reminders), or no reminders to use WeCareAdvisor. COVID-19 necessitated design modifications resulting in greater inclusivity of caregivers from diverse races, ethnicities, and geographic areas. Key modifications include shifting from in-home, in-person interviewing to telephone; adjusting tool functionality from operating on a grant-funded iPad to caregivers' personal internet-capable devices; and expanding recruitment from one metropolitan area to nationwide.

Conversely, significantly more patients developed at least one VAP episode in C-ARDS as compared with NC-ARDS: 58 (64%) vs. 36 (44%), p = 0.007. The probability of VAP was significantly higher in C-ARDS after adjusting on death and ventilator weaning [sub-hazard ratio = 1.72 (1.14-2.52), p < 0.01].

In the virulent Miller strain of TGEV, ORF 3b is 5-terminal on mRNA 3C1 and is presumably translated following 5 cap-dependent ribosomal entry. For three other strains of TGEV, the virulent British FS772/70 and Taiwanese TFI and avirulent Purdue-116, mRNA species 3C1 is not made and ORF 3b is present as a non-overlapping second ORF on mRNA 3. ORF 3b begins at base 432 on mRNA 3 in Purdue strain. In vitro expression of ORF 3b from Purdue mRNA 3-like transcripts did not fully conform to a predicted leaky scanning pattern, suggesting ribosomes might also be entering internally. With mRNA 3-like transcripts modified to carry large ORFs upstream of ORF 3a, it was demonstrated that ribosomes can reach ORF 3b by entering at a distant downstream site in a manner resembling ribosomal shunting. Deletion analysis failed to identify a postulated internal ribosomal entry structure (IRES) within ORF 3a. The results indicate that an internal entry mechanism, possibly in conjunction with leaky scanning, is used for the expression of ORF 3b from TGEV mRNA 3.

Insufficient knowledge and training of frontline medical staff, such as nurses, interns, and residents, may lead to an increase in acute and chronic complications among patients with diabetes. However, interns have insufficient knowledge about diabetes management. The factors that affect interns current level of diabetes-related knowledge are still unclear. Therefore, understanding the behavioral intentions of interns is essential to supporting the development and promotion of the use of virtual simulation teaching applications. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the determinants of nursing interns intentions to use simulation-based education applications. METHODS: From December 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021, the web-based survey tool Sojump (Changsha Xingxin Information Technology Co) was used to survey nursing interns in hospitals across China. Two survey links were sent to 37 partner schools in 23 major cities in China, and they were disseminated through participants WeChat networks. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the association between demographic information and basic disease information and the use of the application for treating adult patients. RESULTS: Overall, 883 nursing interns from 23 provinces in China responded to the survey. Among them, the virtual simulation utilization rate was 35.6% (314/883) and the awareness rate was 10.2% (90/883). In addition, among the interns, only 10.2% (90/883) correctly understood the concept of virtual simulation, and most of them (793/883, 89.8%) believed that scenario-simulation training or the use of models for teaching are all the same. Multiple regression analysis showed that the educational level, independent learning ability, and professional identity of the interns were related to use of the application (P<.05). Skills and knowledge that the interns most wanted to acquire included the treatment of hypoglycemia (626/883, 70.9%), functional test simulation (610/883, 69.1%), and blood glucose monitoring technology (485/883, 54.9%). A total of 60.5% (534/883) of the interns wanted to acquire clinical thinking skills, while 16.0% (141/883) wanted to acquire operational skills. Nursing trainees believed that the greatest obstacles to virtual simulation included limited time (280/883, 31.7%), the degree of simulation (129/883, 14.6%), the demand for satisfaction (108/883, 12.2%), and test scores (66/883, 7.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The understanding and usage rate of diabetes virtual simulation teaching applications by Chinese nursing interns is very low. However, they have high requirements regarding this teaching method.

The first case with symptoms of hyperglycemia and inaugural diabetic ketoacidosis, without detecting a precipitating factor;the second case accidentally diagnosed, in the absence of hyperglycemia symptoms;and the last case in the context of symptoms of hyperglycemia and ketosis precipitated by a respiratory infection. The cases are characterized by the presence of autoimmunity markers (anti-GAD positive antibodies) and C-peptide within normal range. In dynamics, with the initiation of insulin therapy and the remission of glucotoxicity, the insulin requirement decreased progressively, in all patients therapeutic regimen being represented by a low dose of basal insulin, in the conditions of a C-peptide still within normal limits at 4 years (first case), 1 year (second case), respectively 2 years (third case) from the diagnosis and without significant glycemic variability registered on the continuous glycemic monitoring system. In the third case, there is a lack of regression of insulin requirements after remission of SARS COV-2 infection, and in the second case, the maintenance of prandial insulin secretion sufficient to induce hypoglycemia after administration of a minimal dose of prandial insulin, but insufficient to control post-prandial glycemia in the conditions of omitting the administration of prandial insulin.

This review provides my perspective on the field during this period, integrating fundamental and applied developments and milestones. Our basic understanding of the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis led to overcoming the failure of farmed fish to ovulate and spawn in captivity, allowing us to close the fish life cycle and establish a predictable, year-round production of eggs. Dissecting the molecular and hormonal mechanisms associated with sex determination and differentiation drove technologies for producing better performing mono-sex and reproductively-sterile fish. The growing contingent of passionate fish biologists, together with the availability of innovative platforms such as transgenesis and gene editing, as well as new models such as the zebrafish and medaka, have generated many discoveries, also leading to new insights of reproductive biology in higher vertebrates including humans. Consequently, fish have now been widely accepted as vertebrate reproductive models. Perhaps the best testament of the progress in our discipline is demonstrated at the International Symposia on Reproductive Physiology of Fish (ISRPF), at which our scientific family has convened every four years since the grandfather of the field, the late Ronald Billard, organized the inaugural 1977 meeting in Paimpont, France. As the one person who has been fortunate enough to attend all of these meetings since their inception, I have witnessed first-hand the astounding evolution of our field as we capitalized on the molecular and biotechnological revolutions in the life sciences, which enabled us to provide a higher resolution of fish reproductive and endocrine processes, answer more questions, and dive into deeper comprehension. Undoubtedly, the next (five) decades will be similarly exciting as we continue to integrate physiology with genomics, basic and translational research, and the small fish models with the aquacultured species.","output":"Fish reproductive biology - reflecting on five decades of fundamental and translational research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O artigo apresenta resultados da pesquisa de opini?o realizada no Brasil sobre a percep??o do isolamento social durante a pandemia de COVID-19.

Most were ecological studies at the county or regional level which disregard important local variability and relied on data from only the first few months of the pandemic. Using COVID-19 deaths identified from death certificates in California, we evaluated whether long-term ambient air pollution was related to weekly COVID-19 mortality at the census tract-level during the first 12 months of the pandemic. Weekly COVID-19 mortality for each census tract was calculated based on geocoded death certificate data. Annual average concentrations of ambient particulate matter <2.5 m (PM(2.5)) and <10 m (PM(10)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and ozone (O(3)) over 2014C2019 were assessed for all census tracts using inverse distance-squared weighting based on data from the ambient air quality monitoring system. Negative binomial mixed models related weekly census tract COVID-19 mortality counts to a natural cubic spline for calendar week. We included adjustments for potential confounders (census tract demographic and socioeconomic factors), random effects for census tract and county, and an offset for census tract population. Data were analyzed as two study periods: Spring/Summer (March 16-October 18, 2020) and Winter (October 19, 2020CMarch 7, 2021). Mean (standard deviation) concentrations were 10.3 (2.1) g/m(3) for PM(2.5), 25.5 (7.1) g/m(3) for PM(10), 11.3 (4.0) ppb for NO(2), and 42.8 (6.9) ppb for O(3).

Vaccine hesitancy may be a major barrier to achieving equitable herd immunity and must be addressed to reduce the excess morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in disproportionately affected communities. This study aimed to determine if COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and its factors vaccine complacency and confidence, are more prominent among disproportionately affected racial minority groups. Methods:We collected data from participants aged 18 years or older from the four most populous U.S. states, including New York, California, Florida, and Texas, and Canada. Data were collected using a web-based survey platform. Data are available at http://www.covid19-database.com. Results:Data from 4,434 participants were included [mean (SD) age = 48.7 (17.2) and 50.4% women]. Vaccine hesitancy was higher in Black, Indigenous (Native American and Indigenous People of Canada, including First Nations, Inuit and Mtis), and Latinx compared to White participants, while no difference was found between East Asian and White participants. The group differences in vaccine hesitancy for Indigenous and Black compared to White participants remained after controlling for sociodemographic factors. Determinants of vaccine complacency were equivalent between disproportionately affected racial groups and white participants. Vaccine confidence (i.e., trust in vaccine benefit) was generally lower in all racial groups compared to White participants. Differences in vaccine mistrust comparing Black and East Asian to White participants remained after controlling for sociodemographic factors. Discussion:Disproportionately affected racial minorities may have higher vaccine hesitancy and lower confidence in COVID-19 vaccines.

In an effort to reduce the severity of organ dysfunction, including respiratory insufficiency, monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) that block the interleukin-6 receptor, such as tocilizumab, sarilumab, and siltuximab, are under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19. However, blocking of just one of the many cytokines involved in the inflammatory reaction may not slow down the magnitude of the process. Since timing is important, the immune deficiency induced by IL6 blockade at the late immunodeficiency phase of sepsis that follows the initial inflammatory response may be detrimental. Finally, monitoring the degree and duration of IL6 blockade may be challenging because of the long half-life of Mabs (2-3 weeks). Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines act through a common JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which can be inhibited by JAK-STAT inhibitors. Ruxolitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective for JAK1, 2, blocks many pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL6. Ruxolitinib has favorable pharmacodynamics and an acceptable safety profile. The short half-life (4-6 h) of the drug offers the opportunity for ideal monitoring of the degree and duration of cytokine blocking, simply by the adjusting dose and duration of therapy. From a theoretical point of view, the balanced control of cytokine blockade throughout the course of the septic process should be the cornerstone of modern management. According to this hypothesis, maximization of blocking should be attempted at the phase of hyper-inflammation for preventing severe organ damage, while pro-inflammatory blockade should be minimized at the late phase of immunoparalysis for prevention of secondary infections. Based on the above considerations, we consider that the efficacy and safety of this drug deserves testing in the context of a controlled randomized trial.","output":"Interleukin-6 Blocking vs. JAK-STAT Inhibition for Prevention of Lung Injury in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently released interim numbers from advanced vaccine candidate clinical trials suggest that a COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) of >90% is achievable. However, SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics are highly heterogeneous and exhibit localized bursts of transmission, which may lead to sharp localized peaks in the number of new cases, often followed by longer periods of low incidence. Here we show that, for interim estimates of VE, these characteristic bursts in SARS-CoV-2 infection may introduce a strong positive bias in VE. Specifically, we generate null models of vaccine effectiveness, i.e., random models with bursts that over longer periods converge to zero VE but that for interim periods frequently produce apparent VE near 100%. As an example, by following the relevant clinical trial protocol, we can reproduce recently reported interim outcomes from an ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of an RNA-based vaccine candidate. Thus, to avoid potential random biases in VE, it is suggested that interim estimates on COVID-19 VE should control for the intrinsic inhomogeneity in both SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and reported cases.","output":"Interim estimates in null models of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has already caused in excess of 1.25 million deaths worldwide, and the number is increasing.

Hence, we used time point meta-analysis to investigate available SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in-vitro transcriptome datasets in order to identify the significant genes and pathways that are dysregulated at each time point. The subsequent over-representation analysis (ORA) revealed that several pathways are significantly dysregulated at each time point after both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection.

Moreover, COVID-19 was renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).

In this article, we offer a perspective on teaching an online Global Health course to engineering students. RESULTS: The course, taught by a physician, provides a grounding in basic medical, scientific and engineering principles and is available to students of diverse engineering specialties. Students developed skills and gained confidence in active listening, sourcing and critical appraisal of information, interdisciplinary teamwork, needs assessment, problem analysis, problem-solving, effective communication, and organisation and delivery of information (in English). Students learned the importance of engineering in landmark historical public health projects, the delivery of modern health care, and the pressing need to develop engineering solutions to current global health problems. Course assessment was formative: 20% attendance and active participation in online classes, 30% problem-solving, 30% student presentations, and 20% written abstracts for two class projects: historical innovations and medicine in the future.

The objective was to know the impact of vaccination against COVID-19 on the hospitalization of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital mortality and readmissions for this cause, and to describe the characteristics of vaccinated patients who required admission. METHODS A retrospective, observational epidemiological study was conducted of all patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a diagnostic test for active infection (PDIA) in a tertiary hospital, from January 2021 to June 2021. The incidence of admissions was calculated based on the vaccination status of the patients and age groups at different times according to the progress of the strategy of vaccination COVID-19. RESULTS Between December 27, 2020 and June 30, 2021, 1,308 patients with positive PDIA were admitted to the University Hospital of Salamanca, of which 1,167 (89.2%) were not vaccinated, 129 (9.9%) had received one dose of vaccine and 12 (0.9%) were fully vaccinated. Of the latter, none were admitted to the ICU and 2 died.

However, the use of dental services is determined by complex phenomena related to the individual, the environment and practices in which care is offered. Therefore, factors associated with dental appointments scheduling can affect positively or negatively the use of dental services. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the indicators for dental appointment scheduling in Primary Health Care (PHC). METHODS: The present is a cross-sectional analytical study that used data from the external assessment of the third cycle of the National Program for Improving Access and Quality in Primary Care (PMAQ-AB), carried out between 2017 and 2018, in Brazil. The final sample consisted of 85,231 patients and 22,475 Oral Health teams (OHTs). The outcome variable was the fact that the user sought for a dental appointment at the Primary Health Care Unit. A multilevel analysis was carried out to verify the association between individual variables (related to users) and contextual variables (related to the OHTs) in relation to the outcome. RESULTS: Only 58.1% of the users interviewed at these Primary Health Care Units seek the available dental care. The variables with the greatest effect on the outcome were the patients age up to 42 years old (OR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.96C2.10), at individual level, and oral health teams that assisted no more than a single family health team (FHT) (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.23C1.36) at contextual level. Other variables were also associated with the outcome, but with a smaller effect size. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, users age and work process of OHT were indicators for dental appointment scheduling. Our results suggest that when OHT put the National Oral Health Policy guidelines into practice, by assisting only one FHT, the chance for PHC users seeking dental appointments is higher than OHTs that assist more than one FHT. Regarding age, patients aged up to 42 years are more likely to seek an appointment with a dentist.

Subgroup analysis included impact of early (< 96 hours) vs late ( 96 hours) TCZ therapy on IM. RESULTS: Between March 25 to May 6, 2020, 170 patients met criteria and received TCZ. There were 83 non-ICU patients and 87 in the ICU. Forty five patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). ICU patients tended to be obese, receive 2 doses of TCZ and have longer length of stay. Overall CI was seen in 71% of patients. CI was higher in non-ICU vs ICU patients (85.5% vs 57.5%, P=0.002). Overall IM was 18.8%; however, IM was lower in non-ICU vs ICU patients (8.4% vs 28.7%, P=0.0014). IM was higher in patients on IMV vs. non-IMV (30% vs 15.4%, P=0.03). Risk factors of ICU admission, BMI  30 kg/m2 and AKI were associated with higher risk of IM. Many IM patients were made comfort care. No differences were observed in early vs late TCZ therapy on inpatient mortality, but there was a trend toward lower mortality with early TCZ. COS Review of Tocilizumab Patients [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: TCZ is an effective treatment option in patients with SARS-CoV-2 patients at risk of CRS. Patients receiving TCZ in non-ICU setting had a better response to treatment compared to ICU patients. Obesity and AKI were associated with higher risk of mortality, but there was no statistical difference in early vs late therapy.

In Sainte-Anne Hospital (GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neuroscience, Paris, France) we have observed a lower incidence of symptomatic forms of COVID-19 among patients than among our clinical staff. This observation led us to hypothesize that psychotropic drugs could have a prophylactic action against SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients from the symptomatic and virulent forms of this infection, since several of these psychotropic drugs have documented antiviral properties. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a phenothiazine derivative, is also known for its antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recentin vitro studies have reported that CPZ exhibits anti-MERS-CoV and anti-SARS-CoV-1 activity. METHODS: In this context, the ReCoVery study aims to repurpose CPZ, a molecule with an excellent tolerance profile and a very high biodistribution in the saliva, lungs and brain. We hypothesize that CPZ could reduce the unfavorable course of COVID-19 infection among patients requiring respiratory support without the need for ICU care, and that it could also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we plan a pilot, multicenter, randomized, single blind, controlled, phase III therapeutic trial (standard treatment vs. CPZ+standard treatment). CONCLUSION: This repurposing of CPZ for its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity could offer an alternative, rapid strategy to alleviate infection severity. This repurposing strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, and could save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easily managed side effects.","output":"Repurposing chlorpromazine to treat COVID-19: The reCoVery study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severity of the novel 2019 Coronavirus leaves much trepidation, anxiety and desperate measures are taken to curb the pandemic.

This free service aims to promote psychological resilience and alleviate pandemic-associated stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the feedback, satisfaction, experience, and perceptions of Text4Hope subscribers and to examine any differences based on gender after subscribers received 6 weeks of daily supportive text messages. Additionally, this study examined subscribers' anticipated receptivity to technology-based medical services that could be offered during major crises, emergencies, or pandemics. METHODS: Individuals self-subscribed to Text4Hope to receive daily supportive text messages for 3 months. Subscribers were invited to complete a web-based survey at 6 weeks postintervention to provide service satisfaction-related information. Overall satisfaction was assessed on a scale of 0-10, and satisfaction scores were analyzed using a related-measures t test. Likert scale satisfaction responses were used to assess various aspects of the Text4Hope program. Gender differences were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi-square analyses. RESULTS: A total of 2032 subscribers completed the baseline and 6-week surveys; 1788 (88%) were female, 219 (10.8%) were male, and 25 (1.2%) were other gender. The mean age of study participants was 44.58 years (SD 13.45 years). The mean overall satisfaction score was 8.55 (SD 1.78), suggesting high overall satisfaction with Text4Hope. The ANOVA analysis, which was conducted using the Welch test (n=1716), demonstrated that females had significantly higher mean satisfaction scores than males (8.65 vs 8.11, respectively; mean difference=0.546; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.91; P<.001) and nonsignificantly lower satisfaction scores than other gender respondents (mean difference=-0.938; 95% CI -0.37 to 2.25; P=.15). More than 70% of subscribers agreed that Text4Hope helped them cope with stress (1334/1731, 77.1%) and anxiety (1309/1728, 75.8%), feel connected to a support system (1400/1729, 81%), manage COVID-19-related issues (1279/1728, 74%), and improve mental well-being (1308/1731, 75.6%). Similarly, subscribers agreed that messages were positive, affirmative, and succinct. Messages were always or often read by 97.9% (1681/1716) of respondents, and more than 20% (401/1716, 23.4%) always or often returned to messages. The majority of subscribers (1471/1666, 88.3%) read the messages and either reflected upon them or took a positive action. Subscribers welcomed almost all technology-based services as part of their health care during crisis or emergency situations. Text4Hope was perceived to be effective by many female subscribers, who reported higher satisfaction and improved coping after receiving text messages for 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents affirmed the high quality of the text messages with their positive feedback. Technology-based services can provide remotely accessible and population-level interventions that align with the recommended physical distancing practices for pandemics. Text4Hope subscriber feedback revealed high satisfaction and acceptance at 6 weeks postintervention.

Specifically, researchers sought to understand if pharmacy patients were comfortable with being immunized by a pharmacy technician, and also if knowing the technician personally, knowing that the technician was trained to immunize, the waiting time, or the patient age were factors that changed the patient comfort level. METHODS Qualitative, semi-structured, key informant interviews were conducted using a 12-item interview script. Participants were walk-in patients from 3 chain community pharmacies in a state in which technicians have not started to administer immunizations, but in which the practice is not prohibited. RESULTS A total of 46 pharmacy patients were interviewed and the following 4 themes emerged from the resulting transcripts: pharmacy patients support immunization by pharmacy technicians to increase the accessibility and decrease the waiting time, even for pediatric patients; patients value positive, trusting relationships with the pharmacy team, and knowing technicians had proper immunization technique training added to the patients' feelings of comfort; participants believed that allowing technicians to immunize would broaden the technician's responsibilities and balance the workload among the pharmacy team; and some patients still choose not to be vaccinated at a pharmacy.

Histological analysis showed that the hair follicles in the mutants were arrested at stage 2 of hair development. The density of hair follicles in the mutant mice was also lower compared to that in the control mice. Overexpression of Fgf8 inhibited the proliferation of epidermal cells and simultaneously promoted apoptosis, leading to the arrest of hair follicle development. Further analysis showed that sonic hedgehog (Shh) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) were downregulated and upregulated, respectively.

Social distancing, face masks and other rules have reshaped our way of living during the last year. The impact of these measures for indoor establishments, such as education or hostelry businesses, resulted in a considerable organisation problem. Achieving a table distribution inside these indoor spaces that fulfilled the distancing requirements while trying to allocate the maximum number of tables for enduring the pandemic has proved to be a considerable task for multiple establishments. This problem, defined as the Table Location Problem (TLP), is categorised as NP-Hard, thus a metaheuristic resolution is recommended. In our previous works, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimisation was proposed for optimising the table distribution in real classrooms. However, the proposed algorithm performed poorly for high obstacle density scenarios, especially when allocating a considerable number of tables due to the existing dependency between adjacent tables in the distance distribution. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce for the first time, to the authors best knowledge, a Memetic Algorithm (MA) optimisation that improves the previously designed GA through the introduction of a Gradient Based Local Search. Multiple configurations have been analysed for a real hostelry-related scenario and a comparison between methodologies has been performed. Results show that the proposed MA optimisation obtained adequate solutions that the GA was unable to reach, demonstrating a superior convergence performance and an overall greater flexibility. The MA performance denoted its value not only from a COVID-19 distancing perspective but also as a flexible managing algorithm for daily table arrangement, thus fulfilling the main objectives of this paper.","output":"Optimal COVID-19 Adapted Table Disposition in Hostelry for Guaranteeing the Social Distance through Memetic Algorithms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Covid-19 pandemic shocked and locked whole world in year 2019 and 2020.

PATIENTS Between 2009 and 2011, of 4,012 H1N1-infected patients, 38 patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure were enrolled. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Thirty-eight patients with confirmed H1N1 pneumonia and on mechanical ventilatory support were randomized to receive adjuvant treatment of corticosteroids with an mTOR inhibitor, either with sirolimus (Rapamune 2 mg/d) (sirolimus group, n = 19) for 14 days or without sirolimus (nonsirolimus group, n = 19). The clinical values measured included PaO2/FIO2, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, duration of ventilatory support, and mortality. The baseline demography was similar between the two groups. After treatment, the PaO2/FIO2 values on day 3 (167.5 [95% CI, 86.7-209.2 mm Hg], n = 19 vs 106.8 [95% CI, 73.0-140.7 mm Hg], n = 19; p = 0.025] and day 7 (241.6 [95% CI, 185.2-297.9 mm Hg], n = 19 vs 147.0 [95% CI, 100.7-193.7 mm Hg], n = 17; p = 0.008) in the sirolimus group were significantly better over the nonsirolimus group. Similarly, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on day 3 (4.3 [95% CI, 3.1-5.5]; p = 0.029) and day 7 (5.9 [95% CI, 4.8-6.9], n = 19 and 6.2 [95% CI, 4.7-7.8], n = 17, respectively) significantly improved in the sirolimus group. The liberation from a mechanical ventilator at 3 months was also better in the sirolimus combined with corticosteroids treatment.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess myths, beliefs, perceptions, and information gaps about COVID-19 in Ethiopia. METHODS: An internet-based survey was conducted in Ethiopia from April 22 to May 04, 2020. The survey link was promoted through emails, social media, and the Jimma University website. Perceptions about COVID-19 have considered the World Health Organization (WHO) resources and local beliefs. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 20.0. Classifications and lists of factors for each thematic perception of facilitators, inhibitors, and information needs were generated. Explanatory factor analysis (EFA) was executed to assist categorizations. Standardized mean scores of the categories were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests. A significant difference was claimed at p-value <0.05. RESULTS: A total of 929 responses were gathered during the study period. The EFA generated two main categories of perceived facilitators of COVID-19 spread: behavioral non-adherence (55.9%) and lack of enablers (86.5%). Behavioral non-adherence was illustrated by fear of stigma (62.9%), not seeking care (59.3%), and hugging and shaking (44.8%). Perceived lack of enablers of precautionary measures includes staying home impossible due to economic challenges (92.4%), overcrowding (87.6%), and inaccessible face masks (81.6%) and hand sanitizers (79.1%). Perceived inhibitors were categorized into three factors: two misperceived, myths (31.6%) and false assurances (32.9%), and one correctly identified; engagement in standard precautions (17.1%). Myths about protection from the virus involve perceived religiosity and effectiveness of selected food items, hot weather, traditional medicine, and alcohol drinking, ranging from 15.1% to 54.7%. False assurances include people's perception that they were living far away from areas where COVID-19 was rampant (36.9%), and no locally reported cases were present (29.5%). There were tremendous information needs reported about COVID-19 concerning protection methods (62.6%), illness behavior and treatment (59.5%), and quality information, including responses to key unanswered questions such as the origin of the virus (2.4%). Health workers were perceived as the most at-risk group (83.3%). The children, adolescents, youths were marked at low to moderate (45.1%-62.2%) risk of COVID-19. Regional, township, and access to communication showed significant variations in myths, false assurances, and information needs (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Considering young population as being at low risk of COVID-19 would be challenging to the control efforts, and needs special attention. Risk communication and community engagement efforts should consider regional and township variations of myths and false assurances. It should also need to satisfy information needs, design local initiatives that enhance community ownership of the control of the virus, and thereby support engagement in standard precautionary measures. All forms of media should be properly used and regulated to disseminate credible information while filtering out myths and falsehoods.","output":"Myths, beliefs, and perceptions about COVID-19 in Ethiopia: A need to address information gaps and enable combating efforts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New evidence on the COVID-19 pandemic is being published daily. Ongoing high-quality assessment of this literature is therefore needed to enable clinical practice to be evidence-based. This review builds on a previous scoping review and aimed to identify associations between disease severity and various clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics. We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Scopus and LILACS for studies published between January 1, 2019 and March 22, 2020. Clinical studies including 10 patients with confirmed COVID-19 of any study design were eligible. Two investigators independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A quality effects model was used for the meta-analyses. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression identified sources of heterogeneity. For hospitalized patients, studies were ordered by overall disease severity of each population and this order was used as the modifier variable in meta-regression. Overall, 86 studies (n = 91,621) contributed data to the meta-analyses. Severe disease was strongly associated with fever, cough, dyspnea, pneumonia, any computed tomography findings, any ground glass opacity, lymphocytopenia, elevated C-reactive protein, elevated alanine aminotransferase, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, older age and male sex. These variables typically increased in prevalence by 30C73% from mild/early disease through to moderate/severe disease. Among hospitalized patients, 30C78% of heterogeneity was explained by severity of disease. Elevated white blood cell count was strongly associated with more severe disease among moderate/severe hospitalized patients. Elevated lymphocytes, low platelets, interleukin-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and D-dimers showed potential associations, while fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, consolidation and septal thickening showed non-linear association patterns. Headache and sore throat were associated with the presence of disease, but not with more severe disease. In COVID-19, more severe disease is strongly associated with several clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics. Symptoms and other variables in early/mild disease appear non-specific and highly heterogeneous.

Methods: A longitudinal study enrolling healthcare professionals and concurrent serial cross-sectional studies of unselected all-comer patients were conducted at an Austrian academic medical center. Healthcare workers were tested at enrollment and after 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months. The cross-sectional studies in patients were conducted at 3 time periods, which roughly coincided with the times after the first, second, and third wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria (i.e., August 24 - September 7, 2020;February 8 - 22, 2021, and November 9 - 23, 2021). Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein antigen were measured using a sandwich electrochemiluminescence assay (Roche). We estimated the seroprevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CI) according to the Wilson score method. Findings: In total, 2,735 and 9,275 samples were measured in 812 healthcare workers (median age 40 years, 78% female) and 8,451patients (median age 55 years, 52% female), respectively. Over the entire study period, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 98 of 812 healthcare workers, resulting in a seroprevalence of 121% (95% CI 100% to 145%), which did not differ significantly (P=063) from that of the all-comer patient population at the end of the study period (407/3184;128%, 95% CI 117% to 140%). The seroprevalence between healthcare workers and patients did not differ significantly at any time and was 15 to 2-fold higher than the number of confirmed cases in Austria throughout the pandemic. In particular, there was no significant difference in the seroprevalence between pediatric and adult patients at any of the tested time periods. Interpretation: Throughout the pandemic, healthcare staff and an adult and pediatric all-comer patient population had similar exposure to SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest that the established hospital containment policies were effective.","output":"Comparison of the Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein Antibodies in Healthcare Workers and an Unselected Adult and Pediatric All-Comer Patient Population in Austria (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Despite advancements in the areas of omics and chemoinformatics, potent novel biotherapeutic molecules with new modes of actions are needed for leishmaniasis. The socioeconomic burden of leishmaniasis remains alarming in endemic regions. Currently, reports from existing endemic areas such as Nepal, Iran, Brazil, India, Sudan and Afghanistan, as well as newly affected countries such as Peru, Bolivia and Somalia indicate concerns of chemoresistance to the classical antimonial treatment. As a result, effective antileishmanial agents which are safe and affordable are urgently needed. Natural products from both flora and fauna have contributed immensely to chemotherapeutics and serve as vital sources of new chemical agents. This review focuses on a systematic cross-sectional view of all characterized anti-leishmanial compounds from natural sources over the last decade. Furthermore, IC(50)/EC(50), cytotoxicity and suggested mechanisms of action of some of these natural products are provided. The natural product classification includes alkaloids, terpenes, terpenoids, and phenolics. The plethora of reported mechanisms involve calcium channel inhibition, immunomodulation and apoptosis.

In standard small-scale circulation simulations, it is shown that the conventional approach incorporates a pseudo diffusive effect that is almost as large as the effect of the turbulent diffusion model; hence the numerical solution is rendered inconsistent with the PDEs. This oscillation causes inaccuracy and computational uncertainty. Of all the schemes tested, only the PINNs approximation accurately predicted the outcome.

Thus, it provoked challenges to the routine management protocol. In this study, we summarized our experience in the emergency management of aSAH (Beijing Tiantan Protocol, BTP) in Beijing, China. Methods: : Demographic, clinical, and imaging data of consecutive emergency aSAH patients who underwent craniotomy clipping during the COVID-19 epidemic season were reviewed and compared with the retrospective period last year. Subgroup analysis was further performed to assess the outcomes of different screening results and several detailed protocols. Neurological outcomes were evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Results: : A total of 127 aSAH referred to our emergency department, and 42 (33.1%) underwent craniotomy clipping between January 20, 2020, and March 25, 2020. The incidence of preoperative hospitalized adverse events, and the perioperative outcomes were similar (-0.1, 95% CI -1.0 to 0.8, P =0.779) to the retrospective period last year (2019.01-2019.03). After the propensity score matching (PSM), there were still no statistical differences in prognostic parameters between the two groups. 8 (19.0%) of the 42 individuals were initially screened as preliminary undetermined COVID-19 cases, in which 2 of them underwent craniotomy clipping in the negative pressure operating room (OR). The prognosis of patients with varied COVID-19 screening results was similar (F(2, 39)=0.393, P =0.678). Since February 28, 12 cases (28.6%) received COVID-19 nucleic acid testing (NAT) upon admission, and all showed negative. The false-negative rate was 0.0%. The preoperative hospitalized adverse events and postoperative prognosis were still similar between patients with and without COVID-19 NAT (-0.3, 95% CI -1.4 to 0.9, P =0.653).

The commonly anti-hypertensive drugs are the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and beta-blockers. The association between commonly used anti-hypertensive medications and the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients with hypertension has not been well studied. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included all patients admitted with COVID-19 to Huo Shen Shan Hospital and Guanggu District of the Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China. Clinical and laboratory characteristics were extracted from electronic medical records. Hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatment were confirmed by medical history and clinical records. The primary clinical endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included the rates of patients in common wards transferred to the intensive care unit and hospital stay duration. Logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors associated with mortality and prognosis. Propensity score matching was used to balance the confounders between different anti-hypertensive treatments. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare the cumulative recovery rate. Log-rank tests were performed to test for differences in Kaplan-Meier curves between different groups. RESULTS: Among 4569 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 31.7% (1449/4569) had a history of hypertension. There were significant differences in mortality rates between hypertensive patients with CCBs (7/359) and those without (21/359) (1.95% vs. 5.85%, risk ratio [RR]: 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13C0.76, (2) = 7.61, P = 0.0058). After matching for confounders, the mortality rates were similar between the RAAS inhibitor (4/236) and non-RAAS inhibitor (9/236) cohorts (1.69% vs. 3.81%, RR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.13C1.43, (2) = 1.98, P = 0.1596).

Recent data suggests an increased risk for personnel of gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy units for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Several societies have provided recommendations for the current situation, but their feasibility is unclear and real-world data on preparedness of endoscopy units are lacking. AIMS & METHODS: A web-based survey among German GI-endoscopy heads was conducted from April 1 to April 7, 2020. It comprised 33 questions based on the ESGE (European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) recommendations and was distributed electronically by the German Society of Gastroenterology, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS). RESULTS: Of 551 completed surveys, 202 (37a??%) endoscopy units cancelled less than 40a??% of their procedures. Small-volume units (<a??4000 procedures/year) cancelled significantly less procedures than high-volume units (>a??4000). Complete spatial separation of high-risk patients was possible in only 17a??%. Most units systematically identified patients at risk (91a??%) and used risk adapted personal protective equipment (PPE, 85a??%). For the future, shortages in PPE (83a??%), staff (69a??%) and relevant financial losses (80a??%) were expected. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations on structural measures were only partially fulfilled and cancellations of procedures were heterogeneous. Clear definitions of indications to perform endoscopies during such a pandemic are needed. Further, structural recommendations should be adapted and strategies to compensate financial losses need to be developed.","output":"Gastrointestinale Endoskopie in Zeiten der COVID-19-Pandemie: Umsetzung von Empfehlungen und Erwartungen fr die Zukunft./ [Challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic in gastrointestinal endoscopy: expectations and implementation of recommendations]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aims: Favipiravir is a ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) inhibitor antiviral agent used in the treatment of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

Nevertheless, the usefulness of such models has been subject to controversy. An evolution in the epidemiological modeling field is urgently needed, beginning with an agreed-upon set of modeling standards for policy recommendations. The objective of this article is to propose a set of modeling standards to support policy decision making. METHODS: We identify and describe 5 broad standards: transparency, heterogeneity, calibration and validation, cost-benefit analysis, and model obsolescence and recalibration. We give methodological recommendations and provide examples in the literature that employ these standards well. We also develop and demonstrate a modeling practices checklist using existing coronavirus disease 2019 literature that can be employed by readers, authors, and reviewers to evaluate and compare policy modeling literature along our formulated standards. RESULTS: We graded 16 articles using our checklist. On average, the articles met 6.81 of our 19 categories (36.7%). No articles contained any cost-benefit analyses and few were adequately transparent. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant room for improvement in modeling pandemic policy. Issues often arise from a lack of transparency, poor modeling assumptions, lack of a system-wide perspective in modeling, and lack of flexibility in the academic system to rapidly iterate modeling as new information becomes available. In anticipation of future challenges, we encourage the modeling community at large to contribute toward the refinement and consensus of a shared set of standards for infectious disease policy modeling.","output":"Where Do We Go From Here?: A Framework for Using Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered Models for Policy Making in Emerging Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The entry of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 into human lung cells can be inhibited by the approved drugs camostat and nafamostat.

As no experimental structure is available, we provide a model of the TMPRSS2 equilibrium structure and its fluctuations by relaxing an initial homology structure with extensive 330 microseconds of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) and Markov modeling. Through Markov modeling, we describe the binding process of both drugs and a metabolic product of camostat (GBPA) to TMPRSS2, reaching a Michaelis complex (MC) state, which precedes the formation of a long-lived covalent inhibitory state. We find that nafamostat has a higher MC population than camostat and GBPA, suggesting that nafamostat is more readily available to form the stable covalent enzymeCsubstrate intermediate, effectively explaining its high potency. This model is backed by our in vitro experiments and consistent with previous virus cell entry assays.

Here we use state-of-the-art deep neural networks over an institution-wide machine intelligence platform for the augmented curation of 8.2 million clinical notes from 14,967 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR diagnostic testing. By contrasting the Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived clinical phenotypes of COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos, n=272) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg, n=14,695) patients over each day of the week preceding the PCR testing date, we identify diarrhea (2.8-fold), change in appetite (2-fold), anosmia/dysgeusia (28.6-fold), and respiratory failure (2.1-fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients. The specific combination of cough and diarrhea has a 4-fold amplification in COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19 (4-7 days prior to typical PCR testing date). This study introduces an Augmented Intelligence platform for the real-time synthesis of institutional knowledge captured in EHRs. The platform holds tremendous potential for scaling up curation throughput, with minimal need for training underlying neural networks, thus promising EHR-powered early diagnosis for a broad spectrum of diseases.","output":"Augmented Curation of Unstructured Clinical Notes from a Massive EHR System Reveals Specific Phenotypic Signature of Impending COVID-19 Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using the PLFS 2018-19, this study intends to analyse current labour market from the perspective of COVID-19 pandemic, subsequent lockdown and the expected slowdown in the Indian economy.

Nurses are recognized as front-line responders to the COVID-19 pandemic and are crucial healthcare members to win the fight against the evolving COVID-19. Considering the long-lasting shortage of national nurses, and turnover of the current nursing workforce, it is essential to consider unconventional strategies aiming at expanding the national nursing workforce in order to embrace the impact of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to measure senior nursing students and interns willingness to treat patients with COVID-19. Further, this study investigated their feelings, knowledge, and concerns regarding treating patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This quantitative, cross-sectional study utilized self-reported survey gathered from a convenience sample of 178 senior nursing students and interns. A 7-item scale was used to measure the participants willingness to treat patients with COVID-19. The data were collected between March 2020 and April 2020. RESULTS: Out of 178 participants, 50.56% were at Level 8, 89.33% were single, and 53.37% had a very satisfactory grade point average. The highest proportion of the respondents (38.20%) felt neutral about treating patient with COVID-19, while 53.93% had good knowledge about COVID-19. The perceived willingness to treat of participants had an overall mean score of 20.19, which indicated neutral willingness to treat patients with COVID-19. Participants feelings about treating patients with COVID-19 predicted their willingness to treat patients with COVID-19 (P<0.001). CONCLUSION/RECOMMENDATION: There is a clear need for educational and training programs both in clinical practice and academia for the improvement among nursing students and interns who reported paucity of knowledge about COVID-19. Furthermore, hospital institutions should provide additional incentives or hazard protections to maintain and even increase the number of staff at the frontline who are willing to care for patients amid the deadly pandemic of COVID-19.","output":"Senior Nursing Students and Interns Concerns and Willingness to Treat Patients with COVID-19: A Strategy to Expand National Nursing Workforce during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of the Coronavirus SARS-2 is a major challenge that led almost all governments worldwide to take drastic measures to respond to the tragedy Chief among those measures is the massive lockdown of entire countries and cities, which beyond its global economic impact has created some deep social and psychological tensions within populations While the adopted mitigation measures (including the lockdown) have generally proven useful, policymakers are now facing a critical question: how and when to lift the mitigation measures?

We compared the outcomes between those with and without routine drain insertion. MATERIALS AND METHODS From July 2014 to October 2018, 178 PLDN were consecutively performed by a single surgeon. Since October 2016, we stopped routine insertion of a drain after PLDN. Thus, the former 80 drained routinely were defined as the Drainage group and the latter 98 were defined as the Non-drainage group. One patient drained non-routinely in the Non-drainage group was excluded from the final analysis. Operative and convalescence parameters and intra- and postoperative complications were compared between the groups. Intra- and postoperative complications within 90 days of surgery were graded using the Satava and Clavien-Dindo classifications, respectively. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups, except for concomitant surgery, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and preoperative glomerular filtration rate. All operative and convalescence parameters were similar between the groups, except for postoperative glomerular filtration rate. The rates of overall intra- (22.5% versus 28.9%, p=0.337) and postoperative (62.5% versus 59.8%, p=0.713) complications were similar between the groups.

The disease has aggressively spread around the world, including Indonesia. The emergence of COVID-19 has serious implications for public health and socio-economic development worldwide. No country is prepared to face COVID-19. Because of the rapid transmission of COVID-19, the early warning systems (EWS) in each country are not prepared to deal with it. Controlling and preventing COVID-19 transmission in an effective and efficient manner is critical not only for public health, but also for economic sustainability and long-term viability. Consequently, an efficient and effective EWS for COVID-19 is required. The EWS for COVID-19 must be capable of monitoring and forecasting the spatiotemporal transmission of COVID-19. This study demonstrates how an EWS could be a proactive system that would be able to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 and detect its sudden increase in small areas such as cities. Early COVID-19 data in Bandung, Indonesia from 17 March 2020 to 22 June 2020 was used to demonstrate the construction of an effective and efficient EWS using the spatiotemporal model.

The analysis focuses on examining opinions and expectations of adolescents regarding the introduced restrictions and their impact on civil liberties by investigating the pace, meaning and ways in which they are declared by the lawmaker. THE RESEARCH PROBLEM AND METHODS: The main research question is to determine how COVID-19 restrictions affect young people in Poland. Therefore, the research was conducted on a group of 308 respondents, using a diagnostic survey and questionnaire created for this purpose. THE PROCESS OF ARGUMENTATION: The paper consists of three parts. The first part analyses the legal acts that have been issued in Poland in order to counter the spread of COVID-19. The second part describes the research methodology, objectives and hypotheses as well as the profile of the examined respondents. The last part presents the results of the research. RESEARCH RESULTS: The research results show that young people generally negatively assess the legitimacy and pace of the introduced COVlD-19 restrictions. The assessment of those restrictions regarding their impact on civil liberties differed between males and females. Men indicated the closu e of restaurants, bars and caf as the biggest restriction, while women considered the ban on public assemblies as the restriction that most limited their civil liberties. CONCLUSIONS, INNOVATIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many areas of everyday life. In Poland, due to the state of epidemic emergency announced on March 12, 2020 (and the epidemic state on March 20, 2020), a number of restrictions and bans were introduced, which suspended or temporarily limited the functioning of many businesses, cultural and entertainment centres. The study concludes that according to the respondents, the restrictions introduced by the government were implemented hastily, and their justification was insufficient. The conducted studies present an important and present issue of the COVID-19 restrictions and may provide a basis for further research in this area, e.g., an analysis of the perception of pandemic restrictions among different age groups. The research also emphasizes that any changes to the legal order must be introduced in advance.","output":"Postrzegany wp?yw COVID-19 i zwi?zanych z nim ogranicze dla m?odych ludzi w Polsce"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has forced higher institutions to shift towards electronic (e) learning.

Notwithstanding this, limited research has addressed how e-learning experiences can be enhanced among medical students, who often need conventional leaning, especially for practical courses. This research addresses a gap in the knowledge and examined medical students perceptions of e-learning using the Blackboard platform, and the elements or predicators that affect their e-learning experience amid COVID-19 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. An online survey was transmitted to medical students in three main public universities. Based on the findings, a FLOWER model was proposed for improving e-learning experience using Blackboard among medical students. This model includes six dimensions: feedback, leverage to remain motivated, open resources and information, working together, evaluation, and reflection and knowledge. These dimensions are interrelated, and enable the creation of a positive e-learning experience. The results showed that four of the six dimensions have high positive and significant path coefficients: open sources and information; leverage to remain motivated; working together; and reflection and knowledge construction. Two of the six dimensions have low positive, but significant, path coefficients (feedback and evaluation), which require further consideration by policymakers and educators.

There was an unprecedented upsurge in biomedical journals' IF in 2020, perhaps contributed by the increased number of publications since the COVID-19 outbreak. We conducted a cross-sectional study (2018C2020) to analyze recent trends in standard bibliometrics (IF, Eigenfactor, SNIP) of pediatric journals. We also estimated reference and publication counts of biomedical journals since publication volume determines the number of citations offered and IF. METHODS: Various bibliometrics of pediatric journals and reference/publication volumes of biomedical journals were compared between 2020 vs. 2019 and 2019 vs. 2018. We also compared open access (OA) and subscription journals' trends. Finally, we estimated IF changes in the journals of a different specialty, pulmonology. RESULTS: The study included 164 pediatric and 4,918 biomedical journals (OA = 1,473, subscription = 3,445). Pediatric journals' IFs had increased significantly in 2020 [median (IQR) = 2.35 (1.34)] vs. 2019 [1.82 (1.22)] (Wilcoxon: p-value < 0.001). IFs were unchanged between 2018 and 2019. Eigenfactor remained stable between 2018 and 2020, while SNIP increased progressively. Reference/publication volumes of biomedical journals escalated between 2018 and 2020, and OA journals experienced faster growth than subscription journals. IFs of pulmonary journals also increased considerably in 2020 vs. 2019. CONCLUSIONS: We report an upsurge in pediatric journals' IF, perhaps contributed by a sudden increase in publication numbers in 2020. Therefore, considering this limitation, IF should be cautiously used as the benchmark of excellence. Unlike IF, Eigenfactor remained stable between 2018 and 2020. Similar changes in IF were also observed among the journals of another specialty, pulmonology.","output":"The Upsurge of Impact Factors in Pediatric Journals Post COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE SARS-CoV-2 first emerged in China in December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide.

We explored the birth and new parenting experiences of South African parents in 2020 during the Covid-19 lockdown. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with consenting parents of babies born in South Africa during 2020. Factors associated with negative birth emotions and probable depression were estimated using logistic regression. Results Most of the 520 respondents were females (n = 496, 95%) who gave birth at private hospitals (n = 426, 86%). Mothers reported having overall positive birth emotions (n = 399, 80%). Multivariable analysis showed that having a preterm baby (aOR 2.89; CI 1.51C5.53) and the mother self-reporting that Covid-19 affected her birth experience (aOR 4.25; CI 2.08C8.68) increased the odds of mothers reporting predominantly negative emotions about their birth. The mother having her preferred delivery method reduced the odds of having negative birth emotions (aOR 0.41; CI 0.25C0.66). Multivariable analysis showed that having predominantly negative emotions about the birth increased the odds of probable minor depression (aOR 3.60; CI 1.93C6.70). Being older reduced the odds of having probable minor depression (25?34 years aOR 0.36; CI 0.10C1.32; 35 years or older aOR 0.25; CI 0.06?0.91). Conclusions Lockdown exacerbated many birth and parenting challenges including mental health and health care access.

The lack of anti-COVID-19 treatment to date warrants urgent research into potential therapeutic targets. Virtual drug screening techniques enable the identification of novel compounds that are capable of targeting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (M pro ). The latter plays a fundamental role in mediating viral replication and transcription, rendering it an attractive drug target. In this study, twenty six novel halogenated, heterocyclic compounds, which can inhibit M pro , were tested by molecular docking combined with molecular dynamics simulation. Three compounds showed the highest binding affinity to the protein active site and their binding modes coincide with that of Nelfinavir. The binding of the halogenated compounds to M pro may inhibit the replication and transcription of SARS-CoV-2 and, ultimately, stop the virallife cycle. In times of dire need for anti-COVID-19 treatment, this study lays the groundwork for further experimental research to investigate the efficacy and potential medical uses of these compounds to treat COVID-19. Novel compounds including fused thiophene, pyrimidine and pyran derivatives were tested against human RNA N7-MTase (hRNMT) and selected viral N7-MTases such as SARS-CoV nsp14 and Vaccinia D1-D12 complex to evaluate their specificity and their molecular modeling was also studied in the aim of producing anti covid-19 target molecules.","output":"Synthesis of Novel Halogenated Heterocyclic compounds and their uses as Target SARS-CoV-2 main Protease (Mpro) and Potential Anti-Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional viral isolation by cell culture assays and conventional serological methods have been previously used to detect and identify various virus infections","output":"Molecular Virology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, knowledge transfer from pre-trained models showed outstanding performance in medical image classification.

This indicates that HIV-1 has emerged through the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees to humans. However, it remains unclear how SIVcpz has evolved into pandemic HIV-1 in humans. To address this question, we inoculated three SIVcpz strains (MB897, EK505, and MT145), four pandemic HIV-1 strains (NL4-3, NLCSFV3, JRCSF, and AD8), and two nonpandemic HIV-1 strains (YBF30 and DJO0131). Humanized mice infected with SIVcpz strain MB897, a virus phylogenetically similar to pandemic HIV-1, exhibited a peak viral load comparable to that of mice infected with pandemic HIV-1, while peak viral loads of mice infected with SIVcpz strain EK505 or MT145 as well as nonpandemic HIV-1 strains were significantly lower. These results suggest that SIVcpz strain MB897 is preadapted to humans, unlike the other SIVcpz strains. Moreover, viral RNA sequencing of MB897-infected humanized mice identified a nonsynonymous mutation in env, a G413R substitution in gp120. The infectivity of the gp120 G413R mutant of MB897 was significantly higher than that of parental MB897. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the gp120 G413R mutant of MB897 augments the capacity for viral replication in both in vitro cell cultures and humanized mice. Taken together, this is the first experimental investigation to use an animal model to demonstrate a gain-of-function evolution of SIVcpz into pandemic HIV-1.IMPORTANCE From the mid-20th century, humans have been exposed to the menace of infectious viral diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Ebola virus, and Zika virus. These outbreaks of emerging/reemerging viruses can be triggered by cross-species viral transmission from wild animals to humans, or zoonoses. HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS, emerged by the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz, the HIV-1 precursor in chimpanzees, around 100 years ago. However, the process by which SIVcpz evolved to become HIV-1 in humans remains unclear. Here, by using a hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized-mouse model, we experimentally recapitulate the evolutionary process of SIVcpz to become HIV-1. We provide evidence suggesting that a strain of SIVcpz, MB897, preadapted to infect humans over other SIVcpz strains. We further demonstrate a gain-of-function evolution of SIVcpz in infected humanized mice. Our study reveals that pandemic HIV-1 has emerged through at least two steps: preadaptation and subsequent gain-of-function mutations.","output":"Experimental Adaptive Evolution of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus SIVcpz to Pandemic Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 by Using a Humanized Mouse Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When faced with a threat, peoples estimate of risk guides their response. When danger is to the self as well as to others two estimates are generated: the risk to oneself and the risk to others. As these estimates likely differ, it is unclear how exactly they drive a response. To answer this question, we studied a large representative sample of Americans facing the COVID-19 pandemic at two time points (N1=1145, N2=683). We discover a paradoxical duality: a tendency to be optimistic about ones own risk of infection (private optimism) while at the same time to be pessimistic about the risk to others (public pessimism). These two estimates were found to be differentially related to affect and choice. First, private optimism, but not public pessimism, was associated with peoples positive feelings. The association between private optimism and positive affect was mediated by peoples sense of agency over their future. However, negative affect was related to both private risk perception and public risk perception. Second, people predominantly engaged in protective behaviors based on their estimated risk to the population rather than to themselves. This suggests that people were predominantly engaging in protective behaviors for the benefit of others.

Who is likely to infect whom and under what conditions and how long after becoming infected? These factors are the essence of transmission dynamics. Two groups using identical complex models can be expected to make different predictions simply because they make different choices for such transmission parameters in the model. A policy setter has no way to choose between their predictions. Simple models are not good for assessing contact tracing and detecting asymptomatic carriers, and do not replace agent-based models. However, we explain how simple models can be used to answer complex questions by adding what we call satellite equations, addressing questions involving age groups, death rates, and likelihood of transmission to nursing homes and to uninfected, isolated populations. Simple models are ideal for showing policy setters who are not mathematically sophisticated the kinds of interventions that are needed to achieve public goals. ABSTRACT: As the coronavirus pandemic spreads across the globe, people are debating policies to mitigate its severity. Many complex, highly detailed models have been developed to help policy setters make better decisions. However, the basis of these models is unlikely to be understood by non-experts. We describe the advantages of simple models for COVID-19. We say a model is simple if its only parameter is the rate of contact between people in the population. This contact rate can vary over time, depending on choices by policy setters. Such models can be understood by a broad audience, and thus can be helpful in explaining the policy decisions to the public. They can be used to evaluate the outcomes of different policies. However, simple models have a disadvantage when dealing with inhomogeneous populations. To augment the power of a simple model to evaluate complicated situations, we add what we call satellite equations that do not change the original model. For example, with the help of a satellite equation, one could know what his/her chance is of remaining uninfected through the end of an epidemic. Satellite equations can model the effects of the epidemic on high-risk individuals, death rates, and nursing homes and other isolated populations. To compare simple models with complex models, we introduce our slightly complex Model J. We find the conclusions of simple and complex models can be quite similar. However, for each added complexity, a modeler may have to choose additional parameter values describing who will infect whom under what conditions, choices for which there is often little rationale but that can have big impacts on predictions. Our simulations suggest that the added complexity offers little predictive advantage.","output":"When the Best Pandemic Models are the Simplest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of different mesh fixation suture materials on the risk of recurrence after Lichtenstein inguinal hernioplasty.

In this case-based review, we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, imaging findings, and in-hospital course of acute myocarditis. In addition, the limitations of the myocarditis diagnosis were discussed since only fulminant myocarditis cases have been mentioned in the current literature. METHODS We performed a review of the literature of all patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis using the databases of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane. RESULTS 16 case reports were found to be related to COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis. We observed that the ECG findings in most of the COVID-19 patients were non-specific, including diffuse ST-segment elevation, non-specific intraventricular conduction delay, sinus tachycardia, and inverted T-waves in anterior leads. Echocardiographic findings of COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis patients ranged from preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) without segmental abnormalities to reduced LVEF with global hypokinesia. Interestingly, a few patients with COVID-19-induced acute fulminant myocarditis were steroid-responsive and had an amelioration with glucocorticoid and immunoglobulin therapy. CONCLUSION Despite the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, a limited number of cases has been shared in the current literature.

The bacterium was capable of PPN utilization as a nitrogen source only, while phenylacetonitrile (PAN) served both as carbon, energy and nitrogen source. This capacity was not described previously for any other haloalkaliphilic bacteria.

Neither nitrile hydratase nor amidase activity was detected. The isolate showed a capacity to grow with benzoate and salicylate as carbon and energy source and demonstrated the ability to completely mineralize PAN. These clearly indicated a potential to catabolize aromatic compounds.

High-throughput sequencing technologies generate enormous amounts of short fragments (reads) which essentially oversample components of a mixture; the representation redundancy enables reconstruction of the components (haplotypes, viral strains). The reconstruction problem, known to be NP-hard, boils down to grouping together reads originating from the same component in a mixture. Existing methods struggle to solve this problem with required level of accuracy and low runtimes; the problem is becoming increasingly more challenging as the number and length of the components increase. This paper proposes a read clustering method based on a convolutional auto-encoder designed to first project sequenced fragments to a low-dimensional space and then estimate the probability of the read origin using learned embedded features. The components are reconstructed by finding consensus sequences that agglomerate reads from the same origin. Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and dimension reduction of reads allow the proposed method to efficiently deal with massive numbers of long reads. Experiments on simulated, semi-experimental and experimental data demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to accurately reconstruct haplotypes and viral quasispecies, often demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.","output":"A Convolutional Auto-Encoder for Haplotype Assembly and Viral Quasispecies Reconstruction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The S-glycoprotein (Spike) of the SARS-CoV-2 forms a complex with the human transmembrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) during infection.

Molecular docking and simulations of these molecules targeting the ACE2-Spike complex were performed. Rutin DAB10 and Swertiapuniside were obtained as the top-scored drugs as per the docking protocol. The MD simulations of ligand-free, Rutin DAB10-bound, and Swertiapuniside-bound ACE2-Spike complex revealed abrogation of the hydrogen bonding network between the two proteins. The principal component and dynamic cross-correlation analysis pointed out conformational changes in both the proteins unique to the ligand-bound systems. The interface residues, His34, and Lys353 from ACE2 and Arg403, and Tyr495 from the Spike protein formed significant strong interactions with the ligand molecules, inferring the inhibition of ACE2-Spike complex. Few novel interactions specific to Rutin-DAB10 and Swertiapuniside were also identified. The conformational flexibility of the drug-binding pocket was captured using the RMSD-based clustering of the ligand-free simulations.

However, the prevention and treatment of these diseases remain without clinically significant therapeutic advancement.

With this state of the issue, emphasis should be placed on early diagnosis and prompt intervention in patients with increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases to slow down their progression, poor prognosis, and decreasing quality of life. Accordingly, it is urgent to implement interventions addressing the psychosocial and biochemical disturbances we know are central in managing the evolution of these disorders.

Emergency care in burn centers in developing countries must strike a balance between doctor and patient safety, and uncompromised care of burn patients. Telemedicine is deemed a valid and sound option to maintain social distancing and promote safety, yet provide proper burn care. It is a valuable and indispensable tool for all doctors of all branches of medicine and surgery. Although many of its limitations in developing countries are still being unraveled, the benefits of this technology are being realized worldwide. This study determined the accuracy and timeliness in diagnosing and classifying burn patients assessed by a frontliner non-burn specialist in-person (NBSP), a Burn Specialist online (BSO), and a Burn Specialist in-person (BSP). METHODS: All burn patients (January to March 2021) with signed consent for participation were photographed in a standardized manner by the NBSP and referred to a BSO via an online messaging application. These patients were also assessed independently by the BSP. The % total body surface area (TBSA), burn depth classification, and the time the patients were seen by the NBSP, the time the online referrals were sent to the BSO through the messaging application, the time the BSO sent the diagnoses, and the time of assessment by the BSP, were recorded. One-Way Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with and without blocking were done.Post-hoc Tukey-Test was used to analyze the pair-wise differences for any ANOVA that showed significant statistical differences. RESULTS: Data gathered from 82 patients throughout the 3-month study duration demonstrated that burn size (% TBSA) among the three different physicians (NBSP, BSO, BSP) was not statistically significant (p=0.8794). Our analysis also showed no statistical difference for the 19 different body parts per patient and burn depth classification (p=0.9718). One-way ANOVA tests on timeliness were statistically significant with a p-value of p< 0.0001.

Results: Craniofacial surgeons changed their behaviors significantly during the pandemic, with 91.5% of respondents wearing N95 masks or powered air purifying respirators for operations involving exposure of the nasal or oral airways on untested patients, compared with 4.3% before the pandemic (P &lt; 0.001). For examinations in the clinic, 100% reported wearing a mask during the pandemic compared with 40.3% before the pandemic (P &lt; 0.001). After the pandemic is over, 31.9% of surgeons planned to continue using an N95 mask or powered air purifying respirator for craniomaxillofacial cases and 80.9% planned to continue using masks in clinic. Overall, 46.8% of respondents believed that N95 masks should be the standard for craniofacial surgery. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly shifted the practices and opinion of craniofacial surgeons toward more protective personal protective equipment. These results indicate that this is likely to persist after the pandemic is over, which may limit surgeon exposure to airborne disease and help the field withstand future epidemic outbreaks.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Personal Protective Equipment Practices and Preferences of Craniofacial Surgeons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of a pandemic on unplanned hospital attendance has not been extensively examined. The aim of this study is to report the nationwide consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on unplanned hospital attendances in Denmark for 7 weeks after a 'shelter at home' order was issued. METHODS: We merged data from national registries (Civil Registration System and Patient Registry) to conduct a study of unplanned (excluding outpatient visits and elective surgery) hospital-based healthcare and mortality of all Danes. Using data for 7 weeks after the 'shelter at home' order, the incidence rate of unplanned hospital attendances per week in 2020 was compared with corresponding weeks in 2017-2019. The main outcome was hospital attendances per week as incidence rate ratios. Secondary outcomes were general population mortality and risk of death in-hospital, reported as weekly mortality rate ratios (MRRs). RESULTS: From 2 438 286 attendances in the study period, overall unplanned attendances decreased by up to 21%; attendances excluding COVID-19 were reduced by 31%; non-psychiatric by 31% and psychiatric by 30%. Out of the five most common diagnoses expected to remain stable, only schizophrenia and myocardial infarction remained stable, while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, hip fracture and urinary tract infection fell significantly. The nationwide general population MRR rose in six of the recorded weeks, while MRR excluding patients who were COVID-19 positive only increased in two. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic and a governmental national 'shelter at home' order was associated with a marked reduction in unplanned hospital attendances with an increase in MRR for the general population in two of 7 weeks, despite exclusion of patients with COVID-19. The findings should be taken into consideration when planning for public information campaigns.","output":"Nationwide study on trends in unplanned hospital attendance and deaths during the 7 weeks after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In psychotherapy, paradoxical interventions are characterized by a deliberate reinforcement of the pathological behavior to improve the clinical condition. Such a counter-intuitive approach can be considered when more conventional interventions fail. The development of targeted cancer therapies has enabled the selective inhibition of activated oncogenic signaling pathways. However, in advanced cancers, such therapies, on average, deliver modest benefits due to the development of resistance. Here, we review the perspective of a \\"paradoxical intervention\\" in cancer therapy: rather than attempting to inhibit oncogenic signaling, the proposed therapy would further activate mitogenic signaling to disrupt the labile homeostasis of cancer cells and overload stress response pathways. Such overactivation can potentially be combined with stress-targeted drugs to kill overstressed cancer cells. Although counter-intuitive, such an approach exploits intrinsic and ubiquitous differences between normal and cancer cells. We discuss the background underlying this unconventional approach and how such intervention might address some current challenges in cancer therapy.","output":"Playing cancer at its own game: activating mitogenic signaling as a paradoxical intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: When the COVID-19 pandemic restricted visitation between intensive care unit patients and their families, the virtual intensive care unit (vICU) in our large tertiary hospital was adapted to facilitate virtual family visitation. The objective of this paper is to document findings from interviews conducted with family members on three categories: (1) feelings experienced during the visit, (2) barriers, challenges or concerns faced using this service, and (3) opportunities for improvements. METHODS: Family members were interviewed postvisit via phone. For category 1 (feelings), automated analysis in Python using the Valence Aware Dictionary for sentiment Reasoner package produced weighted valence (extent of positive, negative or neutral emotive connotations) of the interviewees' word choices. Outputs were compared with a manual coder's valence ratings to assess reliability. Two raters conducted inductive thematic analysis on the notes from these interviews to analyse categories 2 (barriers) and 3 (opportunities). RESULTS: Valence-based and manual sentiment analysis of 230 comments received on feelings showed over 86% positive sentiments (88.2% and 86.8%, respectively) with some neutral (7.3% and 6.8%) and negative (4.5% and 6.4%) sentiments. The qualitative analysis of data from 57 participants who commented on barriers showed four primary concerns: inability to communicate due to patient status (44% of respondents); technical difficulties (35%); lack of touch and physical presence (11%); and frequency and clarity of communications with the care team (11%). Suggested improvements from 59 participants included: on demand access (51%); improved communication with the care team (17%); improved scheduling processes (10%); and improved system feedback and technical capabilities (17%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of vICU for remote family visitations evoked happiness, joy, gratitude and relief and a sense of closure for those who lost loved ones.

Due to this proposed concern, we sought to collect the available data and evaluate the use of laparoscopy and the risk of COVID-19 transmission. METHODS: A literature review of viral transmission in surgery and of the available literature regarding the transmission of the COVID-19 virus was performed. We additionally reviewed surgical society guidelines and recommendations regarding surgery during this pandemic. RESULTS: Few studies have been performed on viral transmission during surgery, but to date there is no study that demonstrates or can suggest the ability for a virus to be transmitted during surgical treatment whether open or laparoscopic. There is no societal consensus on limiting or restricting laparoscopic or robotic surgery; however, there is expert consensus on the modification of standard practices to minimize any risk of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Despite very little evidence to support viral transmission through laparoscopic or open approaches, we recommend making modifications to surgical practice such as the use of smoke evacuation and minimizing energy device use among other measures to minimize operative staff exposure to aerosolized particles.","output":"What Is the Appropriate Use of Laparoscopy over Open Procedures in the Current COVID-19 Climate?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Loss of smell is one of the strongest predictors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and can persist long after other symptoms have resolved. Long cases (>28 days) of smell dysfunction present future challenges to medical and dental professionals, as there is a lack of evidence on the causes and any exacerbating or relieving factors. This study aimed to explore the persistence of COVID-19-induced smell loss and association with physical, lifestyle and oral health factors. Materials and Methods: This study was a cross-sectional survey of 235 participants. Recovery of smell was explored, comparing rapid recovery (28 days) with prolonged recovery (>28 days). Associative factors included age, sex, illness severity, diet, BMI, vitamin D supplementation, antidepressants, alcohol use, smoking, brushing frequency, flossing, missing teeth, appliances and number of dental restorations. Results: Smell loss showed 87% resolution within 30 days. Prolonged smell loss was significantly associated with older age (mean  95%, CI = 31.53  1.36 years for rapid recovery vs. mean  95%, CI = 36.0  3 years for prolonged recovery, p = 0.003) and increased self-reported illness severity (mean  95%, CI = 4.39  0.27 for rapid recovery vs. 5.01  0.54 for prolonged recovery, p = 0.016). Fishers exact test revealed flossing was associated with rapid recovery, with flossers comprising 75% of the rapid-recovery group, compared to 56% in the prolonged-recovery group (odds ratio  95%, CI = 2.26 (1.23C4.15), p = 0.01). All other factors were not significantly associated (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Increased age and illness severity were associated with prolonged smell recovery. Use of floss was the only modifiable factor associated with rapid recovery of smell loss. As 87% of cases resolve within 30 days, future studies may benefit from targeted recruitment of individuals experiencing prolonged sense loss. This would increase statistical confidence when declaring no association with the other factors assessed, avoiding type II errors.","output":"Relationship between Recovery from COVID-19-Induced Smell Loss and General and Oral Health Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Streptococcal C5a peptidase (ScpA) specifically inactivates the human complement factor hC5a, a potent anaphylatoxin recently identified as a therapeutic target for treatment of COVID-19 infections. Biologics used to modulate hC5a are predominantly monoclonal antibodies. Here we present data to support an alternative therapeutic approach based on the specific inactivation of hC5a by ScpA in studies using recombinant hC5a (rhC5a). Initial characterization of ScpA confirmed activity in human serum and against rhC5a desArg (rhC5adR), the predominant hC5a form in blood. A new FRET based enzyme assay showed that ScpA cleaved rhC5a at near physiological concentrations (K m 185 nM). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) studies established a high affinity ScpA-rhC5a interaction (K D 34 nM, K D ITC 30.8 nM). SPR analyses also showed that substrate binding is dominated (89% of &#916;Gbind) by interactions with the bulky N-ter cleavage product (PN, 'core' residues 1-67) with interactions involving the C-ter R74 contributing most of the remaining &#916;Gbind. Furthermore, reduced binding affinity following mutation of a subset of positively charged Arginine residues of PN and in the presence of higher salt concentrations, highlighted the importance of electrostatic interactions. These data provide the first in-depth study of the ScpA-C5a interaction and indicate that ScpA's ability to efficiently cleave physiological concentrations of C5a is driven by electrostatic interactions between an exosite on the enzyme and the 'core' of C5a.

In an evaluation at 21 hospitals in 18 states, the duration of mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-associated hospitalizations was assessed among adults aged 18 years. Among 3,089 hospitalized adults (including 1,194 COVID-19 case-patients and 1,895 non-COVID-19 control-patients), the median age was 59 years, 48.7% were female, and 21.1% had an immunocompromising condition. Overall, 141 (11.8%) case-patients and 988 (52.1%) controls were fully vaccinated (defined as receipt of the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines 14 days before illness onset), with a median interval of 65 days (range = 14-166 days) after receipt of second dose. VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalization during the full surveillance period was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 82%-88%) overall and 90% (95% CI = 87%-92%) among adults without immunocompromising conditions. VE against COVID-19- associated hospitalization was 86% (95% CI = 82%-90%) 2-12 weeks and 84% (95% CI = 77%-90%) 13-24 weeks from receipt of the second vaccine dose, with no significant change between these periods (p = 0.854).

We aimed to assess the predictive factors of molecular analysis feasibility (MAF) from samples of peripheral nonSq-NSCLC obtained by radial endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscopy (r-EBUS) and 1.5 mm microbiopsy forceps. METHODS We reviewed data from consecutive peripheral lung nodules sampled with r-EBUS between January 2012 and July 2014 at a single French University Hospital. nonSq-NSCLC were systematically analysed for EGFR, KRAS, ALK, HER2, PI3K and BRAF throughout the study, and c-MET and ROS1 alterations for the last 10 months. RESULTS Of 111 nonSq-NSCLC diagnosed by r-EBUS (113 procedures, mean nodule diameter 28  15 mm), 88 were analysed for EGFR and ALK, 87 for KRAS, 86 for HER2, PI3K and BRAF and 14 for c-MET. Forty-one mutations were identified (23 KRAS, 10 EGFR, 2 BRAF, 1 HER2 and 5 ALK rearrangements). Four c-MET overexpressions were noted. MAF rose from 67% for the first 57 procedures to 89% for the last 56 procedures (P = 0.02) likely due to a higher number of biopsies performed (2  1 vs 3  2, P = 0.005).

The National Academy of Medicine has emphasized the importance of supporting clinician well-being across healthcare; however, well-being is poorly defined, especially early in emergency medicine training. Objectives The primary objective of this study was to explore and understand the attitudes, beliefs, and perspectives of emergency medicine (EM) resident physicians surrounding well-being. A secondary objective was to identify priority areas of focus to promote a culture of well-being for EM trainees. Approach We conducted semi-structured focus groups of EM resident physicians at an urban, academic institution with a 4-year training curriculum. Focus group interviews were transcribed and constructivist aggregated themes were identified using content analysis with a constant comparative coding approach. Results Seventeen EM residents participated in semi-structured qualitative focus groups (PGY1 = 6, PGY2 = 6, PGY3 = 2, PGY4 = 3). Six key themes related to well-being emerged spanning clinical and nonclinical areas: (1) a focus on basic needs being met, (2) on-shift operational structure, (3) individual feedback, (4) feeling valued for clinical contributions, (5) a sense of community within the clinical environment, and (6) a sense of personal ownership over time. Conclusions Shifting the focus for medical trainees away from mitigating burnout and toward proactively promoting well-being is important. Understanding the perspectives and key themes in how EM residents define well-being can help support trainees early in their careers.

We aimed to quantify these variations between hospitals and over time during Englands first wave (March to July 2020) and assess available patient-level and hospital-level predictors to explain those variations. METHODS: We used administrative data for England, augmented by hospital-level information. Admissions were extracted with COVID-19 codes. In-hospital death was the primary outcome. Risk-adjusted mortality ratios (standardised mortality ratios) and interhospital variation were calculated using multilevel logistic regression. Early-wave (March to April) and late-wave (May to July) periods were compared. RESULTS: 74 781 admissions had a primary diagnosis of COVID-19, with 21 984 in-hospital deaths (29.4%); the 30-day total mortality rate was 28.8%. The crude in-hospital death rate fell in all ages and overall from 32.9% in March to 13.4% in July. Patient-level predictors included age, male gender, non-white ethnic group (early period only) and several comorbidities (obesity early period only). The only significant hospital-level predictor was daily COVID-19 admissions in the late period; we did not find a relation with staff absences for COVID-19, mechanical ventilation bed occupancies, total bed occupancies or bed occupancies for COVID-19 admissions in either period. Just 4 (3%) and 2 (2%) hospitals were high, and 5 (4%) and 0 hospitals were low funnel plot mortality outliers at 3 SD for early and late periods, respectively, after risk adjustment. We found no strong correlation between early and late hospital-level mortality (r=0.17, p=0.06).

However, no robust data exist on the use of biologics in the elderly population with UC. We present a retrospective analysis from 2010 to 2020 comparing outcomes such as mortality, adverse events, hospitalizations, and remission of moderate to severe UC patients 65 yo or more () to those less than (<) 65 yo prescribed biologics. Methods: Data was gathered retrospectively from January 2010 to December 2020. Cohorts consisted of patients 18 yo with UC and no other co-existing autoimmune disease who were prescribed, biologic agents. Patient demographics were summarized as mean or proportions (%). Outcomes of interest were compared between groups according to age cutoff (65 yo vs , 65 yo) with the use of Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Multivariate analysis was conducted using logistic regression to identify independent variables associated with any of the outcomes of interest in both age groups. Results: 133 patients were included. The patient's baseline demographic characteristics were not found to be statistically significant (Table). Composite infection (18% vs 9%), skin adverse events (37% vs 32%), neoplasm (19% vs 2%), and mortality (6% vs 2%) between groups ( 65 yo vs <65 yo) were not statistically significant (P=0.38, P=0.70, P=0.11, P=0.48;respectively). Hospitalization and remission at 1, 3, and more than 5 years from biologics prescription were not statistically significant. However, age-stratified infections for pneumonia (PNA/COVID) resulted in statistical significance in those 80 yo (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that higher numbers of prescribed biologics since UC diagnosis were associated more with death (P=0.013) and neoplasm (P=0.046) in patients 65 yo. Conclusion: Age was not found to be an independent variable associated with any poor outcomes. Death and neoplasm events were associated with a greater number of prescribed biologics in those  65 yo and may reflect refractory versus longer disease course. Studies with larger samples of patients greater than 80 yo are required to confirm the association between PNA in this cohort. However, COVID was the etiology of the PNA.

Methods: Observational, unicentric, prospective cohort study. All adult patients with cancer diagnosis within 5 years (2016-April 2020) who accepted participation were included since May 2020. During subsequent months, a comprehensive follow-up of these patients has been performed. Demographic and clinical data was taken from medical records (HCIS, software SAAS) and inputted into a web form (https://forms.epidemixs.org/form/study/covoncoand). Results: 182 oncologic patients with complete data who underwent population serological screening in May 2020 were selected. At baseline, 152 (83.51%) patients had solid tumors and 30 (16.48%) presented with metastatic diseases. Breast cancer was the main primary cancer site with 49 (26.92%) patients. 102 (56.04%) patients received active anti-cancer treatment, of which 48 (47.06%) received chemotherapy, 25 (24.51%) hormonal therapy, 64 (62.74%) biologics and 8 (7.84%) radiotherapy.

For all its power, though, contact tracing yields a variable level of success. One reason is that contact tracing's ability to break the chain of transmission is only as effective as the proportion of contacts who are actually traced. In part, this proportion turns on the quality of the information that infected people provide, which makes human memory a crucial part of the efficacy of contact tracing.

However, distinctions in birthdates between molecular subtypes of sensory neurons, particularly nociceptors, is unknown. Here, we assess the birthdate of lumbar DRG neurons in mice using a thymidine analog, EdU, to label developing neurons exiting mitosis combined with co-labeling of known sensory neuron markers. We find that different nociceptor subtypes are born on similar timescales, with continuous births between E9.5 to E13.5, and peak births from E10.5 to E11.5. Notably, we find that thinly myelinated A-fiber nociceptors and peptidergic C-fibers are born more broadly between E10.5 and E11.5 than previously thought and that non-peptidergic C-fibers and C-LTMRs are born with a peak birth date of E11.5. Moreover, we find that the percentages of nociceptor subtypes born at a particular timepoint are the same for any given nociceptor cell type marker, indicating that intrinsic or extrinsic influences on cell type diversity are occurring similarly across developmental time. Overall, the patterns of birth still fit within the classical \\"two wave\\" description, as touch and proprioceptive fibers are born primarily at E10.5, but suggest that nociceptors have a slightly broader wave of birthdates with different nociceptor subtypes continually differentiating throughout sensory neurogenesis irrespective of myelination.","output":"Nociceptor subtypes are born continuously over DRG development."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Segmental and focal pathological changes were found in the glomeruli and tubules of postoperative renal-biopsy specimens from seven cases of clinically confirmed endemic (Balkan) nephropathy.

Thematic analysis as a qualitative method was used to explore the role physical activity, friendship, and social interactions played in loneliness, particularly in times of social isolation and social distancing. Results revealed associations of varying strength between physical activity and loneliness in 2018/2019 (r = ?0.09, p  0.05) and 2020 (r = ?0.20, p < 0.01). In 2020, n = 73 (41.7%) participants felt that their loneliness had increased since the COVID-19 social and physical distancing guidelines were introduced, but this was not associated with a perceived change in physical activity (r = ?0.05, p > 0.05). Analyses of qualitative data revealed three main themes: (1) the lack of deep friendships at university, (2) the positive perceived impact of team sports on feelings of loneliness, and (3) the need for real connection in times of crisis. Thus, with regard to feelings of loneliness during the pandemic, being physically active seems to be a small but potentially relevant factor among young individuals. The qualitative study suggests that first-year university students might buffer the lack of deep friendships and meaningful interactions by building social bonds in team sports. In times of physical distancing, young individuals vulnerable to loneliness may therefore require special support such as doing sports with physical distance and perceiving connected with their team for instance by digital devices and emotional coping.","output":"Physical Activity, Loneliness, and Meaning of Friendship in Young Individuals C A Mixed-Methods Investigation Prior to and During the COVID-19 Pandemic With Three Cross-Sectional Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Late in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) emerged, causing an unknown type of pneumonia today called coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In this study, the impact of barrier heights on the spread of aerosol particles is investigated in an open office environment with the well-designed ventilation mode and supply air rate. The risk of infection disease transmission is evaluated using simulation of particle concentration in different locations and subject to a number of source scenarios.

Thus, metabolomics studies have attracted extensive research interest owing to their potential in dealing with a vast number of metabolites. Metabolomics coupled with advanced analytical tools provides a comprehensive insight into systems biology. Despite its wide scientific attention, endophytic fungi metabolomics are relatively unexploited. This review highlights the recent developments in metabolomics studies of endophytic fungi in obtaining the global metabolites picture.","output":"Recent Developments in Metabolomics Studies of Endophytic Fungi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A biosafety plan is essential to establish appropriate practices for biosafety in a shared resource laboratory (SRL).

In addition, we used GSE30589 and GSE52920 databases to elucidate the changes of ACE2 expression in vivo and in vitro after SARS-CoV infection. ACE2 was elevated in UCEC and KIRP, and high ACE2 had a favorable prognosis. The expression of ACE2 was positively correlated with the level of immune infiltration of macrophage in KIRP, B cell, CD4+T cell, neutrophil and dendritic cell immune infiltration levels in UCEC. ACE2 was significantly positively correlated with the type markers of B cells and neutrophils, macrophages in UCEC, while ACE2 in KIRP was positively correlated with the type markers of macrophages. High ACE2 expression level had a favorable prognosis in different enriched immune cells subgroups in UCEC and KIRP. And the promoter methylation levels of ACE2 in UCEC and KIRP were significantly reduced. What's more, we found that the expression of ACE2 decreased in vivo and in vitro after SARS-CoV infection. In conclusion, ACE2 expression increased significantly in UCEC and KIRP, elevated ACE2 was positively correlated with immune infiltration and prognosis.

This study investigated depression, anxiety and stress in New Zealand (NZ) during the first 10 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated psychological and behavioural factors. It also compares the results with a similar cross-sectional study in the UK. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: NZ community cohort. PARTICIPANTS: N=681 adults (18 years) in NZ. The cohort was predominantly female (89%) with a mean age of 42 years (range 18C87). Most (74%) identified as NZ European and almost half (46%) were keyworkers. Most were non-smokers (95%) and 20% identified themselves as having clinical risk factors which would put them at increased or greatest risk of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, anxiety, stress, positive mood and engagement in health behaviours (smoking, exercise, alcohol consumption). RESULTS: Depression and anxiety significantly exceeded population norms (p<0.0001). Being younger (p<0.0001) and most at risk of COVID-19 (p<0.05) were associated with greater depression, anxiety and stress. Greater positive mood, lower loneliness and greater exercise were protective factors for all outcomes (p<0.0001). Smoking (p=0.037) and alcohol consumption (p<0.05) were associated with increased anxiety. Pet ownership was associated with lower depression (p=0.006) and anxiety (p=0.008). When adjusting for age and gender differences, anxiety (p=0.002) and stress (p=0.007) were significantly lower in NZ than in the UK. The NZ sample reported lower perceived risk (p<0.0001) and worry about COVID-19 (p<0.0001) than the UK sample. CONCLUSIONS: The NZ population had higher depression and anxiety compared with population norms. Younger people and those most at risk of COVID-19 reported poorer mental health.

Several weeks after recovering from his respiratory infection, patient developed a diffuse, purpuric rash that began on his forearms and gradually spread throughout his bilateral upper extremities to his hands and fingers, as well as to his shoulders and lateral chest. Skin biopsy was performed and revealed findings suggestive of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Blood work revealed Methicillin Resistant Staph Aureus (MRSA) bacteremia, sensitive to Vancomycin. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed native mitral valve endocarditis. Transesophageal echocardiogram was not performed due to patient's underlying comorbidities and high risk. Decision-making: Patient was diagnosed with leukocytoclastic vasculitis secondary to bacterial endocarditis.

Reinfections were postulated as a partial explanation for the second surge. However, accurate calculation of reinfection rates is difficult when stringent criteria as two time-separated RT-PCR tests and/or genome sequencing are required. To estimate the proportion of reinfections caused by Gamma during the second wave in Manaus and the protection conferred by previous infection, we identified anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody boosting in repeat blood donors as a mean to infer reinfection. METHODS: We tested serial blood samples from unvaccinated repeat blood donors in Manaus for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using two assays that display waning in early convalescence, enabling the detection of reinfection-induced boosting. Donors were required to have three or more donations, being at least one during each epidemic wave. We propose a strict serological definition of reinfection (reactivity boosting following waning like a V-shaped curve in both assays or three spaced boostings), probable (two separate boosting events) and possible (reinfection detected by only one assay) reinfections. The serial samples were used to divide donors into six groups defined based on the inferred sequence of infection and reinfection with non-Gamma and Gamma variants. RESULTS: From 3655 repeat blood donors, 238 met all inclusion criteria, and 223 had enough residual sample volume to perform both serological assays. We found 13.6% (95% CI 7.0C24.5%) of all presumed Gamma infections that were observed in 2021 were reinfections. If we also include cases of probable or possible reinfections, these percentages increase respectively to 22.7% (95% CI 14.3C34.2%) and 39.3% (95% CI 29.5C50.0%). Previous infection conferred a protection against reinfection of 85.3% (95% CI 71.3C92.7%), decreasing to respectively 72.5% (95% CI 54.7C83.6%) and 39.5% (95% CI 14.1C57.8%) if probable and possible reinfections are included.

The implementation of analgesia protocols utilizing continuous peripheral nerve catheters and isometric pumps has been described for other surgical procedures and populations, however the role of the Acute Pain Service Nurse (APS RN) in the implementation of such a program has not been described in the literature. DESIGN: An initiative for TKA patients receiving CACC was developed and implemented for patients recovering both in the hospital and at home. METHODS: We describe the development and implementation of a CACC program for TKA patients in response to the surgical backlog created by the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of the APS RN. We provide a detailed narrative description of our postoperative assessment and experience and offer practical insights for the postoperative care of these patients. We share the educational resources and assessment tools we developed to ensure consistent, safe, and effective clinical management of CACC patients in the hospital and at home.

Numerous studies have corroborated yoga's beneficial effects, including a favorable influence on autonomic function and negative emotions. Extensive research in the last few decades has revealed the critical role that yoga can play in eradicating stress. This has laid to the foundation for a scientific understanding of pathophysiological changes attributed to stress, particularly at the molecular and genetic levels. This primarily has helped understand the epigenetic and genetic mechanism at play to induce and alleviate stress, particularly those related to emotional aberrations. As research has indicated, negative emotions are translated into vascular inflammation appropriately accentuated by a sympathetic predominant autonomic function. This cascade is bolstered by multiple factors, including activation of stressor genes and elaborating hormones, including steroids with sometimes nocuous consequences, particularly when chronic. Yoga has been categorically found to have inhibited each and every one of these baneful effects of stress. In fact, it also changes the neuronal circuits that potentiate such a plethora of pathological changes. This, in turn, has accentuated yoga's relevance as a powerful preventive intervention in noncommunicable diseases (NCD). NCDs, including heart disease, stroke, and rheumatological disorders, are essentially inflammatory diseases that perpetuate inflammation in different beds like vascular or joint spaces. The precise mechanism by which yoga induces such beneficial changes is yet to be delineated. However, a cornucopia of pointers indicates that neural, endocrine, immunological, cellular, genetic, and epigenetic mechanisms are at play. This article attempts to cobble together newfangled research to delineate a medical model for this 5000-year-old practice from India. This is imperative, as a mechanistic model of this ancient-but-complex system would enable a more comprehensive understanding of its mechanism and reveal its yet-undiscovered positive health effects.","output":"A Mechanistic Model for Yoga as a Preventive and Therapeutic Modality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Notably, as a result of the unique circumstances that the global population is facing (Covid-19), there has been an increase in interest in educational leadership science, particularly in academic environment, with the aim of enhancing an ecosystem that is inclusive, open to change, monitoring, and often unforeseen challenges. Of the various types of educational leadership, transformational leadership is recognized as the most suitable for use in academic environment. It focuses on the division of leadership responsibilities among academics with varying skills in order to handle collectively the spectrum of leadership responsibilities needed in a variety of contexts. Methods/Analysis: This perspective is embodied in this study paper, which examined the degree to which members of the Senate of three Universities of Greece, engaged in three distinct types of leadership (transformational leadership, transactional leadership, and leadership to be avoided) via digital leadership. The findings were interpreted using descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive data analysis algorithms. Findings: The findings indicate that participants demonstrate a high level of Transformational and Transactional Leadership. They demonstrated a high level of Digital Leadership while avoiding Passive-To Avoid Leadership. The study demonstrates that Digital Leadership has a relatively favorable association with the leadership outcome, which is translated as a high level of performance and satisfaction coexisting with a high level of digital leadership execution. Novelty /Improvement: The research project indicates that a good leader who practices transformational leadership and is prepared with the necessary digital skills would be more effective in carrying out administrative responsibilities in an academic environment. ? 2021 by the authors.

Polymyxin-B hemoperfusion (PMX-HP) has been recognized to effectively remove endotoxins in patients with sepsis and septic shock, and a rat sepsis model revealed that PMX-HP treatment can maintain a better microcirculation. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PMX-HP on microcirculation in patients with septic shock. METHODS: Patients with septic shock were enrolled and randomized to control and PMX-HP groups. In the PMX-HP group, patients received the first session of PMX-HP in addition to conventional septic shock management within 24 h after the onset of septic shock; the second session of PMX-HP was provided after another 24 h as needed. RESULTS: Overall, 28 patients finished the trial and were analyzed. The mean arterial pressure and norepinephrine infusion dose did not differ significantly between the control and PMX-HP groups after PMX-HP treatment. At 48 h after enrollment, total vessel density (TVD) and perfused vessel density (PVD) were higher in the PMX-HP group than in the control group [TVD 24.2 (22.1C24.9) vs. 21.1 (19.9C22.9) mm/mm(2); p = 0.007; PVD 22.9 (20.9C24.9) vs. 20.0 (18.9C21.6) mm/mm(2), p = 0.008].

A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and gray literature for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English language with a minimum follow-up of 6 months, comparing the caries arrest potential of SDF with ART in primary teeth and first permanent molars in children. The risk of bias and quality assessment of the studies was done using the Cochrane Collaboration Tool and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool. Data analysis was performed using RevMan software; the outcomes were summarized in meta-analysis (MA) using the random-effects model, and the odds ratio (OR) at 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed. RESULTS: A total of 1059 studies were identified, out of which 562 remained after removal of duplicates. Eight studies were considered for full-text eligibility, and four studies were included in the qualitative review. Three out of four studies were conducted on primary dentition, whereas one study was done on erupting first permanent molars in children.

PURPOSE The goal of this study was to evaluate DuraSeal Xact Adhesion Barrier and Sealant System (DSX), a polyethylene glycol-based synthetic fibrosis inhibitor, for its ability to reduce postoperative pain after lumbar microdiscectomy. STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective randomized controlled study. PATIENT SAMPLE Twenty patients between 19 and 71 years of age about to undergo elective lumbar single-level discectomy were randomized into two groups of 10. OUTCOME MEASURES Assessments included the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, the short form (SF)-36 questionnaire, and the Oswestry low back pain scale, preoperatively and at discharge, and 30, 90, and 180 days after surgery. METHODS One group was treated with DSX, and the control group received the local standard of care. DSX was applied as a thin layer on the nerve root and surrounding area after microdiscectomy. RESULTS The VAS pain scale was lower at all time points in the DSX treatment group than in the control group. The reductions at 30, 90, and 180 days for DSX and control groups, respectively, were 43.9% versus 35.6%, 64.3% versus 44.8%, and 75.4% versus 59.6%. The SF-36 scores in the DSX treatment group showed more improvement than in the control group as soon as 30 days for physical functioning, general health, vitality, social functioning, mental health, and emotional patterns, and by 90 days for bodily pain and general health. The Oswestry pain score was lower at all time points in the DSX treatment group than in the control group. The reductions at 30, 90, and 180 days for DSX and control groups, respectively, were 41.5% versus 34.3%, 68.2% versus 42.4%, and 73.3% versus 55.4%. Wound healing was normal in the DSX treatment group, there were no complications related to DSX use, and no patient in either group required reoperation. CONCLUSIONS Although this study is too small to have conclusions of efficacy and will need confirmation by larger trials, treatment of a microdiscectomy site with DSX for fibrosis prevention shows promising results in terms of safety, reduction of postoperative pain and functional results when compared to control with the additional advantage of being suitable for use in the presence of a dural tear.","output":"Reduction of postoperative pain after lumbar microdiscectomy with DuraSeal Xact Adhesion Barrier and Sealant System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The variant of Concern(VOC), Omicron is the predominant variant circulating throughout the world of the SARS COV2 pandemic during the third wave including India.

The results provide strong support for personalized booster programmes that, by targeting people in the tail of the distribution, should be more effective at diminishing breakthrough infection and optimising booster dose supply than a program that simply mandates a booster at a specific post-vaccination time point.","output":"Individual vaccine efficacy variation with time since mRNA BNT162b2 vaccination estimated by rapid, quantitative antibody measurements from a finger-prick sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of COVID-19 has exacerbated and highlighted health inequalities experienced by people with a learning disability and/or autism, a clinical leader has said.","output":"COVID exacerbated service users health inequalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak expanded rapidly throughout China.

It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We used real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation in transmission in cities across China and to ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. After the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside of Wuhan.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study (April-June 2021) included 10 liver and 38 kidney transplant recipients who received 2 vaccine doses (Sinovac, n = 31; or BioNTech, n = 17) and 56 healthy adults (Sinovac), all of whom provided 3 blood samples (prevaccination, 4 weeks after first dose, and 4-6 weeks after second dose) for quantitative tests (Abbott Quant assay forimmunoglobulin G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein). Type I error was  = .05 in all statistical analyses (SPSS, version 25). RESULTS: We analyzed demographic data, antibody responses, and adverse events after 2 doses of SARSCoV-2 vaccine, comparedimmune responses from solidorgan transplant recipients (median age, 36.5 years) versus healthy patients (median age, 37.5 years), and observed significantly higher seropositivity in healthy versus transplant patients after Sinovac vaccination (100% vs 67.5%; P = .001). However, we observed no significant seropositive differences for Sinovac versus BioNTech second doses in transplantrecipients. Median SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G level after second dose was significantly higher in BioNTech (1388.6 AU/mL) versus Sinovac patients (136.6 AU/mL) (P = .012). The seropositivity difference between the 2 vaccines was significant in participants 24 to 44 years old (P = .040). The rate of at least 1 side effect was 82.4% (n = 14) for BioNTech vaccine and 32.3% (n = 10) for Sinovac vaccine, and the difference was statistically significant.The most common side effect was arm pain (significantly higher in BioNTech group). CONCLUSIONS: Solid-organ transplant recipients demonstrated inadequate vaccine responses (higher risk of complications and mortality) versus healthy patients. Furthermore, immune responses may differ between vaccines.

For this reason, the help of computer aided diagnosis (CAD) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms is vital. In this study, a method based on optimization of convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is the most effective image analysis method of today, is proposed to fulfill the mentioned COVID-19 detection needs. First, COVID-19 images are trained using ResNet-50 and VGG-16 architectures. Then, features in the last layer of these two architectures are combined with feature fusion. These new image features matrices obtained with feature fusion are classified for COVID detection. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) structure optimized by the whale optimization algorithm is used for the classification process.

Here we retrospectively explore the effectiveness of this strategy, showing that even under the unrealistic assumption of perfect shielding, hospitals would have been rapidly overwhelmed with many avoidable deaths among lower risk individuals. Crucially, even a small (20%) reduction in the effectiveness of shielding would have likely led to a large increase (>150%) in the number of deaths compared to perfect shielding.

Domiciliary ventilators which entrain room air have been widely used during the pandemic. Poor outcomes reported with non-invasive respiratory support using ventilators which lack an oxygen blender could be related to an unreliable Fraction of inspired O(2) (FiO(2)). Additionally, with concerns about oxygen failure, the variety of ventilator circuits used as well as differing peak inspiratory flow rates (PIFR) could impact on the FiO(2) delivered during therapy with domiciliary ventilators. METHODS: In a series of bench tests, we tested the effect of choice of circuit and different PIFR on the FiO(2) achieved during simulation of ventilation and CPAP therapy using domiciliary ventilators. RESULTS: FiO(2) was highly dependent upon the type of circuit used with circuits with an active exhalation valve achieving similar FiO(2) at lower oxygen flow rates than circuits using an exhalation port. During CPAP therapy, high PIFR resulted in significantly lower FiO(2) than low PIFR.

OBJECTIVE: To enrich the understanding of mental health crisis care in the United Kingdom, this study explores views on crisis resolution teams (CRTs) expressed on Twitter. We aim to identify the similarities and differences among views expressed on Twitter compared with interviews and focus groups. METHODS: We used Twitters advanced search function to retrieve public tweets on CRTs. A thematic analysis was conducted on 500 randomly selected tweets. The principles of refutational synthesis were applied to compare themes with those identified in a multicenter qualitative interview study. RESULTS: The most popular hashtag identified was #CrisisTeamFail, where posts were principally related to poor quality of care and access, particularly for people given a personality disorder diagnosis. Posts about CRTs giving unhelpful self-management advice were common, as were tweets about resource strains on mental health services. This was not identified in the research interviews. Although each source yielded unique themes, there were some overlaps with themes identified via interviews and focus groups, including the importance of rapid access to care.

METHODS: Participants were recruited at two United States cancer centers and via social media for a pilot study testing a novel online method for collecting prospective, daily social support interaction data (N=28). All participants were aged 18+; survivors had a current or recent cancer diagnosis and were engaged in treatment and/or services; care partners were identified by the survivors. Enrollment also purposefully targeted YA and LGBTQIA+ survivors. Social network data (up to 10 members) were assessed at baseline. Daily online surveys assessed support interactions between participants and specific network members over 14 days. Descriptive statistics summarized data and explored between-group (YA/non-YA, LGBTQIA+/non-LGBTQIA+) differences in social network characteristics (size, heterogeneity, density, centralization, cohesion) and support interactions (support source and type). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between YA and non-YA participants on any measures. LGBTQIA+ participants support networks were less dense (Mdn=0.69 vs. 0.82, p=.02), less cohesive (Mdn=0.85 vs. 0.91,.02), more centered on the participant (Mdn=0.40 vs. 0.24, p=.047), and included more LGBTQIA+ members (Mdn=0.35 vs. 0.00, p<.001).

Methods: Thirty-eight residents from three nursing homes were recruited for the study. Antibodies targeting the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were measured with the S-Flow assay. Neutralizing activities in sera were measured as effective dilution 50% (ED50) with the S-Fuse assay using authentic isolates of Delta and Omicron. Results: Among the 38 elderly included in the study, with median (inter-quartile range, IQR) age of 88 (81-92) years, 30 (78.9%) had been previously infected. The ED50 of neutralization were lower against Omicron than Delta, and higher among convalescent compared to naive residents. During an Omicron epidemic affecting two of the three nursing homes in December 2021-January 2022, 75% (6/8) of naive residents got infected, compared to 25% (6/24) of convalescents (P=0.03).

We believe that these individuals' characteristics could be consistent with the super-spreader phenomenon and that greater awareness of the social dynamics of these individuals is needed to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in adults during the first and second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Houston, TX: the potential of the super-spreader"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Symptom management is a critical aspect of comprehensive palliative care for people with advanced cancer. Web and mobile-based applications are promising e-Health modalities that can facilitate timely access to symptom management interventions for this population. AIM To evaluate the efficacy of web and mobile-based symptom management interventions in alleviating physical symptom burden in people with advanced cancer. DESIGN A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. PROSPERO ID = CRD42020155295. DATA SOURCES We searched databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL from 1991 until 2019. Inclusion criteria were: adults with advanced cancer, web or mobile-based interventions targeting symptom management, and report of physical symptom data. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I and RoB2. Using RevMan, standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. An assessment of interventions was conducted by evaluating the delivery mode, duration, and evaluation of application feature and theoretical elements. RESULTS A total of 19 studies are included in the systematic review and 18 in the meta-analysis. Majority of the studies were deemed to have high risk of bias. Most of the interventions used a web-application for delivering their education (n = 17). While the interventions varied regarding duration and content, they were mainly guided by a symptom management theory. Web and mobile-based interventions significantly improved the overall physical symptom burden (SMD = -0.18; 95% CI = -0.28 to -0.09; I2 = 0%; p = 0.0002).

These progenitor cells were first discovered as bone marrow-derived adult multipotent cells and believed to migrate to sites of injury, opposing the notion that they are residents of all tissue types. In recent years, however, it has been demonstrated that MSC can be found in all tissues and MSC from different tissues represent distinct populations with differential protein expression unique to each tissue type. Importantly, these cells are efficient mediators of tissue repair, regeneration, and prove to be targets for therapeutics, demonstrated by clinical trials (phase 1C4) for MSC-derived therapies for diseases like graft-versus-host-disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohns disease. The tissue-resident status of MSC found in the lung is a key feature of their importance in the context of disease and injuries of the respiratory system, since these cells could be instrumental to providing more specific and targeted therapies. Currently, bone marrow-derived MSC have been established in the treatment of disease, including diseases of the lung. However, with lung-resident MSC representing a unique population with a different phenotypic and gene expression pattern than MSC derived from other tissues, their role in remediating lung inflammation and injury could provide enhanced efficacy over bone marrow-derived MSC methods. Through this review, lung-resident MSC will be characterized, using previously published data, by surface markers, gene expression patterns, and compared with bone-marrow MSC to highlight similarities and, importantly, differences in these cell types.","output":"Lung-resident mesenchymal stromal cells are tissue-specific regulators of lung homeostasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to close proximity in dormitories, classes, and social activities, college students have been identified as a vulnerable population throughout the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

The proposed system consists of two deep-learning-based models: a quality assessment module that automates predictions of image quality, and a diagnosis assistance module that determines the likelihood-of-anomaly in ultrasound images of sufficient quality. Our two-stage strategy uses a novelty detection algorithm to address the lack of control cases available for training the quality assessment classifier. The diagnosis assistance module can then be trained with data that are deemed of sufficient quality, guaranteed by the closed-loop feedback mechanism from the quality assessment module. Using more than 25,000 ultrasound images from 37 COVID-19-positive patients scanned at two hospitals, plus 12 control cases, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using the proposed machine learning approach. We report an accuracy of 86% when classifying between sufficient and insufficient quality images by the quality assessment module. For data of sufficient quality - as determined by the quality assessment module - the mean classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in detecting COVID-19-positive cases were 0.95, 0.91, and 0.97, respectively, across five holdout test data sets unseen during the training of any networks within the proposed system.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) act together to control the proteolysis of extracellular matrix. Disbalances in the MMP/TIMP system during virally induced neurodegenerative processes and inflammations are responsive to changes in the progression of diseases. METHODS The expression of MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 in JEV-infected mouse brain was analyzed by RT-PCR for semiquantitation and ELISA for estimation of protein along with brain histopathology at different days postinoculation (dpi). Gelatin gel zymography was performed for MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities. RESULTS In the virus-infected group, expression of MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 was found to be increased from 1 dpi to 6 dpi as compared to controls by both RT-PCR and ELISA. The expressions of MMPs and TIMPs at mRNA and protein levels were in concordance with each other. Post hoc multiple comparison analysis between days revealed that, in the virus-infected groups, significant increases (p < 0.05) in MMP and TIMP levels were observed between various dpi at both mRNA and protein levels. Only the MMP-7 protein level at 6 dpi was not significant compared to 5 dpi (p = 0.99). CONCLUSION Overexpression of MMPs and TIMPs is associated with disease severity in the central nervous system (CNS) during JEV infection. Our results showed that JEV infection can alter the expression of MMPs and TIMPs in the CNS. Thus, assessing these important immune mediators in CNS infection appears to play an important role in the development of symptoms and may help to understand the JEV-induced neurological disorders. More studies are required on this important enzymatic system to study their role in immune mediated pathogenesis.","output":"Upregulated expression of matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases in BALB/c mouse brain challenged with Japanese encephalitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is still knowledge gap about the antibody response in COVID-19 patients. Factors affecting the kinetics/titers of the elicited neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), the mean persistence time of NAbs after infection, risk of reinfection, and enhanced respiratory disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) are the main issues needing to be clarified. Recently published studies have suggested an association between increased antibody titers and COVID-19 infection severity. Although there exist insufficient data, the titers of antibodies have been reported to be decreasing rapidly, suggesting a risk of reinfection. If reinfection occurs, another concern is whether it will be more severe due to the preexisting low level antibodies. To combat the continuing pandemic, antibody-based treatments, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), convalescent plasma (CP) therapies, and vaccine studies, have been investigated. Although it may not be as troublesome as in the Dengue fever, clinicians should be alert about the possible risk of ADE. Non-neutralizing antibodies or sub-protective levels of NAbs may trigger immunopathogenic events via immune complex-mediated or Fc receptor-dependent endocytosis, resulting in enhanced viral infection. In this chapter, literature findings revealing the factors with an impact on eliciting NAbs, possible mechanisms and risks of ADE, and safety concerns for SARS-CoV-2 treatment interventions are outlined. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Antibody-Dependent Enhancement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wild edible plants are an important source of healthy food and have played an important role in traditional Mediterranean diets.

Cass, undervalued plants inherent to the spring-summer season in the Valencian coastal region. Nutritional composition and bioactive compounds were analyzed and compared between plants in wild and organic cultivation conditions. Proximate analysis was carried out according to Association of Official Analytical Chemists methods. Total antioxidants were measured as 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl hydrate and total polyphenols content via the FolinCCiocalteu procedure. The HS-SPME technique was used to characterize the volatiles profile, and the polyphenol profile was evaluated by HPLC. The most important microelement was iron. Total antioxidants ranged from 4392.16 to 7315.00 mol Troloxequivalents 100 g(?1) fw, and total phenolic content ranged from 99.09 to 391.18 mg gallic acid equivalents100 g(?1) fw. Results show that the content of antioxidants and phenols was higher in wild species than in cultivated ones. The volatiles profile revealed that P. ruderale was rich in monoterpenoids (48.65C55.82%), and fatty alcohols were characteristic in P. oleracea species (16.21C54.18%).

After successful expression of DENV type 2 NS1 protein, the genes of VHH antibodies against NS1 protein were biopanned from a non-immune llama library by phage display. VHH antibodies were then expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. Simultaneously, monoclonal antibodies were obtained by the conventional route. Sequence analysis of the VHH antibodies revealed novel and long complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3). Epitope mapping was performed via a phage display peptide library using purified VHH and monoclonal antibodies as targets. Interestingly, the same region of NS1, which comprises amino acids (224)HWPKPHTLW(232), was conserved for both kinds of antibodies displaying the consensus motif histidine-tryptophan-tryptophan or tryptophan-proline-tryptophan. The two types of antibodies were used to prepare rapid diagnostic kits based on immunochromatographic assay. The VHH antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kit showed better sensitivity and specificity than the monoclonal antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kit, which might be due to the long CDR3 regions of the VHH antibodies and their ability to bind to the pocket and cleft of the targeted antigen. This demonstrates that VHH antibodies are likely to be an option for developing point-of-care tests against DENV infection.","output":"Development of VHH Antibodies against Dengue Virus Type 2 NS1 and Comparison with Monoclonal Antibodies for Use in Immunological Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liver dysfunction manifesting as elevated aminotransferase levels has been a common feature of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection.
