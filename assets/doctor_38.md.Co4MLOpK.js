We assessed whether sleep and self-reported burnout may be risk factors for COVID-19 among high-risk healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: From 17 July to 25 September 2020, a web-based survey was administered to HCWs in six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, USA) with a high frequency of workplace exposure. Participants provided information on demographics, sleep (number of sleep hours at night, daytime napping hours, sleep problems), burnout from work and COVID-19 exposures. We used multivariable linear and logistic regression models to evaluate the associations between sleep, burnout and COVID-19. RESULTS: Among 2884 exposed HCWs, there were 568 COVID-19 cases and 2316 controls. After adjusting for confounders, 1-hour longer sleep duration at night was associated with 12% lower odds of COVID-19 (p=0.003). Daytime napping hours was associated with 6% higher odds, but the association varied by countries, with a non-significant inverse association in Spain. Compared with having no sleep problems, having three sleep problems was associated with 88% greater odds of COVID-19. Reporting burnout every day was associated with greater odds of COVID-19 (OR: 2.60, 95% CI 1.57 to 4.31, p trend across categories=0.001), longer duration (OR: 2.98, 95% CI 1.10 to 8.05, p trend=0.02) and severity (OR: 3.26, 95% CI 1.25 to 8.48, p trend=0.02) compared with reporting no burnout. These associations remained significant after adjusting for frequency of COVID-19 exposures. CONCLUSIONS: In six countries, longer sleep duration was associated with lower odds of COVID-19, but the association with daytime nap may not be consistent across countries. Greater sleep problems and high level of burnout were robustly associated with greater odds of COVID-19. Sleep and burnout may be risk factors for COVID-19 in high-risk HCWs.","output":"COVID-19 illness in relation to sleep and burnout"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rise of social media and the explosion of digital news in the web sphere have created new challenges to extract knowledge and make sense of published information.

We have previously shown that influenza viruses induce a marked alteration of the nucleus during the time-course of infection and notably in the nucleolar compartment. In this study, we discovered that a major nucleolar component, called nucleolin, is required for an efficient export of vRNPs and viral replication. We have notably shown that nucleolin interacts with the viral nucleoprotein (NP) that mainly constitutes vRNPs. Our results suggest that this interaction could allow vRNPs to catch the host cell export machinery, a necessary step for viral replication.","output":"Nucleolin interacts with influenza A nucleoprotein and contributes to viral ribonucleoprotein complexes nuclear trafficking and efficient influenza viral replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of a portfolio of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to vaccinate the global population remains an urgent public health imperative. Here, we demonstrate the capacity of a subunit vaccine under clinical development, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding domain displayed on a two-component protein nanoparticle (RBD-NP), to stimulate robust and durable neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates. We evaluated five different adjuvants combined with RBD-NP including Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion; AS03, an alpha-tocopherol-containing squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion used in pandemic influenza vaccines; AS37, a TLR-7 agonist adsorbed to Alum; CpG 1018-Alum (CpG-Alum), a TLR-9 agonist formulated in Alum; or Alum, the most widely used adjuvant. All five adjuvants induced substantial nAb and CD4 T cell responses after two consecutive immunizations. Durable nAb responses were evaluated for RBD-NP/AS03 immunization and the live-virus nAb response was durably maintained up to 154 days post-vaccination. AS03, CpG-Alum, AS37 and Alum groups conferred significant protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pharynges, nares and in the bronchoalveolar lavage. The nAb titers were highly correlated with protection against infection. Furthermore, RBD-NP when used in conjunction with AS03 was as potent as the prefusion stabilized Spike immunogen, HexaPro. Taken together, these data highlight the efficacy of the RBD-NP formulated with clinically relevant adjuvants in promoting robust immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates.","output":"Adjuvanting a subunit SARS-CoV-2 nanoparticle vaccine to induce protective immunity in non-human primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background While pulmonary embolism (PE) appears to be a major issue in Covid-19, data remain sparse. Purpose We aimed to describe the risk factors and baseline characteristics of patients with PE in a large cohort of Covid-19 patients. Methods In a retrospective multicentric observational study, we included consecutive hospitalised patients for Covid-19. Patients without computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)-proven PE diagnosis, those who were directly admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and those still hospitalised without PE experience were excluded. Results Among 1240 patients (58.1% men, mean age 6417 years), 103 (8.3%) patients had PE confirmed by CTPA. The ICU transfer requirement and mechanical ventilation requirement were significantly higher in the PE group (P <0.001 and P <0.001, respectively). In an univariable analysis, traditional venous thromboembolic risk factors were not associated with PE (P >0.05), while patients under therapeutic-dose anticoagulation before hospitalisation or prophylaxis-dose anticoagulation introduced during hospitalisation had lower PE occurrence (OR 0.40, 95%CI(0.14-0.91); P = 0.04 and OR 0.11, 95%CI(0.06-0.18); P <0.001, respectively). In a multivariable analysis, the following variables (also statistically significant in univariable analysis) were associated with PE: male gender (OR 1.03, 95%CI(1.003-1.069); P = 0.04), anticoagulation with prophylaxis-dose (OR 0.83, 95%CI(0.79-0.85), P <0.001) or therapeutic-dose (OR 0.87, 95%CI(0.82-0.92), P <0.001), C-reactive protein (OR 1.03, 95%CI(1.01-1.04), P = 0.001) and time from symptom onset to hospitalisation (OR 1.02, 95%CI(1.006-1.038), P = 0.002) (Table 1).

The new technologies also make possible the rapid development of human monoclonal antibodies that could become a potent immediate response to an emergency. So far, several proposals to approach EIDs have been made independently by scientists, the private sector, national governments, and international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO).

To understand these lower rates of mental health care, we performed a systematic review, in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, of barriers that prevent older adults from seeking and accessing treatment. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Clinical Key to identify studies of barriers to mental health treatment in the older adult population (in individuals 50 y of age and older). Thirty-two articles met inclusion criteria (English language and focused on barriers to care in older adults) and exclusion criteria (focus on non-United States populations, focus on younger adults, or no focus on barriers to care). We identified 5 categories of barriers to mental health care in older adults: (1) attitudes and knowledge among older adults; (2) comorbid medical conditions; (3) provider-related factors; (4) other extrinsic barriers (eg, cost, transportation, reliance on caregivers); and (5) unique factors that affect older adults in minority populations. Large studies have primarily identified intrinsic barriers, including negative attitudes toward mental health care and lack of perceived need for treatment, as preventing older adults from seeking mental health care. Minority populations have also been found to face cultural barriers and increased levels of stigma compared with non-Hispanic whites, although several of the identified articles concerning barriers among minority older adults involved qualitative studies with small samples. Larger quantitative studies may help clarify the relative importance of barriers affecting this population.

First, by using Renyi entropy, we analyze the multiscale entropy function in the return time series of Bitcoin, S&P500, WTI, Brent, Gas, Gold, Silver, and investor fear index represented by VIX. Second, by estimating mutual information, we analyze the information sharing between these markets. The analyses are conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical results from Renyi entropy indicate that for all market indices, randomness and disorder are more concentrated in less probable events. The empirical results from mutual information showed that the information sharing network between markets has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Analytical cross-sectional study, secondary analysis based on a previously collected database. A sample of individuals over 18 years of age, residing in Peru and with no history of COVID-19was evaluated. Factors associated with prevention practices were evaluated using Poisson regressions with variance adjustment by region cluster and stratified by rurality. RESULTS: Of 3231 participants included, 2741 (84.8%) were from urban areas and 490 (15.2%) from rural areas. The frequency of good prevention practices against COVID-19 was 27.8% in our total sample. In urban areas the frequency of good prevention practices was 28.8% and in rural areas it was 22.5%. Factors associated with prevention practices against COVID-19 in both urban and rural areas were male sex (urban: aPR 0.64, 95%CI 0.55C0.75; rural: aPR 0.66, 95%CI 0.54C0.80) and self-considering adequately carrying out prevention practices (urban: aPR 2.48, 95%CI 2.13C2.89; rural: aPR 2.70, 95%CI 2.27C3.19).

Background and problem definition: The admission of patients to an intensive care unit is extremely stressful for relatives during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they are not allowed to visit their family members due to a visitation restriction. OBJECTIVES: To describe the experience of relatives during the COVID-19 pandemic and to derive support information for health professionals. METHODS: Qualitative analysis of three written testimonies of relatives whose family members were hospitalized with COVID-19 or other disease at intensive care unit. RESULTS: Relatives report the sudden, unexpected occurrence of the disease. \\"It was there, out of nowhere, hits the heart of life, doesn't just go away, does what it wants. It is an unknown virus that we have to get to know very closely.\\" The ban on visiting was harsh, it made her faint. The first visit was an indescribable joy. Knowing how the family member was and that the health care professionals were taking professional and empathetic care of the sick person were the only things the relatives could hold on to. DISCUSSION: Relatives were reassured when they experienced a high level of commitment on the part of health professionals and received repeated comprehensible information by phone. Limitations and transfer: Restrictions on visits depend on national legislation. Measures such as video calls can also be useful outside of a pandemic to build relationships with relatives.","output":"In sechs Wochen hat sich die Welt ver?ndert: COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article conducts a literature review of current and future challenges in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in cyber physical systems.

PAstV, which was recently identified as an important pathogen of diarrhea in piglets, is widely distributed in China. However, few studies have investigated the coinfection and genetic characterization of PAstV in diarrheic piglets in China. In this study, 89 PAstV-positive samples were identified in 543 diarrhea samples in China from 2015 to 2018, of which 75.28% (67/89) were coinfected with three to five different porcine pathogens, while none were positive for PAstV only. Among the 543 diarrhea samples, statistical analysis showed that PAstV-induced diarrhea was potentially associated with coinfection of PEV (p < 0.01) and GARV (p < 0.01). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 27 identified PAstV strains belong to three different genotypes and that PAstV-2 (81.48%, 22/27) was predominant in diarrheic piglets in China, followed by PAstV-4 (11.11%, 3/27) and PAasV-5 (7.41%, 2/27). Sequence analysis revealed that the 27 RdRp genes identified in this study had nucleotide homologies of 53.8-99.5%. In addition, the RdRp gene of PAstV-4 strain JL/MHK/2018/0115 harbored a unique insert of three nucleotides (GAA) as compared with other known PAstV-4 strains. Furthermore, the genotypes of PAstV varied among different geographical locations, although PAstV-2 was the most widely distributed in China. These data demonstrate that PAstV coinfection with other porcine pathogens was common and there was genetic diversity of PAstV in diarrheic piglets in China.","output":"Coinfection and Genetic Characterization of Porcine Astrovirus in Diarrheic Piglets in China From 2015 to 2018."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assessed the long-term incidence of fractures after stroke and TIA and analyzed associated factors. The fracture incidence increases with age and is higher in stroke than in TIA. Dementia is associated with fractures after both. Our results indicate tailored measures are necessary for preventing fractures after stroke or TIA. INTRODUCTION: In the present study, we aimed to assess the long-term incidence of fractures and analyze associated factors after stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). METHODS: The current cohort study included patients who had received an initial ischemic stroke or TIA diagnosis documented anonymously in the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA) between 2000 and 2016 by physicians in 1262 general practices in Germany. Univariate Cox and multivariate regression models were carried out. RESULTS: Three groups (stroke, TIA, no stroke/TIA), each with 12,265 individuals, were selected (mean age 67.3 years, 48.1% female). A fracture was diagnosed in 12.9% of stroke patients and in 11.4% of TIA patients. Among male stroke patients, 11.1% had a fracture (15.4% among female stroke patients). The hazard ratio (HR) for fractures after stroke was 1.26 (CI: 1.15-1.39) and for fractures after TIA, it was 1.14 (CI: 1.03-1.25). In female stroke patients, the HR for fractures was 1.32 (CI: 1.15-1.60), while in males, it was 1.20 (CI: 1.03-1.39). Among TIA patients, females had an elevated HR for fractures (HR: 1.21; CI: 1.06-1.37). In individuals aged &#8805; 80 years, an increased risk for fractures was only detected among TIA patients (HR: 1.26; CI: 1.05-1.51). Dementia and non-opioid analgesic therapy were positively associated with fracture after both stroke and TIA. CONCLUSION: Stroke was positively associated with fracture in patients < 80 years, while TIA was positively associated with fracture in patients &#8805; 80 years and females.

Methods HBV replication-competent plasmid was cotransfected with pSuper/HBVS1 to HuH-7 cells or to mice. The levels of viral proteins, RNA, and DNA were examined in transfected cells and animals. The effects of pSuper/HBVS1 on clinical isolates with genotypes B and C were also determined. Results pSuper/HBVS1 significantly decreased levels of viral proteins, RNA, and DNA for HBV genotype A in cell culture and in mice. Comparable suppressive effects were observed on clinical isolates of genotypes B and C. A clone with a silent mutation in the target region was identified from a patient with genotype C. This mutant revealed diminished sensitivity to pSuper/HBVS1 and could be selected out in the presence of pSuper/HBVS1 in cell culture.

Evidence from our study indicates that reductions of 24% - 30% to car use and 20% - 26% to air travel could be sustained in the long term. This potentially could lead to annual reductions of 343C529 kgCO(2) per car driver (20% - 29% of pre-COVID-19 car emissions) and 215C359 kgCO(2) per air traveller (10% - 20% of pre-COVID-19 emissions from flying), suggesting that behavioural change may be a major route to emissions reductions. We find that stated voluntary reductions are greater among those who report having more time to do creative things since the start of the COVID-19 lockdowns. Hence, recovery policies promoting low-carbon leisure time may be a key to consumption reductions. We also find that higher-income travellers consume and pollute substantially more than the rest, and yet there is little difference in relative voluntary reductions across the income distribution. We conclude that behaviour associated with affluence represents a major barrier to a low-carbon transition, and that policies must address over-consumption associated with affluence as a priority.","output":"Willingness to reduce travel consumption to support a low-carbon transition beyond COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Working on shifts has the risk of being exposed to health problems, such as obesity and susceptibility to infections and hypertension However, shift work is unavoidable for workers in sectors that require non-stop operations, such as health workers in the Health Service Providers This article presented opinion about an optimal shift rotation pattern in reducing the health risks of shift health workers while increasing the effectiveness of the treatment of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases In general, today's pattern of shift work for health workers is schemed in the eight-day cycle, in which employees work two days in the morning service for seven hours, two days in the evening service for seven hours, and another two days in the night service for ten hours, then followed by two days off This pattern has the potential to cause burnout and decrease reaction time The article identifies a new work shift pattern that can accommodate the risk of burnout while simultaneously assisting in the emergency of the corona outbreak It emphasises the Morning-Evening-Night-Holiday work pattern as an innovative work model that should replace the old work pattern There are seven advantages of the new work pattern: biological balance, availability of transportation, rapid recovery, reduced risk of COVID-19 transmission, increased patient satisfaction, increased self-control, and improved performance","output":"Innovative work shift for health workers in the health service providers in handling COVID-19 cases.

A secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of stringency and timing of the government responses to the early inflow of infected cases. Methods Regional data on mortality week 14-23 in 2020 compared with the same period 2015-2019 were retrieved from Eurostat and national statistical agencies. Data on initial government responses were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Variance-weighted least square regression was used with further adjustment for population density and age distribution. Results Being a region with winter holiday exclusively in week 9 was in the adjusted analysis associated with 16 weekly excess deaths (95% confidence interval 13 to 20) per million inhabitants, which corresponds to 38% of the excess mortality during the study period in these regions. A more stringent response implemented in week 11, corresponding to 10 additional units on the 0-100 ordinal scale, was associated with 20 fewer weekly deaths (95% confidence interval 18 to 22) per million inhabitants.

We aimed to evaluate how it affected such patients during the second lockdown in Israel. METHODS: This national survey included Hebrew-speaking patients with hematological malignancy. This included three tools with 28 items of sociodemographic and medical baseline characteristics, management of hematological disease, and evaluation of emotional coping during COVID-19 pandemic; the Hebrew version of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9; and 3 qualitative open-ended questions. Data was analyzed by mixed methods which combined both quantitative and qualitative thematic analyses. RESULTS: Four hundred eight patients responded to the survey. The management of their hematological disease included a decrease in the number of visits to the hematology clinic (37.0%), delay of some treatment schedules (9.1%), and prescription of replacement therapies permitting less visits to the clinic (2.2%). The frequency and intensity of feeling afraid regarding COVID-19 infection was increased (mean  SD: 4  1 to 5  2 in a 1C7 Likert scale), and a high rate of depression was recorded, which appeared to be more evident in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (p < 0.001).

METHODS The databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, SocINDEX, ASSIA and the Cochrane Library were searched in February 2020. Included studies needed to focus on women's experiences with and expectations of HCPs after disclosure of IPA. We considered primary studies using qualitative methods for both data collection and analysis published since 2004. Studies conducted in any country, in any type of healthcare setting, were included. The quality of individual studies was assessed using an adaptation of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for qualitative studies. The confidence in the overall evidence base was determined using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE)-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research methods. Thematic synthesis was used for analysis. RESULTS Thirty-one papers describing 30 studies were included in the final review. These were conducted in a range of health settings, predominantly in the USA and other high-income countries. All studies were in English. Four main themes were developed through the analysis, describing women's experiences and expectations of HCPs: (1) connection through kindness and care; (2) see the evil, hear the evil, speak the evil; (3) do more than just listen; and (4) plant the right seed. If these key expectations were absent from care, it resulted in a range of negative emotional impacts for women. CONCLUSIONS Our findings strongly align with the principles of woman-centred care, indicating that women value emotional connection, practical support through action and advocacy and an approach that recognises their autonomy and is tailored to their individual needs. Drawing on the evidence, we have developed a best practice model to guide practitioners in how to deliver woman-centred care.

METHODS: Clinical, laboratory, radiology, and treatment data of 41 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively collected. The population was stratified by disease severity as mild, moderate, or severe, based on guidelines of the National Health and Medical Commission of China. RESULTS: The 41 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were studied, and the median age was 45 years (interquartile range [IQR], 31C53; range, 10C87 years) and 18 patients (43.9%) were female. All of the patients had recently visited Wuhan or other places (ie, Beijing, Thailand) or had Wuhan-related exposure. Common symptoms included fever (32[78%]) and cough (29[70.7%]). All patients were without hepatitis B/C virus hepatitis. CRP (C-reactive protein, 11.3 mg/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 2.45C35.2]) was elevated in 22 patients (53.7%), and cardiac troponin I (1.5 ng/mL [IQR, 0.8C5.0]) was elevated in 41 patients (100%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral ground glass opacity (GGO) or GGO with consolidation in the lungs of 27(65.9%) patients. 31(75.6%) patients had an abnormal electrocardiograph (ECG).

So far, many prognostic models have been introduced to guide treatment and resource management. However, data on the impact of measurable respiratory parameters associated with the disease are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the role of Comorbidity-Age-Lymphocyte count-Lactate dehydrogenase (CALL) score and to introduce Respiratory Assessment Scoring (RAS) model in predicting disease progression and mortality in COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: Data of 252 confirmed COVID-19 patients were collected at Pak Emirates Military Hospital (PEMH) from 10th April 2020 to 31st August 2020. The CALL score and proposed factors of RAS model, namely respiratory rate, oxygen saturation at rest, alveolar arterial gradient and minimal exercise desaturation test, were calculated on the day of admission. Progression of disease was defined and correlated with measured variables. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis for each variable, its hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated, and a nomogram was made using the high-risk respiratory parameters to establish the RAS model. RESULTS: Progression of disease and death was observed in 124 (49.2%) and 49 (19.4%) patients, respectively. Presence of more than 50% of chest infiltrates was significantly associated with worsening disease and death (p-value <0.001). Death was observed in 100% of patients who had critical disease category on presentation. Regression analysis showed that the presence of comorbidity (n: 180), in contrast to other variables of CALL score, was not a good prognosticator of disease severity (p-value: 0.565). Nonetheless, the CALL model itself was validated to be a reliable prognostic indicator of disease progression and mortality. Some 10 feet oxygen desaturation test (HR: 0.99, 95%CI: 0.95-1.04, p--value: 0.706) was not a powerful predictor of the progression of disease. However, respiratory rate of more than 30 breaths/minute (b/m) (HR: 3.03, 95%CI: 1.77-5.19), resting oxygen saturation of less than 90% (HR: 2.41, 95%CI: 1.15-5.06), and an elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (HR: 2.14, 95%CI: 1.04-4.39) were considered statistically significant high-risk predictors of disease progression and death, in the formed RAS model.

Centargo CT Injection System, Centargo) to the currently available MEDRAD(?) Stellant CT Injection System (Stellant), in terms of efficiency, injector performance, and user satisfaction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 425 patients at two sites were enrolled; 198 patients in phase one, a randomized study (98 Stellant and 100 Centargo). The second observational phase included 227 patients who were injected with Centargo. Phase one recorded times for setup, disassembly, and patient changeovers. Demographic data, subjective image quality, and injection parameters were collected. Phase two assessed usability via a questionnaire provided to all end-users of both systems (radiographers). RESULTS: Patient changeover times were statistically significantly faster with Centargo (15.4s  8.7s vs 53.7s  19.6s, p < 0.001). Centargo day-setup times were similar to Stellant (138.1s  92s vs 151.8s  30.6s, p = 0.33) and end-of-day-disassembly times were significantly slower (60.6s  27s vs 17.1s  12.9s, p < 0.001). Based on four different scenarios modelling patient throughput, the projected time savings with Centargo over Stellant was 40C63%, with the highest efficiency improvements for higher throughputs and the use of larger contrast medium bottles. Both Centargo and Stellant usability averaged between Very Easy and Easy in all responses to the questionnaire. There were no instances of interrupted injections due to communication loss or detected air and no insufficient images due to injector performance. No safety issues were identified.

Successful implementation of such programmes depends on several factors, including feasibility, acceptability and how people act on test results. There is a paucity of studies examining these issues. Objective We aimed to examine experiences of university students and staff with experience of regular asymptomatic self-testing using LFTs, and their subsequent behaviours. Methods We invited people who were participating in a weekly testing feasibility study. We conducted semi-structured remote interviews between December 2020 and January 2021. Additional qualitative data from a survey were also analysed. Data were analysed thematically. Results We interviewed 18 and surveyed 214 participants. Participants were motivated to regularly self-test as they wanted to know whether or not they were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Most reported that a negative test result did not change their behaviour but it did provide them with reassurance to engage with permitted activities. In contrast, some participants reported making decisions about visiting other people when they would not have done so otherwise, because they felt reassured by a negative test result. Participants valued the test training but some participants still doubted their ability to carry out the test. Participants were concerned about safety of attending test sites with lots of people and reported home testing was most convenient. Conclusions If governments want to increase uptake of LFT use, clear messages highlighting the benefits of regular testing for family, friends and society in identifying asymptomatic cases are needed. This should be coupled with transparent communication about accuracy of LFTs and how to act on either a positive or negative result. Concerns about safety, convenience of testing, and ability to do tests need to be addressed to ensure successful scaling up asymptomatic testing.","output":"Perceptions on undertaking regular asymptomatic self-testing for COVID-19 using lateral flow tests: A qualitative study of university students and staff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses special challenges to immunocompromised transplant patients.

Symptoms may be absent or blunted, and acute phase reactants, like procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) may not elevate. For these patients, minor signs or symptoms could lead to hospitalization and antibiotic prescriptions to prevent complications or death. FebriDx? is a rapid, qualitative immunoassay test designed to distinguish between viral or bacterial respiratory infection through simultaneous detection of both CRP and Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) from a fingerstick blood sample. Methods FebriDx was evaluated as part of a real-world prospective, observational study in hospitalized patients with symptoms of ARI and suspected COVID-19 in a single tertiary care center in Italy (August, 2020 - January, 2021). A sub analysis of patients with expected reduced host immune responses secondary to immunosuppression by disease or medication was performed. (Classified by treating clinician;patient on high dose steroids/ immunosuppressive therapy, or underlying condition like cancer or autoimmune disease). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratios were calculated for FebriDx with respect to the final diagnosis. Results We included 28 patients from 200 in the study, 16 patients had a final diagnosis of bacterial infection and 12 had viral infection. FebriDx showed a sensitivity of 91.7% to accurately diagnose viral infection and 93.8% for bacterial infection (see tables). Serum CRP was not available for 4 of the patients included (14%) and elevated in the remaining patients. PCT was not available for one patient with viral infection and was elevated in 50.0%. FebriDx Performance when compared to Clinical Diagnosis Conclusion FebriDx demonstrated a higher accuracy for differentiating bacterial vs. viral infection in an immunocompromised cohort than single biomarkers CRP and PCT. FebriDx demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy to differentiate viral from bacterial infection in patients with chronic immunosuppressive conditions in a real-world setting and had better performance than standalone CRP and PCT to distinguish viral and bacterial ARI in immunocompromised patients.

The rapid spread of the disease coupled with the lack of specific registered drugs for its treatment pose a great challenge that necessitate the development of therapeutic agents from a variety of sources. In this study, we employed an in-silico method to screen natural compounds with a view to identify inhibitors of the human transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2). The activity of this enzyme is essential for viral access into the host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). Inhibiting the activity of this enzyme is therefore highly crucial for preventing viral fusion with ACE-2 thus shielding SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. 3D model of TMPRSS2 was constructed using I-TASSER, refined by GalaxyRefine, validated by Ramachandran plot server and overall model quality was checked by ProSA. 95 natural compounds from microalgae were virtually screened against the modeled protein that led to the identification 17 best leads capable of binding to TMPRSS2 with a good binding score comparable, greater or a bit lower than that of the standard inhibitor (camostat). Physicochemical properties, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) and toxicity analysis revealed top 4 compounds including the reference drug with good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles.

Understanding how German teachers were caught unprepared in this time of crisis, especially in comparison with their European neighbors, requires an examination of their habitus as discussed by Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992) that accounts for their behaviors beyond existing models regarding technology acceptance. Drawing on existing sociological and media-related studies, this contribution will describe the attitudes of German teachers and educational decision-makers in light of their digital, cultural, and educational habitus to provide a partial explanatory account for the current state of affairs.

We aim to study the clinical characteristics, immunological laboratory data, and immunoglobulin response in patients with MS and COVID-19, to identify factors impacting disease severity and immune response. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Database search was done using DataDirect to search for MS patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 at the University of Michigan hospital. Patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID-19 between March 1 and September 2020 were included. The primary outcome was the immunological laboratory data and immunoglobulin levels and the secondary outcome was their disease severity. We collected demographics, neurological history, MS treatment, Expanded Disability Scale Score (EDSS), comorbidities, and COVID-19 characteristics. A 7-point ordinal scale previously used to assess disease severity was used. Univariate and multivariate analyses will be performed to assess relationships between the collected variables. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: A total of 17 patients, mean age 53 (SD 11.6) years, mean disease duration, 6.2(SD 4.1) years were analyzed. 41% of patients had relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, 17% had primary progressive MS.

However, it is difficult to diagnose IM only with subjective symptoms, and thus EBV and CMV are nearly indistinguishable in clinical practice. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old healthy Japanese woman had a 2-day history of high fever and consulted us. She had sex for the first time 6 months earlier. Her virus antibodies showed that she was infected with primary CMV. About 5 months later, she again experienced high fever and lymph node enlargement at the posterior cervical region.

In arteriviruses and coronaviruses, these mRNAs contain a common 5' leader sequence, derived from the genomic 5' end. The joining of the leader sequence to different segments derived from the 3'-proximal part of the genome (mRNA bodies) presumably involves a unique mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand RNA synthesis in which base pairing between sense and antisense transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) plays an essential role. The leader TRS is present in the loop of a hairpin structure that functions in sg mRNA synthesis. In this study, the minimal sequences in the 5'-proximal region of the Equine arteritis virus genome that are required for sg RNA synthesis were delimited through mutagenesis. A full-length cDNA clone was engineered in which this domain was duplicated, allowing us to make mutations and monitor their effects on sg RNA synthesis without seriously affecting genome replication and translation. The leader TRS present in the duplicated sequence was used and yielded novel sg mRNAs with significantly extended leaders. Our combined findings suggest that the leader TRS hairpin (LTH) and its immediate flanking sequences are essential for efficient sg RNA synthesis and form an independent functional entity that could be moved 300 nucleotides downstream of its original position in the genome. We hypothesize that a conformational switch in the LTH region regulates the role of the 5'-proximal region of the arterivirus genome in subgenomic RNA synthesis.","output":"Discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis in arteriviruses is guided by an RNA hairpin structure located in the genomic leader region."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Latin American Society of Nephrology and Hypertension carried out a cohort prospective, multinational registry of patients with kidney impairment associated to COVID-19 in Latin America through open invitation in order to describe the characteristics of the disease in the region.

The present study focuses on the policy proposals in the context of new economic geography and evolutionary economic geography for lagging-behind areas. Industrial agglomeration, as an essential element of the new economic geography, has restricted the potential for policy-making in lagging-behind regions. Creating regional advantages, as a policy in evolutionary economic geography, has provided diversified policy options for lagging-behind regions. However, this approach faces multi-level challenges in lagging-behind regions, including the lack of critical mass about low diversity and the gap in the knowledge base between lagging-behind and affluent areas.

In this work, we first proposed a novel hybrid device of organic LEDs and inorganic blue GaN LEDs to achieve full white and other colors. Organic LEDs were stacked with green and red emissive layers and connected with blue GaN LEDs in parallel but in opposite polarity voltage. Under the alternate-current (AC) driving, the hybrid structure can be controlled independently by applying timing variable opposite voltages to emit the light from either blue LEDs or the stacked OLEDs for forming mixed colors. The hybrid device can generate white light, varying in a wide range by changing the amplitude and duty ratio (DR) of AC-driving signals, from cold white to standard white and to warm white (3668-11 833 K). When an AC voltage of (4.80 V, -2.45 V) was applied, the device has a high color gamut of 95.24% National Television System Committee (NTSC) and a high color rendering index (R a) of 92.4%.

We aimed to examine the changes in ED utilization during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, in a country with a well-developed primary care system. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of ED utilization was performed in 3 Dutch hospitals during a 60-day period, starting on February 15, 2020. The identical period in 2019 was used as a reference. ED visits were labeled as COVID-related (defined as COVID-19 suspected) or non-COVID-related. Admission rates were compared using chi-square tests, and the reduction in ED visits was assessed descriptively. RESULTS: During the study period, daily ED volume was 18% lower compared to that of 2019. ED utilization further declined (-29%) during lockdown. Combined admission rates were higher in 2020 compared to those in 2019 (P < 0.001), and they were higher for COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 ED visits (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ED utilization was markedly reduced during the local rise of COVID-19 in a region with a well-developed primary care system and relatively low ED self-referral rates. Although it cannot directly be concluded from the findings of our study, this observation likely reflects a complex interaction between pure lockdown effects and viral fear, which warrants further research.","output":"Reduced Emergency Department Utilization During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Viral Fear or Lockdown Effect?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As for many classifiers, decision trees predictions are naturally probabilistic, with a frequentist probability distribution on labels associated to each leaf of the tree. Those probabilities have the major drawback of being potentially unreliable in the case where they have been estimated from a limited number of examples. Empirical Bayes methods enable the updating of observed probability distributions for which the parameters of the prior distribution are estimated from the data. This paper presents an approach of smoothing decision trees predictive binary probabilities with an empirical Bayes method. The update of probability distributions associated with tree leaves creates a correction concentrated on small-sized leaves, which improves the quality of probabilistic tree predictions. The amplitude of these corrections is used to generate predictive belief functions which are finally evaluated through the ensemblist extension of three evaluation indexes of predictive probabilities.","output":"Bayesian Smoothing of Decision Tree Soft Predictions and Evidential Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Transplant recipients are prone to developing severe infections because of immunosuppression. Therefore, studying the manifestation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in transplant recipients is of particular importance. METHODS: One hundred twelve transplant patients consecutively visiting the outpatient department of 2 German transplant centers were included in this study after providing written informed consent. The patients were interviewed about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms and history. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA were measured concomitantly in patient sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The risk of severe COVID-19 according to 2 recent scores differed among the analyzed patients. All patients were well educated about their presumed higher risk of a severe COVID-19 and described performing self-isolation wherever possible. Nevertheless, 20 patients reported contact with someone suspected of having COVID-19 or who tested positive shortly thereafter (18%). Despite this relatively high exposure, no clinically relevant case of COVID-19 was reported. Though SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA were found in 3 patients (3%); 2 patients were asymptomatic and only 1 had mild COVID-19 symptoms and positive RT-PCR 4 weeks earlier. There were no occult SARS-CoV-2 infections, as demonstrated by negative PCR tests. CONCLUSION: Despite the high exposure level, the incidence of COVID-19 remained very low.

The risk of hematoma associated with intraoperative ketorolac is low, but whether concomitant routine discharge with NSAIDs increases the risk of hematoma is unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients who underwent lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and compared the 30-day risk of hematoma between patients discharged with opioids (opioid period: January 2018CAugust 2018) and patients discharged with NSAIDs with or without opioids (NSAID period: January 2019CApril 2020). The association between study period and hematoma risk was assessed using multivariable models. Covariates included intraoperative ketorolac, home aspirin, and race/ethnicity. During the NSAID period, a survey was used to assess analgesic consumption on postoperative days 1C5. RESULTS: In total, 2724 patients were identified: 858 (31%) in the opioid period and 1866 (69%) in the NSAID period. In the NSAID period, 867 (46%) received NSAIDs and opioids, and 999 (54%) received NSAIDs only. Receipt of intraoperative ketorolac was higher in the NSAID period (78 vs. 64%, P < 0.001). The risks of any hematoma (4.1 vs. 3.6%, P = 0.6) and reoperation for bleeding (0.5 vs. 0.6%, P = 0.8) were similar between groups. Study period was not associated with hematoma risk (odds ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.56C1.35, P = 0.5). Among survey respondents (41%), nonopioid analgesic consumption did not increase after opioids were removed from the discharge regimen (median, 6 pills/group, P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: NSAIDs are associated with a low risk of hematoma after lumpectomy and SLNB, and should be prescribed instead of opioids, unless contraindicated.","output":"Postdischarge Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Are not Associated with Risk of Hematoma after Lumpectomy and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy with Multimodal Analgesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the influence of prostate gland size on the perioperative, pathologic, and continence outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP).

To investigate baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection course, requiring respiratory support in the critical care settings of dedicated hospital. Materials and methods. In single-center retrospective study retrospective data collection of 451 respiratory support for COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome cases (noninvasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation) in intensive care unit patients for a 5-month period performed. The analysis aimed on demographic, clinical data, disease severity scores, respiratory support parameters and modality, continuous renal replacement therapy utilization and interleukin-6 receptor blockers administration, survival rates. Results. Respiratory support required 48.8 % of intensive care unit patients, the population was demographically balanced, Charlson Comorbidity Index was 4.46  2.6 and was higher in the mechanically ventilated group. 30-day survival rate (all respiratory support cases) was 33.7 %, mortality structure analysis performed. The disease severity scores, respiratory mechanics among patients in dependence of respiratory support mode and during the period of case registration analysed as well. Median static respiratory compliance at the point of initiation of invasive mechanically ventilation was 43 (IQR 35C51). Mortality in the volume controlled mechanically ventilated group was higher. Conclusions. The patients, requiring respiratory support, during intensive care unit stay have high comorbidity levels. Indications for non-invasive ventilation may be extended on patients with lower Charlson index and initial SOFA score, however, early recognition of high risk of noninvasive ventilation failure required. Volume control invasive ventilation associated with higher mortality levels despite comparable disease severity scores. Further investigation required. ? 2021, Practical Medicine Publishing House LLC.

Through close co-operation between industrial and academic partners, it is possible to successfully collect, isolate and classify marine organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, micro- and macroalgae, cyanobacteria, and marine invertebrates from the oceans and seas globally. Extracts and purified compounds of these organisms can be studied for several therapeutically and industrially significant biological activities, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, and anticoagulant activities by applying a wide variety of screening tools, as well as for ion channel/receptor modulation and plant growth regulation. Chromatographic isolation of bioactive compounds will be followed by structural determination. Sustainable cultivation methods for promising organisms and biotechnological processes for selected compounds can be developed, as well as biosensors for monitoring the target compounds. The (semi)synthetic modification of marine-based bioactive compounds produces their new derivatives, structural analogs and mimetics that could serve as hit or lead compounds and be used to expand compound libraries based on marine natural products. The research innovations can be targeted for industrial product development in order to improve the growth and productivity of marine biotechnology. Marine research aims at a better understanding of environmentally conscious sourcing of marine biotechnology products and increased public awareness of marine biodiversity. Marine research is expected to offer novel marine-based lead compounds for industries and strengthen their product portfolios related to pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmetic, agrochemical, food processing, material and biosensor applications.","output":"Exploring marine resources for bioactive compounds."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide since 2020, placing a huge burden on medical facilities. In the field of respiratory medicine, there has been a decrease in the number of patients. While many pulmonologists have been receiving patients with COVID-19, the actual effects on respiratory care have not been elucidated. Therefore, we conducted this study to clarify the effects of COVID-19 on medical care in the field of respiratory medicine. METHODS: We conducted a questionnaire survey among 749 hospitals belonging to the Board-Certified Member system of the Japanese Respiratory Society on the effects of COVID-19 from November 2021. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 170 hospitals (23%), in approximately 70% of which the respiratory medicine department was the main department involved in managing COVID-19. The number of spirometry and bronchoscopy tests decreased by 25% and 15%, respectively, and the number of both outpatients and inpatients decreased in 93% of hospitals. Among respiratory diseases, the number of patients hospitalized for usual pneumonia, bronchial asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease decreased greatly by 30%C45%. In 62% of hospitals, the biggest effect of the COVID-19 pandemic was the greater burden in terms of the clinical workload due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of tests and non-COVID-19 outpatients and inpatients decreased in respiratory medicine departments during the COVID-19 pandemic, the workload increased due to COVID-19, resulting in a great increase in the clinical burden.","output":"Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Respiratory Care in Japan: A Nationwide Survey by the Japanese Respiratory Society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans learn about the world by collectively acquiring information, filtering it, and sharing what we know.

Over the years a growing body of scientific evidence has been gathered, suggesting that these compounds have therapeutic potential. In this article, we review the classification of cannabinoids, the molecular mechanisms of their interaction with animal cells as well as their potential application in the treatment of human diseases. Specifically, we focus on the research concerning the anticancer potential of cannabinoids in preclinical studies, their possible use in cancer treatment and palliative medicine, as well as their influence on the immune system. We also discuss their potential as therapeutic agents in infectious, autoimmune, and gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases. We postulate that the currently ongoing and future clinical trials should be accompanied by research focused on the cellular and molecular response to cannabinoids and Cannabis extracts, which will ultimately allow us to fully understand the mechanism, potency, and safety profile of cannabinoids as single agents and as complementary drugs.","output":"Cannabinoids in Medicine: Cancer, Immunity, and Microbial Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health disparities are health differences linked with economic, social and environmental disadvantage.

Data on the rates of pituitary dysfunction and recovery in a large cohort of NFPA patients undergoing ETSS and the predictors of endocrine function before and after ETSS are scarce. This study is purposed to analyze the comprehensive changes in hormonal function and identify factors that predict recovery or worsening of hormonal axes following ETSS for NFPA. METHODS: A retrospective review of 601 consecutive patients who underwent ETSS between 2010 and 2018 at one institution was performed. Recovery or development of new hypopituitarism was analyzed in 209 NFPA patients who underwent ETSS. RESULTS: Patients with preoperative endocrine deficits (59.8%) in one or more pituitary axes had larger tumor volumes (P = 0.001) than those without preoperative deficits. Recovery of preoperative pituitary deficit occurred in all four axes, with overall mean recovery of 29.7%. The cortisol axis showed the highest recovery whereas the thyroid axis showed the lowest, with 1-year cumulative recovery rates of 44.3% and 6.1%, respectively. Postoperative hypopituitarism occurred overall in 17.2%, most frequently in the thyroid axis (24.3%, 27/111) and least frequently in the cortisol axis (9.7%, 16/165).

This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. METHODS: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. RESULTS: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. DISCUSSION: French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.","output":"[Ensuring mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: A narrative review]./ Assurer les soins aux patients souffrant de troubles psychiques en France pendant l'pidmie  SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The course of infection by SARS-CoV-2 frequently includes a long asymptomatic period, followed in some individuals by an immune dysregulation period that may lead to complications and immunopathology-induced death. This course of disease suggests that the virus often evades detection by the innate immune system. We suggest a novel therapeutic approach to mitigate the infection's severity, probability of complications and duration. We propose that priming an individual's innate immune system for viral attack shortly before it is expected to occur may allow pre-activation of the preferable trajectory of immune response, leading to early detection of the virus. Priming can be carried out, for example, by administering a standard vaccine or another reagent that elicits a broad anti-viral innate immune response. By the time that the expected SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs, activation cascades will have been put in motion and levels of immune factors needed to combat the infection will have been elevated. The infection would thus be cleared faster and with less complication than otherwise, alleviating adverse clinical outcomes at the individual level. Moreover, priming may also mitigate population-level risk by reducing need for hospitalizations and decreasing the infectious period of individuals, thus slowing the spread and reducing the impact of the epidemic. In view of the latter consideration, our proposal may have a significant epidemiological impact even if applied primarily to low-risk individuals, such as young adults, who often show mild symptoms or none, by shortening the period during which they unknowingly infect others. The proposed view is, at this time, an unproven hypothesis. Although supported by robust bio-medical reasoning and multiple lines of evidence, carefully designed clinical trials are necessary.","output":"A new perspective for mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection: priming the innate immune system for viral attack"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The hand hygiene may possibly influence the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the multifactorial influence on hand hygiene knowledge and behaviors is proven.

The study was conducted Polish Adolescents COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study population (n = 2323) that was recruited based on a random sampling of schools, while the pair-matching procedure was applied within schools and age, in order to obtain adequate number of boys and girls, representative for the general Polish population (n = 1222). The participants were asked about their handwashing habits while using Handwashing Habits Questionnaire (HHQ) and about applied procedure of washing hands. The results were compared in subgroups that were stratified by region for COVID-19 morbidity, socioeconomic status of the region, and rural/urban environment. In regions of low COVID-19 morbidity, a higher share of adolescents, than in regions of high morbidity, declared washing their hands before meals (p = 0.0196), after meals (p = 0.0041), after preparing meals (p = 0.0297), before using the restroom (p = 0.0068), after using the restroom (p = 0.0014), after combing their hair (p = 0.0298), after handshaking (p = 0.0373), after touching animals (p = 0.0007), after contacting babies (p = 0.0278), after blowing nose (p = 0.0435), after touching sick people (p = 0.0351), and after cleaning home (p = 0.0234).

Yet, most analysis uses either exogenous projections of productivity and growth or specifications endogenously enriched with a very small set of drivers. Extending endogenous treatment of productivity to represent two-way interactions with a significant set of goal-related variables can considerably enhance analysis. Among such variables incorporated in this project are aspects of human development (e.g., education, health, poverty reduction), socio-political change (e.g., governance capacity and quality), and infrastructure (e.g. water and sanitation and modern energy access), all in conditional interaction with underlying technological advance and economic convergence among countries. Using extensive datasets across countries and time, this project broadly endogenizes total factor productivity (TFP) within a large-scale, multi-issue IAM, the International Futures (IFs) model system. We demonstrate the utility of the resultant open system via comparison of new TFP projections with those produced for Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios, via integrated analysis of economic growth potential, and via multi-scenario analysis of progress toward the SDGs.

To date, oncology and surgery groups have only given instructions for addressing phases 1 and 2. To prevent excess cancer mortality, health care systems (HCS) need to be restructured. Our aim is to detail the specificities of each epidemic phase and discuss several methods of organization to optimize cancer patient flow during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during phase 3. Hospitals must be reorganized in order to create a cancer hub that is free of infection, allowing for the safe treatment of patients. Hospital structures are different, but all allow for the creation of virus-free areas. Screening programs are critical and need to be applied to all people entering the virus-free zone, including health care workers. Some reorganization proposals are internal to a hospital, while others require interhospital collaboration. The heterogeneity and complexity of HCS will make interhospital management difficult. The ministry of health has an important role in managing the cancer crisis. Cancer management should be declared a priority. Oncological and surgical societies must coordinate their efforts to facilitate this prioritization. The anticipation of oncological management during phase 3 of the pandemic is necessary because it requires a complete readjustment of HCS.

The needs of different Canadian stakeholder groups related to childrens pain have not been examined, limiting the degree to which KMb efforts can be tailored to each group. AIMS: The study aim was to identify shared and unique needs, barriers, and accessibility of evidence for childrens pain across three stakeholder groups: knowledge users (i.e., health professionals, administrators, policymakers, educators), researchers (including trainees), and patients, caregivers, and family members. METHODS: This study comprised an online needs assessment survey. Analyses included descriptive statistics, one-way analyses of variances, and chi-square tests to examine differences between stakeholder groups. Open-ended responses were analyzed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 711 stakeholders completed the survey. Educational materials were the most utilized evidence-based resources among all stakeholders. Researchers and patients/caregivers/family members found resources significantly less accessible than knowledge users (P = 0.008). Knowledge of evidence was the primary barrier across all stakeholder groups (69.2%, n = 492); however, each group reported a need for stakeholder-specific resources. Finally, stakeholders desired opportunities to engage in the KMb process through partnerships and an increased awareness of childrens pain.

Although value-added pulse products are emerging as a means of income maximization in the agri-food industry, there is a lack of understanding about consumers who purchase these products. This study fills the gap by developing a research framework for agriculture-related businesses. The findings may provide further insights into consumers attitudes and behaviors in consuming agri-foods, thereby assisting pulse producers and marketers to develop a more effective marketing strategy.","output":"The Role of Beliefs, Pride, and Perceived Barriers in Decision-Making Regarding Purchasing Value-Added Pulse Products among US Consumers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Determining the roles of carbohydrates in cell biology is hindered by the tremendous efforts that must be taken either to synthesize carbohydrates chemically or to isolate them from natural sources.

The mean incubation period was 7.3+/-7.0 days (3.14 days). The onset symptoms were characterized by fever (100%), cough (49.1%), maylgia (24.5%), shortness of breath (20.8%), malaise (17.0%),and diarrhea (5.7%). Routine blood test during the first to the fifth day of the disease revealed WBCs less than 4.0x10(9) /L in 33 patients (62.3%), 4.0-10.0x10(9)/L in 18 patients (34.0%), lymphopenia in 36 patients (67.9%), and PLT less than 100.0x10(9) in 7 patients (13.2%). The main abnormal X-ray finding was single (75.4%) or bilateral (15.1%) localized patchy clouding opacity. The decrease of arterial partial pressure of oxygen occurred in 26 patients (49.1%). The damage of several organs was common, including the elevated ALT or AST in 20 patients (37.7%), elevated BUN or SCR in 6 patients (11.3%) and elevated LDH or CK or HBDH in 23 patients (43.4%).

Systemic activation of the inflammatory system after aortic injury may play a role in the development of LOI. The aim of this study is to clarify the effect of beta-blockers on systemic inflammation and the development of LOI after distal type AAD. A total of 49 patients, who were admitted with distal type AAD and treated conservatively, were examined. White blood cell (WBC) count, serum CRP level, and arterial blood gases were measured serially. Forty patients received beta-blocker treatment within 24 h of the onset, while 9 patients received no beta-blocker treatment. Maximum WBC count, maximum CRP level, lowest PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio, and patient background were compared between the two groups. There was no difference between the groups according to age, sex, coronary risk factors, blood pressure, serum level of CRP, WBC count, and oxygenation index on admission. Beta-blocker treatment was associated with lower maximum WBC count (P = 0.0028) and lower maximum serum CRP level (P = 0.0004). The minimum P/F ratio was higher in patients with beta-blocker treatment than in those without (P = 0.0076). Multivariate analysis revealed that administration of a beta-blocker was an independent negative determinant of LOI (P/F ratio 200 mmHg). In conclusion, early use of beta-blockers prevented excessive inflammation and LOI after distal type AAD, suggesting a pleiotropic effect of beta-blockers on the inflammatory response after AAD.","output":"Early use of beta-blockers attenuates systemic inflammatory response and lung oxygenation impairment after distal type acute aortic dissection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early assessments of the spreading rate of COVID-19 were subject to significant uncertainty, as expected with limited data and difficulties in case ascertainment, but more reliable inferences can now be made.

Underlying diseases, including cancer, are high-risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor, plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 invading human cells. ACE2 also has significant associations with cancer. Recent studies showed that ACE2 was inversely correlated with the activities of multiple oncogenic pathways and tumor progression phenotypes, and was positively correlated with antitumor immune response and survival prognosis in diverse cancers, suggesting a potential protective role of ACE2 in cancer progression. Positive expression of ACE2 is also correlated with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in cancer. The positive associations of ACE2 expression with antitumor immune signatures and PD-L1 expression indicate that ACE2 expression is a positive predictor for the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This was evidenced in multiple cancer cohorts treated with ICIs. Thus, ACE2 may build potential connections between COVID-19 and cancer and cancer immunotherapy. The potential connections suggest that ACE2 inhibitors may not be a good option for treating COVID-19 patients with cancer, particularly in cancer patients who are receiving immunotherapy.

The uncertainty of the problem is handled with a hybrid robust-stochastic optimization approach. A Lagrangian relaxation (LR) method and a constructive heuristic (CH) algorithm are developed for overcoming problem complexity and solving large-scale instances.

The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a new articulating vessel sealer for laparoscopic hepatectomy. Our hypothesis was that this new device would facilitate parenchymal transection and reduce intraoperative costs in laparoscopic hepatectomy. METHODS Within 18 months, a 5 cm bipolar articulating vessel sealer was used in 32 laparoscopic liver resections (LLR). By excluding 4 patients who underwent concomitant colorectal resections, the outcomes of the remaining 28 patients (group 1) were compared with 28 patients who underwent LLR by the same surgical group using other energy devices (group 2). RESULTS Tumor type was malignant in 71% of patients (n=20) in group 1 and 89% of the patients (n=25) in group 2 (P=0.360). The number and size of tumors were similar in both groups, as well as the type of resections performed. In group 1, there was a less number of adjunctive devices (ie, energy, clip appliers, staplers) used (median 2) compared with group 2 (median 3, P=0.032). Parenchymal transection time (meanSEM 28.23.5 vs. 55.24.1 min, respectively, P<0.001) and total operative time (200.113.7 vs. 242.714.4 min, respectively, P=0.036) were shorter for group 1 versus group 2.

Disparities in the consultation burden of sub-specialities and socio-demographic differences in teleconsultation utilization were also assessed. METHODS: Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital Rawalpindi began audio and video teleconsultation using broadband telecommunication services during the lockdown. Patients' and consultations' data gathered during the first three weeks after the commencement of this programme were compared with data from the four weeks prior to lockdown. The weekly consultation ratio and overall consultation burden of sub-specialities were measured. Chi-Square tests of association determined the relationship between different variables (socioeconomic status and consultation characteristics) and consultation modality (on-site vs online). RESULTS: In total, 17507 on-site consultations (4377/week) were conducted compared to 1431 teleconsultations (477/week), which maintained 10.89% of the weekly pre-lockdown eye care services. The post-lockdown teleconsultation programme saw a relatively higher percentage of service utility among female (47.09% vs 44.71%), younger-age (31.3319.45 vs 41.2523.32 years) and higher-socioeconomic-status (32.21% vs 0.30%) patients compared to pre-lockdown on-site consultations. The most common indication for teleconsultation was red-eye (16.70%). While cornea and glaucoma clinics maintained most of the pre-lockdown services (30.42% and 29% respectively), the highest dropout was seen in optometric and vitreoretinal services supporting only 5.54% and 8.28% of pre-lockdown services, respectively.

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 164 patients with TETs who underwent CECT scans before treatment. A total of 130 patients (approximately 79%, from 2012 to 2018) were designated as the training set, and 34 patients (approximately 21%, from 2019 to 2021) were designated as the testing set. The analysis of variance and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm methods were used to select the radiomics features. A logistic regression classifier was constructed to identify various subgroups of TETs. The predictive performance of RMs was evaluated based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. RESULTS: Two RMs included 16 and 13 radiomics features to identify three risk subgroups of traditional risk grouping [low-risk thymomas (LRT: Types A, AB and B1), high-risk thymomas (HRT: Types B2 and B3), thymic carcinoma (TC)] and improved risk grouping [LRT* (Types A and AB), HRT* (Types B1, B2 and B3), TC], respectively. For traditional risk grouping, the areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) of LRT, HRT, and TC were 0.795, 0.851, and 0.860, respectively, the accuracy was 0.65 in the training set, the AUCs were 0.621, 0.754, and 0.500, respectively, and the accuracy was 0.47 in the testing set. For improved risk grouping, the AUCs of LRT*, HRT*, and TC were 0.855, 0.862, and 0.869, respectively, and the accuracy was 0.72 in the training set; the AUCs were 0.778, 0.716, and 0.879, respectively, and the accuracy was 0.62 in the testing set.

Because public behaviour is key to curbing the pandemic at an early stage, it is important for social psychological researchers to use their knowledge to promote behaviours that help manage the crisis. Here, we identify human values as particularly important in driving both behavioural compliance to government guidelines and promoting prosocial behaviours to alleviate the strains arising from a prolonged pandemic. Existing evidence demonstrates the importance of human values, and the extent to which they are shared by fellow citizens, for tackling the COVID-19 crisis. Individuals who attach higher importance to self-transcendence (e.g., responsibility) and conservation (e.g., security) values are likely to be more compliant with COVID-19 behavioural guidelines and to help others who are struggling with the crisis. Further, believing that fellow citizens share one's values has been found to elicit a sense of connectedness that may be crucial in promoting collective efforts to contain the pandemic. The abstract nature of values, and cross-cultural agreement on their importance, suggests that they are ideally suited to developing and tailoring effective, global interventions to combat this pandemic.","output":"The importance of (shared) human values for containing the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How important is the speed and intensity of behavioral change due to government policies, such as enhanced social distancing or lockdown, when an emerging infectious disease occurs? In this study, we introduce a deterministic SEIR model considering the behavior-changed susceptible group to investigate the effect of the speed and intensity of behavioral change on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We used epidemiological data from South Korea and Italy for the simulation study, because South Korea and Italy were the first countries to report an outbreak of COVID-19 after China and the prevention and response policy of each government were similar during the first outbreak of COVID-19. Simulation results showed that it took approximately twenty fewer days in Korea than in Italy until 90% of susceptible individuals changed their behavior during the first outbreak. It was observed that the behavior-changed susceptible individuals reduced the COVID-19 transmission rate by up to 93% in Korea and 77% in Italy. Furthermore, if the intensity and speed of behavioral change in Italy were the same as in Korea, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would have been reduced by approximately 95%, from 210,700 to 10,700, until the end of the lockdown period. We assumed that behavioral change is influenced by the number of confirmed cases and does not take into account social and cultural differences, as well as the state of the healthcare system, between the two countries.

We examine and provide novel insights on the key drivers and barriers towards COVID-19 vaccine uptake. DESIGN: This study involved an anonymous cross-sectional online survey circulated across the UK in September 2020. The survey was designed to include several sections to collect demographic data and responses on (1) extent of agreement regarding various statements about COVID-19 and vaccinations, (2) previous vaccination habits (eg, if they had previously declined vaccination) and (3) interest in participation in vaccine trials. Multinominal logistic models examined demographic factors that may impact vaccine uptake. We used principle component analysis and text mining to explore perception related to vaccine uptake. SETTING: The survey was circulated through various media, including posts on social media networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram), national radio, news articles, Clinical Research Network website and newsletter, and through 150 West Midlands general practices via a text messaging service. PARTICIPANTS: There were a total of 4884 respondents of which 9.44% were black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) group. The majority were women (n=3416, 69.9%) and of white ethnicity (n=4127, 84.5%). RESULTS: Regarding respondents, overall, 3873 (79.3%) were interested in taking approved COVID-19 vaccines, while 677 (13.9%) were unsure, and 334 (6.8%) would not take a vaccine. Participants aged over 70 years old (OR=4.63) and the BAME community (OR=5.48) were more likely to take an approved vaccine. Smokers (OR=0.45) and respondents with no known illness (OR=0.70) were less likely to accept approved vaccines. The study identified 16 key reasons for not accepting approved vaccines, the most common (60%) being the possibility of the COVID-19 vaccine having side effects.

There is a critical global need for therapeutic intervention strategies that can be deployed to safely treat COVID-19 disease and reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Increasing evidence shows that both natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also referred to as Host Defense Proteins/Peptides (HDPs), can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, paving the way for the potential clinical use of these molecules as therapeutic options. In this manuscript, we describe the potent antiviral activity exerted by brilacidina de novo designed synthetic small molecule that captures the biological properties of HDPson SARS-CoV-2 in a human lung cell line (Calu-3) and a monkey cell line (Vero). These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in these cell culture models is likely to be a result of the impact of brilacidin on viral entry and its disruption of viral integrity. Brilacidin demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity when combined with remdesivir.

It is applied widly for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, diarrhea, acute hepatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease and ulcerative colitis in clinic. Two species, namely Patrinia scabiosaefolia Fisch. (PS) and Patrinia villosa Juss. (PV) from the Caprifoliaceae family, are considered as Herba Patriniae in the pharmaceutical industry. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This paper aims to comprehensively outline the traditional uses, botanical description, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, quality control, pharmacokinetics and patents of Herba Patriniae, and elaborate the same/different characteristics between PS and PV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Detailed information of Herba Patriniae was collected from various online databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, Google Schola, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, National Intellectual Property Administration, PRC National Medical Products Administration), and those published resources (M.Sc. Thesis and books). RESULTS: A total of 233 compounds have been identified in Herba Patriniae, including triterpenoid saponins, flavonoids, organic acids, iridoids, and volatiles. A very distinct difference was observed, that PS is rich in triterpenoid saponins and volatiles, while PV contains more flavonoids. Two source species of Herba Patriniae gave similar pharmacological effects on anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, sedative and hypnotic effects. But there were no reports were on antipruritic, proangiogenic and anti-diarrheal effects for PS, and no studies on anti-diabetic effects for PV. Generally, Herba Patriniae showed non-toxic in the clinical dose, but mild side effects, such as temporary leukopenia, dizziness and nausea, could be found when large and excessive dosage is used. A variety of compounds have been quantified for the quality control of PS and PV. The variety, growth environment, growth time, and harvest time not only affected the contents but also the pharmacological activities of the bioactive compounds. In the past year, patents for compositions containing PV and PS have been filed, mainly involving human health, hygiene, agriculture, and animal husbandry. Unfortunately, the research on pharmacokinetics is insufficient. Only the prototype components and metabolites were repored after intragastric administration of total flavonoids extract from PV in rats. CONCLUSION: Herba Patriniae has displayed a significant medicinal value in clinic, but the differences in phytochemistry, pharmacological effects and the content of compounds have been found between two official recorded species. About side effects and pharmacokinetic characteristics, the differeces between two species have not been well studied. For a better clinical use of Herba Patriniae, it is urgent to establish systematic pharmacology, quality control, pharmacokinetics, and clinical researches on the same/different characteristics between PS and PV.","output":"The Herba Patriniae (Caprifoliaceae): A Review on Traditional uses, Phytochemistry, Pharmacology and Quality Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced rapid system-wide changes to be implemented within cancer care at an alarming pace. Clinical trials are a key element of comprehensive cancer care. Ensuring the continuing safe conduct of cancer clinical trials in the context of a pandemic is challenging. METHODS: We aimed to describe the COVID-19 pandemic response of a Cancer Care Clinical Research Unit (CRU) of a tertiary hospital in Queensland, Australia. We used a mixed methods approach for this case study. Emailed directives from CRU managers to all CRU staff sharing were qualitatively analysed and mapped against our unit activities over longitudinal time points. Data from patient recruitment and protocol deviations were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Mapping activity from 11 March to 30 September 2020 revealed rapid change during the first 2 weeks. Four key strategies to accommodate change were identified: supporting patients and families, introduction of telehealth, accessing investigational product, and social distancing. Early in the pandemic we recognised that our core key stakeholders were integral to our response. When compared to the previous 12 months, our recruitment numbers dropped markedly in early phases of the response but recovered over time, as we accommodated internal and external impacts.

Methods We analysed the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of 19 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, performed at peak disease severity as part of their clinical management. Disease severity, respiratory failure, immune and metabolic dysfunction, sedation status, and neurological examination on the day of the EEG were noted. Results Severe encephalopathy was confirmed in 13 patients, all with severe COVID-19; 10 remained comatose off sedation, and five of them had alpha coma (AC). Disease severity, sedation, immune and metabolic dysfunction were not different between those with AC and those without. Conclusions Severe COVID-19 encephalopathy is a principal cause of persisting coma after sedation withdrawal. The relatively high incidence of the rare AC pattern may reflect direct SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism with a predilection for the brainstem ascending reticular system.

METHODS: To calculate the preventability, we surveyed in a first step the number and kind of needlestick injuries and in a second step the reasons for the injuries and the working conditions of the healthcare workers. Both data sets were collected in independent anonymous questionnaire covering occupational blood exposure among healthcare workers in a German university hospital. RESULTS: Needlestick injuries were caused through unsafe procedures, difficult working conditions and unsafe devices. On average, 50.3% (n = 492/978) of all needlestick injuries could have been avoided by the use of safety devices, whereas only 15.2% could have been prevented by organizational measures. In our study, 31.5% (n = 503/1598) of participant healthcare workers had sustained at least one needlestick injury in the past twelve months. The rate of underreporting was about 75%. After introduction of safety devices, 91.8% of the healthcare workers reported being satisfied with the anti-needlestick devices and 83.4% believed that safety devices would increase the safety of the work environment. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to blood is a common problem among healthcare workers. The introduction of safety devises is one of the main starting points for avoidance of needlestick injuries, and acceptance among healthcare workers is high.

To understand the role of aerosols in disease transmission, we adopted a prospective cross-sectional study design and investigated the count and size distribution of aerosols generated by a non-contact tonometer and its correlation with individual tear film characteristics. METHODS: This study constituted two parts. The study population included outpatients who underwent an intraocular pressure examination in an intraocular pressure examination room (Part I) and 20 participants who underwent an intraocular pressure examination in a laboratory (Part II). The following main outcomes were measured: aerosol counts at 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm from the non-contact tonometer (Part I); aerosol counts after each participant underwent non-contact tonometry, and lipid layer thickness score and tear film break-up time (Part II). RESULTS: The aerosol count decreased with increasing distance from the tonometer. The aerosol count at 0 cm had the highest value compared to that at other distances. For aerosols of diameters 0.25C0.5 m and 0.5C1.0 m, the count decreased at 50 cm and remained stable at further distances. For aerosols of diameters 1.0C2.5 m and  2.5 m, the count dropped progressively at all five distances. The aerosol count from each tonometer correlated positively with the lipid layer thickness score (r = 0.490, P = 0.028), whereas the aerosol count correlated negatively with the tear film break-up time (r = ? 0.675, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Aerosols tended to coagulate during diffusion. A 50-cm distance from the tonometer could confer safety from aerosols with < 1.0-m diameter. Aerosols generated during non-contact tonometry could contain a lipid layer component. Moreover, tear film stability could affect aerosol generation. Protective eyewear is recommended for reducing infection risk from aerosols. Individual tear film characteristics should be considered during non-contact tonometry.","output":"Quantitative Evaluation of Aerosol Generation from Non-contact Tonometry and its Correlation with Tear Film Characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current myasthenia gravis guidelines recommend intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis and discontinuation of pyridostigmine during myasthenic crisis.

Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases and references were searched for observational studies that determined the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in myasthenic crisis. The eligibility criteria were as follows: population, patients with myasthenic crisis, intervention (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor administration), and outcome (clinical improvement and complications). In total, 106 studies were identified, 92 through database searching (after removing duplicates) and 14 through other sources. Only eight were analyzed in the present systematic review. In five, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor was given at the start of the crisis, whereas in the other three, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor was discontinued initially and then restarted prior to extubation. Two observational analytic studies and three case reports showed improvement in different outcome measures. In the other three, improvement of outcome measures was also observed. Overall, a small proportion of patients developed cardiac arrhythmia and pneumonia after administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor alone, although this was not statistically different compared with those subjected to plasmapheresis. In summary, continuous intravenous infusion of pyridostigmine or neostigmine can be a substitute for intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis if these are not available during crisis; however, caution should be observed because of the aforementioned possible complications.","output":"Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors in Myasthenic Crisis: A Systematic Review of Observational Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has increased risk factors for gender\\\\based violence, according to the American Psychological Association.

It draws on material collected during an ongoing action research study aimed at addressing the everyday transport and mobility challenges faced by young women living in poor peripheral communities of three African cities C Abuja, Cape Town and Tunis. The project has the specific objective of supporting young women's improved access to employment opportunities through trialling various mobility/transport-related skills interventions (based on prior in-depth analysis of mobility constraints). With the onset of COVID-19 some readjustments to the research focus and planned interventions became necessary. The research teams, together with an NGO partner, are now working to chart how young women's everyday experiences of mobility and transport - both as transport users and as transport sector workers - are changing as processes of lockdown and their relaxation evolve. The paper covers the period from early 2019 through to March 2021, and offers reflections regarding lived experiences of mobility practice pre-pandemic, during the pandemic, and the potential longer-term mobility-related impacts for women resident in low-income neighbourhoods in a post-COVID-19 era.

Reduced staffing in rheumatology due to redeployment to COVID-19 work, limited out patient capacity and patient vulnerability have had a major impact on our ability to review our patients to assess their condition and treatment (by face-to-face, video or telephone consultations). Novel strategies are essential to safely and effectively treat patients with rheumatic disease whilst minimising their risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection. Objectives: The objective was to develop a digital solution to help deliver safe, efficient and effective care for patients with rheumatic diseases. The aim was to produce a system that allowed us to integrate data recorded directly by patients with information held in our electronic health records to provide a virtual review of care. Methods: An online questionnaire was used to collect clinical information, including validated disease activity measures, to conduct a remote assessment in 175 patients awaiting follow-up appointments. This assessment was integrated within our electronic health records (EHR). The questionnaire contained measures of disease activity (DAS28 or BASDAI);patient reported outcomes;patient preferences regarding the urgency and type of appointment;any recent problems or changes in medication. This information was imported into a database for clinician review, together with previous clinical records and results of relevant investigations, to inform clinical decisions and to decide on the safest and most appropriate timing for follow-up. Report letters were sent to the patient and their primary care providers. Results: Of the 175 patients (149 with RA and 26 with AS), 108 patients (89/149 [60%] with RA [mean age=64;female=65%] and 19/26 [73%] with AS [mean age=45;female=54%]) submitted responses over a 6-week period based on which clinical decisions were made. The mean questionnaire completion time was 19 minutes for RA responders and 16 minutes for AS responders. Non responders (67/175 [mean age=61;female=63%]) remained on our list of patients awaiting follow-up arrangements to be made. Sixty-nine responders (64%) had stable disease therefore did not require any changes to their treatment and were offered an appointment within the next 6 months, of whom 12 (11%) requested face-to-face follow-up. Of the remaining 39 -with less stable disease -requiring more rapid follow-up assessment, 22 patients (56%) required a face-to-face consultation to consider treatment change. So far 9 of these patients have had follow-up, of whom 6 necessitated treatment escalation (Methotrexate increase n=2;anti-inflammatory increase n=2;intramuscular steroid n=1;anti-TNF escalation n=1). Thirty-nine patients (36%) provided feedback on the process of completing the questionnaire, 85% of whom used a mobile phone and the remainder used a computer or tablet. The majority (70%) found it extremely easy or 'somewhatextremely difficult 0%. Conclusion: We have created and tested a system of remote clinical management for patients with RA and AS. Amongst the 108 responders, just 31% required a face-to-face appointment, with treatment changes made accordingly. With a backlog of 3,800 awaiting allocation to follow-up appointments, remote clinical management will allow us to safely and efficiently prioritise patients requiring urgent follow-up for treatment optimisation. We will integrate this system into our standard care pathway beyond the COVID-19 pandemic to streamline our service, deliver effective care and provide evidence to support the use of costly biologic drugs.1 We plan to investigate the barriers for non-responders.","output":"Remote clinical management: Incorporating electronic assessment of patients with rheumatic diseases into standard clinical pathways during the COVID-19 pandemic: A pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This commentary considers the impacts of COVID-19 on sport governance and management, given the global threat to sport services and organizations evident as a result of the disease since early 2020 To frame this analysis of the impacts and lessons to be learned, we use a Critical Realist (CR) perspective, which takes a multi-level view of reality and seeks to establish how and why something occurs in reality [Byers, T (2013) Using critical realism: A new perspective on control of volunteers in sport clubs European Sport Management Quarterly, 13(1), 5C31 https://doi org/10 1080/16184742 2012 744765] While the existing commentaries and emerging research on COVID19 have focused on a superficial level of reality (i e what stakeholder responses have been), a CR view encourages a more holistic account of what and why something happens Specifically, this commentary contributes to the discussion of COVID-19 impacts focusing on sport governance, using a philosophy that encourages examination of what is happening in sport organizations, how different stakeholders perspectives and assessment of the legitimacy of COVID-19 may reveal underlying social structures and biases that help explain sport administrators responses and value systems We hope this novel perspective on sport governance encourages readers to think of new ways of organizing and governing that is more inclusive of diversity (e g race, gender, disability) in sport ? 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","output":"COVID-19 impacts on sport governance and management: a global, critical realist perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"GOALS: The present survey from the Italian Society of Digestive Endoscopy (SIED-Societ Italiana di Endoscopia Digestiva) was aimed at reporting infection control practice and outcomes at Digestive Endoscopy Units in a high-incidence area. BACKGROUND: Lombardy was the Italian region with the highest coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) prevalence, at the end of March 2020 accounting for 20% of all worldwide deaths. Joint Gastro-Intestinal societies released recommendations for Endoscopy Units to reduce the risk of the contagion. However, there are few data from high-prevalence areas on adherence to these recommendations and on their efficacy. METHODS: A survey was designed by the Lombardy section of SIED to analyze (a) changes in activity and organization, (b) adherence to recommendations, (c) rate of health care professionals' (HCP) infection during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: In total, 35/61 invited centers (57.4%) participated; most modified activities were according to recommendations and had filtering face piece 2/filtering face piece 3 and water-repellent gowns available, but few had negative-pressure rooms or provided telephonic follow-up; 15% of HCPs called in sick and 6% had confirmed COVID-19. There was a trend (P=0.07) toward different confirmed COVID-19 rates among endoscopists (7.9%), nurses (6.6%), intermediate-care technicians (3.4%), and administrative personnel (2.2%). There was no correlation between the rate of sick HCPs and COVID-19 incidence in the provinces and personal protective equipment availability and use, whereas an inverse correlation with hospital volume was found. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to recommendations was rather good, though a minority were able to follow all recommendations.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A non-systematic review of the literature is carried out in order to select validated oropharyngeal dysphagia assessment tools with the highest degree of recommendation. These tools are analyzed by a group of experts in oropharyngeal dysphagia from the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona to design a holistic exploration model. RESULTS: This evaluation model includes an assessment at the beginning and at the end of the treatment, as well as continuous monitoring during the rehabilitation process. It is implemented in a semi-presential and multidisciplinary way, and its purpose is to understand oropharyngeal dysphagia holistically to design and monitor an individualized therapeutic plan.

Infectious cDNA clones of these viruses are necessary molecular tools to understand viral biology and to create effective vaccines. The traditional approach to rescuing virus from an infectious cDNA clone requires propagating large amounts of plasmids in bacteria, which can result in unwanted mutations in the viral genome due to bacterial toxicity or recombination and requires specialized equipment and knowledge to propagate the bacteria. Here, we present an alternative to the bacterial-based plasmid platform that uses rolling circle amplification (RCA), an in vitro technology that amplifies plasmid DNA using only basic equipment. We demonstrate that the use of RCA to amplify plasmid DNA is comparable to the use of a midiprepped plasmid in terms of viral yield, albeit with a slight delay in virus recovery kinetics. RCA, however, has lower cost and time requirements and amplifies DNA with high fidelity and with no chance of unwanted mutations due to toxicity. We show that sequential RCA reactions do not introduce mutations into the viral genome and, thus, can replace the need for glycerol stocks or bacteria entirely. These results indicate that RCA is a viable alternative to traditional plasmid-based approaches to viral rescue. Importance The development of infectious cDNA clones is critical to studying viral pathogenesis and for developing vaccines. The current method for propagating clones in bacteria is limited by the toxicity of the viral genome within the bacterial host, resulting in deleterious mutations in the viral genome, which can only be detected through whole-genome sequencing. These mutations can attenuate the virus, leading to lost time and resources and potentially confounding results. We have developed an alternative method of preparing large quantities of DNA that can be directly transfected to recover infectious virus without the need for bacteria by amplifying the infectious cDNA clone plasmid using rolling circle amplification (RCA). Our results indicate that viral rescue from an RCA product produces a viral yield equal to bacterial-derived plasmid DNA, albeit with a slight delay in replication kinetics. The RCA platform, however, is significantly more cost and time-efficient compared to traditional approaches. When the simplicity and costs of RCA are combined, we propose that a shift to an RCA platform will benefit the field of molecular virology and could have significant advantages for recombinant vaccine production.","output":"Rolling Circle Amplification is a high fidelity and efficient alternative to plasmid preparation for the rescue of infectious clones"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new health threat in the form of a new variant of Covid-19 called Omicron has emerged globally in this holiday season.

The application of drones for delivery services results in faster delivery, fuel-saving, and less energy consumption.

So far, a lot of work has been done for improving the design, speed, operating range, security of the delivery drones, etc. However, very limited work has been done to ensure a complete and reliable last-mile delivery from the merchants store to the hands of the actual customer. To ensure a complete and reliable last-mile delivery, a drone must authenticate the consumer before dropping the package. Therefore, in this work, we propose a consumer authentication (Consumer-Auth) hybrid computing framework for drone delivery as a service to make sure that the parcel is perfectly delivered to the intended customer. The proposed Consumer-Auth framework enables a drone to reach the exact destination by using the GPS coordinates of the customer autonomously. After reaching the exact location, the drone waits for the customer to come to the specific pinned location then it starts a two-factor consumer authentication process, i.e., one-time password (OTP) verification and face Recognition.

This paper examines patient characteristics and initial outcomes of patients served during a rapid protocol shift to telehealth that allowed buprenorphine initiation without an in-person encounter following a state-mandated stay-at-home order. Patient characteristics were compared to a subsample of patients enrolled in the program before the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In March 2020, there was a sharp increase in new enrollments to the PC program. A total of 143 patients completed an intake assessment between March and May 2020 and 140 began treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone. Those who completed an intake assessment were primarily male (68.5%), Black (83.2%), had a mean age of 43.2 years (SD = 11.7), and reported a mean of 17.0 years of opioid use (SD = 12.9).

In innate immune response, the host recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) in nucleic acids or viral proteins through pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), especially toll-like receptors (TLRs) and induces immune cells or infected cells to produce type I Interferons (IFN-I) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus when the virus invades the host, innate immunity is the earliest immune mechanism. Besides, cytokine-mediated cell communication is necessary for the proper regulation of immune responses. Therefore, the appropriate activation of innate immunity is necessary for the normal life activities of cells. The suppressor of the cytokine signaling proteins (SOCS) family is one of the main regulators of the innate immune response induced by microbial pathogens. They mainly participate in the negative feedback regulation of cytokine signal transduction through Janus kinase signal transducer and transcriptional activator (JAK/STAT) and other signal pathways. Taken together, this paper reviews the SOCS proteins structures and the function of each domain, as well as the latest knowledge of the role of SOCS proteins in innate immune caused by viral infections and the mechanisms by which SOCS proteins assist viruses to escape host innate immunity. Finally, we discuss potential values of these proteins in future targeted therapies.","output":"SOCS Proteins Participate in the Regulation of Innate Immune Response Caused by Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In times of pandemic and social distancing, the risks tied to leaving home to make purchases can cause consumers to seek online means to perform such activities.

Prior research has mainly focused on a subset of emotion regulation strategies, typically manipulated in lab settings, and has largely been based on the study of individuals from a very limited range of cultural contexts. In the present study, we examined the contribution of the use and variability of six key emotion regulation strategies to wellbeing within one large-scale study in the context of a shared stressor: the COVID-19 pandemic. We tested the cross-cultural consistency of our findings in a large sample (N = 23,865) with participants from 51 countries, using a wide variety of cultural orientations. In line with our pre-registered hypotheses, we found that acceptance and reappraisal were predictive of higher wellbeing, while rumination and suppression were predictive of lower wellbeing. Social sharing and distraction yielded more mixed findings. Notably, acceptance and rumination were the strongest predictors of wellbeing, thus emerging as the promise and peril of emotion regulation. Except for suppression, these effects were replicated in two separate representative samples (N = 2000). Moreover, we found a small but inconsistent positive association between emotion regulation variability and wellbeing, pointing to the importance of flexibly attuning regulatory strategies to situational demands. Finally, cultural orientations did not moderate these relationships, demonstrating a great degree of cross-cultural consistency in both the use of emotion regulation strategies, and their associations with wellbeing. These findings demonstrate that, across cultures, several emotion regulation strategies, particularly acceptance and rumination, shape wellbeing.","output":"Emotion Regulation and Wellbeing: A Cross-Cultural Study During the COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern. In China, Wuhan, Hubei Province was the epicenter. The disease is more severe in patients with high comorbidities and dialysis patients fall into this category. METHODS: In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Wuhan NO.1 Hospital by 28 February 2020. We compared the differences on the epidemiological characteristics and clinical features between patients surviving from COVID-19 and patients who died. RESULT: In this hospital, at time of the present report, 627 patients were on chronic hemodialysis and the prevalence of affected cases was 11.8% (74/627).The median age of the COVID-19-positive patients was 63 years (range 31-88), with an almost even gender distribution (females accounted for 54.4%).The most frequent presenting symptom was cough (41.9%), followed by fatigue (24.2%), fever (17.2%) and dyspnea (14.8%); 22.4% of the cases were and asymptomatic. Fourteen of the 74 patients died (19%), as for presenting symptoms, cough was more frequent in patients who died (P < 0.05). Surviving patients had higher levels of phosphate and albumin, and lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest CT scan was positive in all cases, including in asymptomatic ones, and revealed in about three fourths of the cases bilateral (76.2%) lesions; in each lung lesions were multiple in about half of the cases of the cases (52.3%). After diagnosis, median time to death was 7 days in the 14 patients who died, with a range between 4 and 18 days. CONCLUSION: This preliminary, single Center study identifies hemodialysis patients as a population at high risk of severe, and deadly COVID-19 infection. While classic baseline clinical conditions, including age, kidney disease and gender, are not significantly associated with survival in COVID-19 infected hemodialysis, our study also suggests a significant association between risk of and death, poor nutritional status and less than optimal metabolic balance.","output":"Clinical characteristics of deceased hemodialysis patients affected by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: In this study, we aimed to analyze the demographic characteristics, symptoms, and comorbidities of 504 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. We also sought to describe the relationship between these features and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. Material and Methods: This study is a descriptive study involving 504 COVID-19 patients hospitalized between 16.03.2020 and 07.05.2020 at Istanbul University's Faculty of Medicine Hospital. Information about the patients was obtained from the hospital automation system and evaluated retrospectively. Results: The average age of the 504 patients was 56 +/- 15.14, and 59.1% of them were male. The proportion of the patients admitted into ICU 11.9% and for 8.52% of them the disease resulted in death. Real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results were positive for 60.5% of the patients. The median time spent in the hospital was eight days. Fifty six percent of the patients had at least one accompanying comorbid disease, with hypertension (39.3%) and diabetes (20.8%) being the most common. Being 65 years old or older (p<0.001), days spent in the hospital (p<0.001), presence of at least one comorbidity (p=0.009), hypertension (p=0.003), coronary artery disease (p=0.004), congestive heart failure (p=0.005) and dyspnea (p<0.001) were all factors found in those admitted to ICU.

In Poland, obligatory wearing of masks in public spaces was introduced on April 10th, 2020;a relaxation of previous universal measures was announced on May 29th, 2020, limiting use to indoor public places. Objective: to assess use of masks or other protective devices in public spaces in Poland during the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic. Methods: A non-participatory covert observational study was conducted on three dates, (10.05/18.05/ 25.05.2020) at public spaces in 13 regions with different risks. Ten consecutive individuals were observed by each of 82 medical students (n=2460 observations), using a structured checklist. Results: Among 2353 observed persons, the female/male ratios were 1.0, 1.1, and 1.0 on the three dates. Almost three quarters - 73.6% (n=552/750) were using masks on date 1, 66.5% (544/818) on date 2;and 65.7% (516/785) on date 3. Cloth masks predominated on all dates (64.7%-62.3%-62.6%), followed by medical (23.4%-28.5%-26.9%). Being female (OR=1.77-1.47-1.53 respectively) and location in a closed space (OR=2.60-2.59-2.32) were each associated with higher usage. Participants in sports were about two times less likely to use masks (OR=0.64-0.53-0.53) as compared to other activities. The proportion using masks correctly decreased gradually over time (364/552;65.9%;339/544;62.3% and 304/516;58.9%). More females wore masks correctly (date 1: 205/294;69.7% vs 159/258;61.6%, and date 3: 186/284;65.5% vs 118/232;50.9%;p=0.045;p=0.0008 respectively). Uncovered noses (47.3%-52.7%) and masks around the neck (39.2%-42.6%) were the most frequent incorrect practices.

Pandemic-induced disruptions to conventional food production, distribution, and consumption networks have revealed problems with the global food system and have drawn attention to the re-localization and regionalization of food systems. Lockdown and mobility restrictions have also disrupted the availability, quality, and stability of food. We evaluate how AFNs have responded to these challenges in a non-western context through a case-study approach informed by participant observation and semistructured interviews. After examining the multiple factors that have been critical to the emergence and expansion of AFNs in Turkey since the mid-2000s, we argue that these food distribution networks have aimed to address food security, environmental sustainability, and farmer livelihoods in complementary ways. We provide a timeline of state-led measures in response to COVID-19 in Turkey as we consider their impacts on food distribution systems and access in urban areas. We then compare two AFNs: a food community working within a participatory guarantee system, and a consumer cooperative that connects producers and consumers in urban areas. Although the two AFNs faced initial challenges due to disruptions in delivery services and lockdowns, they have been able to continue their services and address increasing demand. They also provided special solidarity packages for those adversely affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19. By building on the existing networks and relationships of trust between consumers and producers, and the capacity and willingness of producers to adapt to the new regulatory environment, the two AFNs have been able to continue their activities and start new initiatives.","output":"Alternative food distribution networks, resilience, and urban food security in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe varus deformity in osteoarthritic knees is attributed not only to bony deformity but also to intra-articular deformity as a result of medial joint space narrowing with lateral joint space widening (increased joint line convergence angle).

Tibial condylar valgus osteotomy (TCVO), an L-shaped osteotomy in the medial tibial condyle, has been proposed to improve articular stability and congruity by elevating the medial tibial joint line and addressing the articular component of the deformity; however, its surgical efficacy for correction of the valgus deformity is limited. Therefore a procedure combining HTO and TCVO can be a reasonable option to achieve restoration of the knee joint physiology in such situations.

How do societies know when an epidemic is over and normal life can resume? What criteria and markers indicate such an end? Who has the insight, authority, and credibility to decipher these signs? Detailed research on past epidemics has demonstrated that they do not end suddenly; indeed, only rarely do the diseases in question actually end. This article examines the ways in which scholars have identified and described the end stages of previous epidemics, pointing out that significantly less attention has been paid to these periods than to origins and climaxes. Analysis of the ends of epidemics illustrates that epidemics are as much social, political, and economic events as they are biological; the end, therefore, is as much a process of social and political negotiation as it is biomedical. Equally important, epidemics end at different times for different groups, both within one society and across regions. Multidisciplinary research into how epidemics end reveals how the end of an epidemic shifts according to perspective, whether temporal, geographic, or methodological. A multidisciplinary analysis of how epidemics end suggests that epidemics should therefore be framed not as linear narrativesfrom outbreak to intervention to terminationbut within cycles of disease and with a multiplicity of endings.","output":"How epidemics end"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Metabolic acidosis is associated with high mortality.

Research design and methods: YAs (18-34yrs) were invited to complete an anonymous online survey in June 2021 assessing agreement with 30 belief statements informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework of behaviour change (TDF) describing potential barriers/enablers to DRS. Results: In total 102 responses were received. Most had T1D (65.7%) and were regular attenders for DRS (76.5%). The most salient TDF domains for DRS attendance were [Goals], with 93% agreeing that DRS was a high priority and [Knowledge], with 98% being aware that screening can detect eye problems early. Overall 67.4% indicated that they would like greater appointment flexibility [Environmental context/resources] and 31.3% reported difficulties getting time off work/study to attend appointments [Environmental Context/Resources]. This was more commonly reported by occasional non-attenders versus regular attenders (59.1% vs 23.4%, P=0.002) Most YAs were worried about diabetic retinopathy (74.3%), anxious when receiving screening results (63%) [Emotion] and would like more support after getting their results (66%) [Social influences].

Even after two-years, respiratory sequalae related to post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been fully explored and understood. The main treatment for most COVID-19 respiratory complications is still symptomatic and supportive-care oriented.

Significant success has been achieved in a wide range of fields, such as genomics, protein folding, disease diagnosis, imaging, and clinical tasks. Although widely used, the inherent opacity of deep AI models has brought criticism from the research field and little adoption in clinical practice. Concurrently, there has been a significant amount of research focused on making such methods more interpretable, reviewed here, but inherent critiques of such explainability in AI (XAI), its requirements, and concerns with fairness/robustness have hampered their real-world adoption. We here discuss how user-driven XAI can be made more useful for different healthcare stakeholders through the definition of three key personasdata scientists, clinical researchers, and cliniciansand present an overview of how different XAI approaches can address their needs. For illustration, we also walk through several research and clinical examples that take advantage of XAI open-source tools, including those that help enhance the explanation of the results through visualization. This perspective thus aims to provide a guidance tool for developing explainability solutions for healthcare by empowering both subject matter experts, providing them with a survey of available tools, and explainability developers, by providing examples of how such methods can influence in practice adoption of solutions.","output":"Human-centered explainability for life sciences, healthcare, and medical informatics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus-caused pneumonia (COVID-19) broke out in December 2019.

We aimed to perform a constant, detailed assessment of cortical development in IMVM fetuses using ultrasound and determine whether asymmetric cortical development occurred. Moreover, we aimed to estimate the prognosis of IMVM fetuses and compare the difference in the prognosis of IMVM fetuses presenting symmetric and asymmetric cortical maturation. METHODS: IMVM was diagnosed by regular ultrasound, neurosonography and fetal MRI. Genetic and TORCH examinations were conducted to exclude common genetic abnormalities and TORCH infection of fetuses. Ultrasound examinations were conducted at an interval of 2C3 weeks to record sulcus development in IMVM fetuses using a scoring system. The neonatal behavioral neurological assessment (NBNA), the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition (ASQ-3) and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, First Edition (BSID-I) were performed after birth. RESULTS: Forty fetuses with IMVM were included: twenty showed asymmetric cortical maturation and twenty showed symmetric cortical maturation. For IMVM fetuses presenting asymmetric cortical maturation, the mean gestational age (GA) at the first diagnosis of relatively delayed development was 24.23 weeks for the parieto-occipital sulcus, 24.71 weeks for the calcarine sulcus, and 26.43 weeks for the cingulate sulcus. All the sulci with delayed development underwent catch-up growth and developed to the same grade as the sulci of the other hemisphere. The mean GA at which the two sides developed to the same grade was 29.40 weeks for the parieto-occipital sulcus, 29.30 weeks for the calcarine sulcus and 31.27 weeks for the cingulate sulcus. The NBNA, ASQ-3 and BSID-I scores of all patients were in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: IMVM fetuses may show mild asymmetric cortical maturation in the second trimester, but the relatively delayed sulci undergo catch-up growth. The neurodevelopment of IMVM fetuses presenting asymmetric cortical maturation and catch-up growth is not statistically significantly different from IMVM fetuses presenting symmetric cortical maturation.","output":"Asymmetric cortical development and prognosis in fetuses with isolated mild fetal ventriculomegaly: an observational prospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: physical activity has been used for a number of years in the treatment of fibromyalgia (FM).

However, these raise the risk of infection, and the drugs may not be effectively metabolized in patients with liver disease. A 61-year old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus and antibody-mediated IR who required >800 units of daily insulin presented with acute decompensation of his preexisting cirrhosis from recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis. Laboratory tests confirmed an IA level of >625 U/mL (reference: <5.0 U/mL). METHODS: Centrifugal plasmapheresis and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were used to treat the patient to achieve glycemic control. Continuous glucose monitoring was implemented to monitor glycemic control pre- and posttherapy. Laboratory evaluation included levels of IA, C-peptide, insulin-like growth factor-1, growth hormone, salivary cortisol, zinc transporter 8, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65-kilodalton isoform antibody, and islet-cell antibodies. RESULTS: We initiated MMF followed by 5 sessions of plasmapheresis, leading to an overall 77.3% reduction from pretherapy insulin requirements after 6 months without further episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis or infection. The cirrhosis stabilized, and there was an improvement in HbA1C from 8.7% (72 mmol/mol) to 6.6% (49 mmol/mol) and time in euglycemic range from 30% to 61%.

PATIENTS A total of 115 patients hospitalized in the PICU were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Children with underlying comorbidities and those who did not require mechanical ventilation were excluded. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST Demographic, clinical, laboratory test and radiographic data were recorded. RESULTS A total of 63 patients were eligible for the study. The most common diagnosis was bronchiolitis (57.1%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent causal virus (36.5%). The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (28.6%). Multiple viral infection was identified in 20.6% of the patients, the most common in this subgroup being rhinovirus. Patients with bocavirus infection had a higher likelihood of needing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at presentation.

Subsequently, the mink-associated virus (miSARS-CoV-2) spilled back over into humans. Genetic sequences of the miSARS-CoV-2 identified a new genetic variant known as Cluster 5 that contained mutations in the spike protein. However, the functional properties of these Cluster 5 mutations have not been well established. In this study, we found that the Y453F mutation located in the RBD domain of miSARS-CoV-2 is an adaptive mutation that enhances binding to mink ACE2 and other orthologs of Mustela species without compromising, and even enhancing, its ability to utilize human ACE2 as a receptor for entry. Structural analysis suggested that despite the similarity in the overall binding mode of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human and mink ACE2, Y34 of mink ACE2 was better suited to interact with a Phe rather than a Tyr at position 453 of the viral RBD due to less steric clash and tighter hydrophobic-driven interaction. Additionally, the Y453F spike exhibited resistance to convalescent serum, posing a risk for vaccine development. Thus, our study suggests that since the initial transmission from humans, SARS-CoV-2 evolved to adapt to the mink host, leading to widespread circulation among minks while still retaining its ability to efficiently utilize human ACE2 for entry, thus allowing for transmission of the miSARS-CoV-2 back into humans. These findings underscore the importance of active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in Mustela species and other susceptible hosts in order to prevent future outbreaks.","output":"Mutation Y453F in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 enhances interaction with the mink ACE2 receptor for host adaption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Has been described the loss of smell and taste as onset symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence in Spain Methods: Prospective study of COVID-19 confirmed patients through RT-PCR in Spain Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires Results: A total of 1043 patients with mild COVID-19 disease The mean age was 39+/-12 years 826 patients (79 2%) described smell disorder, 662 (63 4%) as a total loss and 164 (15 7%) partial 718 patients (68 8%) noticed some grade of taste dysfunction There was a significant association between both disorders (p&lt;0 001) The olfactory dysfunction was the first symptom in 17 1% The sQOD-NS scores were significantly lower in patients with a total loss compare to normosmic or hyposmic individuals (p=0 001) Female were significantly more affected by olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions (p&lt;0 001) The early olfactory recover in 462 clinically cured patients was 315 (68 2%), during the first 4 weeks Conclusion: The sudden onset smell and/or taste dysfunction should be considered highly suspicious for COVID-19 infection","output":"Subjective evaluation of smell and taste dysfunction in patients with mild COVID-19 in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"3D facial surface imaging is a useful tool in dentistry and in terms of diagnostics and treatment planning.

These spurious differences in component scores via mPCA decreased significantly as the sample sizes per group were increased. Eigenvalues via mPCA were also found to be strongly affected by imbalances in sample sizes per group, although this problem was removed by using weighted forms of covariance matrices suggested by the maximum likelihood solution of the two-level model. However, this did not solve problems of spurious differences between groups in these simulations, which was driven by very small sample sizes in one group. As a \\"rule of thumb\\" only, all of our experiments indicate that reasonable results are obtained when sample sizes per group in all groups are at least equal to the number of variables.

Cough is a complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, asthma, and other diseases. Patients with various diseases have a different profile of tussive responses to diverse cough triggers, thereby suggesting sundry mechanisms of neuronal dysfunctions. Previously, we demonstrated that the small molecule drug XC8 shows a clinical anti-asthmatic effect. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of XC8 on cough. METHODS: We studied the antitussive effect of XC8 on cough induced by agonists activating human transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels TRPA1 or TRPV1 in guinea pigs. We checked the agonistic/antagonistic activity of XC8 on the human cation channels TRPA1, TRPV1, TRPM8, P2X purinoceptor 2 (P2X2), and human acid sensing ion channel 3 (hASIC3) in Fluorescent Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) assay. RESULTS: XC8 demonstrated clear antitussive activity and dose-dependently inhibited cough in guinea pigs induced by citric acid alone (up to 67.1%) or in combination with IFN- (up to 76.4%). XC8 suppressed cough reflexes induced by the repeated inhalation of citric acid (up to 80%) or by cinnamaldehyde (up to 60%). No activity of XC8 against cough evoked by capsaicin was revealed. No direct agonistic/antagonistic activity of XC8 on human TRPA1, TRPV1, TRPM8, P2X2, or hASIC3 was detected. CONCLUSIONS: XC8 acts against cough evoked by the activation of TRPA1 (citric acid/cinnamaldehyde) but not TRPV1 (capsaicin) channels. XC8 inhibits the cough reflex and suppresses the cough potentiation by IFN-.

Oxidative stress, a condition resulting from inadequate antioxidant defense against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, is a major underlying component of mastitis pathophysiology. Isoprostanes (IsoP) are molecules derived from cellular lipid membranes upon non-enzymatic interaction with reactive species during inflammation, and are regarded as highly sensitive and specific biomarkers of oxidative stress. Changes in IsoP concentrations have been noted during major physiological transitions and diseases such as coliform mastitis in dairy cattle. However, the biological role of IsoP during oxidative stress in dairy cows has not been well-elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the impacts of IsoP on oxidative stress outcomes in a bovine model of acute endothelial inflammation. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC; n = 4) were stimulated with 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without 15-F2t-IsoP to determine how IsoP influence oxidative stress outcomes. Our endothelial inflammation model showed relatively decreased reactive metabolites and increased barrier integrity in cells treated with both the agonist and IsoP compared to agonist treatment alone. However, IsoP do not appear to affect oxidative stress outcomes during acute inflammation. Understanding the effect of IsoP on BAEC is an early step in elucidating how IsoP impact dairy cows during times of oxidative stress in the context of acute clinical mastitis. Future studies should define the optimal dosing and treatment timing of IsoP to maximize their cytoprotective potential during acute inflammation.","output":"The Link Between 15-F2t-Isoprostane Activity and Acute Bovine Endothelial Inflammation Remains Elusive"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: There is very limited evidence to support the common practice of preparative fasting prior to contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT).

Recent research indicates elevated prevalence of dysfunctional metacognitions in patients with mental disorders following cardiovascular events. As metacognitive therapy (MCT) is an established treatment to modify metacognitions, we tested if a brief metacognitive intervention via videotelephony is effective in this patient group. METHODS: A brief MCT treatment was tailored to CVD patients and designed as a face-to-face internet-based intervention. Five patients with CVDs and comorbid mental disorders underwent a psychocardiological examination and diagnostic approach. Each patient participated in eight 50 min sessions via encrypted video messenger service. Metacognitions, depression and anxiety symptoms and quality of life were assessed by self-report measures pre- and post-treatment. Patients rated dysfunctional thought processes, current psychological impairment, and treatment satisfaction after each session. Intended follow-up measures were not reported due to missing data. RESULTS: For most patients, the brief metacognitive intervention was associated with a decrease in dysfunctional metacognitions and a reduction of symptoms of anxiety and depression post-treatment.

RESULTS: Compared with urine testing, alternate measures had the following characteristics: 99DOTS patient-reported doses alone (area under the curve [AUC], 0.65; specificity, 70%; 95% CI, 58%C81%), 99DOTS patient- and provider-reported doses (AUC, 0.61; specificity, 33%; 95% CI, 22%C45%), pill estimate (AUC, 0.55; specificity, 21%; 95% CI, 12%C32%), 4-day recall (AUC, 0.60; specificity, 23%; 95% CI, 14%C34%), and last missed dose question (AUC, 0.65; specificity, 52%; 95% CI, 40%C63%). CONCLUSIONS: Alternate measures missed detecting at least 30% of people who were nonadherent by urine testing. The last missed dose question performed similarly to 99DOTS using patient-reported doses alone. Tuberculosis programs should evaluate the feasibility of integrating more accurate, objective measures, such as urine testing, into routine care.","output":"Measuring Tuberculosis Medication Adherence: A Comparison of Multiple Approaches in Relation to Urine Isoniazid Metabolite Testing Within a Cohort Study in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The clinical course of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection is similar to that of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19). However, community-acquired hMPV infections in adults have not yet been sufficiently investigated. We examined the detection status of hMPV antigens and the clinical features of positive patients during the first wave of COVID-19, which coincided with the epidemic season of hMPV infection in Japan. Methods: In this cross-sectional, observational, and single-center study, we recruited consecutive individuals who visited the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives Kochi Hospital due to fever, respiratory symptoms, or close contact with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected persons during the period from January to May 2020. Results: The positive rate of immunochromatography for hMPV antigens from nasopharyngeal swabs was 9.5% (4/42), and four positive cases were community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (5.3% of all CAP). The positive rate of hMPV antigens in the CAP group (30.8%, 4/13) was higher than that in the non-pneumonia group (0.0%, 0/19) (p < 0.05). The average age of the four adult patients with CAP was 69.8 years (range 35C93). Mean white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein blood levels were 6,250 cells/L (3,500C12,180) and 4.30 mg/dL (4.05C7.04), respectively. Chest computed tomography images were diverse and two patients showed dense consolidation. No multi-organ disorder was noted during the clinical course in any of the four cases, and their prognoses were good. Conclusion: hMPV infection may be considered in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 and CAP in Japan under the preventive measures for SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least during the epidemic season of hMPV infection.","output":"Human metapneumovirus-associated community-acquired pneumonia in adults during the first wave of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has adversely impacted the well-being of informal caregivers (CG) due to infection risk, changes to the home environment, and changes to resource availability.

Respondents self-identified as 18+ years and CG to a child or adult with mental health or medical conditions. CG answered questions regarding hours of care provision and caregiving activities, and completed measures of CG burden (Zarit Burden Inventory-4), loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2). Of the 258 respondents within the United States, 86 cared for PLWD (33%; 88% female; 5612 years) while 172 did not (66%; 87% female; 4914 years). Compared to non-dementia CGs, more CGs of PLWD provided 40+ hours of caregiving/week (36% vs. 49%, p<.05), performed more caregiving activities (8.5 vs. 10.5, p<.01), and assisted with more activities of daily living (55% vs. 73%, p<.01).

Confronting the new coronavirus infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging and requires excluding patients with suspected COVID-19 who actually have other diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical features and CT manifestations of COVID-19 by comparing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia who presented at a fever observation department in Shanghai, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results. No statistical difference in clinical features was observed (p > 0.05), with the exception of leukocyte and platelet counts (p < 0.05). The mean ( SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation department was 4.40  2.00 and 5.52  4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive results and patients with negative results, respectively, was as follows: ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus 72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR results, GGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%) (p = 0.05). The median number of affected lung lobes and segments was higher in patients with positive RT-PCR results than in those with negative RT-PCR results (five vs 3.5 affected lobes and 15 vs nine affected segments; p < 0.05). Although the air bronchogram reticular pattern was more frequently seen in patients with positive results, centrilobular nodules were less frequently seen in patients with positive results. CONCLUSION. At the point during the COVID-19 outbreak when this study was performed, imaging patterns of multifocal, peripheral, pure GGO, mixed GGO, or consolidation with slight predominance in the lower lung and findings of more extensive GGO than consolidation on chest CT scans obtained during the first week of illness were considered findings highly suspicious of COVID-19.","output":"Clinical Features and Chest CT Manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Single-Center Study in Shanghai, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has exerted a variety of impacts on people, particularly people with limited education living in poor economic settings. This study investigates the impacts of and adaptations to COVID-19 among the hill tribe people of northern Thailand. METHODS: A qualitative method was used to elicit information from key informants who lived in a hill tribe village in Mae Fah Laung district, Chiang Rai Province, Thailand. Fourteen questions on two issues were used to gather information, and an NVivo program was used to extract the findings. RESULTS: A total of 57 hill tribe villagers participated, including 36 females and 21 males (mean age of 50.1 years, min = 20 and max = 90). Twenty-seven individuals were Thai Yai, 14 were Yunan Chinese, eight were Akha, and eight were members of other minor tribes. Regarding education and occupation, 30 individuals were illiterate, while 27 had attended different levels of primary school; 40 individuals were unemployed, 13 were employed as daily wage workers and farmers, and the other 4 were attending school. Three age categories were used to assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic: impact of access to the educational system among the young, loss of jobs and family financial problems among the working, and access to medical care for the elderly. Six adaptation stages in response to the COVID-19 crisis were observed among the hill tribe people: shock stage with no prior experience, looking for help from health and other agencies, considering the national lockdown policy, complying with prevention and control measures, reducing stressful situations and following the new normal approach, and addressing suffering points at home and elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted different impacts on different age categories among the hill tribe population living in remote and border areas.

In the first instance, the epidemiological model is designed with proportional fractional definition considering the compartmental individuals of susceptible, social distancing, exposed, quarantined, infected, isolated and recovered populations. By virtue of proportional fractional derivative, effective dynamical outcomes of equilibrium states and basic reproduction number are successfully elaborated with memory effect. The expansion of this derivative greatly simplifies the model to integer order while remaining in the fractional context. Subsequently, the memory effects on the asymptotic profiles are demonstrated through various graphical plots and tabulated values. In addition, the inclusion of saturation incident rate further explains the transmissibility of infection for different behavior of susceptible individuals.

Tight-fitting N95 FFRs are respiratory protective devices (RPDs) designed to efficiently filter aerosols. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers (HCWs) throughout the world continue to face shortages of disposable N95 FFRs. Existing version of widely available FDA cleared loose-fitting surgical masks with straps do not provide reliable protection against aerosols. We tested the faceseal of a modified strapless form-fitting sealed version of surgical mask using quantitative fit testing (QNFT) and compared the performance of this mask with that of N95 FFRs and unmodified loose-fitting surgical masks. METHODS: Twenty HCWs participated in the study (10 women; 10 men; age 23C59 years). To create the sealed surgical masks, we removed the straps from loose-fitting surgical masks, made new folds, and used adhesive medical tape to secure the new design. All participants underwent QNFT with a loose-fitting surgical mask, the sealed surgical mask, and an N95 FFR; fit factors were recorded. Each QNFT was performed using a protocol of four exercises: (i) bending over, (ii) talking, (iii) moving head side to side, and (iv) moving head up and down. When the overall fit factor for the sealed surgical mask or N95 FFR was <100, the participant retook the test. Participants scored the breathability and comfort of the sealed surgical mask and N95 FFR on a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (unfavorable) to 10 (favorable). RESULTS: The median fit factor for the sealed surgical mask (53.8) was significantly higher than that of the loose-fitting surgical mask (3.0) but lower than that of the N95 FFR (177.0) (P < 0.001), equating to significantly lower inward leakage of ambient aerosols (measuring 0.04C0.06 m) with the sealed surgical mask (geometric mean 1.79%; geometric standard deviation 1.45%; range 0.97C4.03%) than with the loose-fitting surgical mask (29.5%; 2.01%; 25C100.0%) but still higher than with the N95 FFR (0.66%; 1.46%; 0.50C1.97%) (P < 0.001). Sealed surgical masks led to a marked reduction (range 60C98%) in inward leakage of aerosols in all the participants, compared to loose-fitting surgical masks. Among the exercises, talking had a greater effect on reducing overall fit factor for the sealed surgical mask than for the N95 FFR; when talking was excluded, the fit factor for the sealed surgical mask improved significantly (median 53.8 to 81.5; P < 0.001). The sealed surgical mask, when compared with the N95 FFR, offered better reported breathability (median VAS 9 versus 5; P < 0.001) and comfort (9 versus 5; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Widely available loose-fitting surgical masks can be easily modified to achieve faceseal with adhesives. Unlike loose-fitting surgical masks, sealed surgical masks can markedly reduce inward leakage of aerosols and may therefore offer useful levels of respiratory protection during an extreme shortage of N95 FFRs and could benefit HCWs who cannot comply with N95 FFRs due to intolerance. However, because a wide range of surgical masks is commercially available, individual evaluation of such masks is highly recommended before sealed versions are used as RPDs.","output":"Comparison of Fit for Sealed and Loose-Fitting Surgical Masks and N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mast cells are major effector cells in eliciting allergic responses. They also play a significant role in establishing innate and adaptive immune responses, as well as in modulating tumor growth. Mast cells can be activated upon engagement of the high-affinity receptor FcRI with specific IgE to multivalent antigens or in response to several FcRI-independent mechanisms. Upon stimulation, mast cells secrete various preformed and newly synthesized mediators. Emerging evidence indicates their ability to be a rich source of secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, which convey biological functions. Mast cell-derived EVs can interact with and affect other cells located nearby or at distant sites and modulate inflammation, allergic response, and tumor progression. Mast cells are also affected by EVs derived from other cells in the immune system or in the tumor microenvironment, which may activate mast cells to release different mediators. In this review, we summarize the latest data regarding the ability of mast cells to release or respond to EVs and their role in allergic responses, inflammation, and tumor progression. Understanding the release, composition, and uptake of EVs by cells located near to or at sites distant from mast cells in a variety of clinical conditions, such as allergic inflammation, mastocytosis, and lung cancer will contribute to developing novel therapeutic approaches.","output":"Extracellular Vesicles as Emerging Players in Intercellular Communication: Relevance in Mast Cell-Mediated Pathophysiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Justification: During the current rapidly evolving pandemic of COVID-19 infection, pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their newborn infants form a special vulnerable group that needs immediate attention Unlike other elective medical and surgical problems for which care can be deferred during the pandemic, pregnancies and childbirths continue Perinatal period poses unique challenges and care of the mother-baby dyads requires special resources for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period Process: The GRADE approach recommended by the World Health Organization was used to develop the guideline A Guideline Development Group (GDG) comprising of obstetricians, neonatologists and pediatricians was constituted The GDG drafted a list of questions which are likely to be faced by clinicians involved in obstetric and neonatal care An e-survey was carried out amongst a wider group of clinicians to invite more questions and prioritize Literature search was carried out in PubMed and websites of relevant international and national professional organizations Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, clinical trials, narrative reviews and other descriptive reports were reviewed For the practice questions, the evidence was extracted into evidence profiles The context, resources required, values and preferences were considered for developing the recommendations Objectives: To provide recommendations for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period Recommendations: A set of twenty recommendations are provided under the following broad headings: (1) pregnant women with travel history, clinical suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 infection;(2) neonatal care;(3) prevention and infection control;(4) diagnosis;(5) general questions","output":"Perinatal-neonatal management of COVID-19 infection - guidelines of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI), National Neonatology Forum of India (NNF), and Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is now a global crisis, resulting in the intermittent closure of many schools, worldwide.

The main purpose of this study is to (1) determine the prevalence of mental disorders among medical students and their associated factors, and (2) examine the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy on mental health problems among medical students. METHODS: Between March and May 2021, we conducted a randomized controlled study on two phases among medical students at An-Najah National University. Data were collected using an online questionnaire and the Arabic version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). We also used the MEDAS tool to assess their Mediterranean Diet (MD) adherence. In the second phase, sixty-six students were recruited and assigned randomly to control and intervention groups. Intervention impact was assessed using 12-item General Health Questionnaire at two-time points; baseline, and 8 weeks post-intervention. The interventional model used was cognitive behavioral therapy, and the control group received no treatment. RESULTS: A total of 329 students were included in the analysis of the first phase of the study. Approximately 28% of students had mental health problems. We found a significant relationship between good mental health status with a higher level of physical activity level, longer sleeping hours, and shorter entertainment time (p < 0.05).

Medical students were offered paid employment through a COVID Responder Scheme (CRS). We aimed to qualitatively assess the experience of those who participated in this scheme in comparison to traditional clinical attachments. Summary of work A bespoke questionnaire was designed to explore key themes identified through theme selection, literature review and consensus. Following piloting and validation, the questionnaire was circulated to students recruited to the CRS. A grounded theory analytic framework was used to analyse data. A modified-Delphi consensus process was used to reach a consensus on what makes you feel most valued as a medical student. Summary of results 36 students (46.2% response rate) responded. 86.1% of respondents felt their contribution was worthwhile. 65% reported being significantly more integrated into a team than in their university attachments. Concerns prior to starting CRS work included availability of PPE and the ability to contribute effectively, but refreshingly these concerns did not present as challenges. The steep learning curve of experiential learning alongside virtual teaching commitments proved difficult to juggle when facing physical, mental and emotional fatigue from long hours working busy clinical shifts. Respondents cited the educational benefit of the CRS throughout the survey. Recognition and commendation were highly effective in providing a sense of value ahead of renumeration. 44.4% of respondents were concerned about their future training and a reduction in clinical exposure. Discussion The majority of respondents reported CRS work as worthwhile, with reasons including increased responsibility for patient care and a sense of contribution to the clinical team. This in turn led to autonomous practice and task accountability, which further integrated them into the team and developed their clinical confidence. A students sense of value was strongly linked to being identified in emotional responses from colleagues and patients ahead of financial renumeration, suggesting scope for improvement within unpaid attachments / rotations. Conclusion There is an opportunity to take value from the COVID-19 medical student experience to improve undergraduate medical education through and beyond the pandemic.","output":"A qualitative evaluation of a 'covid responder' scheme for medical students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the spatio-temporal spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Santiago de Chile using anonymized mobile phone data from 1.4 million users, 22% of the whole population in the area, characterizing the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the epidemic dynamics.

METHODS: Here we conducted an observational, longitudinal, and prospective cohort study to investigate serum thyroid hormone levels (TH) in adult COVID-19 patients, admitted between June and August 2020, and to determine whether they reflect the severity or mortality associated with the disease. RESULTS: 245 patients [median age: 62 (49-75) years] were stratified in non-critical (181) and critically ill (64). 58 patients (23.6 %) were admitted to the ICU and 41 (16.7%) died. 16 (6.5%) exhibited isolated low levels of fT3. fT3 levels were lower in critically ill compared to non-critical patients [fT3: 2.82 (2.46- 3.29) vs 3.09 (2.67-3.63) pg/mL, P=0.007]. Serum rT3 was mostly elevated but less so in critically ill compared to non-critical patients [rT3: 0.36 (0.28- 0.56) vs 0.51(0.31-0.67) ng/mL, P=0.001]. The univariate logistic regression revealed correlation between in-hospital mortality and serum fT3 levels (OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.29-0.74; P=0.0019), rT3 levels (OR: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01-0.49; P=0.006) and the product fT3arT3 (OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.28-0.74; P=0.0026). Serum TSH, fT4, and fT3/rT3 values were not significantly associated with mortality and severity of the disease. A serum cutoff level of fT3 (&#8804; 2.6 pg/mL) and rT3 (&#8804;0.38 ng/mL) were associated with 3.46 and 5.94 OR of mortality, respectively. The Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) for serum fT3 (AUC=0.66), rT3 (AUC=0.64), and the product of serum fT3arT3 (AUC=0.70).

Despite the strong inhomogeneity of the observed configurations, most of them are characterized by small density of topological defects, typical of conformal crystals, and the net topological charge induced by the simply-connected geometry of the system is concentrated near the cluster center. These crystals are shown to be robust with respect to thermal fluctuations up to a certain threshold temperature, above which the net charge is progressively redistributed from the center to the rest of the system and the topological order is lost. The crystals are also resilient to the shear stress produced by a small nonuniform azimuthal force field, rotating as a rigid body (RB). For larger forces, topological defects proliferate and the RB rotation gives place to plastic flow.","output":"Formation and stability of conformal spirals in confined 2D crystals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 infections have spread widely in Peru, causing severe societal and health impact.

During the arenavirus life cycle, processing of the viral envelope glycoprotein precursor (GPC) by the cellular subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 (SKI-1)/site-1 protease (S1P) is crucial for productive infection. The ability of newly emerging arenaviruses to hijack human SKI-1/S1P is a key factor for zoonotic transmission and human disease potential. Apart from being an essential host factor for arenavirus infection, SKI-1/S1P is involved in the regulation of important physiological processes and linked to major human diseases. This chapter provides an overview of the mechanisms of arenavirus GPC processing by SKI-1/S1P including recent findings. We will highlight to what extent the molecular mechanisms of SKI-1/S1P cleavage of viral GPC differ from processing of SKI-1/S1Ps cellular substrates and discuss the implications for virus-host interaction and coevolution. Moreover, we will show how the use of the viral GPC as a molecular probe uncovered novel and unusual aspects of SKI-1/S1P biosynthesis and maturation. The crucial role of SKI-1/S1P in arenavirus infection and other major human diseases combined with its nature as an enzyme makes SKI-1/S1P further an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.

Previous studies showed hypercoagulable TEG tracings in anemic patients despite clinical expectations that anemia often prolongs bleeding. TEG is a viscoelastic assessment of clot kinetics, and Hct is the main determinant of whole blood viscosity. TEG changes in anemia may be an in vitro artifact due to Hct effect on blood viscosity rather than true in vivo changes in hemostasis. The effect of changes in whole blood viscosity on TEG independent of Hct is not well understood. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Twenty-one blood samples from seven dogs were manipulated to produce one of three Hct conditions (45, 20, and 10%). Each was tested in two situations: viscosity adjusted to normal by adding alginate (ALG) or dilution with equal volume of saline (SAL). Both samples were analyzed with TEG simultaneously. RESULTS Twenty percent Hct plus ALG and 10% Hct plus ALG were significantly more viscous than their SAL counterparts (p=0.0156). Ten percent Hct plus SAL, 20% Hct plus SAL, and 45% Hct plus SAL all had different viscosities (p=0.006). Twenty percent Hct plus SAL and 10% Hct plus SAL had significantly shorter K and higher angle, MA, and G compared to their ALG counterparts as well as 45% Hct plus SAL (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS ALG samples with low Hct, normal viscosity showed hypocoagulable tracings, whereas SAL samples with low Hct, low viscosity showed hypercoagulable tracings.

Adolescence and early adulthood are peak times for the onset of mental health difficulties. Exposure to a pandemic during this vulnerable developmental period places young people at significant risk of negative psychological experiences. The objective of this research was to summarise existing evidence on the potential impact of a pandemic on the mental health of 12-25-year-olds. METHODS: A rapid review of the published peer-reviewed literature, published between 1985 and 2020, using PsycINFO (Proquest) and Medline (Proquest) was conducted. Narrative synthesis was used across studies to identify key themes and concepts. RESULTS: This review found 3,359 papers, which was reduced to 12 papers for data extraction. Results regarding the prevalence of psychological difficulties in youth were mixed, with some studies finding this group experience heightened distress during an infectious disease outbreak, and others finding no age differences or higher distress among adults. Gender, coping, self-reported physical health and adoption of precautionary measures appear to play a role in moderating the psychological impact of an infectious disease outbreak. Most studies were conducted after the peak of an epidemic/pandemic or in the recovery period.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 Candida spp. isolated from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, who were suspected to have pulmonary candidiasis, and 26 archived Candida spp. specimens were enrolled in this study. For the identification of Candida spp., PCR was performed to detect and amplify the ITS1 and ITS4 genes. Then the products were subjected to the Msp I restriction enzyme to precisely identify the species. The amplification of the WHP1 gene was conducted to identify Candida albicans species. The antifungal activities of routine drugs and the synthesize AuNPs against Candida spp. were assessed based on the protocols presented by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M60. RESULTS: In the present study, C. albicans (24; 96%) and C. parapsilosis (1; 4%) were identified as the etiologic agents of the pulmonary candidiasis associated with the COVID-19 infection. Voriconazol and amphotericin B had superior activity against all the isolates in this study. Treatment with fluconazole and itraconazole did not significantly change the formation of colony-forming units (CFU). However, treatment with the AuNPs significantly decreased (within the range of 92C99.1%; P<0.05) the number of CFUs. CONCLUSION: The azole prophylaxis has likely been associated with the development of resistant isolates; the results of the present study suggested the promising role of novel antifungal agents such as AuNPs in overcoming drug resistant fungi.","output":"Pulmonary Candidiasis Associated with COVID-19: Evaluation of Causative Agents and their Antifungal Susceptibility Patterns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In May 2020, the Navajo Native American Research Center for Health Partnership (Navajo NARCH) was scheduled to launch two summer programs: a 10 weeks-long Summer Research Enhancement Program (SREP) for undergraduate students to learn and practice health research methods and participate in a practicum experience, and a week-long Indigenous Summer Enhancement Program (ISEP) for high school students that introduces a range of health professions and develops leadership qualities Students accepted into the programs are predominantly Navajo and live within Navajo Nation (NN) during the summer Due to NN restrictions and CDC guidelines for physically distancing in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Navajo NARCH team organized to offer both programs entirely online via Zoom?

Demographic and infection-related characteristics have been identified as risk factors, but less research has focused on psychosocial predictors such as stress immediately preceding the index infection. Research on whether stressors predict the development of specific long COVID symptoms is also lacking. MethodsData from 1,966 UK adults who had previously been infected with COVID-19 and who took part in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed. The number of adversity experiences (e.g., job loss) and the number of worries about adversity experiences within the month prior to COVID-19 infection were used to predict the development of self-reported long COVID and the presence of three specific long COVID symptoms (difficulty with mobility, cognition, and self-care). The interaction between a three-level index of socio-economic position (SEP; with higher values indicating lower SEP) and the exposure variables in relation to long COVID status was also examined. Analyses controlled for a range of COVID-19 infection characteristics, socio-demographics, and health-related factors. FindingsOdds of self-reported long COVID increased by 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04 to 1.51) for each additional worry about adversity in the month prior to COVID-19 infection. Although there was no evidence for an interaction between SEP and either exposure variable, individuals in the lowest SEP group were nearly twice as likely to have developed long COVID as those in the highest SEP group (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.19 to 3.19) and worries about adversity experiences remained a predictor of long COVID (OR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.98). The number of worries about adversity experiences also corresponded with increased odds of certain long COVID symptoms such as difficulty with cognition (e.g., difficulty remembering or concentrating) by 1.46 (95% CI: 1.02 to 2.09) but not with mobility (e.g., walking or climbing steps) or self-care (e.g., washing all over or dressing). InterpretationResults suggest a key role of stress in the time preceding the acute COVID-19 infection for the development of long COVID and for difficulty with cognition specifically. These findings point to the importance of mitigating worries and experiences of adversities during pandemics both to reduce their psychological impact but also help reduce the societal burden of longer-term illness.

It was in all forms, including curfew, social distancing, self-quarantine, area quarantine, self-monitoring, and isolation. Due to their concerns about their safety and families, friends, colleagues, and society, everybody was feeling upset, fearful, and anxious. Several studies have reported an association between prolonged sitting time and weight gain. As a way to relieve the tension during that period, people started stocking up on unhealthy foods like over-salted snacks and over-sweetened sugars. People stayed at home, feeling bored, anxious, and stressed and sought relief by eating. Also, there was a rise in emotional eating when the stress of isolation increased by the closure of gyms, casinos, and movie theaters. Moreover, restaurants were allowed to serve the only takeout. Besides, unemployment was skyrocketing, hospitals were overflowing (or were preparing for the possibility), many people were struggling to meet their basic needs, and no one knows when or how it would end. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to figure out whether social isolation during the COVID-19 quarantine is consistent and associated with emotional eating and gaining weight or not. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional case series study was conducted on 765 patients who have visited the bariatric clinic in Sulaimani city, Kurdistan-Iraq, from April 23 to June 23, 2020. An individual face-to-face interview was conducted with each participant to obtain signed informed consent, provide them with information about the type and the subject of the work, and ask them the study's questions. Each interview lasted between 30 and 45 min and was conducted in a closed session by two Kurdistan Board trainees. RESULTS: No patient who was quarantined for the COVID-19 was included in the work, but all other patients were included. The selected patients were those who had undergone social distancing (n = 568, 82.48%) by the local law and did self-isolation (n = 134, 17.51%) at home for reasons like having comorbidity, being prone to contamination due to their jobs (health, police, and media workers), having some family members at home with comorbidity (n = 23, 03.00%), and having comorbidity and having undergone social distancing because of their other family members need to do so for their physical disability (n = 25, 03.27%). Almost all patients (n = 741, 96.86%), even, those with comorbidity (n = 136, 17.78%), were emotionally stable before the outbreak. Seventy-three female patients (09.54%) and138 males (20.65%) sustain their weight during and two months after the outbreak, while the rest (n = 554, 72.41%) gained different amounts of weight. CONCLUSION: Social distancing and self-isolation in the last COVID-19 outbreak influenced weight gain, but weight gain of less than 2 kg was observed among almost all patients who gained weight (98.05%).

Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a very rare presentation of a functioning catecholamine-secreting tumor. We present a case of intestinal pseudo-obstruction due to a large functioning pheochromocytoma. CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old female presented with abdominal distension, pain, nausea, and vomiting with constipation for 3 weeks. She was hypertensive and diabetic and was on multiple medications. She reported frequent spells of severe headaches, palpitations, night sweats, and a 17 kg weight loss over 6 months. She had pallor, dyspnea, marked abdominal distension, and diminished bowel sounds. Her blood pressure was high at 200/120 mmHg. She had tachycardia (pulse 120 bpm) and tachypnea (35 pm). Serum metanephrine levels were significantly elevated, measuring 1203 pg/ml. Abdominal CT showed a heterogeneous, hyper-vascular mass near the upper pole of the left kidney, measuring 10.75 cm  8.72 cm. Open left adrenalectomy was performed through an anterior subcostal approach to remove the tumor with the left adrenal gland. Histopathological examinations were consistent with pheochromocytoma. DISCUSSION: Some authors documented the correlation between tumor size and metabolic activity of catecholamine-secreting tumors with intestinal pseudo-obstruction by paralytic ileus. This case corresponds with these findings, with a tumor mass of 350 g and a serum metanephrine level of 1203 pg/ml.

It has multiple presentations, demyelinating or axonal, according to the pattern of injury. In general, there are cardinal symptoms, such as areflexia and ascending symmetrical lower limb weakness. GBS has multiple different variants. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) is the most common type. Other known variants are acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy, acute motor axonal neuropathy, acute sensory neuropathy, acute pan dysautonomia, and Miller Fisher syndrome. CASE REPORT: In the present case, the patient had initial symptoms of distal bilateral paresthesia and 12 days later he developed left facial muscle weakness, a decrease in ability to taste, and right facial muscle weakness. Two days later the patient said he did not have limb weakness. On examination, he had bilateral lower motor facial palsy, the power in his upper and lower right limbs was 4/5, and he had bilateral upper limb hyperreflexia. Results of a nerve conduction study were consistent with acute demyelinating polyneuropathy with secondary axonal loss. The patient was treated with immunoglobulin G, 0.4 mg/kg/d for 5 days, and fully recovered. CONCLUSIONS: Facial diplegia is one of the GBS variants that presents rarely as pure bilateral facial weakness or is preceded by bilateral lower limb weakness. The present case underscores that patients with GBS may have facial diplegia before weakness. Also, they may not have areflexia as a cardinal feature, and instead, hyperreflexia may be seen. Although hyperreflexia has been reported in association with the acute motor axonal variant, the present case shows that hyperreflexia also can be found with AIDP.","output":"Bilateral Facial Palsy and Hyperreflexia as the Main Clinical Presentation in Guillain-Barr Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The practical experiences of active pharmacists involved in managing critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been rarely reported.

METHODS: This study was conducted in a COVID-19-designated hospital in China. A group of dedicated clinical pharmacists participated in multidisciplinary rounds to optimize the treatments for critically ill patients with COVID-19. Consensus on medication recommendations was reached by a multidisciplinary team through bi-daily discussion. Related drug, classification, cause, and adjustment content for recommendations were recorded and reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 111 medication recommendations were supplied for 22 out of 33 (56.7%) critically ill patients from 1 February 2020 to 18 March 2020, and 106 (95.5%) of these were accepted. Among these recommendations, 64 (67.7%), 32 (28.8%), and 15 (13.5%) were related to antibiotics and antifungals, antiviral agents, and other drugs, respectively. Recommendation types significantly differed for different anti-infectives (p < 0.05).

DATA SOURCES The PubMed database was used to search for relevant articles. STUDY Selections Peer-reviewed prospective and retrospective studies involving the assessment of allergy using human birth cohorts between 2014-2021 were examined. RESULTS Parental history of allergic diseases, especially in cases involving both parents, is associated with increased risk of allergy. Exposure to prenatal and postnatal smoking and limited diet diversity were associated with increased allergic burden. The impact of early life infections and antibiotics on disease development may be associated with the onset of asthma, though this remains debated. Cohort studies also revealed that the mode of delivery and breastfeeding duration impacts the odds ratio of asthma and eczema development. Household exposures, including pets, house dust mites, and scented aeroallergens may confer protective effects, while high air pollution exposure and low socioeconomic status may be risk-enhancing. Exposure to antibiotics during early-life may be associated with increased asthma risk while viral infections may lead to disease protection, though the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on allergic risk is yet to be understood.

While diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is recognised to be the primary manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia, there has been little emphasis on the progression to the fibrosing phase of DAD. This topic is of great interest, due to growing concerns regarding the potential long-term complications in prolonged survivors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we report a detailed histopathological study of 30 autopsy cases with COVID-19 virus infection, based on minimally invasive autopsies performed between February and March, 2020. The mean age was 69 years, with 20 (67%) males and 10 (33%) females and frequent (70.0%) underlying comorbidities. The duration of illness ranged from 16 to 82 (median = 42) days. Histologically, the most common manifestation was diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in 28 (93.3%) cases which showed predominantly acute (32%), organising (25%) and/or fibrosing (43%) patterns. Patients with fibrosing DAD were one decade younger (P = 0.034) and they had a longer duration of illness (P = 0.033), hospitalisation (P = 0.037) and mechanical ventilation (P = 0.014) compared to those with acute DAD. Patients with organising DAD had a longer duration of illness (P = 0.032) and hospitalisation (P = 0.023) compared to those with acute DAD. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pneumonia patients who develop DAD can progress to the fibrosing pattern. While we observed fibrosing DAD in fatal cases, whether or not surviving patients are at risk for developing pulmonary fibrosis and the frequency of this complication will require further clinical and radiological follow-up studies.","output":"Progression to fibrosing diffuse alveolar damage in a series of 30 minimally invasive autopsies with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People worldwide suffer from fake news in many life aspects, healthcare, transportation, education, economics, and many others.

Previous work determined that albumin-rich human fluids increase the minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) of Acinetobacter baumannii against CFDC and reduce the expression of genes related to iron uptake systems. This latter effect may contribute to the need for higher concentrations of CFDC to inhibit growth. The presence of human urine (HU), which contains low albumin concentrations, did not modify MIC values of two carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Levels of resistance to CFDC were not modified by HU in strain AMA40 but were reduced in strain AB5075. Expanding the studies to other carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates showed that the presence of HU resulted in unmodified or reduced MIC of CDFC values. The expression of piuA, pirA, bauA, and bfnH determined by qRT-PCR was enhanced in A. baumannii AMA40 and AB5075 by the presence of HU in the culture medium.

Bayesian network (BN) models have been used within healthcare to bring clarity to complex problems. We use this modelling approach to construct a comprehensive framework for understanding the real world predictive value of individual RT-PCR results. Methods We elicited knowledge from domain experts to describe the test process from viral exposure to interpretation of the laboratory test, through a facilitated group workshop. A preliminary model was derived based on the elicited knowledge, then subsequently refined, parameterised and validated with a second workshop and one-on-one discussions. Results Causal relationships elicited describe the interactions of multiple variables and their impact on a RT-PCR result. Some interactions are infrequently observable and accounted for across the testing cycle such as pre-testing factors, sample collector experience and RT-PCR platform. By setting the input variables as evidence for a given subject and preliminary parameterisation, three scenarios were simulated to demonstrate potential uses of the model. Conclusions The core value of this model is a deep understanding of the total testing cycle, bridging the gap between a persons true infection status and their test outcome.

The suitability of this technique for imaging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is of particular focus here, although it is expected to have equal relevance to many infectious respiratory disease outbreaks. Materials and Methods: Two exposure levels were examined, a typical mobile exposure of 100 kVp/1.6 mAs and a high exposure of 120 kVp/5 mAs. Exposures of an anthropomorphic phantom were made, with and without a glass window present in the beam. The resultant phantom images were provided to experienced radiographers for image quality evaluation, using a Likert scale to rate the anatomical structure visibility. Results and Discussion: The incident air kerma doubled using the high exposure technique, from 29.47 Gy to 67.82 Gy and scattered radiation inside and outside the room increased. Despite an increase in beam energy, high exposure technique images received higher image quality scores than images acquired using lower exposure settings. Conclusion: Increased scattered radiation was very low and can be further mitigated by ensuring surrounding staff are appropriately distanced from both the patient and X-ray tube. Although an increase in incident air kerma was observed, practical advantages in infection control and personal protective equipment conservation were identified.

With limited available research investigating caregiver burden among those caring for patients receiving ECT and the new life challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important now than ever to take a closer look at the caregivers experiences.MethodsEmorys Wesley Woods Geriatric Hospital is one of the busiest ECT services in the country with around 2000 treatments completed every year. In this chart review, researchers are looking at caregivers responses to the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview. This assessment includes 22 questions assessing the caregivers current emotional state in order to examine the impact of the patients condition oncaregiver wellbeing. The score ranges from 0 (no burden) to 88 (severe burden). Other objective assessments completed with ECT patients are BDI (Beck Depression Inventory), BDI Suicide, Sheehan Disability Scale, ECCA (Electrocompulsive Cognitive Assessment), GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale), and CGI (Clinical Global Impression). The purpose of this chart review is to investigate whether the higher severity of depression in patients correlates with higher levels of caregiver burden and whether the pandemic contributed to caregiver burden.ResultsThe Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview has been administered on twelve caregivers (n=12;6 male and 6 female), all providing care for patients currently undergoing ECT for depressive symptoms. Out of the twelve caregivers, 66.6% reported little caregiver burden, 16.6% reported mild to moderate burden, and 16.6% reported moderate to severe burden. Additional patients are being interviewed in the ECT suite and further data collected will be presented at the 2021 IPA Virtual International Congress.ConclusionAs the world adjusts to life in the COVID-19 era, caregivers face new challenges in providing care for vulnerable, at-risk populations. Caregivers of patients receiving ECT facilitate frequent COVID testing and limited visitation policies while continuing to provide care and emotional support to patients with advanced age and a mental illness. Administrating the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview can help providers look at the degree of burden in caregivers of patients receiving ECT for depressive symptoms and provide better caregiving strategies during and post pandemic.","output":"Caregiver Burden and Geriatric Patients Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy in the COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) could have easily been labelled as the \\"black swan\\" of the 21st century, had Covid-19 not emerged as a pandemic.

There is evidence that some of these variants are less sensitive to neutralization in vitro, but it is not clear whether they can evade vaccine induced protection. In this study, we tested SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD as a vaccine antigen and explored the effect of formulation with Alum/MPLA or AddaS03 adjuvants. Our results show that RBD induces high titers of neutralizing antibodies and activates strong cellular immune responses. There is also significant cross-neutralization of variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 and to a lesser extent, SARS-CoV-1.

The purpose of this study is to describe the relationship of time and state-level interventions and opioid filling surrounding total hip arthroplasty (THA) in the United States. METHODS: A national database with diverse insurance constituents was queried for first-prescription and cumulative perioperative opioid filling volumes and rates in oxycodone 5-mg equivalents (OE's) in 487,942 patients undergoing primary THA from 30-days pre-operative to 90-days post-operative. Descriptive statistics evaluated pre-legislative and post-legislative opioid filling by state, legislative type, and surgery year. RESULTS: At the national level, initial opioid filling volumes have remained largely unchanged (56.2 OE's in 2010 to 51.7 OE's in 2018). Meanwhile, cumulative opioid filling volumes (151.9 OE's in 2010 to 111.7 OE's in 2018) have decreased considerably. Rates of initial opioid prescriptions exceeding 90 OE's were similar in 2010 (6.4%) and 2018 (5.6%). States with legislation targeting duration and volume of opioid prescriptions saw the largest decreases in opioid prescription filling. That is, 75% of states with opioid legislation had large (> 10 oxycodone 5-mg equivalents) decreases in cumulative 90-day opioid filling compared to only 20% of states without opioid legislation having large decreases in cumulative 90-day opioid filling. CONCLUSIONS: This descriptive study demonstrates decreases in perioperative opioid filling for THA. Although this study was descriptive in nature, states enacting opioid-limiting legislation had larger decreases. Although causal relationships could not be inferred from this analysis, the results suggest that states without legislation could improve prescriber compliance with national goals of decreased opioid overprescribing by enacting opioid-limiting legislation.

However, in contrast to physical conferences, virtual conferences face a challenge in efficiently scheduling talks, accounting for the availability of participants from different time-zones as well as their interests in attending different talks. In such settings, a natural objective for the conference organizers would be to maximize some global welfare measure, such as the total expected audience participation across all talks. However, we show that optimizing for global welfare could result in a schedule that is unfair to the stakeholders, i.e., the individual utilities for participants and speakers can be highly unequal. To address the fairness concerns, we formally define fairness notions for participants and speakers, and subsequently derive suitable fairness objectives for them. We show that the welfare and fairness objectives can be in conflict with each other, and there is a need to maintain a balance between these objective while caring for them simultaneously. Thus, we propose a joint optimization framework that allows conference organizers to design talk schedules that balance (i.e., allow trade-offs) between global welfare, participant fairness and the speaker fairness objectives. We show that the optimization problem can be solved using integer linear programming, and empirically evaluate the necessity and benefits of such joint optimization approach in virtual conference scheduling.","output":"On Fair Virtual Conference Scheduling: Achieving Equitable Participant and Speaker Satisfaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Bacterial superinfection as well as ventilation associated pneumonia (VAP) are both frequent events in critical care.

They simulate potential scenarios by manipulating model parameters that control processes of disease transmission and recovery. However, the validity of these parameters is challenged by the uncertainty of the impact of public health interventions on disease transmission, and the forecasting accuracy of these models is rarely investigated during an outbreak. We fitted a stochastic transmission model on reported cases, recoveries and deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection across 101 countries. The dynamics of disease transmission was represented in terms of the daily effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text] ).

The impact of updating [Formula: see text] every time a prediction is made on the forecasting accuracy of the model was investigated. We identified 5 groups of countries with distinct transmission patterns during the first 6 months of the pandemic. Early adoption of social distancing measures and a shorter gap between interventions were associated with a reduction on the duration of outbreaks. The lagged correlation analysis revealed that increased policy volume was associated with lower future [Formula: see text] (75 days lag), while a lower [Formula: see text] was associated with lower future policy volume (102 days lag).

In total, 20 samples were collected and analyzed for major ions (boron, fluoride, silica and strontium) and total dissolved solids (TDS). The physical and inorganic results mostly indicated good and excellent quality water for human consumption, while the hot springs tended to have poor water quality in terms of Namibian standards, indicating that the water was not fit for human consumption.","output":"Toward the Sustainable Use of Groundwater Springs: A Case Study from Namibia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability. The incidence of OA is progressively rising due to the diminishing levels of physical activity and ever-expanding aging population. However, the mainstay for OA treatment only can improve symptoms without delay the progression of this severe disease. This study aimed to explore the biological role and clinical function of lncRNA HAND2-AS1 in OA. METHODS: Blood samples and synovial fluid were collected from OA patients and normal subjects. HAND2-AS1 expression was detected by qRT-PCR and IL-6 expression was detected by ELISA. The plasma levels of HAND2-AS1 were also detected in different ages, stages, and gender of OA patients and controls. Furthermore, the ROC curve was used to analyze whether HAND2-AS1 can distinguish OA patients from normal subjects. Also, Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to analyze the correlation between lncRNA HAND2-AS1 and IL-6. In addition, Western blot was used to detect the IL-6 level upon HAND2-AS1 over-expression in chondrocytes and qRT-PCR was used to detect the HAND2-AS1 level after endogenous IL-6 treatment. RESULTS: HAND2-AS1 and IL-6 were dysregulated in plasma and synovial fluid of OA patients. The expression of HAND2-AS1 in plasma of OA patients was decreased with aging and progression. Furthermore, HAND2-AS1 downregulation effectively distinguished OA patients from the healthy controls. Over-expression of HAND2-AS1 inhibited IL-6 expression in chondrocytes, while treatment with exogenous IL-6 did not affect HAND2-AS1 expression. CONCLUSION: HAND2-AS1 effectively distinguished OA patients from the healthy controls and regulates IL-6 expression in human chondrocytes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR, ChiCTR2000038635.

Older adults were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, yet little is known about their perspectives of the government response. Using data collected in September and October, 2020 from the online, nation-wide COVID-19 Coping Study, we conducted qualitative thematic analysis on a subsample of respondents (N=500) proportionate to the age, gender, race/ethnicity, and education of the U.S. population age 55+. Two researchers individually coded a random subsample of 50 open-ended responses to the question How do you feel about federal government responses to and handling of the COVID-19 pandemic? Using NVivo qualitative software, the researchers compared codes and reconciled differences to achieve a Kappa score of >0.8. The first author coded the remaining responses using the established coding strategy. Analyses identified themes related to President Trumps leadership, Congress, the broader federal government, and science. Some participants indicated that the federal governments response to the pandemic was inadequate, too political, and lacking coordination. Others expressed that the president did the best he could or that its not the federal governments responsibility. While some praised vaccine development efforts and expressed their appreciation for Dr. Fauci, others expressed scientific distrust. Participants perspectives were divergent, reflective of the countrys polarization surrounding COVID-19 policies and practices. Differences in perspectives exist by race/ethnicity, gender, geographic region, and age.

Experiences of systemic racism affect the mental health of Canadian young people in multiple complex and intersecting ways including access to care, experience of mental health services, and outcomes of care. We currently lack a national best practice framework for mental health professionals that unifies approaches to research, education, and clinical care for young racialized Canadians; in addition, concerted efforts to collect race-based data are lacking. We suggest that a blueprint for improved services for racialized young people in Canada would include: Development of a funded and sustainable research agenda responsive to community expertise, development and implementation of a Canadian Child and Adolescent task force focused on educational strategies on racism and service provision at both the postgraduate and continuing professional development (CPD) levels, and consideration of clinical parameters that improve access to, and experience of, care for Canadian racialized youth.","output":"What's race got to do with it?

METHODS: Patients admitted to medical wards in an acute hospital were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004 to April 30, 2005. Sputum culture, blood culture, paired serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies were performed. Spirometry was assessed in stable phase at 2C3 months post-hospital discharge. RESULTS: Seventy eight subjects were admitted for AECOPD with concomitant pneumonia. The mean (SD) age was 77.1 (7.5) years, with FEV(1) of 41.5 (20.8)% predicted normal. Overall, an infectious etiology could be established in 48.7% of the subjects. Among the 71 subjects with sputum collected, 40.8% had positive bacterial culture. The commonest bacteria identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae (8[11.3%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7[9.9%]) and Haemophilus influenzae (7[9.9%]). Among the 66 subjects with NPA collected, 9.0 and 12.2% had positive viral culture and PCR results, respectively.

In order to lower the expenditure and development failure rate, repurposing existing and approved drugs and identifying novel interactions between the drug molecules and the target proteins based on computational methods have gained growing attention. Here, we propose the DeepPLA, a novel deep learning-based model that combines ResNet-based 1D CNN and biLSTM, to establish an end-to-end network for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. We first apply pre-trained embedding methods to encode the raw drug molecular SMILES strings and target protein sequences into dense vector representations. The dense vector representations separately go through ResNet-based 1D CNN modules to derive features. The extracted feature vectors are concatenated and further fed into the biLSTM network after average pooling operation, followed by the MLP module to finally predict binding affinity. We used BindingDB dataset for training and evaluating our DeepPLA model. The result shows that the DeepPLA model reaches a good performance for the protein-ligand binding affinity prediction in terms of R, RMSE, MAE, R2 and MSE with 0.89, 0.68, 0.50, 0.79 and 0.46 on the training set; and scores 0.84, 0.80, 0.60, 0.71 and 0.64 on the independent testing set, respectively.

The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of in-hospital severe outcomes of COVID-19. A secondary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Among the 733 patients included in our final analysis, 438 patients (59.8%) presented with anemia. 105 patients (14.3%) had mild, and 333 patients (45.5%) had moderate-severe anemia. Overall, 437 patients (59.6%) had a composite endpoint of severe outcomes. On-admission anemia was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality, (Odds Ratio 1.52, 95% CI [1.01-2.30], p = 0.046) but not for composite severe outcomes.

However, review of the evidence suggests that submucous myomas and possibly intramural myomas both serve to decrease female fertility. A second reason for caution is concern over the impact of surgical treatment on fertility enhancement. For submucous myomas, hysteroscopic myomectomy has proven capable of increasing fertility rates, although this statement may not apply to type 2 submucous myomas.

This is especially of value during the ongoing SAR-COV-2 pandemic, where the accessibility for health care services has been greatly limited. Patients with free access to apps can obtain information to improve their understanding and management of health issues. Currently, there are cancer-related apps available on iPhones and androids. However, there are no guidelines to control these apps and ensure their quality. Furthermore, these apps may significantly modify the patients' perception and knowledge toward drug-related health services. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the convenience, quality, safety and efficacy of apps for cancer patient care. METHODS The study was conducted by searching all apps related to cancer care on both Google Play Store and Apple iTunes Store. A detailed assessment was then performed using the mobile application rating scale (MARS) and risk assessment tools. RESULTS The results indicated that on a scale from 1-5, 47% of the apps were rated  4. The MARS assessment of the apps indicated an overall quality rating of 3.38  0.9 (mean  SD). The visual appeal of the app was found to have a significant effect on app functionality and user engagement. The potential benefits of these apps come with challenges and limitations. Patents related to smartphone applications targeting patients were also discussed. CONCLUSION We recommend a greater emphasis toward producing evidence-based apps. These apps should be rigorously tested, evaluated and updated by experts, particularly clinical pharmacists.

As expected, COVID-19 causes substantial mortality in both ESKD and kidney transplant populations. This is due to underlying CKD and a high prevalence of comorbid conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease in this group. Transplant programs have faced the difficult decision of weighing the risks and benefits of transplantation during the pandemic. On one hand, there is a risk of COVID-19 exposure leading to infection while patients are on maximum immunosuppression. Alternatively, there are risks of delaying transplantation, which will increase waitlist times and may lead to waitlist-associated morbidity and mortality. Cautious and thoughtful selection of both the recipient's and donor's post-transplant management has been required during the pandemic, to mitigate the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.

METHODS We analyzed, retrospectively, data collected prospectively on 44 patients who underwent our bridged one-anastomosis gastric bypass (BOAGB) procedure between September, 2018 and November, 2020. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 45.2  9.3 years (range 20-66 years). The mean preoperative body mass index (BMI), weight, and HbA1c values were 41.5  6.4 kg/m2 (range 35-59), 116  22.7 kg, and 8.2  2.1%, respectively. After a median follow-up period of 18 months (11-26 months), the mean postoperative BMI was 28.4  3.2 kg/m2 (range 21-38), the mean total weight loss was 35.8  13.5 kg (range 20-80 kg), and the mean percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) and the percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) were 79.8  16.1% (range 47-109) and 30.6  6.9% (range 19-48), respectively. The mean postoperative HbA1c level was 6.3  0.9%. There were two early complications (stenosis and bleeding) and one late complication (marginal ulcer). CONCLUSION Patients who underwent BOAGB lost weight similarly to those who underwent OABG as reported in the literature, without an apparent increase in complications related to the technique.

METHOD Bilateral surface EMG activity of the anterior temporalis (AT), masseter (MM), and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscles was recorded in 43 subjects during unilateral chewing and tooth grinding. Thirteen patients had TMD and a natural mediotrusive contact (Group 1), 15 had TMD without a natural mediotrusive contact (Group 2), and 15 were healthy subjects without mediotrusive contacts (Group 3). All subjects were examined according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD). All EMG values were standardized as the percentage of EMG activity recorded during maximum isometric contraction on cotton rolls. RESULTS EMG activity from all muscles measured showed no significant differences between groups during chewing and grinding. Overall, in all groups, the EMG activity during chewing was higher in the working side than the non-working side in AT and MM muscles. During grinding, these differences were only found in masseter muscles (mainly in eccentric grinding). SCM EMG activity did not show significant differences during chewing and grinding tasks. Symmetry, muscular balance, and absence of lateral jaw displacement were common findings in all groups.

METHODS: An electronic survey of varsity athletes 18 years at three United States Division III colleges querying athlete demographics, Modified Athletic Identity Scale (mAIMS), changes in training regimen summer 2020 vs. 2019, RTS confidence, and perceived physical fitness. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-two surveys were completed (19% response). Total reported summer 2020 training decreased by 4 hours/week, with increased aerobic (56% vs. 53%, p = 0.03) and decreased sport-specific training (48% vs 70%, p < 0.001). Median RTS confidence score for formal training and competition was 3 ('neither more or less confident') in men's versus 2 ('less confident') in women's athletes. Median fitness self-assessment for men's athletes was 3 ('neither more nor less physically fit') compared to previous season versus median score of 2 ('less physically fit) among women's athletes (p = 0.004).

Our communication addresses these. Malicious poisoning and poaching are unlikely to have played a role. Other species were unaffected, and elephant carcases had their tusks intact. Restriction of freshwater supplies that force elephants to use pans as a water source possibly polluted by blue-green algae blooms is a possible cause, but as yet not supported by evidence. No other species were involved. A contagious disease is the more probable one. Fences and a deep channel of water confine these elephants dispersal. These factors explain the elephants relatively high population growth rate despite a spell of increased poaching during 2014C2018. While the deaths represent only ~2% of the areas elephants, the additive effects of poaching and stress induced by people protecting their crops cause alarm.

METHODS: Observation at the clinical study site and semi-structured interviews employing situational and discursive analysis were conducted with clinical trial participants and staff over one year. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using critical qualitative interpretivist thematic analytical techniques. Patterns were identified, clustered and sorted to generate distinct and comprehensive themes. We then reassembled events and contexts from the study participants stories to develop two ideal portraits based on \\"composite characters\\" based on study participants features. These provide ethnographically rich details of participants meaningful social worlds while protecting individual identities. RESULTS: Ten of the 14 clinical trial participants, and 3 study staff were interviewed. Participant demographics and socio-economic profiles expressed limited contextual diversity. Half were men who have sex with men, half were former injection drug users experiencing homelessness, one was female, none were racialized minorities and there were no people from HIV endemic countries.

The immune system genes potentially co-expressed with the human targets of SARS-CoV-2 (HT-SARS-CoV-2) ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN were determined in tissue samples from patients with cancer and diabetes mellitus. The network between HT-SARS-CoV-2 and immune system process genes was analyzed based on functional protein associations using STRING. In addition, STITCH was employed to determine druggable targets. Results: DPP4 was the only immune system process gene, which was coexpressed with the three HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes, while eight other immune genes were at least co-expressed with two HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes. STRING analysis between immune and HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes plotted 19 associations of 8 commonly networking genes in mixed healthy (323) and cancer (11003) tissues in addition to normal (87), cancer (90) and diabetic (128) pancreatic tissues.

Methods Using self-reported app data and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, we demonstrate the use of sophisticated spatial modelling for near-real-time prediction of COVID-19 prevalence at small-area resolution to inform strategic government policy areas. Results We demonstrate that using a combination of crowd-sourced app data and sophisticated geo-statistical techniques it is possible to predict hot spots of COVID-19 at fine geographic scales, nationally. We are also able to produce estimates of their precision, which is an important pre-requisite to an effective control strategy to guard against over-reaction to potentially spurious features of best guess predictions. Conclusion In the UK, important emerging risk-factors such as social deprivation or ethnicity vary over small distances, hence risk needs to be modelled at fine spatial resolution to avoid aggregation bias.

Herein, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of ITCs present in public domain databases, including natural products, food chemicals, macromolecular targets of drugs, and the Protein Data Bank. A total of 154 ITCs were found, which can be classified into seven categories: acyclic, cyclic, polycyclic, aromatic, polyaromatic, indolic, and glycosylated. 24 ITCs were reported in 18 vegetable sources, mainly in cruciferous vegetables (Brassica oleracea L.). Calculated properties of pharmaceutical relevance indicated that 11 % of the 154 ITCs would be suitable to be orally absorbed and 48 % permeate the blood-brain-barrier. It was also found that seven molecular targets have been co-crystallized with ITCs and the most frequent is the macrophage migration inhibitory factor. It is expected that this work will contribute to the sub-disciplines of natural products and food informatics.","output":"Chemoinformatic Analysis of Isothiocyanates: Their Impact in Nature and Medicine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer progression is accompanied by increased levels of extracellular proteases that are capable of remodeling the extracellular matrix, as well as cleaving and activating growth factors and receptors that are involved in pro-cancerous signaling pathways. Several members of the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family have been shown to play critical roles in cancer progression, however, the expression or function of the TTSP Human Airway Trypsin-like protease (HAT) in carcinogenesis has not been examined. In the present study we aimed to determine the expression of HAT during squamous cell carcinogenesis. HAT transcript is present in several tissues containing stratified squamous epithelium and decreased expression is observed in carcinomas. We determined that HAT protein is consistently expressed on the cell surface in suprabasal/apical layers of squamous cells in healthy cervical and esophageal epithelia. To assess whether HAT protein is differentially expressed in normal tissue versus tissue in different stages of carcinogenesis, we performed a comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis of HAT protein expression levels and localization in arrays of paraffin embedded human cervical and esophageal carcinomas compared to the corresponding normal tissue. We found that HAT protein is expressed in the non-proliferating, differentiated cellular strata and is lost during the dedifferentiation of epithelial cells, a hallmark of squamous cell carcinogenesis. Thus, HAT expression may potentially be useful as a marker for clinical grading and assessment of patient prognosis in squamous cell carcinomas.","output":"Cell Surface Human Airway Trypsin-Like Protease Is Lost During Squamous Cell Carcinogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Every year situation when the Arctic seas are free of ice is becoming more frequent. It allows scientists to study hard-to-reach areas using well-equipped research vessels instead of icebreakers. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the successful expedition of the research vessel Academician Mstislav Keldysh with more than 60 scientists from 15 countries across the four Arctic seas (Barents, Kara, Laptev, and East Siberian) on September - November 2020 seems like a real wonder. One of the expedition tasks was remote sensing of different hydrophysical processes by their manifestation on the sea surface using marine radar. The present paper proposes the method of generating high spatial resolution radar maps of the sea surface and algorithms of hydrophysical processes identification. This paper also presents examples of registered processes such as wind waves, ice fields with different types of ice (grease ice, pancake ice, nilas, and young ice), manifestations of internal waves observed in the Kara Gate and Vilkitsky Strait, as well as manifestations of intense methane seeps on the sea surface.

Requiring more stringent -- yet well-motivated -- beyond General Relativity (GR) parametrizations improves the inference drawn from available GW data, substantially decreasing the errors on deviation parameters. This implies a reduction in the number of signals needed to detect a deviation from GR predictions and an increase of the number of GR-violating coefficients that can be meaningfully constrained with a given number of signals. To this end, we apply to LIGO-Virgo observations a high-spin version of the Parametrized ringdown spin expansion coefficients (ParSpec) formalism, encompassing large classes of modified theories of gravity. We constrain the lowest-order perturbative deviation of the fundamental ringdown frequency to be $\\\\delta\\\\omega^{0}_{220} = {-0.05}^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$, when assuming adimensional beyond-GR couplings, substantially improving upon previously published results. We also establish upper bounds $\\\\ell_{p=2}<23 \\\\, \\\\mathrm{km}$, $\\\\ell_{p=4}<35 \\\\, \\\\mathrm{km}$, $\\\\ell_{p=6}<42 \\\\, \\\\mathrm{km}$ on the scale $\\\\ell_p$ at which the appearance of new physics is disfavoured, depending on the mass dimension $p$ of the ringdown coupling.

Objective: To describe the demographic and public health characteristics of inquiries, trends, and correlation of inquiries with national COVID-19 case reports. We summarize the results of real-time CDC clinician consultation service provided during 11 March to 31 July 2020 to understand the impact and utility of this service by CDC for the COVID-19 pandemic emergency response and for future outbreak responses. Design: Clinicians documented inquiries received including information about the call source, population for which guidance was sought, and a detailed description of the inquiry and resolution. Descriptive analyses were conducted, with a focus on characteristics of callers as well as public health and clinical content of inquiries. Setting: Real-time telephone consultations with CDC Clinicians in Atlanta, GA. Participants: Health care providers and public health professionals who called CDC with COVID-19 related inquiries from throughout the United States. Main Outcome Measures: Characteristics of inquiries including topic of inquiry, inquiry population, resolution, and demographic information. Results: A total of 3154 COVID-19 related telephone inquiries were answered in real-time. More than half (62.0%) of inquiries came from frontline healthcare providers and clinical sites, followed by 14.1% from state and local health departments. The majority of inquiries focused on issues involving healthcare workers (27.7%) and interpretation or application of CDCs COVID-19 guidance (44%). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a substantial number of inquiries to CDC, with the large majority originating from the frontline clinical and public health workforce. Analysis of inquiries suggests that the ongoing focus on refining COVID-19 guidance documents is warranted, which facilitates bidirectional feedback between the public, medical professionals, and public health authorities.","output":"Real-Time CDC Consultation during the COVID-19 PandemicUnited States, MarchCJuly, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Published data has confirmed the oncological safety and efficacy of laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Continued surgical innovation has seen the recent resurgence of single-port laparoscopic surgery. We present a series of 10 cases of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for right hemicolectomy, with the aim of reaffirming the feasibility and favourable short-term results of this technique. METHODS Ten patients underwent SILS for right hemicolectomy using the SILS port, between June 2009 and August 2009. A longitudinal periumbilical incision was used as the access point for all cases. Data analysed included age, gender, American Society of Anaesthesiology score, body mass index (BMI), location of disease, duration of surgery, length of incision and duration of hospital stay. Inclusion criteria were no prior abdominal surgery, no intra-abdominal sepsis, no distant metastases and a BMI of <30. RESULTS All 10 cases of right hemicolectomy were successfully performed using the SILS port through a single periumbilical incision. The median age of patients was 64 years (range 48-83 years), with a median body mass index of 21.5 kg/m(2) (range 18.9-25.6 kg/m(2)). The median duration of surgery and hospital stay was 83 min (range 60-125 min) and 6 days (range 5-11 days), respectively. No morbidity or mortality was associated with this technique, and all patients recovered uneventfully. CONCLUSION This case series illustrates that SILS for right hemicolectomy is feasible and safe.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The online questionnaire captured current walking, moderate intensity, vigorous intensity and total physical activity and sedentary behaviour (ie, sitting and leisure-based screen time), perceived relative changes in physical activity, sedentary and social behaviours since the pandemic, perceived seriousness and anxiety related to COVID-19, and sociodemographic characteristics. Differences in sociodemographic characteristics, perceived relative change in behaviour and current physical activity and sedentary behaviour were compared between adults with low and high anxiety. RESULTS: Our sample (n=1047) included more females (60.3%) and fewer older adults (19.2%). Most participants (88.4%) considered COVID-19 as extremely or very serious and one-third (32.9%) felt extremely or very anxious. We found no differences (p>0.05) in current physical activity or sedentary behaviour by anxiety level. The largest perceived change in behaviours included social distancing, driving motor vehicles, use of screen-based devices, watching television and interactions with neighbours.

As an additional effort, this study regresses a ratio of accumulative confirmed infection cases at the city level in China on both inter-city and intra-city BE attributes. A mixed geographically weighted regression model was estimated to accommodate both local and global effects of BE attributes. It is found that spatial clusters are mostly related to low infections in 28.63 % of the cities. The density of point of interests around railway stations, travel time by public transport to activity centers, and the number of flights from Hubei Province are associated with the spread. On average, the most influential BE attribute is the number of trains from Hubei Province. Higher infection ratios are associated with higher values of between-ness centrality in 70.98 % of the cities.

Potential therapies and means of prophylaxis against COVID-19 are urgently needed to combat this novel infection. As a result of in vitro evidence suggesting zinc sulfate may be efficacious against COVID-19, our hospitals began using zinc sulfate as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. We performed a retrospective observational study to compare hospital outcomes among patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin plus zinc versus hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone. Methods: Data was collected from electronic medical records for all patients being treated with admission dates ranging from March 2, 2020 through April 5, 2020. Initial clinical characteristics on presentation, medications given during the hospitalization, and hospital outcomes were recorded. Patients in the study were excluded if they were treated with other investigational medications. Results: The addition of zinc sulfate did not impact the length of hospitalization, duration of ventilation, or ICU duration. In univariate analyses, zinc sulfate increased the frequency of patients being discharged home, and decreased the need for ventilation, admission to the ICU, and mortality or transfer to hospice for patients who were never admitted to the ICU. After adjusting for the time at which zinc sulfate was added to our protocol, an increased frequency of being discharged home (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.09) reduction in mortality or transfer to hospice remained significant (OR 0.449, 95% CI 0.271-0.744).

This study aimed to determine how children with disabilities have experienced the pandemic in Sweden and its impact on their lives. METHODS: Six children (5C13 years) were interviewed via video conferencing. An interview guide was adapted based on the childrens communicative abilities and included augmentative and alternative communication support. Reflective field notes were included in the analysis. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Two themes were identified: The childs knowledge of Corona raises anxiety and fear; and Boring Corona makes the child even lonelier. The children had knowledge about and were worried about COVID-19, primarily about illness and death of their grandparents. The children longed for their grandparents and other social contacts at school, and life was described as boring and lonely. Many families lacked adequate tools to communicate with their children about the pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-four nonneurologic patients (group 1; 17 males/17 females; mean age, 7.18 years) who received between 5 and 15 injections (mean, 7.8 injections) of 0.05 mmol/kg of gadobenate during a mean of 2.24 years were compared with 24 control patients (group 2; 16 males/8 females; mean age, 8.78 years) who had never received gadolinium-based contrast agents. Exposure to gadobenate was for diagnosis and therapy monitoring. Five blinded readers independently determined the signal intensity at ROIs in the dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, pons, and thalamus on unenhanced T1-weighted spin-echo images from both groups. Unpaired t tests were used to compare signal-intensity values and dentate nucleus-pons and globus pallidus-thalamus signal-intensity ratios between groups 1 and 2. RESULTS Mean signal-intensity values in the dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, pons, and thalamus of gadobenate-exposed patients ranged from 366.4 to 389.2, 360.5 to 392.9, 370.5 to 374.9, and 356.9 to 371.0, respectively. Corresponding values in gadolinium-based contrast agent-na?ve subjects were not significantly different (P > .05).

After adjusting for confounders, the probability of clinical improvement at day 28 compared to control was 7a6% (OR, 0a36 [95% CrI, 0a09-1a46]) for tocilizumab and 40a9% (OR, 0a89 [95% CrI, 0a32-2a43]) for anakinra. At day 28, the probability of being in a better clinical category was 2a5% (OR, 2a98 [95% CrI, 1a00-8a88]) for tocilizumab, and 49a5% (OR, 1a00 [95% CrI, 0a42-2a42]) for anakinra. CONCLUSIONS: In invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients, treatment with anakinra was associated with a higher probability of clinical improvement compared to tocilizumab; however, treatment with either drug did not result in clinically meaningful improvements compared with controls.","output":"Immunosuppressive strategies in invasively ventilated ARDS COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that serology holds promise as an alternative diagnostic tool to copromicroscopy to monitor and evaluate deworming programs targeting soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). Here we explored the dynamics of anti-Ascaris antibodies (Ab) and evaluated the Ab-isotype of choice to assess the longitudinal exposure to Ascaris in Ethiopian school children. METHODOLOGY: Between October 2018 and February 2020, stool and blood samples were collected every four months from school children (4 to 6 years of age). Stool samples were analyzed by duplicate Kato-Katz to assess the presence and intensity of any STH infection. Plasma Ab-responses against the total extract of Ascaris suum lung third stage larvae were measured through in-house Ab-ELISAs for seven different Ab-isotypes. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: At baseline, 42.4% of the 66 children were excreting eggs of any STH, Trichuris (37.9%) being the most prevalent. The cumulative prevalence (proportion of children tested that positive at least once over the entire study period) was 56.1% for Trichuris and 31.8% for Ascaris. For Ascaris, re-infections were frequently observed, whereas for Trichuris, children often remained excreting eggs following drug administration. When measuring anti-Ascaris Ab-levels, the cumulative seroprevalence was generally higher (IgG4: 60.6%; IgG1: 50.0%; IgE: 36.4%). The individual anti-Ascaris IgG4 levels at baseline were positively associated with the fecal egg counts averaged over the study period, the rate of egg-appearance and the number of positive test results. There was no apparent cross-reactivity between the anti-Ascaris IgG4 Ab-ELISA and Trichuris. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that the children are exposed to STH before the age of four and that the exposure to Ascaris is underestimated when measured with copromicroscopy. Compared to other Ab-isotypes, IgG4 is the Ab-isotype of choice to measure Ascaris exposure in STH endemic settings. Finally, the results also highlight that measuring anti-Ascaris IgG4 levels holds promise as a tool to identify individuals at higher risk for continued exposure to this STH.","output":"Longitudinal assessment of the exposure to Ascaris lumbricoides through copromicroscopy and serology in school children from Jimma Town, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Metabolic reprogramming has been regarded as one of the core hallmarks of cancer and increased de novo fatty acid synthesis has been documented in multiple tumors including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Our previous exome-wide analyses found a Val1937Ile variant (rs17848945) in the 34th exon of fatty acid synthase (FASN) that showed a strong association with the risk of ESCC. In this study, we performed a series of functional assays to investigate the biological functions underlying this variant in the development of ESCC. We demonstrated that FASN was upregulated in ESCC and both knockdown and knockout of FASN significantly inhibited ESCC cell proliferation, suggesting a tumor promoter role for this gene in ESCC. Furthermore, the results showed that overexpression of FASN[I] in the ESCC cells substantially enhanced cell proliferation, compared with overexpression of FASN[V], or the control vector. Intriguingly, we found that the FASN[I] variant can enhance the enzyme activity of FASN, and, thus, increase the amount of the FASN end-product, palmitate in the ESCC cells. We also observed elevated palmitate levels in the plasma of the FASN[I] genotype carriers among a total of 632 healthy Chinese adults. In conclusion, our results suggested that the FASN V1937I variant influenced ESCC cell proliferation and susceptibility by altering the catabolic activity of FASN on palmitate. These findings may highlight an important role of palmitate metabolism in the development of ESCC and may contribute to the personalized medicine of this disease.","output":"Functional characterization of a low-frequency V1937I variant in FASN associated with susceptibility to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present critical review was conducted to evaluate the clinimetric properties of the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), an assessment tool designed specifically to predict long-term mortality, with regard to its reliability, concurrent validity, sensitivity, incremental and predictive validity. The original version of the CCI has been adapted for use with different sources of data, ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. The inter-rater reliability of the CCI was found to be excellent, with extremely high agreement between self-report and medical charts. The CCI has also been shown either to have concurrent validity with a number of other prognostic scales or to result in concordant predictions. Importantly, the clinimetric sensitivity of the CCI has been demonstrated in a variety of medical conditions, with stepwise increases in the CCI associated with stepwise increases in mortality. The CCI is also characterized by the clinimetric property of incremental validity, whereby adding the CCI to other measures increases the overall predictive accuracy. It has been shown to predict long-term mortality in different clinical populations, including medical, surgical, intensive care unit (ICU), trauma, and cancer patients. It may also predict in-hospital mortality, although in some instances, such as ICU or trauma patients, the CCI did not perform as well as other instruments designed specifically for that purpose. The CCI thus appears to be clinically useful not only to provide a valid assessment of the patient's unique clinical situation, but also to demarcate major diagnostic and prognostic differences among subgroups of patients sharing the same medical diagnosis.","output":"Charlson Comorbidity Index: A Critical Review of Clinimetric Properties."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 infection has impacted pregnancy outcomes; however, few studies have assessed the association between haematological parameters and virus-related pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. We hypothesised differences in routine haematology indices in pregnant and non-pregnant COVID-19 patients as well as COVID-19-negative pregnant subjects and observed neonatal outcomes in all pregnant populations. Further, we tested if pattern identification in the COVID-19 pregnant population would facilitate prediction of neonates with a poor Apgar score. METHODS: We tested our hypothesis in 327 patients (111 COVID-19-positive pregnant females, 169 COVID-19-negative pregnant females and 47 COVID-19-positive non-pregnant females) in whom standard routine laboratory indices were collected on admission. RESULTS: Pregnant COVID-19-positive patients exhibited higher WBC, neutrophil, monocyte counts as well as neutrophil/lymphocyte and neutrophil/eosinophil ratio compared to non-pregnant COVID-19-positive patients (p = 0.00001, p = 0.0023, p = 0.00002, p = 0.0402, p = 0.0161, p = 0.0352, respectively). Preterm delivery was more prevalent in COVID-19-positive pregnant patients accompanied with a significantly lower birth weight (2894.37 ( 67.50) g compared with 3194.16 ( 50.61) g, p = 0.02) in COVID-19-negative pregnant patients. The COVID-19-Induced Immunity Response (CIIR) was defined as (WBC  neutrophil) / eosinophil; Apgar scores were significantly and inversely correlated with the CIIR index (r =0.162). INTERPRETATION: Pregnancy appears to give rise to an increased immune response to COVID-19 which appears to protect the mother, however may give rise to complications during labour as well as neonatal concerns. CIIR is a simple metric that predicts neonatal distress to aid clinicians in determining the prognosis of COVID-19 and help provide early intensive intervention to reduce complications.","output":"SARS-2 COVID-19-induced immunity response, a new prognostic marker for the pregnant population correlates inversely with neonatal Apgar score"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We create a network model to study the spread of an epidemic through physically proximate and accidental daily human contacts in a city, and simulate outcomes for two kinds of agents-poor and non-poor.

Methods: A systematic search of the literature conducted in bibliographic databases including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane and Scientific Information Database using a comprehensive search strategy without time limit until the end of 2018, accomplished by reference tracking, author contacting and expert consultation to identify studies on the overuse of medical care. Results: We reviewed 4124 published articles based on predetermined inclusion criteria. The authors consensus included a total of 40 articles. Of these, 31 were in English and 9 in Farsi, published between 19975-2018. The result categorized into two distinct clinical areas: treatment (17 articles), and diagnostic (23 articles) services. Almost all of the studies only described the magnitude of unnecessary overuse. Unnecessary overuse of Antibiotics, MRI and CT-scan were the most reported topics. The ranges of their overuse proportion were as follows; Antibiotic (31 to 97%); MRI (33 to 88%), and CT-scan (19 to 50%). Conclusions: Our review showed, even so, the magnitude of unnecessary overuse of medical services is high but there are only a few interventional studies in clinical and administrative level for finding effective methods for decreasing these unnecessary services.

Recognition of the infectious agent by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) can initiate activation of the NF-B signaling pathway and promote the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. During sepsis, the activation of NF-B is dysregulated and results in cytokine storm, or the pathologic release of cytokines. Current treatments for sepsis rely on broad spectrum antimicrobial medications and fluid replacement therapy, to neutralize the inciting pathogen and maintain adequate blood pressure. The addition of vasopressor therapy is also utilized when sepsis progresses to septic shock, which is defined by treatment resistant hypotension. Even though modern treatment guidelines have improved clinical outcomes, the mortality rate of sepsis and septic shock is still 15C20% and 20C50%, respectively. To reduce mortality, recent sepsis treatment research has focused on investigating novel therapeutics that can attenuate the dysregulated NF-B signaling pathway. Antioxidants, such as Retinoic acid and Oxytocin, can reduce activation of the NF-B pathway by neutralizing stimulatory reactive oxygen species (ROS). Likewise, anti-inflammatory agents can also affect the NF-B pathway by decreasing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-6. Novel anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-37 and IL-38, have recently been characterized and shown to reduce inflammation in mice with bacterial sepsis. Separately, antioxidants and anti-inflammatory cytokines show promise as potential therapies for sepsis, however, a combined therapy including both agents may prove more beneficial in further improving clinical outcomes.","output":"Novel Treatments Targeting the Dysregulated Cell Signaling Pathway during Sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Compliance with government-recommended preventive measures represents a key factor in mitigating the negative consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHOD: Data were collected in AprilCMay 2020, and the sample comprised 236 participants, 192 women, mean age 31.44 (s.d. = 10.30, age range 16C67). RESULTS: Our results showed that health anxiety and perceived control, but not perceived risk predicted adaptive preventive behaviours, whereas dysfunctional behaviours were predicted by health anxiety alone. COVID-19-related anxiety was predicted by health anxiety and perceived risk, with perceived control emerging as a non-significant predictor. Also, we found that the effect of health anxiety on COVID-19-related anxiety was mediated by perceived risk, and that perceived control acted as a moderator in the relation between health anxiety and dysfunctional (but not adaptive) preventive behaviours.

Eosinophils express high levels of secreted phospholipase A2 compared to other leukocytes, indicating their direct involvement in the production of lipid mediators during allergic inflammation. On the other side, eosinophils have also been recognized as crucial mediators with regulatory and homeostatic roles in local immunity and repair. Thus, targeting the complex network of lipid mediators offer a unique opportunity to target the over-activation and 'pro-inflammatory' phenotype of eosinophils without compromising the survival and functions of tissue-resident and homeostatic eosinophils.

Quality was assessed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool. Thirty-eight studies were identified. Results included data from at least 16,600 truckers and 282 trucking settings in the U.S. (n = 32) and Canada (n = 6). Most studies were classified as quantitative descriptive and of poor quality (average score 3 of 7). The few studies (n = 4) that measured trucking food and PA environments characterized trucking sites as poor. Fifteen (47%) presented data about truckers perceptions of food or PA environments and highlighted prominent environmental barriers. Truckers food, PA, and smoking patterns and practices suggested poor diet quality, sedentary practices, and a high prevalence of smoking. The science of trucking food, PA, and tobacco environments is underdeveloped and requires much more focus using validated measures.","output":"A systematic review of trucking food, physical activity, and tobacco environments and tractor-trailer drivers related patterns and practices in the United States and Canada, 1993C2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The availability of comprehensive genomic datasets across patient populations enables the application of novel methods for reconstructing tumor evolution within individual patients. To this end, we propose studying autosomal broad copy number alterations (CNAs) as a framework to better understand early tumor evolution. We compared the broad CNAs and somatic mutations of patients with 1 to 10 autosomal broad CNAs against the full set of patients, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer project. We reveal here that the frequency of a chromosome arm obtaining a broad CNA and a genome acquiring somatic mutations changes as autosomal broad CNAs accumulate. Therefore, we propose that the number of autosomal broad CNAs is an important characteristic of breast tumors that needs to be taken into consideration when studying breast tumors. To investigate this idea more in-depth, we next studied the frequency that specific chromosome arms acquire broad CNAs in patients with 1 to 10 broad CNAs. With this process, we identified the broad CNAs that exhibit the fastest rates of accumulation across all patients. This finding suggests a likely order of occurrence of these alterations in patients, which is apparent when we consider a subset of patients with few broad CNAs. Here, we lay the foundation for future studies to build upon our findings and use autosomal broad CNAs as a method to monitor breast tumor progression in vivo to further our understanding of how early tumor evolution unfolds.","output":"Early Breast Cancer Evolution by Autosomal Broad Copy Number Alterations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) across the globe have met tremendous challenges during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, such as shortages of personal protective equipment, extensive work hours, and constant fear of catching the virus or transmitting it to loved ones. Adding on to the already existing burnout, an increase in incidents of violence and aggression against HCWs was seen in Pakistan and globally. OBJECTIVES: Primarily to review cases of violence against HCWs in Pakistan, highlighting and comparing the instigating factors seen within the country and globally. Secondly, to enlist possible interventions to counter workplace violence in healthcare during a pandemic and in general. METHODS: Incidents of violence towards HCWs in Pakistan during the COVID-19 pandemic occurring between April 7, 2020, and August 7, 2020, were included. The incidents reported from local newspapers were reviewed. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 29 incidents were identified, with perpetrators of violence most commonly being relatives of COVID-19 patients. Most frequent reasons included mistrust in HCWs, belief in conspiracy theories, hospitals refusal to admit COVID-19 patients due to limited space, COVID-19 hospital policies, and the death of the COVID-19 patients. Protests by doctors and other HCWs for provision of adequate PPE, better quarantine conditions for doctors with suspected COVID-19, and better compensation for doctors on COVID-19 patient duty resulted in police violence towards HCWs. To avoid such incidents in the future, institutions, healthcare policymakers, media organisations, and law enforcement agencies must work together for widespread public awareness to counter misconceptions and to exhibit responsible journalism. In hospitals, measures such as de-escalation training and increased security must be implemented. Furthermore, law enforcement agencies must be trained in non-violent methods of crowd dispersal and control to manage peaceful protests by HCWs over legitimate issues.","output":"Violence against Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review of Incidents from a Lower-Middle-Income Country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Despite recognition that farming has substantial economic uncertainty, few recent studies have investigated how economic stress may impact the family dynamic among family farmers. This study sought to address this gap in the literature by examining both personal and global economic stress as a predictor of family distress and work-family conflict among a sample of farm couples. Methods: Participating in the study were 217 husband-wife dyads (434 individuals) in which farming was the primary occupation of the husband. A cross-sectional survey design was used to assess economic stress, family distress, and work-family conflict. Spouses completed separate online surveys to ensure independent responding. Results: Both individual (spillover) and dyadic (crossover) effects were examined. Results demonstrated farmers' personal economic stress was positively related to individual and spousal family distress. Furthermore, family distress ws a mediator of the relationship between personal economic stress and work-family conflict for both farmers and their spouses. Conclusion: Economic stress is an important variable to consider when examining the work-family interface of farm couples. Moreover, personal economic stress had a larger impact on family distress and work-family conflict than global economic stress. By providing a better understanding of the family mechanisms by which economic stress may impact farm couples, it is hoped the current results can be used to assist in the development and application of mental health resources for farm families.","output":"Economic Stress, Family Distress, and Work-Family Conflict among Farm Couples."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes infectious diseases involving the small bowel (SB) with a focus on recent literature related to diagnosis and pathophysiology. RECENT FINDINGS: Typical symptom for SB infections is diarrhea, mostly self-limiting. Pathogens include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoan parasites, and helminths. Host-pathogen interaction is of special interest in infections with potentially severe or prolonged course. Research uses increasingly enterocyte cell culture systems. SARS-CoV2 can also infect enterocytes via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and causes gastrointestinal complaints in some patients. Chronic SB infections as tuberculosis, Cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus have to be differentiated from Crohn's and other diseases. Severe rare fungal and protozoan parasitic infections can cause relevant morbidity in immunocompromised patients. Soil-transmitted helminthic infections are a special issue in endemic areas. SUMMARY: Many infections involve the SB, typically causing mild and self-limiting diarrhea. Symptomatic therapy, hygiene, and isolation are the mainstay of management. However, some patients develop severe or chronic disease. Immunosuppression is a major cause for severe, but also for rare opportunistic systemic infections that can also affect the SB.","output":"Infectious diseases affecting the small bowel - what not to miss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we investigated the spatial dependence of the incidence rate by COVID-19 in the S?o Paulo municipality, Brazil, including the association between the spatially smoothed incidence rate (INC_EBS) and the social determinants of poverty, the average Salary (SAL), the percentage of households located in slums (SLUMS) and the percentage of the population above 60 years of age (POP>60Y). We used data on the number notified cases accumulated per district by May 18, 2020. The spatial dependence of the spatially smoothed incidence rate was investigated through the analysis of univariate local spatial autocorrelation using Moran's I. To evaluate the spatial association between the INC_EBS and the determinants SAL, POP>60Y and SLUMS, we used the local bivariate Moran's I. The results showed that the spatially smoothed incidence rate for COVID-19 presented significant spatial autocorrelation (I = 0.333; P<0.05), indicating that the cases were concentrated in clusters of neighbouring districts. The INC_EBS showed a negative spatial association with SAL (I = -0.253, P<0.05) and POP>60Y (I = -0.398, P<0.05). We also found that the INC_EBS showed a positive spatial association with households located in the slums (I = 0.237, P<0.05).

To determine whether health-care professionals and the 65 years target group value the need for these recommendations, a cross-sectional study was conducted to capture and describe their knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors about vaccination. Online surveys were administered to representative groups of general practitioners (GPs), primary care nurses and adults 65 years from six major cities (and surrounding rural areas) in Spain. Main topics were attitudes and awareness of vaccines, perceptions about vaccination in adults 65 years, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vaccination uptake. A total of 286 health-care professionals (185 GPs, 101 nurses) and 400 adults aged 65 years participated in the survey. GP and nurse groups agreed strongly about the importance of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in the target population. Longer patient visit times were identified as a key factor toward promoting vaccination. The 65 years sample group, especially those 75+ years and/or with chronic diseases, was reasonably positive about the effectiveness and benefits of vaccines. Lower vaccination rates for the pneumococcal than influenza vaccine (29% vs. 80%) in the 65 years sample group suggest that efforts are needed to improve pneumococcal vaccine uptake.

This feed, though, might have negative environmental impacts on the major areas of production and is becoming very expensive. Cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) is a resilient crop which represents a good opportunity in reclaiming and remediating unutilized lands. Cardoon seeds are rich in oil, which is extracted for industrial purposes, and the related by-products (press cake and meal) are characterized by high protein content and essential fatty acids. The aim of this study was to evaluate cardoon meal as a protein source during the Limousine bulls fattening period, in order to study a suitable alternative to develop and create low-input and low-emission feeding strategies. The results obtained in terms of growth performances showed no statistical difference between bulls fed the by control diet (containing soybean meal as main protein source) and animals fed by the experimental diet, where soybean meal was partially replaced by one containing cardoon meal. Meat quality traits were measured, and no differences between the groups were found. Hence, these by-products could be considered as a valuable solution in Limousine bulls fattening periods and could be used to represent a key factor to improve cattle-feeding sustainability. ABSTRACT: Soybean meal is the most important protein source in beef cattle feeding. The research of alternative protein sources to replace soy use, avoiding negative effects on in vivo performance and on the products quality, is an important issue. In this context, cardoon represents a non-OGM resilient crop that can be cultivated in marginal lands for extracting its seed oil (utilized for biodiesel and biodegradable bioplastic production) and whose and the residual meal from its seed oil (utilized for biodiesel and biodegradable bioplastic production) could be a suitable by-product for animal feeding, due to its fairly high protein content. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using cardoon meal as an innovative protein source during the Limousine bulls fattening period. Thirty-two bulls were divided into two groups and fed with a diet containing soybean meal (SG) or partially replacing soybean meal with cardoon meal as a protein source (CG), respectively. The feeding trial lasted about 11 months. Growth performances and meat physicalCchemical traits were evaluated. No statistical differences in feed efficiency, average daily gain, or in the main meat quality indicators, as well as in fatty acid profiles were found among the groups. Therefore, cardoon meal could be considered as an alternative to soybean meal in fattening Limousine bulls in order to enhance the sustainability of the farming system.","output":"Cardoon Meal as Alternative Protein Source to Soybean Meal for Limousine Bulls Fattening Period: Effects on Growth Performances and Meat Quality Traits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, or hypertension have a high risk of developing severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and of COVID-19 mortality. However, the association between long-term exposure to air pollutants, which increases cardiopulmonary damage, and vulnerability to COVID-19 has not yet been fully established. We collected data of confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the epidemic in mainland China. We fitted a generalized linear model using city-level COVID-19 cases and severe cases as the outcome, and long-term average air pollutant levels as the exposure. Our analysis was adjusted using several variables, including a mobile phone dataset, covering human movement from Wuhan before the travel ban and movements within each city during the period of the emergency response. Other variables included smoking prevalence, climate data, socioeconomic data, education level, and number of hospital beds for 324 cities in China. After adjusting for human mobility and socioeconomic factors, we found an increase of 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.8%-52.0%), 32.3% (95% CI: 22.5%-42.4%), and 14.2% (7.9%-20.5%) in the number of COVID-19 cases for every 10-g/m3 increase in long-term exposure to NO2, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. However, when stratifying the data according to population size, the association became non-significant. The present results are derived from a large, newly compiled and geocoded repository of population and epidemiological data relevant to COVID-19. The findings suggested that air pollution may be related to population vulnerability to COVID-19 infection, although the extent to which this relationship is confounded by city population density needs further exploration.","output":"Association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and long-term exposure to air pollution: Evidence from the first epidemic wave in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Incarcerated people are at disproportionately high risk of contracting COVID-19.

It is plausible that the virus is detectable in stormwater samples where human-originated fecal contamination may have occurred from sources like sanitary sewer overflows, leaky wastewater pipes, and non-human animal waste. Because of these potential contamination pathways, it is possible that stormwater could serve as an environmental reservoir and transmission pathway for SARS-CoV-2. The objectives of this study are: 1) determine whether the presence of SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in stormwater via RT-ddPCR (reverse transcription-digital droplet PCR); 2) quantify human-specific fecal contamination using microbial source tracking; and 3) examine whether rainfall characteristics influence virus concentrations. To accomplish these objectives, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 could be detected from 10 storm sewer outfalls each draining a single, dominant land use in Columbus, Xenia, and Springboro, Ohio. Of the 25 samples collected in 2020, at minimum one SARS-CoV-2 target gene (N2 [US-CDC and CN-CDC], and E) was detected in 22 samples (88%). A single significant correlation (p = 0.001), between antecedent dry period and the USCDC N2 gene, was found between target gene concentrations and rainfall characteristics. Grouped by city, two significant relationships emerged showing cities had different levels of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene. Given the differences in scale, the county-level COVID-19 confirmed cases COVID-19 rates were not significantly correlated with stormwater outfall-scale SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations. Countywide COVID-19 data did not accurately portray neighborhood-scale confirmed COVID-19 case rates. Potential hazards may arise when human fecal contamination is present in stormwater and facilitates future investigation on the threat of viral outbreaks via surfaces waters where fecal contamination may have occurred. Future studies should investigate whether humans are able to contract SARS-CoV-2 from surface waters and the factors that may affect viral longevity and transmission.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in urban stormwater: An environmental reservoir and potential interface between human and animal sources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although COVID-19 largely causes respiratory complications, it can also lead to various extrapulmonary manifestations resulting in higher mortality and these comorbidities are posing a challenge to the health care system.

The brain-disease-gene network revealed five highly clustered modules demonstrating a greater complexity of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, we have identified 35 hub proteins of the network which were largely involved in the protein catabolic process, cell cycle, RNA metabolic process, and nuclear transport. Perturbing these hub proteins by drug repurposing will improve the clinical conditions in comorbidity. In the near future, we assumed that in COVID-19 patients, many other neurological manifestations will likely surface. Thus, understanding the infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and associated comorbidity is a high priority to contain its short- and long-term effects on human health.

This study examines variations in COVID-19 symptom profiles based on underlying chronic disease and geographical location. METHODS: Using a global online symptom survey of 78,299 responders in 190 countries between 09/04/2020 and 22/09/2020, we conducted an exploratory study to examine symptom profiles associated with a positive COVID-19 test result by country and underlying chronic disease (single, co- or multi-morbidities) using statistical and machine learning methods. FINDINGS: From the results of 7980 COVID-19 tested positive responders, we find that symptom patterns differ by country. For example, India reported a lower proportion of headache (22.8% vs 47.8%, p<1e-13) and itchy eyes (7.3% vs. 16.5%, p=2e-8) than other countries. As with geographic location, we find people differed in their reported symptoms if they suffered from specific chronic diseases. For example, COVID-19 positive responders with asthma (25.3% vs. 13.7%, p=7e-6) were more likely to report shortness of breath compared to those with no underlying chronic disease. INTERPRETATION: We have identified variation in COVID-19 symptom profiles depending on geographic location and underlying chronic disease. Failure to reflect this symptom variation in public health messaging may contribute to asymptomatic COVID-19 spread and put patients with chronic diseases at a greater risk of infection. Future work should focus on symptom profile variation in the emerging variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Not least because of the corona crisis, more and more digital teaching formats and innovative teaching concepts such as the flipped classroom model are finding their way into teaching. We analyzed the acceptance and effectiveness of traditional teaching methods as well as the interest in innovative e?learning methods among medical students in the field of radiation oncology at the medical school of the Technical University of Munich. METHODS: We carried out an online-based survey as well as a knowledge test on all students from two terms who had completed the seminar series of radiation oncology.

The test consisted of 10 multiple-choice questions. RESULTS: Traditional teaching methods are largely accepted by students and most students consider the current learning format to be effective in terms of the teaching effect in the field of radiation oncology. However, only about 50% of all knowledge questions were answered correctly. The possible use of e?learning methods was judged critically or desired in roughly equal parts among the students.

Morusin suppresses the growth of different types of tumors, including breast cancer, glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, hepatocarcinoma, prostate cancer, and gastric cancer. It also inhibits the inflammatory response by suppressing COX activity and iNOS expression. Moreover, an antimicrobial effect against Gram-positive bacteria was observed after treatment with morusin. The objective of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about the positive effects of morusin on human health in order to facilitate future study on the development of plant polyphenolic drugs and nutraceutics in the group of prenylflavones.","output":"The Pro-Health Benefits of Morusin AdministrationAn Update Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Problems associated with globalisation have been exacerbated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which made us more aware of the interconnected nature of the world. Global pandemic requires global solutions, and the educational system should look beyond the confines of national borders to advocate for Global Citizenship Education (GCE) to provide such solutions. However, it is still underexplored that to what extent Chinese elementary school English textbooks reflect the notion of GCE and how they guide teachers practices particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. To address the gap, a mixed-method study was conducted to scrutinize two versions of Chinese elementary school English textbooks and explore teachers practices, so as to contribute to Chinas context-specific GCE endeavours through English language teaching (ELT). The findings demonstrate that the themes of GCE are embedded in two versions of textbooks to varying degrees and with unbalanced distribution. Some elements that do not comply with the proposition of GCE and the excluded themes may impede the full realisation of global citizenship values. Interview results show that teacher training is urgently needed to integrate GCE into interdisciplinary subjects and raise teachers critical awareness to challenge the prevailing routines in ELT. The findings could also provide some pedagogical enlightenment for teachers practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. ?

CASE REPORT A 48-year-old man was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) in 3 vessels (3VD) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 61% and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with routine hemodialysis. The patient was scheduled for a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He underwent surgery after COVID-19 screening using a checklist provided by the hospital. The patient's condition worsened on the 3rd postoperative day in the ward, and he was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), reintubated, and tested for COVID-19 with a real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we excluded the other possible pneumonia causes (e.g., influenza). An RT-PCR test performed after surgery revealed that the patient was positive for COVID-19. COVID-19 tracing was performed for all health care providers and relatives; all results were negative except for 1 family member. The patient was treated for 4 days in the isolation ICU but died due to complications of the infection. CONCLUSIONS This report shows the importance of testing patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection before hospital admission for elective surgery and during the hospital stay, and the importance of developing rapid and accurate testing methods that can be used in countries and centers with limited health resources.","output":"A 48-Year-Old Man at Low Risk for SARS-CoV-2 Infection Who Underwent Planned Elective Triple-Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery at a National Heart Center in Indonesia Followed by a Fatal Case of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases that do not primarily affect the gastrointestinal tract can cause severe diarrhea. The pathogenesis of this kind of diarrhea includes cytokine action, intestinal inflammation, sequestration of red blood cells, apoptosis and increased permeability of endothelial cells in the gut microvasculature, and direct invasion of gut epithelial cells by various infectious agents. Of the travel-associated systemic infections presenting with fever, diarrhea occurs in patients with malaria, dengue fever and SARS. Diarrhea also occurs in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, when it is suggestive of legionellosis. Diarrhea can also occur in patients with systemic bacterial infections. In addition, although diarrhea is rare in patients with early Lyme borreliosis, the incidence is higher in those with other tick-borne infections, such as ehrlichiosis, tick-borne relapsing fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

This study aims to evaluate the quality of prone elAPER surgery with Permacol? repair of the perineum. The primary end point studied was the rate of primary perineal wound healing. METHODS Data were prospectively collected for consecutive patients having prone elAPER at a single institution to assess surgical morbidity together with pathological and cancer-specific outcomes. RESULTS Between 2006 and 2012, 48 patients had prone elAPER with median age of 63 (40-86). Thirty-four patients (72.3%) received neoadjuvant treatment. Median length of stay was 9 days (6-66). With a prone approach, three patients had specimen perforation (6.4%) and seven patients had circumferential margin involvement (14.9%). Complete perineal wound healing was achieved in 34 patients (73.9%) at 4 weeks. Four patients (8.3%) were unhealed at 6 months; one patient required a perineal sinus to be laid open, and another patient required plastic surgical reconstruction. No perineal wound herniae have been identified during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Acceptable oncological outcomes are achieved with the prone extralevator approach. The technique achieves high rates of primary healing, making it an attractive option in centres without access to plastic reconstructive expertise.","output":"Prone extralevator abdominoperineal excision of the rectum with porcine collagen perineal reconstruction (Permacol?): high primary perineal wound healing rates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains a major global public health crisis. The food animal industry will face escalating challenges to increase productivity while minimizing AMR, since the global demand for animal protein has been continuously increasing and food animals play a key role in the global food supply, particularly broiler chickens. As chicken products are sources of low-cost, high-quality protein, poultry production is an important economic driver for livelihood and survival in developed and developing regions. The globalization of the food supply, markedly in the poultry industry, is aligned to the globalization of the whole modern society, with an unprecedented exchange of goods and services, and transit of human populations among regions and countries. Considering the increasing threat posed by AMR, human civilization is faced with a complex, multifaceted problem compromising its future. Actions to mitigate antimicrobial resistance are needed in all sectors of the society at the human, animal, and environmental levels.

Adenovirus encodes the histone-like protein VII that causes catastrophic global reorganization of host chromatin to promote virus infection. Protein VII recruits the family of high mobility group box (HMGB) proteins to chromatin along with the histone chaperone SET. As a consequence of this recruitment, we find that protein VII causes chromatin-depletion of several linker histone H1 isoforms. The relationship between linker histone H1 and the functionally opposite HMGB proteins is critical for higher order chromatin structure. However, the physiological consequences of perturbing this relationship are largely unknown. Here, we employ complementary systems in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human cells to demonstrate that adenovirus protein VII disrupts the H1-HMGB balance to obstruct the cell cycle. We find that protein VII causes an accumulation of G2/M cells both in yeast and human systems, underscoring the high conservation of this chromatin vulnerability. In contrast, adenovirus E1A and E1B proteins are well-established to override cell cycle regulation and promote transformation of human cells. Strikingly, we find that protein VII obstructs the cell cycle even in the presence of E1A and E1B, suggesting that protein VII-directed cell cycle disruption ensures host resources are directed towards viral proliferation during infection. Together, our results demonstrate that protein VII targets H1-HMGB1 antagonism to obstruct cell cycle progression, revealing an unexpected chromatin vulnerability exploited for viral benefit.","output":"A viral histone-like protein exploits antagonism between linker histones and HMGB proteins to obstruct the cell cycle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate whether the classic bystander effect is unique to humans, the effect of bystanders on rat helping was studied. In the presence of rats rendered incompetent to help through pharmacological treatment, rats were less likely to help due to a reduction in reinforcement rather than to a lack of initial interest.

Duos and trios of potential helper rats helped at superadditive rates, demonstrating that rats act nonindependently with helping facilitated by the presence of competent-to-help bystanders.

Balloon dacryoplasty (BD) is a minimally invasive procedure effectively used for congenital NLDO which has also been used in adults, instead of dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), the current gold standard technique. The main objectives were to assess the results of BD with and without silicone tube insertion (STI) in NLDO in adults. Materiel and Method: A systematic review of literature was conducted on PubMed, SCOPUS and Cochrane databases. The articles were scanned to identify all studies that evaluated the outcomes of primary BD for NLDO in adults. The mean success rates were calculated and compared using the multiple comparisons Sidak's T-test Results: Sixty-seven articles were identified but only 13 publications matched the inclusion criteria. For partial NLDO, BD had a mean, success rate of 73.29% (64.86% with STI) with a mean follow-up of 16 months. For complete NLDO, BD had a success rate of 36.67% (52.50% with STI) with a mean follow-up of 15.5 months. Altogether the success rate of BD was significantly higher for partial NLDO compared to complete stenosis (p = 0,002). Conclusion: BD is significantly more successful for partial NLDO, without significant additional benefit from subsequent STI. The main complication would be the high recurrence rate. BD is not effective for complete NLDO with very low success rates. However, BD could be proposed for partial NLDO, as it is a safe procedure, with minimal invasiveness in comparison to DCR.

There is substantial concern that the use of existing ICU triage protocols to allocate scarce ventilators and critical care resources-most of which are designed to save as many lives as possible-may compound these inequities. As governments and health systems revisit their triage guidelines in the context of impending resource shortages, scholars have advocated a range of alternative allocation strategies, including the use of a random lottery to give all patients in need an equal chance of ICU treatment. However, both the save-the-most-lives approach and random allocation are seriously flawed. In this Perspective, we argue that ICU triage policies should simultaneously promote population health outcomes and mitigate health inequities. These ethical goals are sometimes in conflict, which will require balancing the goals of maximizing the number of lives saved and distributing health benefits equitably across society. We recommend three strategies to mitigate health inequities during ICU triage: introducing a correction factor into patients' triage scores to reduce the impact of baseline structural inequities; giving heightened priority to individuals in essential, high-risk occupations; and rejecting use of longer-term life expectancy and categorical exclusions as allocation criteria. We present a practical triage framework that incorporates these strategies and attends to the twin public health goals of promoting population health and social justice.","output":"Mitigating Inequities and Saving Lives with ICU Triage during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digitalisation and COVID-19 have been changing the way we teach.

Tolerance to the morphine anticonvulsant effect was induced in mice by subcutaneous injection of 2.5 mg/kg of morphine for 4 days. Subsequent doses of ZMEO (20 mg/kg) were used to study the expression and development of morphine tolerance. Clonidine was used as the standard drug to inhibit the morphine withdrawal syndrome symptoms. To study the ZMEO effect on withdrawal syndrome, mice received appropriate morphine values for 4 days and on the fifth day, 60 min before administration of naloxone. The effective dose of ZMEO was determined and the number of jumps, stands and changes in the dry stool weight, as symptoms of withdrawal syndrome were evaluated. The dose of 20 mg/kg of ZMEO decreased the tolerance in development and expression groups significantly. Counting the number of jumping, standing and defecation were assessed 30 min after morphine and 1 h after the vehicle and clonidine. The dose of 40 mg/kg ZMEO decreased all the signs of withdrawal syndrome significantly. ZMEO was analyzed by GC/MS and linalool (53.1%) and camphor (23.8%) were characterized as the main components.

It is the only top ten cause of death that cannot be prevented, cured or substantially slowed, leaving disease management, caregiver support and service innovation as the main targets for reduction of disease burden. Institutionalization of persons with dementia is common in western countries, despite patients preferring to live longer at home, supported by caregivers. Such complex health challenges warrant multicomponent interventions thoroughly implemented in daily clinical practice. This article describes the rationale, development, feasibility testing and implementation process of the LIVE@Home.Path trial. METHODS: The LIVE@Home.Path trial is a 2-year, multicenter, mixed-method, stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial, aiming to include 315 dyads of home-dwelling people with dementia and their caregivers, recruited from 3 municipalities in Norway. The stepped-wedge randomization implies that all dyads receive the intervention, but the timing is determined by randomization. The control group constitutes the dyads waiting for the intervention. The multicomponent intervention was developed in collaboration with user-representatives, researchers and stakeholders to meet the requirements from the national Dementia Plan 2020. During the 6-month intervention period, the participants will be allocated to a municipal coordinator, the core feature of the intervention, responsible for regular contact with the dyads to facilitate L: Learning, I: Innovation, V: Volunteering and E: Empowerment (LIVE). The primary outcome is resource utilization. This is measured by the Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) instrument and the Relative Stress Scale (RSS), reflecting that resource utilization is more than the actual time required for caring but also how burdensome the task is experienced by the caregiver.

RSB may not be successful beyond infancy because of the increased thickness of the rectal mucosa. EMR could improve the diagnostic yield for HD when compared with traditional RSB because larger and deeper samples are acquired for analysis. METHODS In this prospective, single-center study, patients referred for RSB were offered enrollment for concurrent EMR. Specimens were analyzed pathologically for size, submucosal ganglionic tissue, and acetylcholinesterase or calretinin staining. Biopsy results were compared with transit studies, anorectal manometry, and constipation severity through validated questionnaires. RESULTS Seventeen patients (2 male, 15 female; mean age, 35.8 years; range, 22-61 years) were enrolled in the study from 2008 to 2014. All patients underwent anorectal manometry (88% with anorectal dysfunction, 68% with outlet obstruction) and transit studies (41% with delayed transit). There were no reports of adverse events from the RSB and EMR procedures. The RSB sample volumes were significantly lower than the EMR sample volumes (0.023 cm3 vs 0.26 cm3, P = .001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The search strategy was performed in six databases and grey literature. A total of 28 questionnaire\\\\based studies were included, without language or time restriction, from 20 different countries. RESULTS: Six thousand five hundred sixty\\\\five participants were assessed: 84% undergraduates, 9% of faculty members, 5% of postgraduate students/residents/trainees and 2% of dental schools/residency programs. The pooled eligible data for teaching methodologies were 62% of a combination of different methods (95% CI, 35.5% to 82.3%), 23% a combination of synchronous and asynchronous formats (95% CI, 8.2% to 50.2%) and 15% for only synchronous lectures (95% CI, 4.3% to 42.2%). The reported tools were laptops (40%), smartphones (40%), tablets (40%), desktops (20%), Blackboard (20%), Respondus Lockdown Browser (20%), eProctor (20%) and PowerPoint (20%). The most used platforms were Zoom (70.6%), Microsoft Teams (23.5%) and Cisco Webex (23.5%). A better time management (17.9%; 95% CI, 7.9% to 35.6%) and the possibility of revision with additional notes (14.3%; 95% CI, 5.7% to 31.5%) was the greatest advantages related to dental e\\\\learning, while the increased levels of anxiety/stress/burnout/exhaustion (35.7%; 95% CI, 21% to 54.2%) and internet connection problems (35.7%; 95% CI, 21% to 54.2%) was the most cited disadvantages.

We explored whether the quality of evidence of COVID-19 publications is lower when compared to nonCOVID-19 publications in the three highest ranked scientific medical journals. METHODS: We searched the PubMed Database from March 12 to April 12, 2020 and identified 559 publications in the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association, and The Lancet which were divided into COVID-19 (cases, n = 204) and nonCOVID-19 (controls, n = 355) associated content. After exclusion of secondary, unauthored, response letters and non-matching article types, 155 COVID-19 publications (including 13 original articles) and 130 nonCOVID-19 publications (including 52 original articles) were included in the comparative analysis. The hierarchical level of evidence was determined for each publication included and compared between cases and controls as the main outcome. A quantitative scoring of quality was carried out for the subgroup of original articles. The numbers of authors and citation rates were also compared between groups. RESULTS: The 130 nonCOVID-19 publications were associated with higher levels of evidence on the level of evidence pyramid, with a strong association measure (Cramer's V: 0.452, P <0.001). The 155 COVID-19 publications were 186-fold more likely to be of lower evidence (95% confidence interval [CI] for odds ratio, 7.0-47; P <0.001). The quantitative quality score (maximum possible score, 28) was significantly different in favor of nonCOVID-19 (mean difference, 11.1; 95% CI, 8.5-13.7; P <0.001). There was a significant difference in the early citation rate of the original articles that favored the COVID-19 original articles (median [interquartile range], 45 [30-244] vs. 2 [1-4] citations; P <0.001).

The public's gaze is focused on the urgent health crisis, while many children are at risk due to social isolation and reduced social services. OBJECTIVE: Examine child protection in Israel during COVID-19, as portrayed in mainstream news media and government policy documents. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study analyzed all policy documents and mainstream media reports published in Israel from March to May 2020, during the initial mandatory nationwide quarantine. METHODS: (1) Search of relevant articles in mainstream news websites; (2) Search of documents in official websites of relevant government ministries and agencies. RESULTS: 28 government policy documents and 22 media articles were found relevant. When examined chronologically, what stood out was the initial decision to shut down social services, including some of the residential care units for youth at risk, and declare social workers \\"non-essential\\". These decisions were revoked a few weeks into the quarantine, following persistent media pressure by child advocates, resulting in minor changes in policy. CONCLUSION: Children were initially invisible to Israeli policymakers facing the pandemic, highlighting the centrality of advocates promoting children's rights and of mainstream news media in disseminating the discourse of protecting children from maltreatment, especially in times of crisis. Moreover, the study points to the heightened threat to at-risk children due to inadequate policies, and to the urgent need to develop child protection policies in order to avoid further risk in future global crises.","output":"Invisible children and non-essential workers: Child protection during COVID-19 in Israel according to policy documents and media coverage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not only the performance of a commercial contract but also the implementation of the chosen method of resolving a dispute may become impossible or excessively burdensome due to unexpected circumstances, such as the effect of restrictive measures during a pandemic.

Indeed, it has now been shown to be feasible and safe for many commonly performed operations. METHODS This study cohort comprised 22 unselected patients with abdominal wall hernias of varying types: multiply recurrent inguinal (n = 2), suprapubic (n = 1), ventral/incisional (n = 17), and parastomal hernias (n = 2), who underwent laparoendoscopic single-site ventral hernia repair between December 2009 and February 2011. Standard dissecting instruments and a 52 cm/5.5 mm/ 30 degree angle laparoscope were used. RESULTS Patients included 14 men and 8 women, with a median age of 56 (range, 32 to 78) years and a mean body mass index of 31.5 +/- 4.7 kg/m2. The mean mesh size was 460 cm2 (range, 225 to 884 cm2). Mean operation time was 125 minutes for ventral/incisional hernias and 270 minutes for parastomal hernias. No conversions to multiport or open surgeries were necessary. There was no mortality or morbidity, and no recurrence at 6- to 18-month follow-up. The mean satisfaction score was 2.7 (range, 2 to 3) with no patients reporting dissatisfaction with the procedure. CONCLUSION This series, though relatively small, represents a diverse group of patients with varying abdominal wall hernias, including parastomal hernias.

The decision whether to perform only bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and eventually a subsequent LBx in case of a nondiagnostic lavage, or one single bronchoscopy combining both sampling methods depends on the clinical suspicion, on patients characteristics (e.g. increased biopsy risk) and preferences, and on the resources and biopsy techniques available locally (e.g. regular forceps versus cryobiopsy). In CTD-ILD, BAL has major clinical utility in excluding infections and in the diagnosis of specific patterns of acute lung damage (e.g. alveolar hemorrhage, diffuse alveolar damage, and organizing pneumonia). LBx is indicated to exclude neoplasm or diagnose lymphoproliferative lung disorders that in CTD patients are more common than in the general population. Defining BAL cellularity and characterizing the CTD-ILD histopathologic pattern by LBx can be helpful in the differential diagnosis of cases without established CTD [e.g. ILD preceding full-blown CTD, interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF)], but the prognostic and theragnostic role of those findings remains unclear. Few studies in the pretranscriptomics era have investigated the diagnostic and prognostic role of BAL and LBx in CTD-ILD, and it is reasonable to hypothesize that future studies conducted applying innovative techniques on BAL and LBx might open new and unexpected avenues in pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment approach to CTD-ILD. This is particularly desirable now that a new drug treatment era is emerging, in which we have more than one therapeutic choice (immunosuppressive agents, antifibrotic drugs, and biological agents).

This representation can be maintained for a certain duration in the absence of previously elicited inputs. The reliance on an internal representation rather than purely on the basis of external stimuli is a hallmark feature of higher-order functions such as working memory. Patterns of neural activity produced in response to sensory inputs can continue long after the disappearance of previous inputs. Experimental and theoretical studies have largely invested in understanding how animals faithfully maintain sensory representations during ongoing reverberations of neural activity. However, these studies have focused on preassigned protocols of stimulus presentation, leaving out by default the possibility of exploring how the content of working memory interacts with ongoing input streams. Here, we study working memory using a network of spiking neurons with dynamic synapses subject to short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity. The formal model is embodied in a physical robot as a companion approach under which neuronal activity is directly linked to motor output. The artificial agent is used as a methodological tool for studying the formation of working memory capacity. To this end, we devise a keyboard listening framework to delineate the context under which working memory content is (1) refined, (2) overwritten or (3) resisted by ongoing new input streams.

Methods: We collected microarray profiles of 39 ccRCC and matched normal samples to identify differential expression genes (DEGs). Then, a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was constructed to identify gene modules associated with the metastasis in ccRCC. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA, https://www.proteinatlas.org/) database were used for verification set. Finally, we used biological experiments to preliminary investigate the impact of LTF on the tumor biological behavior of ccRCC, including proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Results: A total of 15 genetic modules were identified, and the light-green module is considered the most relevant to tumor metastasis. (P = 0.02, R2 = -0.4). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was performed to identify the hub nodes in the light-green module. Finally, combining the results of PPI, WGCNA and DEGs, lactotransferrin (LTF) gene was regarded as \\"real\\" hub genes for cancer metastasis risk.

The distress associated with the pandemic itself, and with public health efforts to manage the outbreak, could result in increased alcohol use. This study aimed to quantify changes in alcohol use during the early stages of the pandemic and factors associated with different patterns of use. METHODS: Data were obtained from a longitudinal survey of a representative Australian adult sample (N = 1296, 50% female, Mage = 46.0) conducted from March to June 2020, during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia. Change in alcohol consumption was examined using Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) scores from waves one, three, five, and seven of the study, each 4 weeks apart. Factors associated with alcohol consumption were examined, including depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms, health risk tolerance, stress and coping, work and social impairment (WSAS), COVID impacts, and sociodemographic variables. We tested changes in alcohol use across the full sample using a mixed effects repeated measure ANOVA model and a multinomial logistic regression to identify factors assessed at wave 1 that were independently associated with alcohol use. RESULTS: There was no significant change in AUDIT-C scores across the study. For most participants, alcohol use did not increase during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. COVID-19 exposure, higher perceived coping, depression symptoms, and male gender were associated with greater odds of increasing or elevated levels of alcohol use. Social changes, which included working from home, had mixed effects on alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Although no evidence was found for increased alcohol use overall during the early months of the pandemic, several factors were associated with alcohol consumption at risky levels.

Among the different targets within the virus structure, as a vital component in the life cycle of coronaviruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) can be a critical target for antiviral drugs. The impact of the existence of RNA in the enzyme structure on the binding affinity of anti-RdRP drugs has not been investigated so far. METHODS: In this study, the potential anti-RdRP effects of a variety of drugs from two databases (Zinc database and DrugBank) were evaluated using molecular docking. For this purpose, the newly emerged model of COVID-19 (RdRP) post-translocated catalytic complex (PDB ID: 7BZF) that consists of RNA was chosen as the target. RESULTS: The results indicated that idarubicin (IDR), a member of the anthracycline antibiotic family, and fenoterol (FNT), a known beta-2 adrenergic agonist drug, tightly bind to the target enzyme and could be used as potential anti-RdRP inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These outcomes revealed that due to the ligand-protein interactions, the presence of RNA in this structure could remarkably affect the binding affinity of inhibitor compounds. CONCLUSION: In silico approaches, such as molecular docking, could effectively address the problem of finding appropriate treatment for COVID-19. Our results showed that IDR and FNT have a significant affinity to the RdRP of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, these drugs are remarkable inhibitors of coronaviruses.","output":"Evaluation of potential anti-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) drugs against the newly emerged model of COVID-19 RdRP using computational methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are a powerful economic engine in many European countries. Moreover, tourism SMEs are particularly important in the economies of countries in southern Europe due to the climate and sociodemographic situation, among other reasons. In Spain, specifically, these enterprises are a vital economic asset. Nonetheless, neither the importance of SMEs in the tourism industry nor the main factors that influence their capital structure have been sufficiently studied. We used panel data methodology with a regression model to analyse the capital structure of SMEs in the tourism sector at the onset of the 2008 financial crisis. Our results show the significance of SMEs within the tourism industry as well as the need to take into account the main factors that influence their capital, which are type (micro, small or medium enterprise), profitability, number of employees and size (logarithm of total assets). Furthermore, despite the robustness of these companies, they have been affected by the crisis.

Olfactory training involving aromatic oils has been recommended to improve olfactory recovery, but quantitative data are missing. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify the benefit of olfactory training and visual stimulation assisted by a dedicated web application for patients who experienced olfactory dysfunction for &#8805;1 month. METHODS: We performed an observational, real-life, data-based study on a cohort of patients who experienced at least 1 month of persistent olfactory dysfunction between January 30 and March 26, 2021. An analysis was performed after a mean olfactory training time of 4 weeks, and at least 500 patients were assessable for primary outcome assessment. Participants exposed themselves twice daily to odors from 4 high-concentration oils and visual stimulation assisted by a dedicated web application. Improvement was defined as a 2-point increase on a 10-point, self-assessed olfactory visual analogue scale. RESULTS: In total, 548 patients were assessable for primary outcome assessment. The mean baseline, self-assessed olfactory score was 1.9 (SD 1.7), and this increased to 4.6 (SD 2.8) after a mean olfactory training time of 27.7 days (SD 17.2). Olfactory training was associated with at least a 2-point increase in 64.2% (352/548) of patients. The rate of patients' olfactory improvement was higher for patients who trained for more than 28 days than that rate for patients who trained for less than 28 days (73.3% vs 59%; P=.002). The time to olfactory improvement was 8 days faster for patients with hyposmia compared to the time to improvement for patients with anosmia (P<.001). This benefit was observed regardless of the duration of the olfactory dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory training and visual stimulation assisted by a dedicated web application was associated with significant improvement in olfaction, especially after 28 days of olfactory training.","output":"Olfactory Training and Visual Stimulation Assisted by a Web Application for Patients With Persistent Olfactory Dysfunction After SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 78-year-old man underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy for gastric cancer (pT3N0M0).

Successful implementation depends on interactions between the technology, the actors and the context. More traditional reductionistic approaches aim to understand isolated factors and linear causeCeffect relations and have difficulties in addressing inter-relatedness and interaction. Complexity theory offers a myriad of approaches that focus specifically on behaviour and mechanisms that emerge from interactions between involved actors and the environment. These approaches work from the assumption that change does not take place in isolation and that interaction and inter-relatedness are central concepts to study. However, developments are proceeding fast and along different lines. This can easily lead to confusion about differences and usefulness in clinical and healthcare research and practice. Next to this, reductionistic and complexity approaches have their own merits and much is to be gained from using both approaches complementary.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG in seroprevalent patients receiving dialysis. DESIGN: Prospective. SETTING: Nationwide sample from dialysis facilities. PATIENTS: 2215 patients receiving dialysis who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as of July 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Remainder plasma from routine monthly laboratories was used to measure semiquantitative RBD IgG index value over 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 2063 (93%) seroprevalent patients reached an assay detectable response (IgG index value &#8805;1). Most (n = 1323, 60%) had responses in July with index values classified as high (IgG &#8805;10); 1003 (76%) remained within this stratum. Adjusted median index values declined slowly but continuously (July vs. December values were 21 vs. 13; P < 0.001). The trajectory of the response did not vary by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, or diabetes status. Patients without an assay detectable response (n = 137) were more likely to be White and in the younger (18 to 44 years) or older (&#8805;80 years) age groups and less likely to have diabetes and hypoalbuminemia. LIMITATION: Lack of data on symptoms or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction diagnosis, cohort of persons who survived infection, and use of a semiquantitative assay. CONCLUSION: Despite impaired immunity, most seropositive patients receiving dialysis maintained RBD antibody levels over 6 months. A slow and continual decline in median antibody levels over time was seen, but no indication that subgroups with impaired immunity had a shorter-lived humoral response was found.

This is performed explicitly to show the applicability of ANNs in forecasting the daily number of patients recovered from COVID-19. Second, the ANNs-based approach is further applied to the data from Italy to confirm its robustness in other geographical contexts. Finally, to evaluate its forecasting accuracy, the proposed Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) approach is compared with other traditional models, including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), and Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with Exogenous Inputs (NARX). Compared to the ARIMA, LSTM, and NARX, the MLP-based model is found to perform better in forecasting the number of people recovered from COVID-19.

This burden is characterized by wide-spread geographical variation within the country. This paper explores two research questions: (i) are the drivers of severe and moderate stunting similar? (ii) differential endowments or policy-effect, how do community-level nutrition and sanitary practices affect inter-state differences? Using data from Indian National Family and Health Survey 4, 2015C16, six states holding different ranks in the stunting continuum are compared to Tamil Nadu, taken as the benchmark state due to its laudable performance in the health care sector. Applying quantile regression approaches, the difference in state-level performance is decomposed into detailed covariate effects (differential endowments) and coefficient effects (differential strength of association between the drivers and outcome). The explanatory variables are not similarly associated with severe and moderate stunting. Decomposition results demonstrate a significant role of community-level sanitation practices compared to child nutrition behaviour in explaining the inter-state disparity. Coefficient effects play a dominant role in the lower tail of HAZ distribution for the poor performing states indicating that the worse outcomes of these states are due to weaker policy effects of the control variables on stunting. Multi-sectoral approach, identification and differentiation between severe and moderate stunting cases can be more instrumental in managing and reducing the scourge. This paper also advocates the potential benefits of customizing centrally-launched policies as per the states performance and introducing the concept coproduction in the existing nutrition and health policy framework. This will instigate a feeling of ownership of the problem of childhood stunting among the policy consumers and strengthen the influence of policies on the outcomes.","output":"Disparity in childhood stunting in India: Relative importance of community-level nutrition and sanitary practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There is limited access to life-saving antenatal ultrasound in rural and low-resource settings largely due to shortages in skilled staff. Studies have shown healthcare practitioners can be upskilled in PoCUS through focused training, offering a viable solution to this deficit. However, standards for training and competency assessment are unclear and regulation surrounding practice is lacking. We aimed to review published literature examining antenatal PoCUS training programs, comparing teaching approaches and study methodologies. METHODS: A search of electronic databases EMBASE, MEDLINE and Google Scholar was conducted. Original research articles evaluating antenatal PoCUS training of healthcare professionals worldwide were identified for analysis. Articles with limited detail on the PoCUS training intervention and those describing comprehensive diagnostic training programs were excluded. Evaluations were compared against the Kirkpatrick Evaluation Framework (KEF). RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were included from an initial search result of 484 articles. There was considerable heterogeneity between the PoCUS training programs described. Course duration ranged from 3 hours to 2 years, with 11 of the 27 studies delivering obstetric-exclusive content. 44% trained multidisciplinary groups of health professionals. Long-term follow-up training and skills assessments were lacking in over half of the reviewed studies. Study quality and reporting detail varied, but overall beneficial outcomes were reported with 3/4s of the studies reaching upper KEF levels 3 and 4. CONCLUSION: PoCUS performed by upskilled healthcare professionals offers an attractive solution to the problem of inequitable access to antenatal ultrasound. A review of available literature highlighted a paucity of comparable high-quality studies needed to establish a stronger evidence base for antenatal PoCUS, and a need to standardise training and competency assessment. This review may inform educators, researchers and policy-makers on existing training formats and methodologies to assist in establishing best practice antenatal PoCUS training methods for safe service delivery by remote healthcare professionals.","output":"Evaluation of antenatal Point-of-Care Ultrasound (PoCUS) training: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In November 2021, the Omicron variant was discovered and immediately classified as a variant of concern (VOC), since it shows substantially more mutations in the spike protein than any previous variant, especially in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). We analyzed the binding of the Omicron RBD to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) and the ability of human sera from COVID-19 patients or vaccinees in comparison to Wuhan, Beta, or Delta RBD variants. METHODS: All RBDs were produced in insect cells. RBD binding to ACE2 was analyzed by ELISA and microscale thermophoresis (MST). Similarly, sera from 27 COVID-19 patients, 81 vaccinated individuals, and 34 booster recipients were titrated by ELISA on RBDs from the original Wuhan strain, Beta, Delta, and Omicron VOCs. In addition, the neutralization efficacy of authentic SARS-CoV-2 wild type (D614G), Delta, and Omicron by sera from 2 or 3 BNT162b2-vaccinated persons was analyzed. RESULTS: Surprisingly, the Omicron RBD showed a somewhat weaker binding to ACE2 compared to Beta and Delta, arguing that improved ACE2 binding is not a likely driver of Omicron evolution. Serum antibody titers were significantly lower against Omicron RBD compared to the original Wuhan strain. A 2.6 reduction in Omicron RBD binding was observed for serum of 2 BNT162b2-vaccinated persons. Neutralization of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 was completely diminished in our setup. CONCLUSION: These results indicate an immune escape focused on neutralizing antibodies. Nevertheless, a boost vaccination increased the level of anti-RBD antibodies against Omicron, and neutralization of authentic Omicron SARS-CoV-2 was at least partially restored. This study adds evidence that current vaccination protocols may be less efficient against the Omicron variant.

There is a need to understand the impact on different health care professionals in different countries. The aim of the present study was to explore the psychological impact of the pandemic among dental staff in Norway in relation to background characteristics, work situation and preparedness of the service. METHODS: A structured questionnaire sent electronically to dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants inquired information about the lockdown period in Norway (13 March-17 April 2020). Distributions of background characteristics, perceptions of preparedness and psychological impact were calculated. Exploratory factor analysis was performed, and Structural Equation Models (SEMs) were used to compare psychological impact between dental professionals treating patients versus not during lockdown. RESULTS: Among the 1237 respondents, 58.8% worked clinically with patients. The majority were concerned of becoming infected (71.9%), of infecting others (85.4%) and/or of their family becoming infected (76.9%). Respondents who treated patients felt significantly more insecure about whether having become infected or not. The minority felt discriminated (6.7%), worried about death (11.7%), felt that life was threatening (9.8%) or felt loss of control of their lives (8.9%). More than 80% agreed that their workplace handled the situation well. Four factors were retrieved from the factor analysis.

Previous research into forecasting demand this domain has mostly used a collection of statistical techniques, with machine learning approaches only now beginning to emerge in recent literature. The forecasting problem for this domain is difficult and has also been complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic which has introduced an additional complexity to this estimation due to typical demand patterns being disrupted. This study explores the ability of machine learning methods to generate accurate patient presentations at two large urgent care clinics located in Auckland, New Zealand. A number of machine learning algorithms were explored in order to determine the most effective technique for this problem domain, with the task of making forecasts of daily patient demand three months in advance. The study also performed an in-depth analysis into the model behaviour in respect to the exploration of which features are most effective at predicting demand and which features are capable of adaptation to the volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. The results showed that ensemble-based methods delivered the most accurate and consistent solutions on average, generating improvements in the range of 23%-27% over the existing in-house methods for estimating the daily demand.","output":"Forecasting Patient Demand at Urgent Care Clinics using Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 develops well in the oral mucosa because, it is the first contact area with the virus. The oral mucosa is highly expressed with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and makes the virus replicated in the epithelial cells and produce both oral lesions and oral symptoms. This review aimed to describe the oral mucosal symptoms and lesions related to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients that have been reported around the world. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search was performed on PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar, from February to October 5, 2020, focusing on COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) oral lesions and oral symptoms. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Eighteen studies were identified with a total of 25 cases describing the oral symptoms and oral mucosal lesions of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The oral symptoms related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection included dysgeusia, ageusia, a burning mouth sensation, a dry mouth and severe halitosis. The oral mucosal lesions varied from ulceration and depapilation to pseudomembranous, maculae, nodules and plaque. The mucosal lesions related to the skin lesions were in the form of crusty lips, multiple ulcerations and rashes, targeted lesions, blisters and vesiculobullous lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the oral cavity are non-specific. The oral mucosal lesions that occur mimic the Herpes zoster virus infection, the Herpes simplex virus infection, Varicella and hand, foot and mouth disease, and the oral mucosal lesions with the skin manifestations (e.g. erythema multiforme).","output":"Oral mucosal lesions and oral symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation status is crucial for the treatment planning of lung cancer. The gold standard for detecting EGFR mutation status relies on invasive tumor biopsy and expensive gene sequencing. Recently, computed tomography (CT) images and deep learning have shown promising results in non-invasively predicting EGFR mutation in lung cancer. However, CT scanning parameters such as slice thickness vary largely between different scanners and centers, making the deep learning models very sensitive to noise and therefore not robust in clinical practice. In this study, we propose a novel QuarterNetadaptive model to predict EGFR mutation in lung cancer, which is robust to CT images of different thicknesses. We propose two components: 1) a quarter-split network to sequentially learn local lung features from different lung lobes and global lung features; 2) a domain adaptive strategy to learn CT thickness-invariant features. Furthermore, we collected a large dataset including 1413 patients with both EGFR gene sequencing and CT images of various thicknesses to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Finally, the QuarterNetadaptive model achieved AUC over 0.88 regarding CT images of different thicknesses, which improves largely than state-of-the-art methods.Clinical relevance-We proposed a non-invasive model to detect EGFR gene mutation in lung cancer, which is robust to CT images of different thicknesses and can assist lung cancer treatment planning.","output":"A Quarter-split Domain-adaptive Network for EGFR Gene Mutation Prediction in Lung Cancer by Standardizing Heterogeneous CT image."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genetic recombination is a major evolutionary mechanism among RNA viruses, and it is common in coronaviruses, including those infecting humans. A few SARS-CoV-2 recombinants have been reported to date whose genome harbored combinations of mutations from different mutants or variants, but a single patients sample was analyzed, and the virus was not isolated. Here, we re-port the gradual creation of a hybrid genome of B.1.160 and Alpha variants in a lymphoma patient chronically infected for 14 months, and we isolated the recombinant virus. The hybrid genome was obtained by next-generation sequencing, and recombination sites were confirmed by PCR. This consisted of a parental B.1.160 backbone interspersed with two fragments, including the spike gene, from an Alpha variant. Analysis of seven sequential samples from the patient decoded the recombination steps, including the initial infection with a B.1.160 variant, then a concurrent infec-tion with this variant and an Alpha variant, the generation of hybrid genomes, and eventually the emergence of a predominant recombinant virus isolated at the end of the patients follow-up.

Interferon-beta 1a (IFN- 1a) has been used to treat patients with COVID-19. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of high-dose IFN- 1a compared to low dose IFN- 1a in moderate to severe COVID-19 cases. Methods: In this randomized, controlled, and clinical trial, eligible patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were randomly assigned to receive one of the two following therapeutic regimens: The intervention group was treated with high-dose IFN- 1a (Recigen) (Subcutaneous injections of 88g (24,000 IU) on days 1, 3, 6) + lopinavir /ritonavir (Kaletra) and the control group was treated with low-dose IFN- 1a (Recigen) (Subcutaneous injections of 44g (12,000 IU) on days 1, 3, 6) + lopinavir /ritonavir (Kaletra) (400mg/100 mg twice a day for 10 days, orally, in two groups). Result: A total of 168 COVID- 19 confirmed patients underwent randomization;83 were assigned to the intervention group and 85 were assigned to the control group. Median Time To Clinical Improvement (TTIC) for cases treated with low-dose IFN-1a was shorter than that for cases treated with high-dose IFN-1a (6 vs10 days). Due to differences between some baseline clinical factors between intervention and control group, we performed an adjusted analysis. The model failed to reach a significant difference between two groups. Conclusion: The use of high-dose IFN- 1a did not improve TTCI in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Also, it did not have any significant effect on mortality reduction compared with treating with low-dose IFN- 1a.

The lockdown measure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on our economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown measures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and epidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find optimal decision making to balance between economy and people's health during the outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases optimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the overall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take different decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their utility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through various additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model people's behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage between economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results provides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on when to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period of the outbreak.

Effective waste management in relation to a circular economy is presented. A sample of refuse derived fuel (RDF) with a high content of plastics was used for the experimental and calculation studies. Pyrolysis was selected as the best thermal decomposition process for this kind of wastes. Proximate and ultimate analyses were performed for RDF and its products. Pyrolysis was carried out using a pilot-scale reactor with acontinuous flow of 250 kg/h at 900 C. Thermogravimetric analysis was applied during the pyrolysis investigation and showed that the main decomposition of RDF took place in the temperature range of 250C500 C. The pyrolysis gas contained combustible compounds like CO (19.8%), H2 (13.2%), CH4 (18.9%) and C2H4 (7.1%), giving a high calorific value C 24.4 MJ/m3. The experimental results were implemented for numerical calculations. Chemkin-Pro software was applied to predict the chemical composition of the pyrolysis gas.

Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is one such method, in common use for decontamination of hospital rooms. Practical technologies designed to monitor UVGI ensure the delivery of sufficient doses for germicidal efficacy. Existing UVGI dosimeters rely on intermittent measurements of intensity as the basis for a numerical integration scheme that approximates dose. Traditional devices are ineffective, particularly with pulsed UVGI lamps that emit pulses of light with durations shorter than the interval of measurement. Here, we present a compact, accumulation mode dosimeter (AMD) that detects continuously, as opposed to intermittently, at single or multiple UVGI wavelengths. The AMD utilizes an array of photodiodes and supercapacitors to passively transduce and capture photocurrent generated by UVGI without the use of external power. The accumulated voltage across the supercapacitors then serves as a measure of UVGI dose. A key result is that sampling intervals of AMD do not constrain measurement accuracy. When implemented with a wireless transponder, AMD supports a light-adaptive sampling scheme designed to adjust the sampling interval to the intensity and period of UVGI exposure. Compared to time-based sampling schemes adopted by conventional sensors, light-adaptive approaches autonomously optimize battery life by minimizing current consumption during periods of low or no UVGI. Benchtop studies of the use of this technology with pulsed Xenon lamps (pulse similar to 5 ms) sampled at long intervals (>1s) highlight the key features of operation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve West African Dwarf (WAD) goats aged 6 months were randomly grouped and vaccinated within 2 weeks using a combination of PPRV lineage 1 vaccine (Nig/75), and bacterin from Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh) or Pasteurella multocida intranasally. The goats were observed for 3 weeks post-vaccination before comingled with a known infected WAD goat with apparent clinical signs of peste des petits ruminants and further observed clinically for 5 weeks post-infection (PI). Blood samples were taken for hematology while sera were assayed for antioxidants (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase, and superoxide dismutase) activities and pro-oxidants (malondialdehyde content, reduced glutathione, hydrogen peroxide generation(,) and myeloperoxidase) using spectrophotometric methods. Data were subjected to parametric statistics at =0.05 using GraphPad Prism version 21. RESULTS: Clinically, there were pyrexia, oculonasal discharge, diarrhea, anemia, leukopenia, and increased pro-oxidants in the unvaccinated goats, while moderate neutrophilia and leukocytosis were observed in PPRV and bacterin vaccinated goats. Two unvaccinated goats were weak and euthanized at 13 and 28 days PI. The goats vaccinated with PPRV and Mh showed better response clinically and biochemically.

Adjuvants are commonly used for antigen sparing in other vaccines, and thereby could potentially have major benefits to extend JJA supplies if they were to similarly enhance JJA VIT immunogenicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical and microbiological stability and murine immunogenicity of low-dose JJA VIT formulated with a novel polysaccharide adjuvant referred to as delta inulin or Advax?. Jack Jumper ant venom (JJAV) protein stability was assessed by UPLC-UV, SDS-PAGE, SDS-PAGE immunoblot, and ELISA inhibition. Diffraction light scattering was used to assess particle size distribution of Advax; pH and benzyl alcohol quantification by UPLC-UV were used to assess the physicochemical stability of JJAV diluent, and endotoxin content and preservative efficacy test was used to investigate the microbiological properties of the adjuvanted VIT formulation. To assess the effect of adjuvant on JJA venom immunogenicity, mice were immunised four times with JJAV alone or formulated with Advax adjuvant. JJA VIT formulated with Advax was found to be physicochemically and microbiologically stable for at least 2 days when stored at 4 and 25 C with a trend for an increase in allergenic potency observed beyond 2 days of storage. Low-dose JJAV formulated with Advax adjuvant induced significantly higher JJAV-specific IgG than a 5-fold higher dose of JJAV alone, consistent with a powerful allergen-sparing effect. The pharmaceutical data provides important guidance on the formulation, storage and use of JJA VIT formulated with Advax adjuvant, with the murine immunogenicity studies providing a strong rationale for a planned clinical trial to test the ability of Advax adjuvant to achieve 4-fold JJAV dose sparing in JJA-allergic human patients.","output":"Pharmaceutical and preclinical evaluation of Advax adjuvant as a dose-sparing strategy for ant venom immunotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objective of this study is to discuss the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable groups in Malaysia.

COVID-19 has a high transmission rate and is more lethal amongst the elderly, ethnic minorities and those with comorbidities. For these reasons, COVID-19 poses a particular challenge to our patients. Most have significant comorbidities, live communally, engage infrequently with primary care and take high-risk medications like clozapine. Many are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. During the Spring coronavirus wave, we found that unwell patients or their carers would contact our service for advice ahead of 111, primary care or emergency services. In response we designed a standard operating procedure to guide our response to possible cases. This aimed to ensure our advice and management for patients drew upon the latest emerging evidence. We audited our work and the burden of disease within our service until November 2020. METHOD: At a team level, we introduced same-day remote assessments structured around a standard operating procedure incorporating the latest primary care and national guidelines. At a trust level, treatment guidelines were amended permitting consultant discretion when deciding whether an urgent blood count was required for those unwell on clozapine, and routine blood count monitoring was extended to 3 months for eligible patients RESULT: By November 2020 we had only one confirmed case of COVID-19 on our caseload. This patient required ITU and recovered. Seven patients were judged suspected to have suffered COVID-19 and eight were possible cases. One supported living accommodation had a possible outbreak. CONCLUSION: We are surprised to have had just one confirmed case of COVID-19, despite the vulnerability of our cohort. The attentiveness of our patients and their carers to government guidelines will have contributed to this figure. They have shown remarkable resilience. This pandemic has prompted trust-wide changes to clozapine monitoring and perhaps a permanently less intensive monitoring regime for some patients. That our patients contacted our team ahead of 111, primary care or emergency services may reflect the close trust they place in us to support them through difficulty.

Such debates are less well recognised in health-related disciplines, particularly public health, who remain at earlier stages of valuing and understanding qualitative research. Drawing on personal experiences and methodological reflections gathered from a qualitative study, undertaken with young people over the course of 16 months during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, UK, the aim of this article is to offer further insight into the impact of researcher emotion, by specifically focussing on longitudinal, diary-based methods. My reflections are framed as three overlapping and intersecting themes. First, that qualitative longitudinal methods (and diary studies in particular) have enormous potential to curate rich emotional narratives. Second, that despite these positives, there are tensions or conflicting dynamics in using a method which helps to explore young people's emotions but also involves emotional labour for the researcher. Third, that greater attention should be paid to ensuring ethical care for researchers, particularly those engaging with qualitative longitudinal and/or creative methods. Such strategies should not solely rely on self-care and must be considered at institutional or funding body level. To this end, my personal experiences and reflections, as well as those from previous offerings, are used here to underpin a framework for researchers or research teams embarking upon novel qualitative longitudinal methods: 1. Do not underestimate emotional burden. 2. Ensure meaningful debriefing is available. 3. Establish boundaries. 4. Make space for emotion throughout fieldwork as well as during analysis and writing ('entering and exiting the field').

Meanwhile, these professionals began to develop their activities in an often-improvised workspace - many of them have also been caring for their children and doing household chores. We have even observed a decline in student performance with remote teaching, as class duration reduced and students lacked access to laboratories for practical classes. In our view, if the Brazilian government does not invest in improving the quality of remote education and internet access for the population amid the ongoing pandemic, an increasing number of teachers and researchers will develop irreversible health problems due to the precariousness of remote teaching and work.","output":"Being a professor and researcher during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Testing individuals for pathogens can affect the spread of epidemics. Understanding how individual-level processes of sampling and reporting test results can affect community- or population-level spread is a dynamical modeling question. The effect of testing processes on epidemic dynamics depends on factors underlying implementation, particularly testing intensity and on whom testing is focused. Here, we use a simple model to explore how the individual-level effects of testing might directly impact population-level spread. Our model development was motivated by the COVID-19 epidemic, but has generic epidemiological and testing structures. To the classic SIR framework we have added a per capita testing intensity, and compartment-specific testing weights, which can be adjusted to reflect different testing emphases -- surveillance, diagnosis, or control. We derive an analytic expression for the relative reduction in the basic reproductive number due to testing, test-reporting and related isolation behaviours. Intensive testing and fast test reporting are expected to be beneficial at the community level because they can provide a rapid assessment of the situation, identify hot spots, and may enable rapid contact-tracing. Direct effects of fast testing at the individual level are less clear, and may depend on how individuals' behaviour is affected by testing information. Our simple model shows that under some circumstances both increased testing intensity and faster test reporting can reduce the effectiveness of control, and allows us to explore the conditions under which this occurs. Conversely, we find that focusing testing on infected individuals always acts to increase effectiveness of control.","output":"Testing and Isolation Efficacy: Insights from a Simple Epidemic Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) measures on the lives and psychosocial well-being of persons with epilepsy (PWE) during the third trimester of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A structured questionnaire investigating different aspects of the lives and psychosocial well-being of PWE during the COVID-19 pandemic was developed. Persons with epilepsy were invited via social media to anonymously respond to a secure web-based online questionnaire (www.icpcovid.com). Responses were collected between July 26th and December 3rd, 2020. Hospital anxiety and depression scales (HADS) were used to screen respondents for depression (HADS-D) and anxiety (HADS-A). RESULTS: Responses of 407 PWE were included in the analysis; 304 (74.7%) respondents were female and 245 (60.2%) living in Europe, 157 (38.6%) in South America, and 5 (1.2%) in Canada. Seventy-six (18.7%) reported a decrease of income during the COVID-19 lockdown, and 122 (30.0%) experienced difficulties in obtaining anti-seizure medication (ASM), mostly (72/122, 59.0%) due to unavailability. Seizure frequency increased in 122 (30.0%); 295 (72.5%) screened positive for anxiety, and 159 (39.1%) for depression. Hundred eighty-eight (46.2%) reported reluctance to seek medical care; 27.3% believed that epilepsy was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 disease. Forty-six (74.2%) of 62 PWE who were followed up by telephone or video consult were satisfied with this consult. Fifty-five respondents, most (89.1%) of whom were from Europe, had also participated in a previous survey during the early months of the pandemic. In this subgroup, although there was no difference in prevalence of a positive screening for depression or anxiety, mean scores on HADS-A and HADS-D increased from 6.65  3.99 to 7.27  4.01 (p = 0.418), and from 5.84  4.43 to 6.60  4.45 (p = 0.371), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the psychosocial and somatic well-being of PWE. To minimize this impact, ensuring uninterrupted access to ASM is essential. Teleconsultations are valid alternatives for continued follow-up, but should include attention to psychosocial well-being. Persons with epilepsy should be more actively informed that epilepsy is not a risk factor for developing (more severe) COVID-19 disease.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the lives and psychosocial well-being of persons with epilepsy during the third trimester of the pandemic: Results from an international, online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Several months into the COVID-19 pandemic, reassessing intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, specifically with regional impact on diverse populations, should be a priority for hospitals planning for critical care resource allocation. In our study, we reviewed the impact of COVID-19 on a community hospital serving an urban region, comparing the sociodemographic distribution of ICU admissions before and during the pandemic. Methods: : We executed a time sensitive analysis to see if COVID-19 ICU admissions reflect regional sociodemographic populations as well as ICU admission trends prior to the current pandemic. Collected sociodemographic variables included sex, race, ethnicity, and age of adult patients (age 18 and older) admitted to the hospitals medical and cardiac ICUs, which were converted to COVID-19 ICUs. The time period selected was 18-months, which was then dichotomized into pre-COVID-19 admissions (December 1, 2018 to March 13, 2020) and COVID-19 ICU admissions (March 14, 2020 to May 31, 2020). Variables were compared using Fishers exact tests and Wilcoxon tests when appropriate. Results: : During the 18-month period, 1861 patients were admitted to the aforementioned ICUs. The mean age of the 1861 patients was 62.75 + 15.57 years old, with the majority of these patients being male (52.23%), White (64.43%), and non-Hispanic/Latinx (95.75%). There were differences in racial and ethnic distribution comparing pre-COVID-19 admissions to the COVID-19 admissions. Compared to pre-COVID-19 ICU admissions, there was an increase in African American versus White admissions (p=0.01) and an increase in Hispanic/Latinx versus non-Hispanic/Latinx admissions (p<0.01), during the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: During the first three months of admissions to COVID-19 ICUs, there was a rise in admissions among Hispanic/Latinx and African-American patients, while non-Hispanic/Latinx and White patient admissions declined compared to the previous pre-COVID year. These findings support development of strategies to enhance allocation of resources to bolster novel, equitable strategies to mitigate the incidence of COVID-19 in minority populations.","output":"Comparing COVID-19 Critical Care Admissions by Minority Populations to Pre-COVID-19 Critical Care Utilization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rickettsia rickettsii, the etiological agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), a life-threatening tick-borne disease that affects humans and various animal species, has been recognized in medicine and science for more than 100 years. Isolate-dependent differences in virulence of R. rickettsii have been documented for many decades; nonetheless, the specific genetic and phenotypic factors responsible for these differences have not been characterized. Using in vivo and in vitro methods, we identified multiple phenotypic differences among six geographically distinct isolates of R. rickettsii, representing isolates from the United States, Costa Rica, and Brazil. Aggregate phenotypic data, derived from growth in Vero E6 cells and from clinical and pathological characteristics following infection of male guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), allowed separation of these isolates into three categories: nonvirulent (Iowa), mildly virulent (Sawtooth and Gila), and highly virulent (Sheila Smith(T), Costa Rica, and Taia?u). Transcriptional profiles of 11 recognized or putative virulence factors confirmed the isolate-dependent differences between mildly and highly virulent isolates. These data corroborate previous qualitative assessments of strain virulence and suggest further that a critical and previously underappreciated balance between bacterial growth and host immune response could leverage strain pathogenicity. Also, this work provides insight into isolate-specific microbiological factors that contribute to the outcome of RMSF and confirms the hypothesis that distinct rickettsial isolates also differ phenotypically, which could influence the severity of disease in vertebrate hosts.","output":"Isolate-Dependent Differences in Clinical, Pathological, and Transcriptional Profiles following In Vitro and In Vivo Infections with Rickettsia rickettsii"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study examined the roles of population aging and national development level in affecting different phases of novel coronavirus disease development with a view to advancing preparedness and corresponding policy Methods: Regression analysis was conducted using multisource data from the World Bank and Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard Results: Population aging is positively associated with confirmed cases of day-10, day-20, and day-30 The positive association between population aging and death does not emerge until day-20 Countries with a higher proportion of older males face higher risks of death Countries with a higher proportion of males aged 70-74 years are at the highest risk of confirmed cases National development level is not associated with confirmed cases, but developing countries face significantly higher risks of death of day-10 and day-20 Conclusion: Prevention and control policies for older adults and underdeveloped areas and sex differences need to be studied","output":"Global Population Aging, National Development Level, and Vulnerability to the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The RECQ family of DNA helicases is a conserved group of enzymes that are important for maintaining genomic integrity.

This current situation has carved innovative ways like online teaching to counter the challenges of the pandemic faced by a surgical resident. However, online teaching is not complimentary to bedside teaching which is a traditional practice. Therefore, we designed this study to assess the residents' perceptive towards online learning as a mode of education which is extensively implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic at our centre. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional survey. An online Google survey was circulated among junior residents in the department of General Surgery. This survey included residents' demographic profile, effect on working hours, their perception with online teaching, and effect on their surgical training during the COVID 19 pandemic. Results: A total of 95 junior residents participated in this study. Surgical training and teaching was rigorously affected according to most of them and they also believe they have lost crucial training time in their tenure as a surgical resident. A majority found the communication with the faculty during online teaching adequate; however, the main drawback of online classes was the lack of clinical exposure and practical experience. Only 4.2% preferred 100% online teaching in future. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic has affected surgical training much more as compared to other medical fields.

Methods and Results: Included were 14,159 participants of the Kailuan study with assessment of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) from 2010 to 2015, and free of diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease at baseline. FBG and baPWV were repeatedly measured at baseline and follow-ups. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of incident diabetes across baseline baPWV groups: <1,400 cm/s (ref), 1,400 {less than or equal to} baPWV < 1,800 cm/s, and {greater than or equal to}1,800cm/s. Path analysis was used to analyze the possible temporal causal relationship between baPWV and FBG, among 8,956 participants with repeated assessment of baPWV and FBG twice in 2010-2017. The mean baseline age of the observed population was 48.3{plus minus}12.0 years. During mean 3.72 years of follow-up, 979 incident diabetes cases were identified.

We surveyed 1556 Chinese people in April 2020 (757 people in Hubei Province, the pandemic epicenter in China, and 799 in other regions of China where the pandemic is relatively not severe). A multiple-group structural equation modeling analysis found significant total effects between perceived threat of COVID-19 and aggressive tendencies during the pandemic in both regional groups, and the effect between them was mainly achieved through the mediating roles of sense of control and powerlessness during the pandemic. For all participants, negative coping strategies significantly aggravated the association between perceived threat of COVID-19 and aggressive tendencies during the pandemic, but the buffers were different across regions of outbreak severity. For participants in other regions where the pandemic is relatively not severe, positive coping strategies could mitigate the association between perceived threat of COVID-19 and aggressions. However, for participants in Hubei Province, the epicenter of China's pandemic, higher life satisfaction was more effective in buffering. These findings extend the possible consequences of the perceived COVID-19 threat and suggest that improving the life satisfaction of residents in areas with severe outbreaks is more effective in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19.

In this study, we developed a robust in vitro nonradioactive primer extension assay to quantitatively evaluate the efficiency of incorporation of nucleotide analogs by SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Our results show that many nucleotide analogs can be incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and that the incorporation of some of them leads to chain termination. The discrimination values of nucleotide analogs over those of natural nucleotides were measured to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. In agreement with the data published in the literature, we found that the incorporation efficiency of remdesivir-TP is higher than that of ATP and incorporation of remdesivir-TP caused delayed chain termination, which can be overcome by higher concentrations of the next nucleotide to be incorporated. Our data also showed that the delayed chain termination pattern caused by remdesivir-TP incorporation is different for different template sequences. Multiple incorporations of remdesivir-TP caused chain termination under our assay conditions. Incorporation of sofosbuvir-TP is very low, suggesting that sofosbuvir may not be very effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a comparison, 2-C-methyl-GTP can be incorporated into RNA efficiently, and the derivative of 2-C-methyl-GTP may have therapeutic application in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. This report provides a simple screening method that should be useful for evaluating nucleotide-based drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and for studying the mechanism of action of selected nucleotide analogs.","output":"Development of a Simple In Vitro Assay To Identify and Evaluate Nucleotide Analogs against SARS-CoV-2 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyzed the economic benefits versus safety risks of sharing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) vials during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample of this study included 20 patients hospitalized in our clinic diagnosed with Covid-19 via PCR modality and 20 healthy volunteers of similar age and sex. Bilateral middle cerebral arteries were investigated with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Basal cerebral blood flow velocities and vasomotor reactivity rates were determined and statistically compared. RESULTS: When patient and control groups were compared, the mean blood flow velocity was found to be higher in Covid-19 patients than in the healthy volunteers and it was statistically significant (P = 0.00). The mean vasomotor reactivity rates values were found to be lower in the Covid-19 group than the healthy group and was also statistically significant (P = 0.00).

Thus, we aimed to explore TCM characteristics of clinical efficacy to NCP, as well as to optimize Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD) and the recommended formulas to NCP by National Health Commission (NHC). METHODS: Chinese medical sciences theory and clinical application of TCM were analyzed. A total of 54 NCP patients were observed in a hospital from Wuhan, whose clinical characteristics and utilization of Chinese Medicines (CMs) were described. Paired t test was used to measure the change of patients hemogram during hospitalization period, indicating the effect of CMs. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to explore the factors affecting the length of hospital stay. Network pharmacology analysis was applied to figure out the performance of NHC-recommended formulas of five disease stages at levels of compounds, targets and pathways. RESULT: The average length of hospital stay was 8.96 days. Patients over 45 stayed 9.79 days in hospital in average, longer than 7.64 days of patients under 45. Comparing the hemograms between admission and discharge of hospital, the number of leukocytes, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet increased, while the numbers of erythrocytes, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit decreased. According to the standard coefficients of regression, the factor affecting the length of stay for the most was CMs in category of invigorating spleen and removing dampness (ISRD), followed by administrating CMs, male, and cough. Thirty-two CMs were screened after deleting duplication from QFPDD and NHC-recommended formulas. Compound quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, acacetin etc., were all involved in the treatment of various disease stages on the compound level both in generality and individuality. CONCLUSION: TCM has a systemic theoretical understanding on the pathological evolution and a positive clinical efficacy on NCP. The CMs of ISRD improved patients recovery, suggesting the importance of regulating intestinal function and keeping microenvironmental balance in TCM treatment of NCP. The active compounds from QFPDD and NHC-recommended formulas contribute to recovery of varied disease progresses during TCM treating NCP.","output":"Treatment efficacy analysis of traditional Chinese medicine for novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19): an empirical study from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Moeten we iets met dat coronavirus? vroeg een collega op 28 januari 2020 per mail.

Teledermatology has been proposed to expand access to dermatologic care for children. We report our experience with a physician-to-physician store-and-forward teledermatology service (eConsults), focusing on patient and consult characteristics and their relationship with teledermatologist confidence and follow-up recommendations as well as clinical outcomes. METHODS We reviewed electronic health records of all pediatric patients referred through eConsults at the Massachusetts General Hospital from 1/13/2020 to 7/17/2020. We assessed pediatrician and parental receptiveness with a confidential survey. RESULTS A total of 302 referrals (median patient age 4.6 years (IQR 0.6-12); 54% female) and 310 cases were completed in 1.8 days on average (SD = 1.2). Teledermatologists rated their confidence as definite and moderate in 51.3% and 39.4% cases, respectively. Teledermatologists felt comfortable managing rashes remotely, but patients with alopecia, pigmented and vascular lesions, and warts frequently required formal dermatology evaluation. Among patients seen subsequently, full concordance was seen for 70.1% of diagnoses and 74.4% of management recommendations. All responding pediatricians were satisfied with the service, and 97.5% felt that the parents were receptive to it. CONCLUSIONS Our study supports the growing evidence that store-and-forward teledermatology can quickly and effectively provide the access to pediatric dermatologic care and is well received by pediatricians and parents. To maximize cost-effectiveness of store-and-forward teledermatology, dermatologists should work with referring providers to improve the quality of submitted photographs and patient history as well as advise in-person referrals for cases likely to require further follow-up.","output":"Evaluation of electronic consults for outpatient pediatric patients with dermatologic complaints."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper pays attention to colonial strategies that were deployed to fight against the influenza pandemic among the Asante of Ghana.

With its relatively short lifespan, Drosophila also is an organism of choice for aging studies. Despite numerous advantages that this model offers, Drosophila has not been used to its full potential to investigate the response of the aged host to viral infection. Here, we show that, in comparison to younger flies, aged Drosophila succumb more rapidly to infection with the RNA-containing Flock House virus due to an age-dependent defect in disease tolerance. Relative to younger individuals, we find that older Drosophila mount transcriptional responses characterized by differential regulation of more genes and genes regulated to a greater extent. We show that loss of disease tolerance to Flock House virus with age associates with a stronger regulation of genes involved in apoptosis, some genes of the Drosophila immune deficiency NF-kB pathway, and genes whose products function in mitochondria and mitochondrial respiration.

Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 also interacts with host proteins to pave its entry into host cells. Therefore, to understand the behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 and design of effective antiviral drugs, host-virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs) can be very useful. In this regard, we have initially created a human-SARS-CoV-2 PPI database from existing works in the literature which has resulted in 7085 unique PPIs. Subsequently, we have identified at most 10 proteins with highest degrees viz. hub proteins from interacting human proteins for individual virus protein. The identification of these hub proteins is important as they are connected to most of the other human proteins. Consequently, when they get affected, the potential diseases are triggered in the corresponding pathways, thereby leading to comorbidities. Furthermore, the biological significance of the identified hub proteins is shown using KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis. KEGG pathway analysis is also essential for identifying the pathways leading to comorbidities. Among others, SARS-CoV-2 proteins viz. NSP2, NSP5, Envelope and ORF10 interacting with human hub proteins like COX4I1, COX5A, COX5B, NDUFS1, CANX, HSP90AA1 and TP53 lead to comorbidities. Such comorbidities are Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, HTLV-1 infection, prostate cancer and viral carcinogenesis. Subsequently, using Enrichr tool possible repurposable drugs which target the human hub proteins are reported in this paper as well.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the rapid adoption and expansion of virtual care technologies. Although the intense and prolonged nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has renewed peoples interest in health systems resilience, which includes how services adapt or transform in response to shocks, evidence regarding the role of virtual care technologies in health systems resilience is scarce. OBJECTIVE: At Toronto General Hospital in Ontario, Canada, the rapid virtualization of cardiac care began on March 9, 2020, as a response to the pandemic. The objective of this study was to understand peoples experiences with and the barriers and facilitators of the rapid virtualization and expansion of cardiac care resulting from the pandemic. METHODS: A single-case study was conducted with 3 embedded units of analysis. Patients, clinicians, and staff were recruited purposively from an existing mobile, phone-based telemonitoring program at a heart function clinic in Toronto, Canada. Individual, semistructured phone interviews were conducted by two researchers and transcribed verbatim. An inductive thematic analysis at the semantic level was used to analyze transcripts and develop themes. RESULTS: A total of 29 participants were interviewed, including patients (n=16), clinicians (n=9), and staff (n=4). The following five themes were identified: (1) patient safety as a catalyst for virtual care adoption; (2) piecemeal virtual care solutions; (3) confronting new roles and workloads; (4) missing pieces in virtual care; and (5) the inequity paradox. The motivation to protect patient safety and a piecemeal approach to virtual care adoption facilitated the absorptive and adaptive resilience of cardiac care during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, ad hoc changes to clinic roles and workflows, challenges in building relationships through remote methods, and widened inequities were barriers that threatened virtual care sustainment. CONCLUSIONS: We contend that sustaining virtual care hinges upon transformative actions (rather than adaptive actions) that strengthen health systems so that they can face the dynamic and emergent challenges associated with COVID-19 and other shocks. Based on the barriers and facilitators we identified, we present the lessons we learned and recommend transformations for sustaining virtual care during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The Resilience of Cardiac Care Through Virtualized Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Case Study of a Heart Function Clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research suggests there could be an increase in the number of COVID-19-related psychosis episodes during the pandemic outbreak This case series outlines the clinical presentation of first-onset psychosis in three older adults and their treatment in the 30 days following their initial admission The authors postulate that these COVID-19-related psychoses are qualitatively different to psychoses prior to the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"First-onset psychosis in older adults: social isolation influence during COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Adaptive COVID Treatment Trial-2 (ACTT-2) found that baricitinib in combination with remdesivir therapy (BCT) sped recovery in hospitalized COVID-19 patients versus remdesivir monotherapy (RMT).

METHODS: We characterized the clinical trajectories of 891 ACTT-2 participants requiring supplemental oxygen or higher levels of respiratory support at enrollment. We estimated the effect of BCT on cumulative incidence of clinical improvement and deterioration using competing risks models. We developed multistate models (MSM) to estimate the effect of BCT on clinical improvement and deterioration, and on utilization of respiratory therapies. RESULTS: BCT resulted in more linear improvement and lower incidence of clinical deterioration compared with RMT (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58C0.95). The benefit was pronounced among participants enrolled on high-flow oxygen or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. In this group, BCT sped clinical improvement (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.99C1.51) while slowing clinical deterioration (HR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.48C1.02), which reduced the expected days in ordinal score (OS) 6 per 100 patients by 74 days (95% CI, -8C154) and the expected days in OS 7 per 100 patients by 161 days (95% CI, 46C291) compared with RMT.

Direct weighting and questionnaire survey were conducted in 112 randomly selected dormitory rooms. Totally 523 valid questionnaires were collected. It is found that the average waste generation was 0.275 kg/day/cap, in which residual waste accounted for 64% of total, followed by household food waste (29%), and recyclable waste (7%). Regressions based on ordinary least square method suggested that students attitude towards waste played the most important role in affecting the waste reduction with its elasticity ? 0.195. Lower educational level and better financial condition would lead to more waste generation, whose elasticity was 0.148 and 0.098 respectively. The influences of gender and major varied from waste types. Policies implications for university administration departments for sustainable waste and resource management include developing personalized and humanized waste management policies, enhancing environmental awareness through diverse educational activities, and expanding the publicity role of campus cultural activities on waste reduction.","output":"Influencing factors and reduction of domestic solid waste at university dormitory in Shanghai, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Literature regarding the outcomes of lower dosage peritoneal dialysis (PD) in treating acute kidney injury (AKI) among resource-limited setting is sparse. This study aims to compare the risk of mortality in patients with AKI receiving lower PD dosage and conventional intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) in Thailand. METHODS In a tertiary center in Thailand, a matched case-control study using propensity scores in patients with AKI was conducted to compare the outcomes between lower PD dosage (18 L per day for first two sessions, weekly Kt/V 2.2) and IHD (three times a week) from February 2015 to January 2016. The primary outcome was a 30-day in-hospital mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included dialysis dependence at 90 days. RESULTS Eighty-four patients were included (28 PD and 56 IHD). Patient characteristics were comparable between two treatment groups. Overall, the mean age was 58 years. Most of the patients were critically ill (87% need mechanical ventilator; mean acute physiological and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score: 25). The 30-day in-hospital mortality rate was similar between the PD and IHD patients (57% vs. 46%, p = 0.36). The dialysis dependence rate was also comparable at 90 days. The risk of death among AKI patients was higher in those with respiratory failure, higher APACHE II score, and starting dialysis with blood urea nitrogen greater than 70 mg dL-1.

Licorice is a common ingredient of several prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine which have been proved to inhibit infection of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). There are two preparations of licorice, Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata. However, it is unknown whether licorice or which preparation of licorice is effective against HRSV, nor is its active constituent. AIM OF THE STUDY: We tested the hypothesis that Radix Glycyrrhizae can effectively decrease HRSV-induced plaque formation in respiratory mucosal cell lines. We also tried to find out the active constituent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-HRSV activities of hot water extracts of preparations of licorice, glycyrrhizin and 18-glycyrrhetinic acid (18-GA), the active constituents of licorice, were examined by plaque reduction assay in both human upper (HEp-2) and low (A549) respiratory tract cell lines. Abilities of crude licorice to inhibit viral replication and to stimulate IFN- were evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. RESULTS: Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata dose-dependently inhibited HRSV-induced plaque formation in both HEp-2 and A549 cell lines (p<0.0001). The effect of Radix Glycyrrhizae was better than that of Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata on HEp-2 cells. However, there was no difference of their anti-HRSV effects on A549 cells. Besides, glycyrrhizin was ineffective at all. Nevertheless, 18-GA showed a potent anti-HRSV activity. Radix Glycyrrhizae was more effective when given before viral inoculation (p<0.0001) which may be due to its inhibition of viral attachment on (p<0.0001) and penetration (p<0.0001) into the host cells. The anti-HRSV activity of Radix Glycyrrhizae was further confirmed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. 300 g/ml Radix Glycyrrhizae markedly decreased the viral amounts within the cells and in the suspension. Radix Glycyrrhizae might further stimulate mucosal cells to secrete IFN- to counteract viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Both Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata are effective against HRSV infection on airway epithelial cells. Radix Glycyrrhizae inhibited HRSV mainly by preventing viral attachment, internalization, and by stimulating IFN secretion. 18-GA may be one of its active constituents.","output":"Water extract of licorice had anti-viral activity against human respiratory syncytial virus in human respiratory tract cell lines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 49-year-old male Japanese patient was admitted to our hospital under the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia For 5 days before admission, he had experienced various symptoms, including high fever, watery diarrhea, dyspnea, and cough, and he tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid The patient is a smoker who was on medication for hypertension A chest computed tomography scan showed bilateral multiple patchy ground-glass opacities Despite being treated with several therapeutic agents, he still exhibited dyspnea (oxygen saturation [SpO2] in ambient air: 88%), a high fever (axillary temperature: 39 &deg;C), and high blood pressure (148/98 mmHg) Because laboratory data revealed high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP;2 10 mg/dL) and urinary &beta;2-microglobulin (B2M;33,683 &micro;g/mL), the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab (TCZ;400 mg) was administered intravenously One day after injection, he was afebrile Four days after the TCZ injection, his CRP level dropped to 0 27 mg/dL, B2M level decreased to 3817 &micro;g/mL, and viral load became low No adverse drug reaction due to TCZ was observed The patient was discharged 15 days after admission The early administration of TCZ in this patient prevented the pneumonia and kidney injury caused by COVID-19 from progressing to hyperinflammation syndrome","output":"Successful Treatment of a COVID-19 Case with Pneumonia and Renal Injury Using Tocilizumab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a result of the rushed transition to remote teaching because of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers have suddenly been forced to design mobile-assisted language learning (MALL; m-learning) activities, mostly for the first time in their careers.

Collagen density maps were reconstructed from the DECT datasets and used to measure densities in regions of interest (ROIs) placed in the scapholunate (SL) ligament (dorsal, palmar, proximal), lunotriquetral (LT) ligament, and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) tendon, (n = 260 measurements). The presence of calcifications on standard CT images in these regions was assessed by a blinded reader.

Severe disease, termed COVID-19, involves acute respiratory deterioration that is frequently fatal. To understand the highly variable presentation, and identify biomarkers for disease severity, blood RNA from COVID-19 patient in an intensive care unit was analyzed by whole transcriptome RNA sequencing. Both SARS-CoV2 infection and the severity of COVID-19 syndrome were associated with up to 25-fold increased expression of neutrophil-related transcripts, such as neutrophil defensin 1 (DEFA1), and 3-5-fold reductions in T cell related transcripts such as the T cell receptor (TCR). The DEFA1 RNA level detected SARS-CoV2 viremia with 95.5% sensitivity, when viremia was measured by ddPCR of whole blood RNA. Purified CD15+ neutrophils from COVID-19 patients were increased in abundance and showed striking increases in nuclear DNA staining by DAPI. Concurrently, they showed >10-fold higher elastase activity than normal controls, and correcting for their increased abundance, still showed 5-fold higher elastase activity per cell. Despite higher CD15+ neutrophil elastase activity, elastase activity was extremely low in plasma from the same patients. Collectively, the data supports the model that increased neutrophil and decreased T cell activity is associated with increased COVID-19 severity, and suggests that blood DEFA1 RNA levels and neutrophil elastase activity, both involved in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), may be informative biomarkers of host immune activity after viral infection.","output":"RNA Sequencing in COVID-19 patients identifies neutrophil activation biomarkers as a promising diagnostic platform for infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study are to investigate how many advanced cancer patients became unconscious or non-communicative after pharmacological treatment for delirium, and to explore whether existing delirium assessment tools can successfully evaluate its severity at the end of life. METHODS This was a secondary analysis of a registry study that examined the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics for advanced cancer patients with delirium. A total of 818 patients were recruited from 39 specialized palliative care services in Japan. The severity of delirium was measured using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale-Palliative care version, the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98), and the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) on Day 3. Data from 302 patients with motor anxiety with an Agitation Distress Scale score 2 on Day 0 were analyzed for this study. The patients were categorized into four treatment response groups: complete response (CR: no agitation and fully communicative), partial response (PR: no/mild agitation and partially communicative), unconscious/non-communicative (UC), and no change (NC). RESULTS On Day 3, 29 (10%; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 7-13) and 2 (1%; 95% CI, 0-2) patients became unconscious and non-communicative, respectively.

Nirsevimab is a monoclonal antibody to the RSV fusion protein that has an extended half-life. The efficacy and safety of nirsevimab in healthy late-preterm and term infants are uncertain. METHODS We randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, infants who had been born at a gestational age of at least 35 weeks to receive a single intramuscular injection of nirsevimab or placebo before the start of an RSV season. The primary efficacy end point was medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection through 150 days after the injection. The secondary efficacy end point was hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection through 150 days after the injection. RESULTS A total of 1490 infants underwent randomization: 994 were assigned to the nirsevimab group and 496 to the placebo group. Medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection occurred in 12 infants (1.2%) in the nirsevimab group and in 25 infants (5.0%) in the placebo group; these findings correspond to an efficacy of 74.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.6 to 87.1; P<0.001) for nirsevimab. Hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection occurred in 6 infants (0.6%) in the nirsevimab group and in 8 infants (1.6%) in the placebo group (efficacy, 62.1%; 95% CI, -8.6 to 86.8; P = 0.07). Among infants with data available to day 361, antidrug antibodies after baseline were detected in 58 of 951 (6.1%) in the nirsevimab group and in 5 of 473 (1.1%) in the placebo group.

Nevertheless, the data on optimal fluid management strategies for those who develop critical illness remain sparse. Adding to the challenge, the fluid volume status of these patients has been found to be dynamic. Some present with several days of malaise, gastrointestinal symptoms, and consequent hypovolemia requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation, while a subset develop acute respiratory distress syndrome with renal dysfunction and lingering congestion necessitating restrictive fluid management. Accurate objective assessment of volume status allows physicians to tailor the fluid management goals throughout this wide spectrum of critical illness. Conventional point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) enables the reliable assessment of fluid status and reducing the staff exposure. However, due to specific characteristics of COVID-19 (e.g., rapidly expanding lung lesions), a single imaging method such as lung POCUS will have significant limitations. Herein, we suggest a Tri-POCUS approach that represents concurrent bedside assessment of the lungs, heart, and the venous system. This combinational approach is likely to overcome the limitations of the individual methods and provide a more precise evaluation of the volume status in critically ill patients with COVID-19.","output":"Need for Objective Assessment of Volume Status in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19: The Tri-POCUS Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Line dancing is one of the most practiced dance styles by adults and seniors due to the ease of execution of choreography. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic prolonging the restrictions of physical and sports activities, the elderly population has been forced into increased sedentariness and social isolation, resulting in the development of symptoms of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of line dancing practice on the mental state of late second- and third-age dancers. The sample consisted of 14 Italian female dancers with an average age of 65 years old. The Geriatric Depression Scale was used to verify whether 3 months of LD classes were able to produce improvements. Paired Samples T-Test and effect size were performed to test the difference between pre- and post-training protocol. The result was statistically significant (p <0.05). Dancers improved their state of depression;in particular, they felt a better satisfaction in their life (d = 0.6), a greater interest in activities (d = 1), less boredom (d = 0.8), a good mood most of the time (d = 0.8), greater happiness throughout the day (d = 0.7), and the perception of a wonderful life (d = 0.5).

OBJECTIVE To examine relationships between suicide and acute inpatient psychiatric bed occupancy and other community, hospital and patient factors. METHODS Retrospective cohort study using administrative and publicly available data for contextual community factors. The study sample included all veterans enrolled in VHA primary care in 2011-2016 associated with 111 VHA hospitals with acute inpatient psychiatric units. Acute psychiatric bed occupancy, as a measure of access to care, was the main exposure of interest and was categorised by quarter as per cent occupied using thresholds of 85%, 85.1%-90%, 90.1%-95% and >95%. Hospital-level analyses were conducted using generalised linear mixed models with random intercepts for hospital, modelling number of suicides by quarter with a negative binomial distribution. RESULTS From 2011 to 2016, the national incidence of suicide among enrolled veterans increased from 39.7 to 41.6 per 100 000 person-years. VHA psychiatric bed occupancy decreased from a mean of 68.2% (IQR 56.5%-82.2%) to 65.4% (IQR 53.9%-79.9%). VHA hospitals with the highest occupancy (>95%) in a quarter compared with 85% had an adjusted incident rate ratio (IRR) for suicide of 1.10 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.19); no increased risk was observed for 85.1%-90% (IRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03) or 90.1%-95% (IRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) compared with 85% occupancy. Of hospital and community variables, suicide risk was not associated with number of VHA or non-VHA psychiatric beds or amount spent on community mental health. Suicide risk increased by age categories, seasons, geographic regions and over time. CONCLUSIONS High VHA hospital occupancy (>95%) was associated with a 10% increased suicide risk for veterans whereas absolute number of beds was not, suggesting occupancy is an important access measure. Future work should clarify optimal bed occupancy to meet acute psychiatric needs and ensure adequate bed distribution.","output":"Association between acute psychiatric bed availability in the Veterans Health Administration and veteran suicide risk: a retrospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper studies the macro situation of studying abroad in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and the motivations of Chinese international high school students studying abroad.

METHODS: We used bestCworst scaling (BWS) and composite time trade-off (cTTO) to determine the preference weights for ASCOT-Carer states in the general population. TTO values were applied to convert the BWS scores to utilities. The sample number was approximately 1000 for the BWS survey and 200 for the TTO survey. Whereas face-to-face surveys by computer-assisted interviewing were adopted for the TTO tasks, a web-based survey was used for the BWS tasks. In the BWS tasks, the ASCOT-Carer states were presented, and the best, worst, second best, and second worst domains in a profile were selected. A mixed logit model was applied to the BWS data. RESULTS: The respondents background was similar to that of the general population, although the number of people in the age and sex categories was equal. The preference weights for calculating the utilities of the ASCOT-Carer states were estimated. The estimated utilities of the ASCOT-Carer states were distributed between 1 and 0.02.

The objective of this case series is to describe early neonatal outcomes and inpatient management in U.S. hospitals. STUDY DESIGN: We solicited cases of mother-infant dyads affected by novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the Better Outcomes through Research for Newborns (BORN) Network members. Using a structured case template, participating sites contributed deidentified, retrospective birth hospitalization data for neonates &#8805;35 weeks of gestation at birth with mothers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before delivery. We describe demographic and clinical characteristics, clinical management, and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: Sixteen U.S. hospitals contributed 70 cases. Birth hospitalizations were uncomplicated for 66 (94%) neonates in which 4 (6%) required admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. None required evaluation or treatment for infection, and all who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 were negative (n = 57). Half of the dyads were colocated (n = 34) and 40% directly breastfed (n = 28).

We aimed to characterize the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension and concurrent elevated left heart filling pressure in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. We hypothesized that a significant proportion of coronavirus disease 2019 patients has evidence of pulmonary hypertension associated with elevated left heart filling pressure on transthoracic echocardiography. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic tertiary-care center. PATIENTS: Hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients who underwent clinical transthoracic echocardiography. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The exposure variable of interest was right ventricular systolic pressure, calculated using the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. Pulmonary hypertension was defined as right ventricular systolic pressure greater than 40 mm Hg. Left heart filling pressure was estimated with Naguehs method for pulmonary artery occlusion pressure using E/e ratio, and normal was considered pulmonary artery occlusion pressure less than 16 mm Hg. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared between the patients with and without pulmonary hypertension. A total of 73 patients (median age 66 yr [57C75 yr]; 46% women) were included. Median right ventricular systolic pressure was 39 mm Hg (interquartile range, 32C50 mm Hg), and 36 patients (49.3%) had evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Patients with pulmonary hypertension were more likely to require ICU admission (86% vs 65%; p = 0.035) and have acute respiratory distress syndrome (72% vs 49%; p = 0.0053) than those without. In-hospital mortality was 26% for those with pulmonary hypertension compared with 14% for those without (p = 0.19). Patients with pulmonary hypertension had higher median-estimated pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (17.4 mm Hg [12.7C21.3 mm Hg] vs 12.1 mm Hg [10.0C14.1 mm Hg]; p = 0.0008), and elevated left heart filling pressure was present in 59% of those with pulmonary hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary hypertension is common in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Left ventricular filling pressure is elevated in over half of those with pulmonary hypertension and may represent a target to reduce right ventricular afterload and potentially improve outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019.","output":"Prevalence and Clinical Correlates of Echo-Estimated Right and Left Heart Filling Pressures in Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has caused the collapse of the Peruvian healthcare system, which could have caused errors in the registration of the death records in the N","output":"Demographic and Geographic COVID-19 Death Risk Factors in Peru.

Direct demonstration of this process nor definition of the entry pathway of Pi into SR are fully established. We show that Pi promoted Ca2+ release at concentrations below 10 mm and decreased it at higher concentrations. This decrease correlated well with that of [Ca2+ ]SR . Pre-treatment of permeabilized myofibers with 2 mm Cl- channel blocker 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (9AC) inhibited both effects of Pi . The biphasic dependence of Ca2+ release on [Pi ] is explained by a direct effect of Pi acting on the SR Ca2+ release channel, combined with the intra-SR precipitation of Ca2+ salts. 9AC effects demonstrates that Pi enters the SR via a Cl- pathway of as yet undefined molecular nature. ABSTRACT Fatiguing exercise causes hydrolysis of phosphocreatine, increasing the intracellular concentration of inorganic phosphate (Pi ). Pi diffuses into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where it is believed to forms insoluble Ca2+ salts, thus contributing to the impairment of Ca2+ release. Information on the Pi entrance pathway is still lacking. In amphibian muscles endowed with isoform 3 of the RyR channel, Ca2+ spark frequency is correlated with Ca2+ load of the SR and can be used to monitor this variable. We studied the effects of Pi on Ca2+ sparks in permeabilized fibres of the frog. Relative event frequency (f/fref ) rose with increasing [Pi ] reaching 2.541.6 at 5 mm and then decreased monotonically, reaching 0.090.03 at [Pi ] = 80 mm. Measurement of [Ca2+ ]SR confirmed a decrease correlated with spark frequency at high [Pi ]. A large [Ca2+ ]SR surge was observed upon Pi removal. Anion channels are a putative path for Pi into the SR. We tested the effect of chloride channel blocker 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (9AC) on Pi entrance. 400 m 9AC applied to the cytoplasm produced a non-significant increase in spark frequency and reduced the Pi effects on this parameter. Fibre treatment with 2 mm 9AC in the presence of high cytoplasmic Mg2+ suppressed Pi effects on [Ca2+ ]SR and spark frequency up to 55 mm Pi . These results suggest that chloride channels (or transporters) provide the main pathway of inorganic phosphate into the SR and confirm that it impairs Ca2+ release by accumulating and precipitating with Ca2+ inside the SR, thus contributing to myogenic fatigue.

Yet, there is no publicly available data on tests that could be missing infections. Complicating matters and furthering anxiety are specific instances of false-negative tests. METHODS: We developed a deep learning model to improve accuracy of reported cases and to precisely predict the disease from chest X-ray scans. Our model relied on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect structural abnormalities and disease categorization that were keys to uncovering hidden patterns. To do so, a transfer learning approach was deployed to perform detections from the chest anterior-posterior radiographs of patients. We used publicly available datasets to achieve this. RESULTS: Our results offer very high accuracy (96.3%) and loss (0.151 binary cross-entropy) using the public dataset consisting of patients from different countries worldwide. As the confusion matrix indicates, our model is able to accurately identify true negatives (74) and true positives (32); this deep learning model identified three cases of false-positive and one false-negative finding from the healthy patient scans.

Ultimately, the paper highlights the role of technology to help the participants navigate sudden crisis affecting a global online instructional team project. The adaptive instructional teaching strategies and technologies depicted in this study offer transformative potential for future developments in higher education. PRACTITIONER NOTES: : The modern workplace calls for cross\\\\cultural, digital collaboration skills, and this need has increased potentially after the impacts of the pandemic on moving a lot of work to remote settingspermanently. While instructional virtual teams are being used as part of diverse curricula to add an international, experiential element for students, universities still struggle helping students to acquire the whole spectrum of skills needed for the global digital workplace: virtual teamwork, project management, and comfort on working with digital business collaboration platforms. Virtual team research has studied impacts of the pandemic on organizational teams but there is little research on instructional online teams during the pandemic crisis. : This paper adds evidence\\\\based knowledge how virtual instructional teams, and their instructors navigated the broken connectivity situation when a global external health crisis forced students to transition from campuses to home environments in the middle of the collaboration project. It offers practical ideas how faculty used technology to connect with students and maintain class community in cases of inequal access to technology from home environments by using multiple platforms, and both, computer, and mobile enabled communication. It offers examples of student\\\\centered, coaching\\\\like teaching strategies and how these were applied when the global health crisis affected students in instructional teams. : The study offers implications for development of digital pedagogies for future; specifically, how to develop students' virtual intelligence and to promote intercultural awareness and collaboration skills in future higher education. The pandemic experiences shed additional light on the need to develop and acquire soft skills among students, for them to be able to navigate struggles and crisis in global, digital real workplace.","output":"Standing strong amid a pandemic: How a global online team project stands up to the public health crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the 5th February 2020 issue of Journal of Medical Virology a paper was published by Giovannetti et al., entitled \\"The first two cases of 2019-nCoV in Italy: where they come from?\\"1 .

No standards exist to characterize shock-absorbing healthcare flooring. This study explores two mechanical tests for impact force reduction and horizontal force required to move wheeled objects. An appropriately designed rubber underlay can reduce peak impact by 25% compared with 1% with standard vinyl. INTRODUCTION Severe falls often occur in hospitals and care homes. Shock-absorbing flooring is one potential solution to prevent fall-related injuries; however, no standards exist for characterizing flooring as an injury prevention measure. Shock-absorbing flooring use in high-risk settings may influence both patients (injury-saving potential) and staff (manoeuvring equipment). We aimed to explore two tests to characterize floors, to determine shock absorbency and horizontal pulling force required to move wheeled objects. METHODS Mechanical testing was performed according to the Canadian Standards Association Z325 Hip Protectors document. This test was developed for hip protectors but is applicable to compliant surfaces that form part of the floor. Tests were performed on commercially available floor materials (suitable for care settings) to assess the force required to initiate movement of a wheeled object across the floor. We explored the relationships between horizontal force required to pull wheeled objects, impact force, floor thickness, and core material. RESULTS Considerable differences were identified between floor samples in their ability to reduce the peak impact force (range 0.7-25%). A peak force reduction of up to 25% can be achieved with a specially designed rubber underlay. Horizontal pulling force increased with floor thickness but was lower for rubber floors. There was no direct relationship between impact attenuation and horizontal pulling force. Whilst thickness and core material explain some variations (66.5% for wheel movement; 82.3% for impact), other unmeasured factors clearly influence floor performance. CONCLUSIONS These results can inform the development of flooring and the establishment of standards needed to underpin practice, research, and development in this field.","output":"A comparison of floor surfaces for injury prevention in care settings: impact forces and horizontal pulling force required to move wheeled equipment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Group convolution has been widely used in deep learning community to achieve computation efficiency.

Although cluster 1 (i.e. Veneto) and 2 (i.e. Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna) included the most hit regions beyond Lombardy, this partition reflected differences in the efficacy of restrictions and testing strategies. Cluster 3 was heterogeneous and comprised regions where the epidemic started later and/or where it spread with the lowest intensity. Regions within cluster 4 were those where the epidemic started slightly after Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont, favoring timely adoption of control measures.

Such a serious external shock affects the distribution of economic rents, thus leading to potentially large institutional changes. Naturally, in the short term we are dealing with an economic crisis and a restriction of civil liberties in both autocratic and democratic countries, however, it is not known what the dynamics of institutional changes will be in the longer run. Aim: The main purpose of the article is to answer if the Covid-19 pandemic becomes a turning point that will determine the institutional system in developing countries for the next few decades. The first part of the article outlines the theory of institutional change, with particular emphasis on the role of external shocks. The next section presents studies on the socioeconomic impact of two major epidemics: The Black Death and the Great Influenza Pandemic. The third part conducts an assessment as to what extent the current pandemic may affect institutions in developing countries, by reference to the example of two countries: Tunisia and Cambodia. The analysis is conducted from the perspective of the new institutional economics. Results: If we look at the experiences from previous pandemics, current events and refer to the literature on the theory of institutional change, we can conclude that significant institutional changes caused by Covid-19 are unlikely. The process of institutional change is characterized by a specific complexity and changing dynamics. Nonetheless, it is the internal factors, reflecting the actions of people trying to maximize the benefits, which are the main cause of change in an institutional system. Therefore, the Covid-19 pandemic is more likely to strengthen the endogeneity of the process of institutional change, rather than change its course.","output":"The impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the institutional change in developing countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined the synthesis and processing of the polymerase polyprotein in RNA(-) temperature sensitive mutant of murine coronavirus strain A59. These temperature sensitive mutants of MHV-A59 synthesize viral RNA at the permissive temperature (33.0 degrees C), but are unable to synthesize viral RNA at the nonpermissive temperature (39.5 degrees C). The ts mutants have been mapped to five different complementation groups in the polymerase gene. The 5'-most complementation groups, Groups A and B, map to a region encoding an autoproteinase responsible for the cleavage of p28, the amino-terminal product of the polymerase polyprotein. We screened six temperature sensitive mutants to determine if there was an alteration in the proteolytic processing of the polymerase polyprotein, particularly in the cleavage of the p28 protein. Two mutants, tsNC9 and tsLA16, had altered proteolytic products at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. One Group B temperature sensitive mutant, designated tsNC11, was defective in the production of p28 protein at the nonpermissive temperature. To further localize the site of the mutation in tsNC11, RNA representing the 5'-most 5.3 kb region of the polymerase gene was transfected into tsNC11-infected cells and virus production monitored. The transfected RNA was able to complement the defect in tsNC11, resulting in viral RNA synthesis and production of viral particles at the nonpermissive temperature.

The review aimed to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence, process, and outcomes of OHCA. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, and pre-print websites was performed. Studies reporting comparative data on OHCA within the same jurisdiction, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Study quality was assessed based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Ten studies reporting data from 35,379 OHCA events were included. There was a 120% increase in OHCA events since the pandemic. Time from OHCA to ambulance arrival was longer during the pandemic (p = 0.036). While mortality (OR = 0.67, 95%-CI 0.49-0.91) and supraglottic airway use (OR = 0.36, 95%-CI 0.27-0.46) was higher during the pandemic, automated external defibrillator use (OR = 1.78 95%-CI 1.06-2.98), return of spontaneous circulation (OR = 1.63, 95%-CI 1.18-2.26) and intubation (OR = 1.87, 95%-CI 1.12-3.13) was more common before the pandemic. More patients survived to hospital admission (OR = 1.75, 95%-CI 1.42-2.17) and discharge (OR = 1.65, 95%-CI 1.28-2.12) before the pandemic. Bystander CPR (OR = 1.08, 95%-CI 0.86-1.35), unwitnessed OHCA (OR = 0.84, 95%-CI 0.66-1.07), paramedic-resuscitation attempts (OR = 1.19 95%-CI 1.00-1.42) and mechanical CPR device use (OR = 1.57 95%-CI 0.55-4.55) did not defer significantly.

Existing data suggests a reduced disease severity in comparison to B.1.617.2 (Delta). Differences in characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Germany during the Omicron period compared to Delta are not thoroughly studied. Surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) represents an integral part of infectious disease control in Germany. MethodsAdministrative data from 89 German Helios hospitals was retrospectively analysed. Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified by ICD-10-code U07.1 and SARI cases by ICD-10-codes J09-J22. COVID-19 cases were stratified by concomitant SARI. A nine-week observational period between December 6, 2021 and February 6, 2022 was defined and divided into three phases with respect to the dominating virus variant (Delta, Delta to Omicron transition, Omicron). Regression analyses adjusted for age, gender and Elixhauser comorbidities were applied to assess in-hospital patient outcomes. ResultsA total cohort of 4,494 inpatients was analysed. Patients in the Omicron dominance period were younger (mean age 61.6 vs. 47.8; p<0.01), more likely to be female (54.7% vs. 47.5%; p<0.01) and characterized by a lower comorbidity burden (mean Elixhauser comorbidity index 8.2 vs. 5.4; p<0.01). Comparing Delta and Omicron periods, patients were at significantly lower risk for intensive care treatment (adjusted odds ratio 0.64 [0.51-0.8]; p<0.001), mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio 0.38 [0.28-0.51]; p<0.001), and in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.42 [0.32-0.56]; p<0.001). This also applied to the separate COVID-SARI group. During the Delta to Omicron transition, case numbers of COVID-19 without SARI exceeded COVID-SARI. ConclusionPatient characteristics and outcomes differ during the Omicron dominance period as compared to Delta suggesting a reduced disease severity with Omicron infections.

Multiple saliva-based viral detection protocols use a direct-to-RT-qPCR approach that eliminates nucleic acid extraction but can reduce viral RNA detection sensitivity. To improve test sensitivity while maintaining speed, we developed a robotic nucleic acid extraction method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva samples with high throughput. Using this assay, the Free Asymptomatic Saliva Testing (IGI-FAST) research study on the UC Berkeley campus conducted 11,971 tests on supervised self-collected saliva samples and identified rare positive specimens containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA during a time of low infection prevalence. In an attempt to increase testing capacity, we further adapted our robotic extraction assay to process pooled saliva samples.

The aim of the study was to explore if Covid-19 myocardial involvement is the only contributor for New Onset Atrial Fibrillation (NOAF) in intubated ICU patients. Methods Consecutive intubated, Covid-19ARDS patients, were prospectively studied for factors triggering NOAF. Demographics, data on Covid-19 infection duration, severity of illness and ARDS are reported. Echocardiographic findings, troponin levels and secondary infection (sepsis/septic shock) data were collected on the day of AF and compared to the preceding days and/or ICU admission data. Comparison was also performed between NOAF and control group (no AF) on admission. Results Among 105 patients screened, 79 were eligible;nineteen presented NOAF (24%). Baseline characteristics did not differ between the NOAF and control groups. Troponin levels were mildly elevated upon ICU admission in both groups. NOAF occurred on the 18  4.8 days from Covid-19 symptoms onset, and the 8.5  2.1 ICU day. Seventeen patients in the NOAF group (89.5%) presented a septic secondary infection vs 25 (41.6%) in the control group (p < 0.001). In sixteen NOAF patients (84.2%), AF occurred concurrently with a secondary septic episode. Noradrenaline, lactate levels and inflammation biomarkers presented a gradual increase in the days preceding the AF day (all p < 0.05). Troponin increased compared to admission (p = 0.017). AF did not resolve or re-occurred if sepsis persisted. Upon ICU admission left ventricular ejection fraction was rather normal, yet, global longitudinal strain was equally impaired (< 16.5%) in 63% vs 78% in the NOAF and control groups, respectively. The right ventricle was mildly dilated, and 36 (45.6%) patients had pericardial effusion. Echocardiographic findings did not change on NOAF occurrence.

METHODS: This study recruited 179 patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease who had received a chest CT scan between March 14 and April 28, 2020. The participants were divided into three successive temporal groups based on their date of CT examination. The early (March 14-29), mid (March 30-April 13), and late (April 14-28) groups were compared regarding the presence and extent of pulmonary involvement and CT characteristics of lesions.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Household-based survey. PARTICIPANTS: 3063 individuals who participated in the 2017 South African Social Attitudes survey, a nationally representative, in-person survey of the non-institutionalised civilian adult population aged &#8805;16 years EXPOSURE: 'In the past 12 months, have you seen advertisements or promotions for e-cigarettes (including e-shisha, e-pipe) on any of the following media: newspapers/magazines, billboards, in the malls or any other source?' MAIN OUTCOMES: Beliefs and attitudes regarding e-cigarettes. FINDINGS: Participants' mean age was 37.7 years. Overall, 20.1% reported exposure to e-cigarette advertisements. By age, exposure was most prevalent among those aged 16-19 years (24.6%). Top sources of exposure among those exposed were stores, 40.7%; malls, 30.9%; and television, 32.5%. Of those aware of e-cigarettes, 61.2% believed 'e-cigarette advertisements and promotion may make adolescents think of smoking traditional cigarettes'; 62.7% believed that 'e-cigarette advertisements and promotions may make ex-smokers think of starting smoking cigarettes again'; and 59.5% supported the statement that 'e-cigarette smoking should be banned indoors just as traditional cigarette smoking'. Notably, teens aged 16-19 reported the lowest prevalence (49.0%) of those believing that 'e-cigarette advertisements and promotion may make adolescents think of smoking traditional cigarettes', whereas this percentage was highest among those aged 55-64 years (73.2%).

By promoting organizational value system, the leader can influence the work behavior and attitudes of the employees and results. In this context, the present book proposes to investigate and understand the influence of corporate leadership on the organizational culture and performance from multi-disciplinary perspective. In other words, the aim of this book is to provide a comprehensive and in-depth multi-perspective analysis and lies at the crossroads of different theories (e.g. leadership theories, agency, theory, resource dependency theory and positive accounting theory) from different disciplines (e.g. corporate finance, behavioral finance and management). From managerial perspective, for instance, leadership can shape culture by developing skills such as creating personal credibility and establishing trusted relationships. Thereby, leadership styles (transformational leadership, in particular) can build greater innovation and satisfactory organizational culture and lead to organizational effectiveness. Based on this crux, a leader can affect employees in achieving better organizational performance and influence business results (i.e. long-term financial performance). That is why, from this perspective, it is important to determine how leadership and management decisions and styles affect organizational culture and apprehend whether leadership influences (employee, organizational, financial) performance. From corporate finance perspective, it is interesting to investigate the impact of CEO/Director behavior on firm performance across the world based on different financial theories. This can lead to better apprehend the strategic role of CEO/Director for firm sustainability and provide bigger picture of CEO/Director role and practices around the world.

To elucidate its function in teleost fish, TRAF3 homologue of black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) has been cloned and characterized in this study. The open reading frame (ORF) of black carp TRAF3 (bcTRAF3) consists of 1722 nucleotides and bcTRAF3 contains 574 amino acids. bcTRAF3 protein migrated around 65 KDa in immunoblot analysis of both EPC and HEK293T cells. bcTRAF3 was identified as a cytosolic protein and suggested to form aggregates or be associated with vesicles scattering in the cytoplasm. It was interesting that both NF-B and IFN transcription was activated by bcTRAF3 in reporter assay. When co-expressed with black carp STING (bcSTING), bcTRAF3 was redistributed in the cytoplasm and its subcellular location overlapped with that of bcSTING no matter what the cells was infected with GCRV or not, which suggested the association between these two molecules. bcSTING-mediated IFN production was up-regulated by bcTRAF3 in a dose dependent manner in reporter assay.

Taken together, the data generated in this paper supported the conclusion that bcTRAF3 was recruited into host innate immune activation and positively regulated bcSTING-mediated antiviral signaling.","output":"TRAF3 enhances STING-mediated antiviral signaling during the innate immune activation of black carp"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic is limiting outdoor and community-based activities, especially for older adults owing to the requirement for self-isolation, potentially increasing prolonged sedentary behavior (SB). Given a poor tolerance for intense exercise, SB displacement with light intensity physical activity (LIPA) is a promising health enhancing alternative. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the effects of two different types of SB displacement on health outcomes in older adults and any differential impact of associated LIPA pattern. Method: 28 older women (age: 73  5 years, height: 1.60  0.07 m, weight: 67  10 kg, and BMI: 26.1  3.6 kg/m(2)) underwent overnight fasted dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) imaging, blood sampling, and functional assessments before being randomly allocated to one of two groups: (1) single continuous bout of 45C50 min LIPA daily (n = 14); or (2) SB fragmentation (SBF; ~48 min LIPA daily, 2 min LIPA for every 30 min of SB; n = 14). Compliance was systematically monitored using tri-axial accelerometery. All measures were taken at weeks 0 and 8. Results: Physical behavior significantly altered (decreased SB/increased LIPA; p < 0.05) and to a similar extent in both groups. We observed a significant reduction in serum triglycerides [p = 0.045, effect size (?(p)(2)) = 0.15; SBF: ?0.26  0.77 mmol/L, LIPA: ?0.26  0.51 mmol/L], improved 30 s sit-to-stand (STS) count (p = 0.002, ?(p)(2) = 0.32, 2  3 STS) and speed (p = 0.009, ?(p)(2) = 0.35, ?10  33%), as well as increased average handgrip strength (p = 0.001, ?(p)(2) = 0.45, 6  12%), and gait speed (p = 0.005, ?(p)(2) = 0.27, 0.09  0.16 m/s) in both groups. Interestingly, SBF caused a greater increase in peak handgrip strength (8  14%), compared to LIPA (2  10%; p = 0.04, ?(p)(2) = 0.38). Conclusion: SB displacement induced significant improvements in fasting triglycerides, gait speed, as-well as STS endurance/speed in older women. Frequent vs. continuous SB displacement also caused greater increases in handgrip strength. While both SB displacement protocols display promise as efficacious home-based interventions for self-isolating older adults, our results would suggest a physical functioning advantage of the SBF protocol for certain outcomes.","output":"The Effects of Displacing Sedentary Behavior With Two Distinct Patterns of Light Activity on Health Outcomes in Older Adults (Implications for COVID-19 Quarantine)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to characterize changes in waitlist and post-transplant outcomes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) patients bridged to heart transplantation under the 2018 adult heart allocation policy. METHODS: All adult patients listed for isolated heart transplantation from August 2016 to December 2020 were identified using the United Network for Organ Sharing database. Patients were stratified into Eras (Era 1 and Era 2) centered around the policy change on October 18, 2018. Competing risk regression was used to evaluate waitlist death or deterioration across Eras. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine associations between use of ECMO and 1-year post-transplant mortality within each Era. RESULTS: Of 8,902 heart transplants included in analysis, 339 (3.8%) were bridged with ECMO (Era 2: 6.1% vs Era 1: 1.2%, P<0.001). Patients bridged with ECMO in Era 2 were less frequently female (26.0% vs 42.0%, P = 0.02) and experienced shorter waitlist times (5 vs 11 days, P<0.001) along with a lower likelihood of waitlist death or deterioration (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.45, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.30C0.68, P<0.001) compared to those in Era 1. Use of ECMO was associated with increased post-transplant mortality at 1-year compared to all other transplants in Era 1 (hazard ratio 3.78, 95% CI 1.88C7.61, P < 0.001) but not Era 2.

DESIGN/SETTING A retrospective review of the electronic patient record of 61 hospital inpatients referred to the specialist palliative care team with swab-confirmed COVID-19 who subsequently died over a 1-month period. Intubated patients were excluded. RESULTS In all, 83% (40/48) of patients were prescribed opioids at a starting dose consistent with existing local guidelines. In seven of eight patients where higher doses were prescribed, this was on specialist palliative care team advice. Mean total opioid dose required in the last 24 h of life was 14 mg morphine subcutaneous equivalent, and mean total midazolam dose was 9.5 mg. For three patients in whom non-invasive ventilation was in place higher doses were used.

Methods: Patients diagnosed with MOGAD at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2013 to August 2021 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Age at disease onset, sex, comorbidities, laboratory tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were collected and analyzed. The association between risk factors and initial EDSS scores at disease onset was analyzed using logistic regression models and Spearman correlation analyses. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive ability of the uric acid and homocysteine (Hcy) levels for the severity of neurological dysfunction at the onset of MOGAD. Results: Sixty-seven patients (female, n=34; male, n=33) with first-attack MOGAD were included in this study. The mean age at onset was 26.43  18.22 years (range: 3-79 years). Among patients <18 years of age, the most common presenting symptoms were loss of vision (36.0%), and nausea and vomiting (24.0%), and the most common disease spectrum was acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (40.0%). Among patients aged 18 years, the most common presenting symptoms were loss of vision (35.7%), paresthesia (33.3%), and paralysis (26.2%), and the most common disease spectrum was optic neuritis (35.7%). The most common lesions were cortical gray matter/paracortical white matter lesions in both pediatric and adult patients.

The comparisons made between the two situations confirm that the economic repercussions remain moderate and Morocco will be able to face this disaster with even stricter or even more intelligent containment.","output":"The COVID-19: macroeconomics scenarii and role of containment in Morocco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enrollment remains high as the Biden administration proposes to fix the \\"family glitch\\" and tracks No Surprises Act litigation.","output":"Subsidy Cliff Looms; Fixing The Family Glitch"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solitude C the state of being alone and not physically with another C can be rewarding. The present research explored the potential benefits of solitude from a pragmatist approach: a ground-up, top-down perspective that is receptive to new knowledge but informed by theory. Participant recruitment was stratified by age and gender, and the sample involved 2,035 individuals including adolescents (13C16 years), adults (35C55 years), or older adults (65+ years). Data were analyzed with a mixed-methods approach. Coded themes from brief narratives about solitude were extracted, and their frequencies (i.e., their salience to participants) were compared across the lifespan. Themes were then correlated with two indicators of well-being in solitude: self-determined motivation for solitude and peaceful mood. Several prominent themes emerged when talking about time spent in solitude. With the exception of feeling competent in solitude, which was described frequently but consistently unrelated to self-reported well-being regardless of age, benefits of solitude tended to shift over the lifespan. Some qualities, such as a sense of autonomy (self-connection and reliance; absence of pressure), were salient and consequential for everyone, but increasingly so from adolescence to older adulthood. Older adults also reported feeling most peaceful in solitude and described their social connection and alienation less frequently, suggesting they see solitude and social time as more distinct states. Findings are discussed in light of existing work on solitude across the lifespan, and theoretical frameworks that spoke well to the data (e.g., self-determination theory).","output":"What Time Alone Offers: Narratives of Solitude From Adolescence to Older Adulthood"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fecal samples from suckling (n=153) and weaned (n=116) piglets with diarrhea in Japan were examined for shedding of viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens using culture, microscopic, and polymerase chain reaction methods. In suckling piglets, diarrhea was attributed to infection with a single etiologic agent in 60.8% of cases and with combinations of agents in 22.2%. In weaned piglets, diarrhea was attributed to a single etiologic agent in 43.1% and to combinations of agents in 47.4% of cases. Rotavirus was the most prevalent agent in suckling (67.3%) and weaned (65.5%) piglets. The detection of other pathogens was associated with age of the animals examined. Coccidia were predominantly isolated from suckling piglets, whereas Escherichia coli was found predominantly in weaned piglets. Although a relationship was not observed between detection rate of rotavirus and age of piglets, a single group of rotavirus was detected in 87.5% of suckling piglets whereas multiple groups were detected in 51.6% of weaned piglets.

A frequently intervened pathology is acute appendicitis, which could be affected by this situation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We propose a retrospective observational study on patients involved in our centre. They are divided into two groups, the preCOVID group with 123 patients surgically intervened between 15/03/19 and 31/12/19 and the postCOVID group with 101 patients surgically intervened between 15/03/20 and 31/12/20. We use T Student for quantitative variables and Chi2 for qualitative variables. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The preCOVID group, 54 males and 64 women. Average age 38.57. Average stay 3.33 days. There were 79 phlegmonous appendicitis, 27 necrotizing, 9 perforated and 8 plastron appendicitis. The postCOVID group, 57 males and 44 women. Average age 41.12. Average stay 4.27 days. There were 49 phlegmonous appendicitis, 33 necrotizing, 11 perforated and 8 plastron appendicitis. We observed statistically significant differences from time to intervention and intra-abdominal drainage placement, both being larger in the postCOVID group (p-0.038; p-0.037 respectively). We dot found statistically significant differences in other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the postCOVID group are surgically intervened later, probably motivated by the need to perform a PCR to discount SARS-CoV-2, previously to intervention. More drains are also placed in this group, probably because more acute appendicitis is involved in higher severity phases than in the preCOVID group although there aret significant differences in this regard.","output":"INFLUENCE OF COVID-19 IN ACUTE APPENDICITIS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poor medication adherence is a global phenomenon that has received a significant amount of research attention yet remains largely unsolved. Medication non-adherence can blur drug efficacy results in clinical trials, lead to substantial financial losses, increase the risk of relapse and hospitalisation, or lead to death. The most common methods of measuring adherence are post-treatment measures; that is, adherence is usually measured after the treatment has begun. What the authors are proposing in this multidisciplinary study is a new technique for predicting the factors that are likely to cause non-adherence before or during medication treatment, illustrated in the context of potential non-adherence to COVID-19 antiviral medication. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), allows system analysts to determine how combinations of simple faults of a system can propagate to cause a total system failure. Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical algorithm that depends heavily on repeated random sampling to predict the behaviour of a system. In this study, the authors propose a new technique called Non-Adherence Tree Analysis (NATA), based on the FTA and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, to improve adherence. Firstly, the non-adherence factors of a medication treatment lifecycle are translated into what is referred to as a Non-Adherence Tree (NAT). Secondly, the NAT is coded into a format that is translated into the GoldSim software for performing dynamic system modelling and analysis using Monte Carlo. Finally, the GoldSim model is simulated and analysed to predict the behaviour of the NAT. NATA is dynamic and able to learn from emerging datasets to improve the accuracy of future predictions. It produces a framework for improving adherence by analysing social and non-social adherence barriers. Novel terminologies and mathematical expressions have been developed and applied to real-world scenarios. The results of the application of NATA using data from six previous studies in relation to antiviral medication demonstrate a predictive model which suggests that the biggest factor that could contribute to non-adherence to a COVID-19 antiviral treatment is a therapy-related factor (the side effects of the medication). This is closely followed by a condition-related factor (asymptomatic nature of the disease) then patient-related factors (forgetfulness and other causes). From the results, it appears that side effects, asymptomatic factors and forgetfulness contribute 32.44%, 22.67% and 18.22% respectively to discontinuation of medication treatment of COVID-19 antiviral medication treatment. With this information, clinicians can implement relevant interventions and measures and allocate resources appropriately to minimise non-adherence.","output":"Non-Adherence Tree Analysis (NATA)-An adherence improvement framework: A COVID-19 case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to evaluate the differences of clinical presentations and the impact of healthcare organization on outcomes of neurological COVID-19 patients admitted during the first and second pandemic waves.

Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were compared between patients admitted during the first and second waves of COVID-19 pandemic. Results223 patients were included, of whom 112 and 111 hospitalized during the first and second pandemic waves, respectively. Patients admitted during the second wave were younger and exhibited pulmonary COVID-19 severity, resulting in less oxygen support (n=41, 36.9% vs n=79, 70.5%, p<0.001) and lower mortality rates (14.4% vs 31.3%, p=0.004). The different healthcare strategies and early steroid treatment emerged as significant predictors of mortality independently from age, premorbid conditions and COVID-19 severity in cox regression analyses.

Main outcomes(s) and Measure(s)Binary measures of depression (PHQ-9, cut-off []10) and anxiety (GAD-7, cut-off []10) one month before the first dose, one month after the first dose, and, if applicable, one month after the second dose. For individuals not vaccinated or chose to not report vaccination status (unvaccinated individuals), we selected three monthly measures of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 with 2-month intervals in-between based on data availability. Results5,079 (64.1%) individuals received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, 1,977 (24.9%) received one dose, 305 (3.9%) were not vaccinated, and 564 (7.1%) chose not to report vaccination status. There was a lower prevalence of depression and anxiety among vaccinated, compared with unvaccinated, individuals, especially after the second dose. Among individuals receiving two doses of vaccine, the prevalence of depression and anxiety was lower after both first (aRR=0.82, 95%CI 0.76-0.88 for depression; aRR=0.81, 95%CI 0.73-0.89 for anxiety) and second (aRR=0.79, 95%CI 0.73-0.85 for depression; aRR=0.73, 95%CI 0.66-0.81 for anxiety) dose, compared with before vaccination.

The pivotal procedure of this technique is determining the specific threshold of the images. In this paper, a hybrid preaching optimization algorithm (HPOA) for color image segmentation is proposed. Firstly, the evolutionary state strategy is adopted to evaluate the evolutionary factors in each iteration. With the introduction of the evolutionary state, the proposed algorithm has more balanced exploration-exploitation compared with the original POA. Secondly, in order to prevent premature convergence, a randomly occurring time-delay is introduced into HPOA in a distributed manner. The expression of the time-delay is inspired by particle swarm optimization and reflects the history of previous personal optimum and global optimum. To better verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, eight well-known benchmark functions are employed to evaluate HPOA. In the interim, seven state-of-the-art algorithms are utilized to compare with HPOA in the terms of accuracy, convergence, and statistical analysis. On this basis, an excellent multilevel thresholding image segmentation method is proposed in this paper. Finally, to further illustrate the potential, experiments are respectively conducted on three different groups of Berkeley images. The quality of a segmented image is evaluated by an array of metrics including feature similarity index (FSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and Kapur entropy values. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms other algorithms and has remarkable and promising performance for multilevel thresholding color image segmentation.","output":"A Hybrid Preaching Optimization Algorithm Based on Kapur Entropy for Multilevel Thresholding Color Image Segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent technological developments have influenced a shift in the use of videos in Health Professions Education (HPE). Rather than casting students in the role of observers of videos, educators have been asking students to produce videos as a learning activity. The assumption is that video production is often an active and collaborative exercise, therefore could engage students and enhance learning. However, applications of this emerging pedagogical approach vary, and there has not been a knowledge synthesis to guide future research and practice. METHODS: With a view to mapping existing knowledge, identifying avenues for further research, and informing practice, we conducted a scoping review to establish current understanding of video production in HPE. We undertook a literature search of seven databases and identified thirty-six studies. RESULTS: The findings showed considerable variation in purposes and implementation approaches, consequences and challenges associated with video production. In particular, the assumption that creating a video automatically promotes student engagement was not well supported, especially when the intended learning was not made apparent to students. CONCLUSION: Overall, the review suggests that despite the increasing adoption of video production in HPE, the purposes are often unclear; pedagogical considerations underlying project design are limited, which risks undermining the intended learning. To optimise educational benefits, future video production projects should be explicit in their intention and approach, draw upon pedagogical theories, anticipate and address implementation issues, and be robust in their formative and summative assessment processes. Future research should more explicitly show the relationship between the intended learning and the underlying pedagogy and thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of video production projects.","output":"Student video production within health professions education: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The true impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on children is yet to be seen, but charities have warned of an increase in psychosocial issues, including eating disorders","output":"Eating disorders on the rise in children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we propose a new epidemiological mathematical model for the spread of the COVID-19 disease with a special focus on the transmissibility of individuals with severe symptoms, mild symptoms, and asymptomatic symptoms.

Students and faculty had mostly similar thoughts about the practice of giving orientation t-shirts and the messages on them. Many pointed to the drug-related aspects of pharmacists' roles and did not question this representation until explicitly prompted. Relatedly, most participants did not suggest that the t-shirts should emphasize the pharmacist-patient relationship and care provision. And while there were mixed thoughts about the business logo on the t-shirts, participants were often unperturbed by sponsorship or its potential effects on students.Conclusion.

However, there is a lack of studies on developmental toxicity of azithromycin. In this study, we observed the developmental toxicity of fetal liver induced by prenatal azithromycin exposure (PAE) in mice and explored the potential mechanism. Pregnant Kunming mice were intraperitoneally injected with azithromycin (37.5 and 150 mg/kgd) from gestational day (GD) 9 to 18. After PAE, the bodyweight gain rates of pregnant mice and the birthweights of the offspring were decreased, and the liver morphology, development indexes and metabolic function were all altered in different degree in the PAE fetuses. Meanwhile, PAE decreased the fetal serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) levels and liver IGF1 signal pathway expression, accompanied by glucocorticoid receptor-CCAAT enhancer-binding protein &#945; (GR-C/EBP&#945;) signal enhancement. Furthermore, azithromycin disturbed hepatocyte differentiation, maturation and metabolic function via upregulating GR-C/EBP&#945; signal and reducing the expression and secretion levels of IGF1 in HepG2 cells. These changes could be reversed by GR siRNA or exogenous IGF1. These results indicated that PAE could cause fetal liver developmental toxicity in mice, and one of the main mechanisms was that azithromycin activated the GR-C/EBP&#945; signal, inhibited the IGF1 signal pathway, and then disturbed the hepatic proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and glycose and lipid metabolism.","output":"GR-C/EBP-IGF1 axis mediated azithromycin-induced liver developmental toxicity in fetal mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exploiting powerful techniques from physics and mathematics, this book studies animal movement in ecology, with a focus on epidemic spread Pulmonary syndrome is not only feared in epidemics of recent times, such as COVID-19, but is also characteristic of epidemics studied earlier such as Hantavirus The Hantavirus is one of the book's central topics Correlations between epidemic outbreaks and precipitation events like El Ni?o are analyzed and spatial reservoirs of infection in off-period of the epidemic, known as refugia, are studied Predicted traveling waves of infection are successfully compared to field observations Territoriality in scent-marking animals is presented, with parallels drawn with the theory of melting The flocking and herding of birds and mammals are described in terms of collective excitations For scientists interested in movement ecology and epidemic spread, this book provides effective solutions to long-standing problems","output":"Theory of the Spread of Epidemics and Movement Ecology of Animals: An Interdisciplinary Approach using Methodologies of Physics and Mathematics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the new paradigm of health-centric governance, policy makers are in a constant need for appropriate metrics and estimates in order to determine the best policies in a non-arbitrary fashion.

The antivaccine movement uses Facebook to promote messages on the alleged dangers and consequences of vaccinating, leading to a reluctance to immunize against preventable communicable diseases. OBJECTIVE: We would like to know more about the messages these websites are sharing via social media that can influence readers and consumers. What messages is the public receiving on Facebook about immunization? What content (news articles, testimonials, videos, scientific studies) is being promoted? METHODS: We proposed using a social media audit tool and 3 categorical lists to capture information on websites and posts, respectively. The keywords \\"vaccine,\\" \\"vaccine truth,\\" and \\"anti-vax\\" were entered in the Facebook search bar. A Facebook page was examined if it had between 2500 and 150,000 likes. Data about beliefs, calls to action, and testimonials were recorded from posts and listed under the categories Myths, Truths, and Consequences. Website data were entered in a social media audit template. RESULTS: Users' posts reflected fear and vaccine hesitancy resulting from the alleged dangers of immunization featured on the website links. Vaccines were blamed for afflictions such as autism, cancer, and infertility. Mothers shared testimonies on alleged consequences their children suffered due to immunization, which have influenced other parents to not vaccinate their children. Users denied the current measles outbreaks in the United States to be true, retaliating against the government in protests for fabricating news. CONCLUSIONS: Some Facebook messages encourage prevailing myths about the safety and consequences of vaccines and likely contribute to parents' vaccine hesitancy.

Since clinical and roentgenographic features poorly predict the aetiological agent in most cases of community-acquired pneumonia, empirical therapy is generally recommended. Nosocomial pneumonia is the second most common hospital-acquired infection and is associated with significant mortality.

However, the closed-ward environment and extreme shortage of onsite mental health workers have limited the use of traditional face-to-face diagnosis and psychological interventions. AIM: To develop a mental health intervention model for inpatients that can be applied during a widespread epidemic, such as COVID-19. METHODS: In a medical team stationed in Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China, we integrated onsite and online psychological support resources to implement a graded psychological intervention system. The onsite psychiatrist established trust with the patients and classified them into categories according to their symptom severity. While face-to-face evaluation and intervention are critical for effective online support, the online team effectively extended the scope of the first-aid to all patients. CONCLUSION: This integrated onsite and online approach was effective and efficient in providing psychological interventions for inpatients during the crisis. Our model provides a realistic scheme for healthcare systems in or after the COVID-19 epidemic and also could be adopted in areas of the world with insufficient mental healthcare resources.","output":"Development of a psychological first-aid model in inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adapting dashboard design to different contexts of use is an open question in visualisation research. Dashboard designers often seek to strike a balance between dashboard adaptability and ease-of-use, and in hospitals challenges arise from the vast diversity of key metrics, data models and users involved at different organizational levels. In this design study, we present QualDash, a dashboard generation engine that allows for the dynamic configuration and deployment of visualisation dashboards for healthcare quality improvement (QI). We present a rigorous task analysis based on interviews with healthcare professionals, a co-design workshop and a series of one-on-one meetings with front line analysts. From these activities we define a metric card metaphor as a unit of visual analysis in healthcare QI, using this concept as a building block for generating highly adaptable dashboards, and leading to the design of a Metric Specification Structure (MSS). Each MSS is a JSON structure which enables dashboard authors to concisely configure unit-specific variants of a metric card, while offloading common patterns that are shared across cards to be preset by the engine. We reflect on deploying and iterating the design of QualDash in cardiology wards and pediatric intensive care units of five NHS hospitals.

Patients had COVID-19 related pneumonia with respiratory failure. Ninety-four patients out of 193 survivors accepted to be re-evaluated after discharge, on average after 4 months. In ? of the patients an evidence of pulmonary fibrosis was detected, as indicated by an altered diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO); in 6C7% of patients the alteration was classified as of moderate/severe degree.

Amid the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in January 2020, strict policies were in place to restrict people's movement, bringing about steep reductions in pollution activities and notably lower ambient concentrations of primary pollutants. In this study, we report hourly measurements of fine particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5) and its comprehensive chemical speciation, including elemental and molecular source tracers, at an urban site in Shanghai spanning a period before the lockdown restriction (BR) (1 to 23 Jan. 2020) and during the restriction (DR) (24 Jan. to 9 Feb. 2020). The overall PM2.5 was reduced by 27% from 56.2  40.9 (BR) to 41.1  25.3 g m-3 (DR) and the organic carbon (OC) in PM2.5 was similar, averaged at 5.45  2.37 (BR) and 5.42  1.75 gC m-3 (DR). Reduction in nitrate was prominent, from 18.1 (BR) to 9.2 g m-3 (DR), accounting for most of the PM2.5 decrease. Source analysis of PM2.5 using positive matrix factorization modeling of comprehensive chemical composition, resolved nine primary source factors and five secondary source factors. The quantitative source analysis confirms reduced contributions from primary sources affected by COVID-19, with vehicular emissions showing the largest drop, from 4.6 (BR) to 0.61 g m-3 (DR) and the percentage change (-87%) in par with vehicle traffic volume and fuel sale statistics (-60% to -90%). In the same time period, secondary sources are revealed to vary in response to precursor reductions from the lockdown, with two sources showing consistent enhancement while the other three showing reductions, highlighting the complexity in secondary organic aerosol formation and the nonlinear response to broad primary precursor pollutants. The combined contribution from the two secondary sources to PM2.5 increased from 7.3  6.6 (BR) to 14.8  9.3 g m-3 (DR), partially offsetting the reductions from primary sources and nitrate while their increased contribution to OC, from 1.6  1.4 (BR) to 3.2  2.0 gC m-3 (DR), almost offset the decrease coming from the primary sources.

Most dental procedures generate a significant number of aerosolized particles, increasing transmission risk in dental settings. Since the generation of aerosols in dentistry is unavoidable, many clinics have started using intervention strategies such as area-filtration units and extraoral evacuation equipment, especially under the relatively recent constraints of the pandemic. However, the effectiveness of these devices in dental operatories has not been studied. Therefore, the ability of dental personnel to efficiently position and operate such instruments is also limited. To address these challenges, we utilized a real-time sensor network for assessment of aerosol dynamics during dental restoration and cleaning producers with and without intervention. The strategies tested during the procedures were (i) local area High-Efficiency Particle Air (HEPA) filters and (ii) Extra-Oral Suction Device (EOSD). The study was conducted at the University of Washington School of Dentistry using a network of 13 fixed sensors positioned within the operatory and one wearable sensor worn by the dental operator. The sensor network provides time and space-resolved particulate matter (PM) data. Three-dimensional (3D) visualization informed aerosol persistence in the operatory. It was found that area filters did not improve the overall aerosol concentration in dental offices in a significant way. A decrease in PM concentration by an average of 16% was observed when EOSD equipment was used during the procedures. The combination of real-time sensors and 3D visualization can provide dental personnel and facility managers with actionable feedback to effectively assess aerosol transmission in medical settings and develop evidence-based intervention strategies.","output":"Methodology for Addressing Infectious Aerosol Persistence in Real-Time Using Sensor Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a signaling phospholipid involved in pathophysiologic progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) through its roles in endothelial barrier function and immune modulation. We hypothesized that decreased serum S1P level is associated with the clinical outcomes of ARDS and polymorphisms in the S1P gene are associated with serum S1P levels. METHODS: This multicenter prospective study includes ARDS patients and healthy blood donors as controls. Serum S1P levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Eight tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the S1P gene were detected, and their associations with S1P levels were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 121 ARDS patients and 100 healthy individuals were enrolled. Serum S1P levels were lower in ARDS patients than in controls (P < 0.001). Decreased S1P levels correlated with more organ dysfunction and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores. Changes in S1P levels in ARDS patients were associated with the clinical outcomes. The recessive model for SNP rs3743631 suggests that GG homozygote is associate with a higher risk for ARDS. The dominant model for SNP rs907045 suggests that AA or TA genotype might increase the risk for ARDS. In ARDS patients, the rs3743631 GG genotype showed lower S1P levels than those harboring AG and AA genotypes. The serum S1P levels of rs907045 AA or TA genotype patients were lower than those of TT genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Serum S1P levels are dramatically decreased in ARDS patients. Reduced S1P levels are associated with worse clinical outcomes.

This study is devoted to addressing this knowledge gap by cross-comparisons of field measurements, wind tunnel tests, and large-eddy simulations (LES) under neutral and unstable conditions. It is found that LES-computed velocity ratios under unstable conditions are in line with field measurements, while results of simulations under neutral conditions are close to those of wind tunnel tests. Enhanced vertical mixing due to surface heating produces improved ventilation performance in the unstable case. The neutral assumption tends to underestimate pedestrian-level velocity ratios compared to a diabatic condition; hence it is deemed conservative when it is adopted in AVA practices. Moreover, stronger wind direction variance under unstable conditions results in weaker correlation between velocity ratios and frontal area indices than neutral conditions, which implies that street orientations become less important in ventilation under unstable conditions.","output":"Air ventilation assessment under unstable atmospheric stratification  A comparative study for Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preeclampsia is one of the most common complications of pregnancy and occurs in approximately 3-8% of all pregnancies worldwide.

To date, there remains a paucity of high-quality evidence to inform clinical practice world-wide. Therefore, the objective of this scientific statement is to provide consensus-based recommendations on the use of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in children hospitalized for COVID-19-related illnesses, and to identify priorities for future research. METHODS We surveyed 20 pediatric hematologists and pediatric critical care physicians from several continents who were identified by Pediatric/Neonatal Hemostasis and Thrombosis Subcommittee leadership as having experience and expertise in the use of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis and/or the management of COVID-19-related illness in children. A comprehensive review of the literature on COVID-19 in children was also performed. RESULTS Response rate was 90%. Based on consensus of expert opinions, we suggest the administration of low-dose low molecular weight heparin subcutaneously twice-daily as anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis (in the absence of contraindications, and in combination with mechanical thromboprophylaxis with sequential compression devices, where feasible) in children hospitalized for COVID-19-related illness (including the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [MIS-C]) who have markedly elevated D-dimer levels or superimposed clinical risk factors for hospitalassociated VTE. For children who are clinically unstable or have severe renal impairment, we suggest the use of unfractionated heparin by continuous intravenous infusion as anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. In addition, continued efforts to characterize VTE risk and risk factors in children with COVID-19, as well as to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis strategies in children hospitalized with COVID-19-related illness (including MIS-C) via cooperative multicenter trials, were identified among several key priorities for future research.

However, individuals who experienced austerity, adversity, and disadvantage prior to the pandemic have been disproportionately affected with every turn the pandemic has taken, from transmission risk to vaccination take-up. One such population is individuals who experience homelessness. As the UK begins to transition to a stage of post-pandemic recovery, it is imperative to understand the perceived impact COVID-19 has had on the day-to-day lives of individuals who experience homelessness, to ensure they are not left behind and recovery planning can be better targeted to their specific needs. Methods Between February and May, 2021, 26 individuals (10 women and 16 men) who self-identified as experiencing homelessness within the Newcastle Gateshead area took part in telephone interviews of 20C80 min in length. Participants provided written or verbal informed consent prior to participating. Recruitment took place through existing networks, housing providers, charities, word of mouth, and snowball sampling. Analysis was co-produced with five individuals with lived experience using interpretative phenomenological analysis. NVivo release 15 was used to organise quotes. Ethics approval was granted by the Faculty of Medical Sciences Research Ethics Committee, part of Newcastle University's Research Ethics Committee (ref 2034/6698/2020.) Findings Experiences shared depicted unique stories with commonalities across the findings through five main themes: (1) surreality of day-to-day lifesearching for understanding and lost autonomy; (2) an emotional rollercoasterconfronting negative emotions; (3) loneliness is my best friendlearning from being alone; (4) adversity is the only consistencyrecognising past and present hardship, violence, and loss; and (5) coping with uncertaintyusing drugs, mindfulness, and technology to survive. Interpretation The pandemic has affected the daily lives of people who experience homelessness in a variety of ways, including personal growth, no change, and regression. This study is limited by its localised recruitment in Newcastle and Gateshead in the UK; however, this local focus and involvement of individuals with lived experience has strengthened the study's implications for policy and practice in the region. Initiatives or policies developed to support post-pandemic recovery should reflect the array of impacts, while giving special recognition to loneliness, adversity, and resiliency among individuals who experience homelessness.

Effective carbon price forecasting can help the carbon market to solve environmental problems at a lower economic cost. However, the existing studies focus on the carbon premium explanation from the perspective of return and volatility spillover under the framework of the mean-variance low-order moment. Specifically, the time-varying, high-order moment shock of market asymmetry and extreme policies on carbon price have been ignored. The innovation of this paper is constructing a new hybrid model, NAGARCHSK-GRU, that is consistent with the special characteristics of the carbon market. In the proposed model, the NAGARCHSK model is designed to extract the time-varying, high-order moment parameter characteristics of carbon price, and the multilayer GRU model is used to train the obtained time-varying parameter and improve the forecasting accuracy. The results conclude that the NAGARCHSK-GRU model has better accuracy and robustness for forecasting carbon price. Moreover, the long-term forecasting performance has been proved. This conclusion proves the rationality of incorporating the time-varying impact of asymmetric information and extreme factors into the forecasting model, and contributes to a powerful reference for investors to formulate investment strategies and assist a reduction in carbon emissions.","output":"Forecasting Carbon Dioxide Price Using a Time-Varying High-Order Moment Hybrid Model of NAGARCHSK and Gated Recurrent Unit Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) is a multidomain metalloprotease for which until now only a single substrate has been identified. ADAMTS13 cleaves the polymeric force-sensor von Willebrand factor (VWF) that unfolds under shear stress and recruits platelets to sites of vascular injury. Shear forceCdependent cleavage at a single TyrCMet peptide bond in the unfolded VWF A2 domain serves to reduce the size of VWF polymers in circulation. In patients with immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP), a rare life-threatening disease, ADAMTS13 is targeted by autoantibodies that inhibit its activity or promote its clearance. In the absence of ADAMTS13, VWF polymers are not adequately processed, resulting in spontaneous adhesion of blood platelets, which presents as severe, life-threatening microvascular thrombosis. In healthy individuals, ADAMTS13CVWF interactions are guided by controlled conversion of ADAMTS13 from a closed, inactive to an open, active conformation through a series of interdomain contacts that are now beginning to be defined. Recently, it has been shown that ADAMTS13 adopts an open conformation in the acute phase and during subclinical disease in iTTP patients, making open ADAMTS13 a novel biomarker for iTTP.

However, cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC alterations in MDD remain largely unknown. METHODS 50 patients with MDD and 36 well-matched healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC analyses were performed using the cerebellar seeds previously identified as being involved in the executive, default-mode, affective-limbic, and motor networks. Inter-group differences in the cerebellar dynamic FC and their associations with clinical and cognitive variables were examined. RESULTS Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD had decreased cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregions connecting with the executive, default-mode and affective-limbic networks. The dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregion connecting with the affective-limbic network was related to severity of depression and anxiety symptoms in MDD patients. The dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregions connecting with the default-mode and affective-limbic networks were related to sustained attention and prospective memory in controls, while the correlations were inverse or non-significant in patients. LIMITATIONS The fairly modest sample size and potential medication effect may increase the instability of the results.

METHODS: A sample of 623 Chinese nurses were recruited from all hepatological surgery departments in Hunan Province and filled out an online questionnaire to collect data on socio-demographics, role stress, burnout, psychological distress, and social support. Mediation and moderation analyses were carried out in SPSS macro-PROCESS. RESULTS: Burnout partially mediated the positive association between role stress and psychological distress. Social support moderated the indirect effect of role stress on psychological distress via burnout, with the effect being stronger for nurses with low social support than those with high social support. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated how role stress contributed to nurses' psychological distress both directly and indirectly through burnout, and how this indirect effect was moderated by social support. The results provide important practical implications for future prevention and intervention programs to improve nurses' mental health from multiple aspects such as decreasing role stress and burnout while increasing social support.","output":"Role Stress and Psychological Distress Among Chinese Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Moderated Mediation Model of Social Support and Burnout"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ventilator-associated pneumonia is a hospital-acquired infection of the lungs occurring in mechanically ventilated patients. An active risk management approach can prevent the occurrence of the disease and promote positive organizational changes, subsequently decreasing mortality and hospitalization costs. Using scientific and clinical practice knowledge, a risk evaluation model was developed to identify patients more at risk of developing the disease. For this purpose, a Decision Expert qualitative multi-criteria decision method was used, in which alternatives are evaluated according to predetermined hierarchically arranged criteria. Characteristics of each evaluated alternative are described by the members of an interdisciplinary expert team and are represented by the values of the basic criteria. Values of hierarchically higher aggregated criteria are computed in an upwards fashion according to utility functions, which are defined as simple logical rules. This method is integrated into a software solution, DEXi. The approach is applicable to vastly diverse decision problems and has been successfully used before for health-related decision support. The designed model was tested using actual clinical data. Evaluations of alternatives that most distinctly demonstrated the functionality of the evaluation model were selected and are presented in the results. The evaluation model is intended to assist a holistic evaluation of the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia, by considering patient-related risk factors and the use of preventive measures. The model incorporates nursing-specific data that have hitherto been poorly utilized in preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia and promotes the active engagement of nurses in confronting this interdisciplinary healthcare problem, which has gained more prominence with the onset of COVID-19 disease.","output":"Multi-criteria risk evaluation model for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Secondary immunodeficiency is reported in most patients with hematological malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma.

Immunodeficiency in these patients has an intense impact on their risk of infection, in turn increasing morbidity and mortality even years after treatment completion. However, these patients with increased risk of severe infectious diseases could be treated with adequate vaccination coverage, but the vaccines administration can be associated with a decreased immune response and an augmented risk of adverse reactions. Probably, immunogenicity of the inactivated is analogous to that of healthy subjects at the moment of vaccination, but it undertakes a gradual weakening over time.

A study was conducted to assess the impact of the pandemic on cropping patterns, crop management, usage of chemical inputs and their organic alternatives, harvesting, and marketing avenues through a survey approach in the two states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu in India. A total of 250 farmers participated in the study, the data was analyzed by Chi-square test and KruskalCWallis test. The assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on some aspects was undertaken by dividing the study period into three phases. Though a smaller number of people were infected with COVID-19 in the initial phase of the pandemic compared to the later phases, farm operations and the procurement of inputs were significantly affected at this phase as there was a sudden disruption in transportation due to COVID-19-induced movement restrictions. During the entire study period, commodities such as rice, bananas, vegetables, coconuts, and flowers suffered maximum crop loss compared to pulses, groundnuts, cotton, and rubber. Among fertilizers, the maximum shortage was observed for chemical fertilizers (46%) and biofertilizers (30%) compared to cow dung (18%) and poultry manure (6%), indicating that farmers tended to use more local materials that could be easily procured and accessed compared to shop-based inputs. A rise in the cost of cultivation, scarcity of farm workforce, and difficulty in hiring farm machinery all have contributed to the loss of profit during the pandemic period. As a response to COVID-19, growers initiated post-harvest processing of commodities, and cropping systems remained the same during the period.

Earlier reports have suggested that COVID-19 agents can be present in the fecal and sewage samples and thus it can be a good indication of the pandemic extent in a community. However, no such studies have been reported in the Indian context so far. Since, several factors like local population physiology, the climatic conditions, sewage composition, and processing of samples could possibly affect the detection of the viral genome, it becomes absolutely necessary to check for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serving different localities of Jaipur city, which has been under red zone (pandemic hotspots) since early April 2020. Samples from different local municipal WWTPs and hospital wastewater samples were collected and wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) studies for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 were carried out using the RT-PCR technique to confirm the presence of different COVID-19 target genes namely S gene, E gene, ORF1ab gene, RdRp gene and N gene in the viral load of wastewater samples.

A cis-acting element previously identified in the 3' untranslated region binds to trans-acting host factors from mouse fibroblasts and forms at least three RNA-protein complexes. The largest RNA-protein complex formed by the cis-acting element and the lysate from uninfected mouse fibroblasts has a molecular weight of about 200 kDa. The complex observed in gel shift assays has been resolved by second-dimension sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into four proteins of approximately 90, 70, 58, and 40 kDa after RNase treatment. Specific RNA affinity chromatography also has revealed the presence of a 90-kDa protein associated with RNA containing the cis-acting element bound to magnetic beads. The 90-kDa protein has been purified from uninfected mouse fibroblast crude lysates. Protein microsequencing identified the 90-kDa protein as mitochondrial aconitase. Antibody raised against purified mitochondrial aconitase recognizes the RNA-protein complex and the 90-kDa protein, which can be released from the complex by RNase digestion. Furthermore, UV cross-linking studies indicate that highly purified mitochondrial aconitase binds specifically to the MHV 3' protein-binding element. Increasing the intracellular level of mitochondrial aconitase by iron supplementation resulted in increased RNA-binding activity in cell extracts and increased virus production as well as viral protein synthesis at early hours of infection. These results are particularly interesting in terms of identification of an RNA target for mitochondrial aconitase, which has a cytoplasmic homolog, cytoplasmic aconitase, also known as iron regulatory protein 1, a well-recognized RNA-binding protein.

The disease distribution analysis showed that, except for nondisease-specific consultations, acute upper respiratory infection (AURI) (4.1%), pregnancy (2.8%), and dermatitis (2.4%) were the most frequently consulted diseases. In terms of user profiles, females (60.4%) from 19 to 35 years of age were most likely to seek consultations online, in general. The user behavior analyses showed that the peak times of day for online consultations occurred at 10 AM, 3 PM, and 9 PM. Regarding user experience, 93.0% of users gave full marks following their consultations. For some disease-related health problems, such as AURI, dermatitis, and eczema, the feedback scores were above average. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of internet hospitals, such as Ping An Good Doctor, illustrated the great demand for online health care services that can go beyond geographical limitations. Our analyses showed that nondisease-specific issues and moderate health problems were much more frequently consulted about than severe clinical conditions. This indicated that internet hospitals played the role of the family doctor, which helped to relieve the stress placed on offline hospitals and facilitated people's lives. In addition, good user experiences, especially regarding disease-related inquisitions, suggested that online health services can help solve health problems. With support from the government and acceptance by the public, online health care services could develop at a fast pace and greatly benefit people's daily lives.","output":"Characteristics of Online Health Care Services From China's Largest Online Medical Platform: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectif La pandmie COVID-19 a provoqu une crise sanitaire avec un bouleversement de la vie du personnel mdical  lorigine de troubles de sommeil.

While these two constructs have been studied extensively by extant research, there is scant research which has studied the relationship between them C perhaps due to the expectation that individuals who are chronically more altruistic are very different from those who are more risk taking. This research tests this expectation by formally studying the relationship between altruism and risk taking using a mixture of survey-based and experimental methodology. First four studies test the relationship between altruism and risk-taking using survey-based methodology involving some of the most prominent scales for measuring trait altruism and risk taking. The final study investigates the influence of trait altruism on situational social risk taking. Trait altruism and risk taking are found to be significantly positively correlated with each other, with the relationship being the strongest for social risk taking. Further, the relationship is not significant for ethical risk taking. Additionally, it was found that trait optimism could be the underlying cause for the relationship. Further, it was also found that trait altruism was significantly positively correlated with situational social risk taking. Contributions emerge for the literatures on consumer altruism, risk taking, and optimism by filling an important theoretical gap related to the inter-relationships between these three constructs. Additionally, this research has important implications for practice by informing nonprofit organizations about an erstwhile unknown facet of altruistic people C their tendency to take risks. This opens new avenues for nonprofit practitioners to explore when looking to expand the scope and size of their initiatives, and to innovate on their current offerings in a variety of ways.

The dopaminergic system is particularly interesting to investigate the RAS as important functional interactions between dopamine and RAS have been observed in the brain and several peripheral tissues. Our recent observations in mitochondria and nucleus of dopaminergic neurons may clarify the role of the iRAS.

The serine protease, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and cysteine proteases, cathepsins B, L (CTSB/L) activate spike protein and enabling SARS-CoV-2 entry to the host cell through two completely different and independent pathways. Given that the uncertainty of how SARS-CoV-2 infects and kills, the need for a deep understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology is imperative. Herein, we performed genomic-guided meta-analysis to identify upstream regulatory elements altering the expression of TMPRSS2 and CTSB/L genes. Further, drugs and medicinal compounds were identified based on their effects on gene expression signatures of the modulators of TMPRSS2 and CTSB/L genes. Using this strategy, estradiol and retinoic acid have been identified as putative SARS-CoV-2 alleviation agents. Further, we analysed drug-gene and gene-gene interaction network using 332 human targets of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The network results indicate that out of 332 human proteins, estradiol interacts with 135 (41%) and retinoic acid interacts with 40 (12%) proteins. Interestingly, a combination of both estradiol and retinoic acid interacts with 153 (46%) of human proteins acting as SARS-CoV-2 targets and affect the functions of nearly all of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, indicating the therapeutic benefits of drug combination therapy. Finally, molecular docking analysis suggest that both the drugs binds to TMPRSS2 and CTSL with the nanomolar to low micromolar affinity. This study, for the first time, reports the molecules like estradiol and retinoic acid as candidate drugs against both the host proteases, TMPRSS2 and CTSB/L. We here thus suggest that these antiviral drugs alone or in combination can simultaneously target both the entry pathways and thus can be considered as a potential treatment option for COVID-19.","output":"Genomics-guided identification of potential modulators of SARS-CoV-2 entry proteases, TMPRSS2 and Cathepsins B/L"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Recent data have reinforced the concept of a reciprocal relationship between COVID-19 and kidney function. However, most studies have focused on the effect of COVID-19 on kidney function, whereas data regarding kidney function on the COVID-19 prognosis is scarce. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between eGFR on admission and the mortality rate of COVID-19. Methods We recruited 336 adult consecutive patients (male 57.1%, mean age 55.0 {+/-}15.9) that were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the tertiary care university hospital. Data were collected from the electronic health records of the hospital. On admission, eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI formula. Acute kidney injury was defined according to the KDIGO criteria. Binary logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between eGFR on admission and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. Results Baseline eGFR was under 60 mL/min/1.73m2 in 61 patients (18.2%). Acute kidney injury occurred in 29.1% of the patients. In-hospital mortality was calculated as 12.8%. Age-adjusted and multivariate logistic regression analysis (p:0.005, odds ratio:0.974, CI:0.956-0.992) showed that baseline eGFR was independently associated with mortality. Additionally, age-adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed a higher mortality rate in patients with an eGFR under 60 mL/min/1.73m2.

Reflexivity has implications for several ocean forecasting applications, such as fisheries management, endangered species management, toxic and invasive species management, and community science. The field of ocean system forecasting is experiencing rapid growth, and there is an opportunity to add the reflexivity dynamic to the conventional approach taken from weather forecasting. Social science has grappled with reflexivity for decades and can offer a valuable perspective. Ocean forecasting is often iterative, thus it can also offer opportunities to advance the general understanding of reflexive prediction. In this paper, we present a basic theoretical skeleton for considering iterative reflexivity in an ocean forecasting context. It is possible to explore the reflexive dynamics because the prediction is iterative. The central problem amounts to a tension between providing a reliably accurate forecast and affecting a desired outcome via the forecast. These two objectives are not always compatible. We map a review of the literature onto relevant ecological scales that contextualize the role of reflexivity across a range of applications, from biogeochemical (e.g., hypoxia and harmful algal blooms) to endangered species management. Formulating reflexivity mathematically provides one explicit mechanism for integrating natural and social sciences. In the context of the Anthropocene ocean, reflexivity helps us understand whether forecasts are meant to mitigate and control environmental changes, or to adapt and respond within a changing system. By thinking about reflexivity as part of the foundation of ocean system forecasting, we hope to avoid some of the unintended consequences that can derail forecasting programs.","output":"Facing the Forecasters Dilemma: Reflexivity in Ocean System Forecasting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disturbance to human life.

This paper focuses on the possible secondary transmission due to resuspension of virus-laden droplets from common surfaces, which several studies have shown to be possible under external disturbances. Such disturbances could be body motion during walking, running, clothes removal, or airflow in the environment. In this paper, a three-dimensional two-phase model is utilized to study respiratory droplet resuspension dynamics on various surfaces due to sudden agitation. The velocity range and variation during walking, surgical glove removal, and dropping an object are studied experimentally. A parametric study is performed to characterize the effects of droplet size and surface wettability on the minimum initial droplet velocity required for detachment from surfaces. The results are reported as average droplet velocity during the detachment process, total detachment time, and detached droplet volume. The obtained results indicate that respiratory droplets larger than 200 m can detach from typical surfaces due to normal daily activities. Droplets are partially separated from hydrophilic surfaces with contact angle Furthermore, the minimum initial droplet velocity to induce the resuspension depends on the droplet size. Droplet velocity immediately after detachment is a function of droplet size, initial droplet velocity, and surface wettability. Bigger droplets have larger detached volume percentage as well as higher velocity after detachment compared to smaller droplets. Finally, a higher initial velocity is needed to separate droplets from hydrophilic surfaces as compared to hydrophobic surfaces. In accordance with the results, the droplet minimum initial velocity to cause detachment is 2 m s?1, while our experiments show that surface velocity can reach up to 3 m s?1 during normal human activities. We also develop an analytical model to predict the required kinetic energy to detach droplets from different surfaces, which is in good agreement with numerical results. The mechanism of droplet detachment is dictated by a competition between droplet kinetic energy induced by surface motion and surface energy due to droplet-surface interaction as well as droplet-vapor and surface-vapor interactions. We believe that the results of this fundamental study can potentially be used to suggest proper surface wettability and safe motion that reduce respiratory droplet resuspension from various surfaces. ? 2021 Author(s).","output":"Respiratory droplet resuspension near surfaces: Modeling and analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Affibody molecules are a class of small (7 kDa) robust scaffold proteins suitable for radionuclide molecular imaging in vivo.

Prior literature finds attitudes toward individualism and collectivism have significant implications for gender equality and patriarchal attitudes. We combine these ideas arguing that the degree to which social trust fosters gender equality depends upon the degrees of individualism and collectivism. Employing World Values Survey data across countries over time, we find that with low levels of individualism, and high degrees of collectivism, higher levels of trust are not effective in reducing the prevalence of gendered patriarchal attitudesin fact it entrenches them further, worsening gender equality. However, as individualism rises, and collectivism falls, higher levels of trust become effective in reducing the prevalence of patriarchal beliefs.

Hence, health care workers, who are in close contact with affected patients, face many risks. There need to be a greater understanding of: individual HCWs' risk perceptions; adopted risk-mitigating strategies; and factors influencing both. OBJECTIVES This review aimed to establish the best evidence regarding health care worker's risk perceptions and workplace strategies towards emerging acute respiratory infectious diseases in acute hospital and community healthcare settings; and to make recommendations for practice and future research. INCLUSION CRITERIA Participants Studies that included male and female health care workers practising in acute and community health care settings were considered.Types of intervention (s)/Phenomena of interest This review considered studies that investigated: health care workers' risk perceptions; perceived meaning/effectiveness of the individual and workplace strategies implemented; and the factors influencing both.Types of outcomes This review focused on factors affecting: health care worker' risk perceptions; use of risk-mitigating strategies; and their perceived meaning and effectiveness.Types of studies Both qualitative and quantitative study designs published in the English language were including in the study. SEARCH STRATEGY Using a three-step search strategy, the following databases from 1997-2009 were accessed: CINAHL, PubMed, SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, Sociological Abstracts, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY Two independent reviewers assessed each paper for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Disagreements were resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. DATA EXTRACTION Information was extracted by two independent reviewers from each paper using the standardised data extraction tools from JBI. DATA SYNTHESIS The findings are presented in narrative form, as textual pooling and statistical pooling was not possible for the qualitative and quantitative papers respectively. RESULTS Ten quantitative studies and one qualitative study were included in the review. Findings indicated that although health care workers perceived personal and familial health risks and stigmatization from their exposure to emerging acute respiratory infectious diseases, the majority were accepting of these risks. Organizational implementation of infection control measures; avoidance of patients; and complying with personal protective equipment were identified as risk-mitigating strategies. Demographic, individual and organizational factors were found to influence their risk perceptions and their adoption of these strategies. CONCLUSIONS There is a nebulous relationship between health care workers' risk perceptions and how these perceptions affect their use of risk-mitigating strategies. Hence, future research needs to examine the nuances of this relationship, as well as the influencing factors involved. In this review, several key factors influencing health care workers' risk perceptions and risk-mitigating strategies were identified and these may form the implications for new practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Institutions need to: empower health care workers through education and training; protect them with organizational safeguards; and offer incentives to encourage willingness to work, especially for those with high risk perceptions. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH Future research need to examine the: differences between HCWs' intentions to care during SARS and influenza outbreaks; relationship between intentions to care and actual care provided; difference between their intentions to care/resign and acceptance of risks; factors influencing their intentions to care; and factors influencing compliance to infection control measures.","output":"A comprehensive systematic review of healthcare workers' perceptions of risk from exposure to emerging acute respiratory infectious diseases and the perceived effectiveness of strategies used to facilitate healthy coping in acute hospital and community healthcare settings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review considers evidence for infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presence and COVID-19 infection and illness resulting from exposure to environmental fecal wastes and waters.

Specific primers for each of the 3 RNA viruses, North American genotype porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and swine influenza virus, were used in the testing procedure. The assay was shown to be highly sensitive because it could detect as little as 10(?5) ng of each of the respective amplicons in a single sample containing a composite of all 3 viruses. The assay was also effective in detecting one or more of the same viruses in various combinations in specimens, including lymph nodes, lungs, spleens, and tonsils, collected from clinically ill pigs and in spleen specimens collected from aborted pig fetuses. The results from the multiplex RT-PCR were confirmed by virus isolation. The relative efficiency (compared to the efficiency of separate assays for each virus) and apparent sensitivity of the multiplex RT-PCR method show that this method has potential for application in routine molecular diagnostic procedures.","output":"Use of a Multiplex RT-PCR Assay for Simultaneous Detection of the North American Genotype Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus, Swine Influenza Virus and Japanese Encephalitis Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, Digital Technologies (DTs) are becoming an inseparable part of human lives. Thus, many scholars have conducted research to develop new tools and applications. Processing information, usually in the form of binary code, is the main task in DTs, which is happening through many devices, including computers, smartphones, robots, and applications. Surprisingly, the role of DTs has been highlighted in peoples life due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are several different challenges to implement and intervene in DTs during the COVID-19 outbreak; therefore, the present study extended a new fuzzy approach under Hesitant Fuzzy Set (HFS) approach using Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method to evaluate and rank the critical challenges of DTs intervention to control the COVID-19 outbreak. In this regard, a comprehensive survey using literature and in-depth interviews have been carried out to identify the challenges under the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) framework. Moreover, the SWARA procedure is applied to analyze and assess the challenges to DTs intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the WASPAS approach is utilized to rank the DTs under hesitant fuzzy sets. Further, to demonstrate the efficacy and practicability of the developed framework, an illustrative case study has been analyzed. The results of this study found that Health Information Systems (HIS) was ranked as the first factor among other factors followed by a lack of digital knowledge, digital stratification, economic interventions, lack of reliable data, and cost inefficiency In conclusion, to confirm the steadiness and strength of the proposed framework, the obtained outputs are compared with other methods.","output":"A novel extended approach under hesitant fuzzy sets to design a framework for assessing the key challenges of digital health interventions adoption during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate change in sedentary behavior (SB) and physical activity (PA) over 3 years following bariatric surgery. METHODS A subset of participants in an observational study (n = 473 of 2,458; 79% female, median body mass index 45 kg m(-2) ) wore an activity monitor presurgery and at 1-3 annual postsurgery assessments. RESULTS Over the first year, on average, sedentary time decreased from 573 (95% CI: 563-582) to 545 (95% CI: 534-555) min days(-1) and moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA) increased from 77 (95% CI: 71-84) to 106 (95% CI: 98-116) min week(-1) , or 7 (95% CI: 5-10) to 24 (95% CI: 18-29) min week(-1) in MVPA bouts 10 min. There were no changes in these parameters from years 1 to 3 (P for all > 0.05).

However, there is a lack of evidence on the causal relationship between social protection programmes and suicide, which may hinder substantial national budget reallocations necessary to implement these policies. Social protection programmes are government interventions that ensure adequate income now and in the future, through changes to earned income (eg, minimum wage increase) or social security (via cash transfers or cash equivalents). Our review aims to evaluate the existing evidence on a causal relationship between social protection programmes and suicide mortality by examining all relevant experimental and quasi-experimental studies between January 1980 and November 2021. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The review will be conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline. We will search references published between 1 January 1980 and 30 November 2021 in 10 electronic databases, including MEDLINE (PubMed), PsycINFO, EMBASE and Applied Social Sciences Index Abstracts. Seven reviewers will independently participate in screening studies from titles, abstracts and full texts across all the stages. Experimental (ie, randomised controlled trials) and quasi-experimental studies (ie, non-randomised interventional studies) written in English, French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Korean and Japanese examining the impact of income security programmes on suicide mortality were included. Meta-analyses will be conducted if there are at least three studies with similar income security programmes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Our proposed review does not require ethical approval. In collaboration with our community partners, we will develop a policy brief for stakeholders to support efforts to implement social protection programmes to help prevent suicides. Our findings will be presented at conferences, published in a peer-reviewer journal and promoted on social media platforms.

Sabah State, located on the island of Borneo, has previously reported a particularly high burden of disease and faces unique contextual challenges compared with peninsular Malaysia. The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology of TB in Sabah to identify risk groups and hotspots of TB transmission. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of TB cases notified in Sabah, Malaysia, between 2012 and 2018. Using data from the states myTB notification database, we calculated the case notification rate and described trends in the epidemiology, diagnostic practices and treatment outcomes of TB in Sabah within this period. The Chi-squared test was used for determining the difference between two proportions. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2018 there were 33 193 cases of TB reported in Sabah (128 cases per 100 000 population). We identified several geographic hotspots, including districts with > 200 cases per 100 000 population per year. TB rates increased with age and were highest in older males. Children < 15 years accounted for only 4.6% of cases. Moderate or advanced disease on chest X-ray and sputum smear positivity was high (58 and 81% of cases respectively), suggesting frequent late diagnosis. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB prevalence was low (0.3% of TB cases), however, rapid diagnostic test coverage was low (1.2%) and only 18% of all cases had a positive culture result. Treatment success was 83% (range: 81C85%) in those with drug-sensitive TB and 36% (range: 25C45%) in cases of MDR-TB. CONCLUSION: Between 2012 and 2018, TB notifications in Sabah State equated to 20% of Malaysias total TB notifications, despite Sabah representing only 10% of Malaysias population. We found hotspots of TB in urbanised population hubs and points of migration, as well as evidence of late presentation and diagnosis.

A subset of COVID-19 pandemic questions included resident wellness, imaging opinions, residency infrastructure change, and opinions regarding the Core Exam delay. RESULTS: One hundred forty chief residents from 86 institutions responded to COVID-19-related questions. Nearly all responding programs (99%; 85/86) reported institutional positive cases of COVID-19. Most residents (94%; 132/140) thought laboratory testing provided more value than imaging. Fifty-seven percent of respondents (80/140) would use COVID-19-related terminology when encountering chest CT findings supportive of viral pneumonia in symptomatic patients. There was little reported change in the number of residents on call (no change reported in >80% of programs). Fifty-nine percent of residents (83/140) reported increased stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of programs (93%) had fewer residents on service (80/86 responding programs).

Return to work (RTW) not only indicates patients physical health, showing that they could undertake the work, but also demonstrates their psychological well-being. While cell transplantation showed satisfactory efficacy in limb salvage, few studies of AICLI patients RTW after transplantation have been reported. METHODS: From May 2009 to May 2021, AICLI patients who underwent cell transplantation and completed no less than 12 months of follow-up were retrospectively enrolled. The primary endpoint was RTW. Patient demographics and characteristics of the ischaemic limbs were reviewed to analyse independent risk factors for RTW. RESULTS: A total of 171 AICLI patients (170 males) were enrolled with a mean age of 41.9  9.6 years (range: 20C57 years). The 12-month and 24-month RTW cumulative rates were 69.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 61.6C75.6%) and 70.1% (95% CI 62.3C76.2%), respectively.

We aimed to review the clinical risk factors for fatal outcomes in these patients. METHODS: We performed meta-analysis using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. A fixed- or random-effects model was used for calculating heterogeneity. We used contour-enhanced funnel plot and Eggers tests to assess potential publication bias. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included. The proportion of males was lower in the survivor group than in the non-survivor group (OR = 0.75, 95% CI [0.61, 0.94]). The proportion of respiratory diseases was significantly lower in the survivor group than in the non-survivor group (OR = 0.42, 95% CI [0.29, 0.60]). The proportion of patients with fever, cough, and dyspnea was significantly lower in the survivor group (fever: OR = 0.53, 95% CI [0.31, 0.92]; cough: OR = 0.50, 95% CI [0.38, 0.65]; dyspnea: OR = 0.25, 95% CI [0.14, 0.47]) than in the non-survivor group. Compared with the non-survivor group, the survivor group had higher albumin and platelet levels and lower leucocyte counts. CONCLUSIONS: Male patients might have a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. Comorbidities, such as respiratory diseases could also greatly influence the clinical prognosis of COVID-19. Clinical features, such as fever, dyspnea, cough, and abnormal platelet, leucocyte, and albumin levels, could imply eventual death.

This paper aims to investigate library leadership in Nigeria and COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Descriptive research design was used for the study. A structured questionnaire designed with Google Form and administered online was used to elicit data from 137 heads of academic and public libraries and their deputies in South West, Nigeria. Findings: It was found that transformational and transactional leadership styles were more effective than laissez-faire style in managing libraries during crisis. Library operations were reduced during the COVID-19 era, and communication and meetings were conducted via social media. The spread of the pandemic was curtailed through enforcement of the use of face mask and nose covers and awareness campaign through posters and handbills. Practical implications: It is the library heads with effective leadership styles that will be productive in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: This study is novel, as it approaches the handling of COVID-19 in libraries from the perspective of the leadership styles of the library leaders.

Emerging fungal pathogens and increasing rates of resistance mean that additional research efforts and resources must be allocated to advancing our understanding of fungal pathogenesis and developing new therapeutic interventions. Neutrophilic granulocytes are a major cell type involved in protection against the important fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, where they employ numerous defense mechanisms, including production of antimicrobial extracellular vesicles. A major draw-back to work with neutrophils is the lack of a suitable cell line system for the study of fungal pathogenesis. To address this problem, we assessed the feasibility of using differentiated PLB-985 neutrophil-like cells as an in vitro model to study A. fumigatus infection. We find that dimethylformamide-differentiated PLB-985 cells provide a useful recapitulation of many aspects of A. fumigatus interactions with primary human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. We show that differentiated PLB-985 cells phagocytose fungal conidia and acidify conidia-containing phagolysosomes similar to primary neutrophils, release neutrophil extracellular traps, and also produce antifungal extracellular vesicles in response to infection. In addition, we provide an improved method for the isolation of extracellular vesicles produced during infection by employing a size-exclusion chromatography-based approach. Advanced LC-MS/MS proteomics revealed an enrichment of extracellular vesicle marker proteins and a decrease of cytoplasmic proteins in extracellular vesicles isolated using this improved method. Ultimately, we find that differentiated PLB-985 cells can serve as a genetically tractable model to study many aspects of A. fumigatus pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Polymorphonuclear leukocytes are an important defense against human fungal pathogens, yet our model systems to study this group of cells remains very limited in scope. In this study, we established that differentiated PLB-985 cells can serve as a model to recapitulate several important aspects of human polymorphonuclear leukocyte interactions with the important human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. The proposed addition of a cultured neutrophil-like cell line to the experimental toolbox to study fungal pathogenesis will allow for a more mechanistic description of neutrophil antifungal biology. In addition, the easier handling of the cell line compared to primary human neutrophils allowed us to use PLB-985 cells to provide an improved method for isolation of neutrophil-derived extracellular vesicles using size-exclusion chromatography. Together, these results provide significant tools and a baseline knowledge for the future study of neutrophil-derived extracellular vesicles in the laboratory.","output":"PLB-985 neutrophil-like cells as a model to study Aspergillus fumigatus pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Black lives matter.

When consumed regularly, the tea can be problematic since some of its ingredients can be toxic or interfere with other medications taken by the patient. Current anti-diabetic medications are not always suitable nor optimal for all patients living with diabetes and therefore new drugs are constantly being sought after which may be more useful and/or present less side effects. Therefore, identifying the specific constituents that give the desired anti-diabetic effect, isolating them and developing them further may provide new useful anti-diabetic drugs. This paper discusses some key compounds found in Golden Germander that might be valuable for developing a new medication for type 2 diabetics whilst outlining some issues with the research conducted thus far. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is rising globally and this disease is proposed to be the next pandemic after COVID-19. Although the cause of type 2 diabetes mellitus is unknown, it is believed to involve a complex array of genetic defects that affect metabolic pathways which eventually lead to hyperglycaemia. This hyperglycaemia arises from an inability of the insulin-sensitive cells to sufficiently respond to the secreted insulin, which eventually results in the inadequate secretion of insulin from pancreatic -cells. Several treatments, utilising a variety of mechanisms, are available for type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, more medications are needed to assist with the optimal management of the different stages of the disease in patients of varying ages with the diverse combinations of other medications co-administered. Throughout modern history, some lead constituents from ancient medicinal plants have been investigated extensively and helped in developing synthetic antidiabetic drugs, such as metformin. Teucrium polium L. (Tp) is a herb that has a folk reputation for its antidiabetic potential. Previous studies indicate that Tp extracts significantly decrease blood glucose levels r and induce insulin secretion from pancreatic -cells in vitro. Nonetheless, the constituent/s responsible for this action have not yet been elucidated. The effects appear to be, at least in part, attributable to the presence of selected flavonoids (apigenin, quercetin, and rutin). This review aims to examine the reported glucose-lowering effect of the herb, with a keen focus on insulin secretion, specifically related to type 2 diabetes mellitus. An analysis of the contribution of the key constituent flavonoids of Tp extracts will also be discussed.","output":"Teucrium polium: Potential Drug Source for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a current burgeoning interest in networking as an approach to working more effectively in under-resourced communities.

AIM: Convalescent plasma proved to increase survival rates in other severe viral infections. Therefore, convalescent plasma could be a promising treatment option for severe COVID-19 patients. METHOD: In our article, we present the first two critically ill Hungarian patients with COVID-19 infection treated with convalescent fresh frozen plasma. RESULTS: At the time of plasma therapy both patients were on mechanical ventilation and received antiviral agents and a full scale of supportive care. Each patient received 3  200 mL of convalescent plasma of recently recovered donors with sufficient novel anti-coronavirus IgG titers. Subsequent to convalescent plasma infusion, oxygenization improved and inflammatory markers decreased in both individuals. As compared to pretransfusion, lymphocyte counts increased and interleukin-6 level lessened. Both patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. No severe adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience indicates that convalescent plasma therapy is well tolerated and could potentially improve clinical outcomes.

Previous evidence indicated that sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) is associated with the tumor metastasis. However, the expression and role of SOX2 in BCC remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to analyze the possible mechanism of SOX2 in the progression of BCC. The levels of SOX2 in BCC cells were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transwell assays were also used to determine the migration and invasion of BCC cells. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were used for analyzing the role of SOX2 knockdown in the serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1)-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway in BCC cells. The results demonstrated that SOX2 is overexpressed in BCC tissues and cells. In addition, SOX2 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of BCC cells, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress of BCC cells. It was also observed that SOX2 knockdown decreased SRPK1 expression, which further led to the downregulation of PI3K and AKT expression levels in BCC cells. Furthermore, SRPK1 transfection or PI3K/AKT pathway activation abolished the inhibitory effects of SOX2 knockdown on the migration, invasion and EMT progress of BCC cells. In conclusion, these results indicated that SOX2 may potentially serve as a target for BCC therapy by targeting the SRPK1-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.","output":"SOX2 knockdown inhibits the migration and invasion of basal cell carcinoma cells by targeting the SRPK1-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research aims to explore and investigates which project management methodology is recommended for artificial intelligence (AI) transformation projects.

Relational Practice was identified as the central overarching theme and describes how community services can best support people with complex emotional needs. This approach involves care delivered in a non-stigmatising, individualised, compassionate and trauma-informed manner. It involves care that is planned collaboratively with service users to ensure their multiple needs are addressed in a flexible, holistic and consistent way which accounts for the long-term and fluctuating nature of their needs. Conclusions Relational practice approaches have potential to facilitate better community care for people with complex emotional needs. Research and service development are needed to examine how best to implement such approaches across the mental health service system. This work must be co-produced with people with relevant lived experience, their carers and the professionals who support them.

In pulmonary hypertension, the M1 phenotype is more pro-inflammatory compared to the M2 phenotype, which is involved in tissue repair. The role of macrophages in the initiation and progression of pulmonary hypertension is well studied. However, their role in the regression of established pulmonary hypertension is not well known. Rats chronically exposed to hemoglobin (Hb) plus hypoxia (HX) share similarities to humans with pulmonary hypertension associated with hemolytic disease, including the presence of a unique macrophage phenotype surrounding distal vessels that are associated with vascular remodeling. These lung macrophages are characterized by high iron content, HO-1, ET-1, and IL-6, and are recruited from the circulation. Depletion of macrophages in this model prevents the development of pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling. In this study, we specifically investigate the regression of pulmonary hypertension over a four-week duration after rats were removed from Hb + HX exposure with and without gadolinium chloride administration. Withdrawal of Hb + HX reversed systolic pressures and right ventricular function after Hb + Hx exposure in four weeks. Our data show that depleting circulating monocytes/macrophages during reversal prevents complete recovery of right ventricular systolic pressure and vascular remodeling in this rat model of pulmonary hypertension at four weeks post exposure. The data presented offer a novel insight into the role of macrophages in the processes of pulmonary hypertension regression in a rodent model of Hb + Hx-driven disease.","output":"Evidence supporting a role for circulating macrophages in the regression of vascular remodeling following sub-chronic exposure to hemoglobin plus hypoxia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious virus that has created a health crisis for people all over the world. Social distancing has proved to be an effective non-pharmaceutical measure to slow down the spread of COVID-19. As unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a flexible mobile platform, it is a promising option to use UAV for social distance monitoring. Therefore, we propose a lightweight pedestrian detection network to accurately detect pedestrians by human head detection in real-time and then calculate the social distancing between pedestrians on UAV images. In particular, our network follows the PeleeNet as backbone and further incorporates the multi-scale features and spatial attention to enhance the features of small objects, like human heads. The experimental results on Merge-Head dataset show that our method achieves 92.22% AP (average precision) and 76 FPS (frames per second), outperforming YOLOv3 models and SSD models and enabling real-time detection in actual applications. The ablation experiments also indicate that multi-scale feature and spatial attention significantly contribute the performance of pedestrian detection. The test results on UAV-Head dataset show that our method can also achieve high precision pedestrian detection on UAV images with 88.5% AP and 75 FPS. In addition, we have conducted a precision calibration test to obtain the transformation matrix from images (vertical images and tilted images) to real-world coordinate. Based on the accurate pedestrian detection and the transformation matrix, the social distancing monitoring between individuals is reliably achieved.

A set of 58 molecules belongs to the naphthyridine and quinoline derivatives have been recently synthesized and considered for structure-based virtual screening against Nsp16-Nsp10. Molecular docking was virtually performed to screen for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity against Nsp16-Nsp10. Fourteen out of fifty-eight compounds were exhibited binding affinity higher than co-crystal bound ligand s-adenosylmethionine (SAM) toward Nsp16-Nsp10. Further, the in silico pharmacokinetics assessment was carried out and it was found that two molecules possess the acceptable pharmacokinetic profile, hence considered promising Nsp16-Nsp10 inhibitors. The binding interaction analysis was revealed some crucial binding interactions between the final selected two molecules and ligand-binding amino acid residues of Nsp16-Nsp10 protein. In order to explore the characteristics of the protein-ligand complex and how selected small molecules retained inside the receptor cavity in dynamic states, all-atoms conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed. Several factors were obtained from the MD simulation trajectory evidently suggested the potentiality of the molecules and stability of the protein-ligand complex. Finally, the binding affinity of both molecules and SAM was explored through the MM-GBSA approach which explained that both molecules possess strong affection towards the Nsp16-Nsp10.

Little is known about the frequency and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination in NHs. We characterize SARS-CoV-2 contamination in the rooms of COVID-19 patients and common areas in and around COVID-19 units. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted at four NHs in Michigan between October 2020 and January 2021. Clinical research personnel obtained swab specimens from high-touch room surfaces of COVID-19 infected patients, up to three times per patient. Weekly swab specimens from six high-touch surfaces in common areas were also obtained. Demographic and clinical data were collected from patient clinical records. Our primary outcome of interest was the probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection from specific environmental surfaces in COVID-19 patient rooms. Results One hundred four patients with COVID-19 were enrolled and followed for 241 visits. Patient characteristics included: 61.5% over the age of 80;67.3% female;89.4% non-Hispanic white;50.1% short-stay. The study population had significant disabilities in activities of daily living (ADL;81.7% dependent in four or more ADLs) and comorbidities including dementia (55.8%), diabetes (40.4%) and heart failure (32.7) (Table 1). Over the 3-month study period, 2087 swab specimens were collected (1896 COVID-19 patient room surfaces, 191 common area swabs). Figure 1 shows contamination rates at sites proximate and distant to the patient bed. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 28.4% (538/1896 swabs) on patient room surfaces and 3.7% (7/191 swabs) on common area surfaces. Over the course of follow-up, 89.4% (93/104) of patients had SARS-CoV-2 contamination in their room at least once (Figure 2). Environmental contamination detected on enrollment correlated with contamination of the same site during follow-up. Functional independence increased the odds of proximate contamination. Table 1.

The Rfam data base contains more than five hundred structurally annotated RNA families. Unfortunately, searching for new family members using covariance models (CMs) is very time consuming. Filtering approaches that use the sequence conservation to reduce the number of CM searches, are fast, but it is unknown to which sacrifice. RESULTS We present a new filtering approach, which exploits the family specific secondary structure and significantly reduces the number of CM searches. The filter eliminates approximately 85% of the queries and discards only 2.6% true positives when evaluating Rfam against itself. First results also capture previously undetected non-coding RNAs in a recent human RNAz screen. CONCLUSION The RNA shape index filter (RNAsifter) is based on the following rationale: An RNA family is characterised by structure, much more succinctly than by sequence content. Structures of individual family members, which naturally have different length and sequence composition, may exhibit structural variation in detail, but overall, they have a common shape in a more abstract sense. Given a fixed release of the Rfam data base, we can compute these abstract shapes for all families. This is called a shape index. If a query sequence belongs to a certain family, it must be able to fold into the family shape with reasonable free energy. Therefore, rather than matching the query against all families in the data base, we can first (and quickly) compute its feasible shape(s), and use the shape index to access only those families where a good match is possible due to a common shape with the query.","output":"Shape based indexing for faster search of RNA family databases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Glissonian approach, due to its simplicity of procedure, is a technical procedure widely used in open hepatectomy. However, it is not easily applicable in the setting of the total laparoscopic approach because of movement restriction. We herein propose a new and simple method of performing hemihepatectomy by Glissonian approach called temporary inflow control of the Glissonian pedicle (TICGL) technique. Dissection of the Glisson pedicle from the liver parenchyma is done until the posterior margin of the pedicle is visualized, and is clamped with bulldog clamps. Encircling the pedicle is not necessary. Resection of the liver parenchyma is performed under inflow control of the resected side liver providing less bleeding. After sufficient resection is done so that the whole Glissonian pedicle structures are visualized, the pedicle is encircled, often very easily without the fear of bleeding from the posterior side of the pedicle, which is a common problem when encircling is done before parenchymal resection. The staplers may then be applied safely without injuring the major hepatic veins since they have been already exposed. Stapling is done while the tape is retracted toward the contralateral side. This retraction prevents injury or stricture of the contralateral Glissonian pedicle branch. The remnant liver parenchyma is resected and hepatectomy finalized. The TICGL technique provides a safe and easy way of performing major hemihepatectomies, not only by expert laparoscopic surgeons but by less experienced surgeons. It can therefore become a standard method of performing hemihepatectomy by Glissonian approach.","output":"Application of temporary inflow control of the Glissonean pedicle method provides a safe and easy technique for totally laparoscopic hemihepatectomy by Glissonean approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is characterised by a heterogeneous clinical presentation and a wide range of imaging findings, depending on disease severity and time course. The pathophysiology is complex, involving immune and hematologic systems, epithelial cells and vascular system and to date reliable biomarkers aimed at stratifying patients and predicting worse outcomes have not been identified Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe clinical, serological and CT imaging features of a cohort of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and identify possible relationships between the variables and disease outcomes (admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and/or death). Methods: We evaluated hospitalized patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical signs of COVID-19 and computed tomography (CT) scan-proven pulmonary involvement. Clinical and serological records of patients admitted to two COVID-19 Units in Italy with proven SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary involvement investigated with CT scan, assessed at the time of admission to the hospital, were retrospectively collected. Results: Sixty-one patients (22 females and 39 males) of median age 65 years were enrolled. Fifty-six patients were discharged while death occurred in 5 patients. None of the lung abnormalities detected by CT was different between discharged and deceased patients. No differences were observed in the features and extent of pulmonary involvement according to age and gender. Logistic regression analysis with age and gender as covariates demonstrated that ferritin levels over the 25th percentile were associated with the involvement of all 5 pulmonary lobes (OR=14.5, 95% CI=2.3-90.9, p=0.004), the presence of septal thickening (OR=8.2, 95% CI=1.6-40.9, p=0.011) and the presence of mediastinal lymph node enlargement (OR=12.0, 95% CI=1.1-127.5, p=0.039) independently of age and gender. Conclusion: We demonstrated that ferritin levels over the 25th percentile are associated with a more severe pulmonary involvement, independently of age and gender, but not with disease outcomes (admission to ICU/death).

However, since shifts in infection susceptibility after commensal bacteria eradication have primarily been probed using viruses, the broader applicability to other pathogen types remains undefined. In sharp contrast to diminished antiviral immunity, we show commensal bacteria eradication bolsters protection against disseminated Candida albicans fungal infection. Enhanced antifungal immunity reflects more robust systemic expansion of Ly6G(hi)Ly6C(int) neutrophils, and their mobilization into infected tissues among antibiotic treated compared with commensal bacteria replete control mice. Reciprocally, depletion of neutrophils from expanded levels or intestinal LPS reconstitution overrides the antifungal protective benefits conferred by commensal bacteria eradication. This discordance in antifungal compared with antiviral immunity highlights intrinsic differences in how commensal bacteria control responsiveness for specific immune cell subsets because pathogen-specific CD8(+) T cells that protect against viruses were suppressed similarly after C. albicans and influenza A virus infection. Thus, positive calibration of antiviral immunity by commensal bacteria is counterbalanced by restrained activation of other immune components that confer antifungal immunity.","output":"Commensal enteric bacteria lipopolysaccharide impairs host defense against disseminated Candida albicans fungal infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A Resequencing Pathogen Microarray (RPM) is a single, highly multiplexed assay for detecting and differentiating similarly related pathogens by using closely overlapping probe sets to determine a target organisms nucleotide sequence.

Animals in each group were sacrificed at 1 h or 8 h after the instillation. Pulmonary histological changes were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The levels of NF-B and TNF- were measured by qRT-PCR. Expressions of NF-B in lung cells and TNF- in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined by western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. RESULTS: LPS administration reduced the rectal temperature and white blood cell counts at 1 h, increased lung wet/dry weight ratios, caused evident lung histopathological injury, and increased the detectable transcript and cytokine levels of TNF- in lung tissue in BALF. siRNA targeting of NF-B p65 effectively abrogated the expression of NF-B p65 in lung cells and, aside from rectal temperatures, ameliorated all changes induced by LPS.

The United Kingdoms National Endoscopy Database (NED) automatically captures patient level data in real time and provides endoscopy key performance indicators (KPI) at a national, endoscopy center, and individual level. Using an electronic behavior change intervention, the primary objective of this study is to assess if automated feedback of endoscopist and endoscopy center-level optimal procedure-adjusted detection KPI (opadKPI) improves polyp detection performance. Methods This multicenter, prospective, cluster-randomized controlled trial is randomizing NHS endoscopy centres to either intervention or control. The intervention is targeted at independent colonoscopists and each centers endoscopy lead. The intervention reports are evidence-based from endoscopist qualitative interviews and informed by psychological theories of behavior. NED automatically creates monthly reports providing an opadKPI, using mean number of polyps, and an action plan. The primary outcome is opadKPI comparing endoscopists in intervention and control centers at 9 months. Secondary outcomes include other KPI and proximal detection measures at 9 and 12 months. A nested histological validation study will correlate opadKPI to adenoma detection rate at the center level. A cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis will be undertaken. Conclusion If the intervention is efficacious and cost-effective, we will showcase the potential of this learning health system, which can be implemented at local and national levels to improve colonoscopy quality, and demonstrate that an automated system that collects, analyses, and disseminates real-time clinical data can deliver evidence- and theory-informed feedback.","output":"The National Endoscopy Database (NED) Automated Performance Reports to Improve Quality Outcomes Trial (APRIQOT) randomized controlled trial design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hysterectomy is a potential risk factor for subsequent surgery for pelvic organ prolapse, especially when the prolapse exists before hysterectomy.

Vaginal length was measured before and after colposuspension after complete hysterectomy. Preoperative characteristics of the patients, perioperative quality, postoperative outcomes, and vaginal length differences were analyzed.Vaginal length increased by a mean of 2.59 cm after colposuspension. The mean extra-operative time needed for laparoscopic colposuspension was about 10 minutes. No severe complications were reported in our patients, and we did not find any cystocele after completing vaginal cuff suspension to the round ligament.The vaginal apex level was maintained in our modified laparoscopic hysterectomy. Therefore, laparoscopic colposuspension with round ligaments is a promising option as a routine, first-line standard procedure in younger women without genital prolapse to maintain an acceptable vaginal length after laparoscopic hysterectomy.","output":"Effect of modified laparoscopic hysterectomy on pelvic floor function: A retrospective observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of \\"Corona Virus Disease 2019\\" (COVID-19) has changed the lives of people.

Due to this virus declared by the World Health Organization as a pandemic, the health authorities of the countries are constantly trying to reduce the spread rate of the virus by emphasizing the rules of masks, social distance, and hygiene. COVID-19 is highly contagious and spreads rapidly globally and early detection is of paramount importance. Any technological tool that can provide rapid detection of COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be very useful to medical professionals. The disease findings on COVID-19 images, such as computed tomography (CT) and X-rays, are similar to other lung infections, making it difficult for medical professionals to distinguish COVID-19. Therefore, computer-aided diagnostic solutions are being developed to facilitate the identification of positive COVID-19 cases. The method currently used as a gold standard in detecting the virus is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Due to the high false-negative rate of this test and the delays in the test results, alternative solutions are sought. This study was conducted to investigate the contribution of machine learning and image processing to the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from two of the most widely used different medical imaging modes, chest X-ray and CT images. The main purpose of this study is to support early diagnosis and treatment to end the coronavirus epidemic as soon as possible. One of the primary aims of the study is to provide support to medical professionals who are most worn out and working under intense stress during COVID-19 through smart learning methods and image classification models. The proposed approach was applied to three different public COVID-19 data sets and consists of five basic steps: data set acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, dimension reduction, and classification stages. Each stage has its sub-operations. The proposed model performs in considerable levels of COVID-19 detection for dataset-1 (CT), dataset-2 (X-ray) and dataset-3 (CT) with the accuracy of 89.41%, 99.02%, 98.11%, respectively. On the other hand, in the X-ray data set, an accuracy of 85.96% was obtained for COVID-19 (+), COVID-19 (-), and those with Pneumonia but not COVID-19 classes. As a result of the study, it has been shown that COVID-19 can be detected with a high success rate in about less than one minute with image processing and classical learning methods. In the light of the findings, it is possible to say that the proposed system will help radiologists in their decisions, will be useful in the early diagnosis of the virus, and can distinguish pneumonia caused by the COVID-19 virus from the pneumonia of other diseases.","output":"A new approach for computer-aided detection of coronavirus (COVID-19) from CT and X-ray images using machine learning methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work we looked into a dataset of 114 thousands of suspicious messages collected from the most popular closed messaging platform in Taiwan between January and July, 2020.

A total of 171 COVID-19-related interventional trials were identified on Feb 22, 2020. These trials are classified into 4 categories based on treatment modalities, including chemical drugs (CDs), biological therapies (BTs), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatments and other therapies. Results: Our analysis focused on the issues of stage, design, randomization, blinding, primary endpoints (PEs) definition and sample size of these trials. Although most trials use parallel-arm design (88.3%) and randomization (77.2%), blinding is applied in only 25 trials (14.6%). More than half of the trials planned to recruit .100 patients, indicating a possibility of insufficient statistical power. About one third of trials will recruit severe and critically ill patients. More trials on traditional Chinese medical treatment use 2 or more PEs than those on CDs or biological treatments (57.6%, 39.4% and 40.5%, respectively).

By modelling the calls as background (proportional to population) plus signal (proportional to infected), we fit the calls in Province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) with coefficient of determination R(2) > 0.85. This result allows us to estimate the number of cases given the number of calls from a specific district, days before the laboratory results are available. We validate the algorithm with real data. We show how to use the algorithm to track on-stream the epidemic, and present the Early Outbreak Alarm to detect outbreaks in advance of laboratory results. One key point in the developed algorithm is a detailed track of the uncertainties in the estimations, since the alarm uses the significance of the observables as a main indicator to detect an anomaly.

In the diagnosis and treatment of drug-induced lung disease, it is important to distinguish pneumonia as an infectious disorder. Immune checkpoint inhibitors(ICIs)have been widely introduced to treat several types of malignancies. It is currently believed that ICIs do not increase the risk of infections. However, immune-related adverse events(irAEs)induced by ICIs may necessitate the administration of immunosuppressive agents, which could cause opportunistic infections.

Sia come in a variety of chemically modified forms, including those with acetyl modifications at the C7, C8, and C9 positions. Here, we analyzed the distribution and amounts of these acetyl modifications in different human and canine cells. As Sia or their variant forms are receptors for influenza A and influenza C viruses, we examined the effects of these modifications on virus infections. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl and 7,9-O-acetyl modified Sia are widely but variably expressed across cell lines from both humans and canines. While they were expressed on the cell surface of canine MDCK cell lines, they were located primarily within the Golgi compartment of human HEK-293 and A549 cells. The O-acetyl modified Sia were expressed at low levels of 1-2% of total Sia in these cell lines. We knocked out and over-expressed the sialate O-acetyltransferase gene (CasD1), and knocked out the sialate O-acetylesterase gene (SIAE) using CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Knocking out CasD1 removed 7,9-O- and 9-O-acetyl Sia expression, confirming previous reports. However, over-expression of CasD1 and knockout of SIAE gave only modest increases in 9-O-acetyl levels in cells and no change in 7,9-O-acetyl levels, indicating that there are complex regulations of these modifications. These modifications were essential for influenza C infection, but had no obvious effect on influenza A infection. Sialic acids are key glycans that are involved in many different normal cellular functions, as well as being receptors for many pathogens. However, Sia come in diverse chemically modified forms.

AIM In cooperation with the Federal Office of Public Health, we set up a surveillance database in February 2020 to monitor hospitalised patients with COVID-19, in addition to their mandatory reporting system. METHODS Patients hospitalised for more than 24 hours with a positive polymerase chain-reaction test, from 20 Swiss hospitals, are included. Data were collected in a customised case report form based on World Health Organisation recommendations and adapted to local needs. Nosocomial infections were defined as infections for which the onset of symptoms was more than 5 days after the patients admission date. RESULTS As of 1 September 2020, 3645 patients were included. Most patients were male (2168, 59.5%), and aged between 50 and 89 years (2778, 76.2%), with a median age of 68 (interquartile range 54C79). Community infections dominated with 3249 (89.0%) reports. Comorbidities were frequently reported, with hypertension (1481, 61.7%), cardiovascular diseases (948, 39.5%) and diabetes (660, 27.5%) being the most frequent in adults; respiratory diseases and asthma (4, 21.1%), haematological and oncological diseases (3, 15.8%) were the most frequent in children. Complications occurred in 2679 (73.4%) episodes, mostly respiratory diseases (2470, 93.2% in adults; 16, 55.2% in children), and renal (681, 25.7%) and cardiac (631, 23.8%) complications for adults. The second and third most frequent complications in children affected the digestive system and the liver (7, 24.1%). A targeted treatment was given in 1299 (35.6%) episodes, mostly with hydroxychloroquine (989, 76.1%). Intensive care units stays were reported in 578 (15.8%) episodes. A total of 527 (14.5%) deaths were registered, all among adults. CONCLUSION The surveillance system has been successfully initiated and provides a robust set of data for Switzerland by including about 80% (compared with official statistics) of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 hospitalised patients, with similar age and comorbidity distributions.

Serum containing remdesivir or GS-441524 was circulated in a custom-made system containing a CytoSorb? device. Concentrations of remdesivir and GS-441524 before and after the adsorber were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Measurements of remdesivir in the outgoing tube after the adsorber indicated almost complete removal of remdesivir by the device. In the reservoir, concentration of remdesivir showed an exponential decay and was not longer detectable after 60 mins. GS-441524 showed a similar exponential decay but, unlike remdesivir, it reached an adsorption-desorption equilibrium at ~48 g/L. Remdesivir and its main active metabolite GS-441524 are rapidly eliminated from the perfusate by the CytoSorb? adsorber device in vitro. This should be considered in patients for whom both therapies are indicated, and simultaneous application should be avoided.

Ensemble avec les partenaires des diffrents ministres et administrations, il a t possible de faire face  la premire vague du COVID-19. Malgr sa cration rcente, le jeune tablissement public a montr son efficacit dans la gestion des crises complexes, telle que la crise sanitaire actuelle lie au COVID-19. With the law of March 27th, 2018, the Luxembourg Fire and Rescue Corps (Corps Grand-ducal dincendie et de secours - CGDIS) has been created as a public service. On July 1st, 2018, all emergency care and firefighters, including all volunteer and professional firefighter units, the airport fire brigade, the civil protection units as well as the prehospital medical emergency service merged to become the CGDIS. Due to its single chain of command and structure, all emergency units on the field can efficiently work together through a better coordination in all situations. With approximately 5000 firefighters, of which some 500 professionals, the CGDIS was well prepared for the first COVID-19 wave. The straight organization and the many competencies concentrated within the CGDIS positioned it as a key player in the handling of this crisis beside the involved ministries and administrations. Even though CGDIS has only recently been created, it undoubtedly showed its necessity and efficacy in the management of complex situations like this sanitary crisis.","output":"Le Corps grand-ducal dincendie et de secours.

While there are a plethora of atlases built with cadaveric images, radiology, and artist-rendered 3D models, we often find a disconnect between the complex geometry of many anatomical structures and the 2D screen interfaces used by students to access these digital resources. The open-source Mozilla Hubs platform allows for the creation of customizable 3D virtual spaces, accessible via URL on a mobile, desktop, or virtual reality (VR) device. This platform was used to create four educational experiences deployed to first and second year medical students during pre-clerkship courses: a desktop-based tour of the surface and chambers of the heart; a VR tour of the chambers of the heart; a desktop-based foregut escape room integrated with questions and multimedia clinical supplements; and a VR tour of the structure and neurovasculature of the pterygopalatine fossa. In each experience, the students are immersed within these anatomical spaces, encouraged to explore and appreciate the spatial relationships and orientations of key internal structures. When applicable, radiological imaging, videos, and animations display physiologic processes, the flow of blood and other fluids, and the functionality of a given structure in vivo. Audio and text instructions, labels, and additional information guide student learning, encouraging directed exploration while immersed in the experience. This presentation will discuss the four experiences, display real-time video capture of the interactions and spaces, their deployment, educational value, and student reception. Students' feedback suggests that the context and timing of the deployment of these experiences is crucial for student learning and appreciation, including the role of faculty assistance and training on how to navigate the interface prior to the educational intervention. Qualitative feedback and performance on pre- and post- experience quizzes show that these experiences are both statistically and perceptually valuable educational resources, and that the novel nature of this experience is engaging and exciting to students when deployed appropriately.

This study aimed to unravel the possible involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating PHLPP2 in colon cancer. Expressions of candidate lncRNAs and miRNAs were verified by the RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses in colon cancer. The roles of candidate genes in colon cancer were investigated in HT-29 cells in vitro and in mouse tumor xenograft model in vivo. PHLPP2, a target of miR-141 and miR-424, was downregulated in colon cancer. PHLPP2 upregulation and miR-141 and miR-424 downregulation suppressed the colon cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and promote cell apoptosis, which also resulted in suppression of tumor metastasis and formation. Furthermore, LINC00402, LINC00461, and SFTA1P were identified as the targets of miR-141 and miR-424 and acted as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) of PHLPP2. The upregulation of LINC00402, LINC00461, and SFTA1P was verified to enhance the suppressive effects of PHLPP2 in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. Conjointly, our results demonstrated the suppressive effects of PHLPP2 in colon cancer and proved that LINC00402, LINC00461, and SFTA1P acted as ceRNAs of PHLPP2 by competitive binding to miR-141 and miR-424.","output":"PHLPP2 is regulated by competing endogenous RNA network in pathogenesis of colon cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The prognostic value of the national early warning score (NEWS) in patients with infections remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of NEWS for prediction of in-hospital mortality in patients with infections outside the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for related articles from January 2012 to April 2021. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were pooled by using the bivariate random-effects model. Overall prognostic performance was summarized by using the area under the curve (AUC). We performed subgroup analyses to assess the prognostic accuracy of NEWS in selected populations. Results: A total of 21 studies with 107,008 participants were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of NEWS were 0.71 and 0.60. The pooled AUC of NEWS was 0.70, which was similar to quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA, AUC: 0.70) and better than systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS, AUC: 0.60). However, the sensitivity (0.55) and AUC (0.63) of NEWS were poor in elder patients. The NEWS of 5 was more sensitive, which was a better threshold for activating urgent assessment and treatment. Conclusions: The NEWS had good diagnostic accuracy for early prediction of mortality in patients with infections outside the ICU, and the sensitivity and specificity were more moderate when compared with qSOFA and SIRS. Insufficient sensitivity and poor performance in the elder population may have limitations as an early warning score for adverse outcomes. NEWS should be used for continuous monitoring rather than a single time point predictive tool.","output":"National Early Warning Score Does Not Accurately Predict Mortality for Patients With Infection Outside the Intensive Care Unit: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text].","output":"Assessing mass incarceration's effects on families."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is due to a defect in the diaphragm and is usually detected soon after birth.

Recovery of the Golgi complex from brefeldin A (BFA) treatment was inhibited by caffeine at reduced temperature (20 degrees C) suggesting that caffeine inhibits the membrane traffic between the ER and the Golgi complex. Caffeine at 20 degrees C did not inhibit the BFA-induced retrograde movement of the Golgi membranes. Further, incubation of the cells in 10 mM caffeine at 20 degrees C had profound effects on the distribution and the organization of the pre-Golgi and the Golgi stack membranes. Caffeine treatment at 20 degrees C resulted in a selective and reversible translocation of the pre- and cis-Golgi marker protein (p58) to the periphery of the cell. This caffeine-induced effect on the Golgi complex was different from that induced by BFA, since mannosidase II, a Golgi stack marker, remained perinuclearly located and the Golgi stack coat protein, beta-COP, was not detached from Golgi membranes in the presence of 10 mM caffeine at 20 degrees C. Electron microscopic analysis showed that, in the presence of caffeine at 20 degrees C, the morphology of the Golgi stack was altered and accumulation of numerous small vesicles in the Golgi region was observed. The results in the present study suggest that caffeine at reduced temperature (20 degrees C) reveals a functional interface between the pre-Golgi and the Golgi stack.","output":"Effect of caffeine and reduced temperature (20 degrees C) on the organization of the pre-Golgi and the Golgi stack membranes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is shed in the feces of infected people.

Although the presence of viral RNA does not inform on the infectivity of the virus, this presence of genetic material raised the question of the effectiveness of treatment processes in reducing the virus in wastewater and sludge. In this work, treatment lines of 16 wastewater treatment plants were monitored to evaluate the removal of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw, processed waters and sludge, from March to May 2020. Viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in 5 different laboratories. These laboratories participated in proficiency testing scheme and their results demonstrated the reliability and comparability of the results obtained for each one. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in 50.5% of the 101 influent wastewater samples characterized. Positive results were detected more frequently in those regions with a COVID-19 incidence higher than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) significantly reduced the occurrence of virus RNA along the water treatment lines. Secondary treatment effluents showed an occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 23.3% of the samples and no positive results were found after MBR and chlorination. Non-treated sludge (from primary and secondary treatments) presented a higher occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA than the corresponding water samples, demonstrating the affinity of virus particles for solids. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in treated sludge after thickening and anaerobic digestion, whereas viral RNA was completely eliminated from sludge only when thermal hydrolysis was applied. Finally, co-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and F-specific RNA bacteriophages was done in the same water and sludge samples in order to investigate the potential use of these bacteriophages as indicators of SARS-CoV-2 fate and reduction along the wastewater treatment.","output":"Elimination of SARS-CoV-2 along wastewater and sludge treatment processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Water sampling is an essential undertaking for water utilities and agencies to protect and enhance our natural resources.

A multitude of immunological changes characterizes pregnancy to create the optimal milieu for the unborn child. Both these immunological changes and pre-conceptional, sub-optimal disease control may affect the severity of the respective allergic disease manifestations during pregnancy and pose a risk for mother and child. Due to apparent limitations in conducting clinical trials, safety data on anti-allergic drugs during pregnancy are limited. This lack of clinical evidence demands to counsel between potential and known risks and benefits of anti-allergic drugs. This includes the potential of disease aggravation in the absence of treatment. By doing so, informed decisions and shared decision-making is facilitated. In particular, in patients with severe asthma, education about the risk of uncontrolled asthma for mother and child should be part of regular care. This review focuses on the management of allergic diseases during pregnancy, maternal counseling, and available information/evidence regarding allergic diseases management and treatment during pregnancy.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Systematic search of the literature for NSAIDs approved by the FDA (2000-2010). RESULTS One new orally-administered NSAID molecule (meloxicam), two orally-administered NSAID formulations (naproxen plus lansoprazole; oxycodone/ibuprofen), and three topical NSAID formulations (diclofenac patch, gel, and solution) were approved by the FDA (2000-2010). A systematic literature review found evidence to support efficacy in treating patients with OA for all agents except oxycodone/ibuprofen, which has not been studied in this patient population, although ibuprofen and immediate-release oxycodone have been studied individually for OA pain. Evidence quality was inconsistent, with several agents lacking long-term, controlled trials against active comparators, and functional end points inconsistently met. Although low-dose meloxicam and naproxen plus lansoprazole offer a reduced risk of adverse gastrointestinal (GI) events, cardiovascular and renal risks remain similar to traditional oral NSAID therapy. Further, only lower doses of meloxicam appear to carry a reduced risk of GI events. Diclofenac patch, gel, and solution preparations offer the potential for reduced GI, cardiovascular, and renal adverse events. The level of evidence available to support the efficacy and safety of these agents for long-term treatment of patients with OA differs, with some having only short-term trials, while others have longer-duration trials with active comparators. CONCLUSIONS By expanding the treatment armamentarium, newly-approved NSAID agents may improve the ability of clinicians to tailor analgesic therapy for their diverse patient populations and to achieve realistic functional improvements. The comparisons in this article were limited to drugs that received approval after 2000 and should be considered accordingly.","output":"Recent developments in the treatment of osteoarthritis with NSAIDs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several potent neutralizing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus have been identified.

Prior rural health research suggests such disparities may be exacerbated during the pandemic and in remote parts of the U.S. OBJECTIVES: To understand the spread and impact of COVID-19 across the U.S., county level data for confirmed cases of COVID-19 were examined by Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and Metropolitan vs. Nonmetropolitan designations from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These designations were the basis for making comparisons between Urban and Rural jurisdictions. METHOD: Kendall's Tau-B was used to compare effect sizes between jurisdictions on select ADI composites and well researched social determinants of health (SDH). Spearman coefficients and stratified Poisson modeling was used to explore the association between ADI and COVID-19 prevalence in the context of county designation. RESULTS: Results show that the relationship between area deprivation and COVID-19 prevalence was positive and higher for rural counties, when compared to urban ones. Family income, property value and educational attainment were among the ADI component measures most correlated with prevalence, but this too differed between county type. CONCLUSIONS: Though most Americans live in Metropolitan Areas, rural communities were found to be associated with a stronger relationship between deprivation and COVID-19 prevalence.

METHODS: We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis from 1 January 2017 to 6 September 2020 based on the Yinzhou Health Information System in Ningbo, Zhejiang province. The beginning of the intervention was on 23 January 2020, and thus, there were 160 weeks before the intervention and 32 weeks after the implementation of the intervention.

Cell viability (by Calcein-AM staining) and ECD of five grafts originally scheduled for transplantation were evaluated on the originally planned surgery day, whereas 22 grafts from paired donor corneas were evaluated either directly post-preparation or after 3-7 days of storage. ECD was analyzed by light microscopy (LM ECD) and Calcein-AM staining (Calcein-ECD).Results: Light microscopy (LM) evaluation of all grafts showed an unremarkable endothelial cell monolayer directly after preparation. However, median Calcein-ECD for the five grafts initially allocated for transplantation was 18% (range 92-73%) lower than median LM ECD. For the paired DMEK grafts, Calcein-ECD determined by Calcein-AM staining on the day of graft preparation and after 3-7 days of graft storage showed a median decrease of 1% and 2%, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the experiences and attitudes of elementary school students and their parents (two generations from the same family) toward online learning in China during the pandemic. METHODS: A 16-item questionnaire was distributed at the 10-day and 40-day marks after the start of the first online course to 867 parent-child pairs and 141 parent-child pairs, respectively. The questionnaire was comprised of questions pertaining to course and homework completeness, effectiveness, reliability, and abundance as well as the students' enthusiasm for taking part in online classes and their satisfaction with the courses. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that 90.7% (786/867) of students exhibited high or moderate enthusiasm for participating in online classes. However, most students performed poorly in online learning classes and after-school homework. With regard to satisfaction, parents' and students' average scores were 7.35 and 7.25, respectively (10-point scoring system). During the second stage of this study, parents' positive evaluations for online learning declined, including those for the effectiveness and reliability of the courses. Furthermore, the proportion of students who completed the courses and homework on time decreased; this difference proved statistically significant (P=.047). The parents' and students' overall satisfaction with online learning also declined during the second stage (parents: 7.21; students: 7.23); however, the difference in overall satisfaction between the two stages was not statistically significant (parents: P=.53; students: P=.60). Several of the parents (315/867, 36.2%) indicated that assisting with and supervising the students' online learning resulted in increased stress. Further, 36% of parents expressed dissatisfaction with or provided suggestions for online learning; most parents and students hoped to return to face-to-face classes (parents: 823/867, 94.9%; students: 811/867, 93.5%). Finally, our results presented the following six main issues that parents were the most concerned about: (1) disappointment regarding timely interaction in courses; (2) apprehensiveness about students' understanding of the course; (3) the increased burden of annoying adult responsibilities; (4) concern about children's eyesight; (5) the idea that teachers' explanations were not detailed enough; and (6) concerns about the decline of students' interest in and attention toward online courses. CONCLUSIONS: Online learning can prevent the spread of infectious diseases while still allowing elementary school students to attain knowledge. However, in our study, children's completion of the courses and homework were not satisfactory. Furthermore, their parents often experienced stress and had many concerns and complaints. Measures such as increasing the interactivity of the courses and prohibiting teachers from assigning tasks to parents could improve the effectiveness of these courses and the mental health of parents and students.","output":"Experiences and Attitudes of Elementary School Students and Their Parents Toward Online Learning in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Questionnaire Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is in urgent need of therapeutic options.

The study of the prognostic value of SPOCK1 in ccRCC is a good complement to the study of ccRCC biomarkers. Methods Databases of this study included Oncomine, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, GEPIA, GeneMANIA, cBioPortal, and TIMER. Student's t-test was used to analyze the differences in SPOCK1 expression in ccRCC tissues compared with tumor-adjacent normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier curves for survival analysis were used to assess the correlation between the expression of SPOCK1 and the prognostic outcomes. Correlation module drew the expression scatterplots between SPOCK1 and immune cell infiltration in ccRCC, together with the Spearman's rho value and estimated statistical significance. Results The SPOCK1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in ccRCC tissues (mean expression  SD: 920.2195.2) than in normal tissues (mean expression  SD: 358.429.1, P=0.008), and high SPOCK1 expression significantly and positively correlated with the pathological stage of ccRCC patients (F value =10.2, P<0.001).

Uncovering the mechanisms of cell volume regulation by astrocytes will be important for identifying novel therapeutic targets for neurological conditions, such as those characterized by imbalances to hydro saline challenges (as in edema) or by altered cell volume regulation (as in glioma). One major challenge in studying the astroglial membrane channels involved in volume homeostasis in cell culture model systems is that the expression patterns of these membrane channels do not resemble those observed in vivo. In our previous study, we demonstrated that rat primary astrocytes grown on nanostructured interfaces based on hydrotalcite-like compounds (HTlc) in vitro are differentiated and display molecular and functional properties of in vivo astrocytes, such as the functional expression of inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Kir 4.1) and Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) at the astrocytic microdomain. Here, we take advantage of the properties of differentiated primary astrocytes in vitro to provide an insight into the mechanism underpinning astrocytic cell volume regulation and its correlation with the expression and function of AQP4, Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4(TRPV4), and Volume Regulated Anion Channel (VRAC). METHODS: The calcein quenching method was used to study water transport and cell volume regulation. Calcium imaging and electrophysiology (patch-clamp) were used for functional analyses of calcium dynamics and chloride currents. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to analyse the expression and localization of the channel proteins of interest. RESULTS: We found that the increase in water permeability, previously observed in differentiated astrocytes, occurs simultaneously with more efficient regulatory volume increase and regulatory volume decrease. Accordingly, the magnitude of the hypotonic induced intracellular calcium response, typically mediated by TRPV4, as well as the hypotonic induced VRAC current, was almost twice as high in differentiated astrocytes. Interestingly, while we confirmed increased AQP4 expression in the membrane of differentiated astrocytes, the expression of the channels TRPV4 and Leucine-Rich Repeats-Containing 8-A (LRRC8-A) were comparable between differentiated and non-differentiated astrocytes. CONCLUSION: The reported results indicate that AQP4 up-regulation observed in differentiated astrocytes might promote higher sensitivity of the cell to osmotic changes, resulting in increased magnitude of calcium signaling and faster kinetics of the RVD and RVI processes.

We review over fundamentals and the challenging steps of Zero-Shot Learning, including state-of-the-art categories of solutions, as well as our recommended solution, motivations behind each approach, their advantages over each category to guide both clinicians and AI researchers to proceed with the best techniques and practices based on their applications. Inspired from different settings and extensions, we then review through different datasets inducing medical and non-medical images, the variety of splits, and the evaluation protocols proposed so far. Finally, we discuss the recent applications and future directions of ZSL. We aim to convey a useful intuition through this paper towards the goal of handling complex learning tasks more similar to the way humans learn. We mainly focus on two applications in the current modern yet challenging era: coping with an early and fast diagnosis of COVID-19 cases, and also encouraging the readers to develop other similar AI-based automated detection [Formula: see text] recognition systems using ZSL.","output":"Zero-Shot Learning and its Applications from Autonomous Vehicles to COVID-19 Diagnosis: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Diabetic retinopathy remains a leading cause of visual loss in people of working age. We examined whether candesartan treatment could slow the progression and, secondly, induce regression of retinopathy in people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS We did a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial in 309 centres worldwide. We recruited normoalbuminuric, normotensive, or treated hypertensive people with type 2 diabetes with mild to moderately severe retinopathy and assigned them to candesartan 16 mg once a day or placebo. After a month, the dose was doubled to 32 mg once per day. Investigators and patients were unaware of the treatment allocation status. Progression of retinopathy was the primary endpoint, and regression was a secondary endpoint. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00252694. FINDINGS 1905 participants (aged 37-75 years) were randomised to candesartan (n=951) or placebo (n=954). 161 (17%) patients in the candesartan group and 182 (19%) in the placebo group had progression of retinopathy by three steps or more on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale. The risk of progression of retinopathy was non-significantly reduced by 13% in patients on candesartan compared with those on placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.70-1.08, p=0.20). Regression on active treatment was increased by 34% (1.34, 1.08-1.68, p=0.009). HRs were not attenuated by adjustment for baseline risk factors or changes in blood pressure during the trial. An overall change towards less severe retinopathy by the end of the trial was observed in the candesartan group (odds 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.30, p=0.003). Adverse events did not differ between the treatment groups.

Identification of predictors of poor outcomes will assist medical staff in treatment and allocating limited healthcare resources. Aims The primary aim was to study the value of D-dimer as a predictive marker for in-hospital mortality. Methods This was a cohort study. The study population consisted of hospitalized patients (age >18 years), who were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on real-time PCR at 9 hospitals during the first COVID-19 wave in Lombardy, Italy (Feb-May 2020). The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Information was obtained from patient records. Statistical analyses were performed using a Fine-Gray competing risk survival model. Model discrimination was assessed using Harrells C-index and model calibration was assessed using a calibration plot. Results Out of 1049 patients, 501 patients had evaluable data. Of these 501 patients, 96 died. The cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality within 30 days was 20% (95CI: 16%-23%), and the majority of deaths occurred within the first 10 days. A prediction model containing D-dimer as the only predictor had a C-index of 0.66 (95%CI: 0.61-0.71). Overall calibration of the model was very poor. The addition of D-dimer to a model containing age, sex and co-morbidities as predictors did not lead to any meaningful improvement in either the C-index or the calibration plot. Conclusion The predictive value of D-dimer alone was moderate, and the addition of D-dimer to a simple model containing basic clinical characteristics did not lead to any improvement in model performance.","output":"The usefulness of D-dimer as a predictive marker for mortality in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized during the first wave in Italy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease of pandemic proportions There are only a few reports about urinary abnormalities in this disease, and to our knowledge there are no reports about the usefulness of urinary sediment on prognosis Our aim was to describe the urinary abnormalities in COVID-19 and to assess the utility of urinary sediment on prognosis in COVID-19 Methods: Prospective, single-center study, in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (with a positive RT-PCR test), who were admitted in our hospital, from April 2020 to date, and whose urine sample could be obtained at admission to the isolation wing Results: 22 patients were included;17 (77 3%) had proteinuria, 12 (54 5%) had microscopic hematuria, and 9 (40 9%) had leukocyturia Granular casts (with a Chawla cast scoring index greater than 3) were present in 8 (36 4%) patients Of the 8 patients with granular cast, 6 developed an AKI (75%), 2 required Hemodialysis (25%) and 3 died (37 5%) Of the 14 patients whose urinary sediment was classified as bland, 5 developed an AKI (35 7%), none of them required hemodialysis, and 2 subsequently died (14 2%) There was a statistically significant difference between a bland urinary sediment and a sediment showing granular casts for the need of hemodialysis or death (p=0 02), with a positive LR of 3 5 Conclusions: The urinary sediment is a cheap, available tool for the prognosis of need for hemodialysis or death in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and should be taken into consideration in the assessment of these patients by the Nephrology department","output":"Urinary abnormalities and urinary sediment findings in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We provide the expected constructions of weakly $\\\\omega$-categorified models (in the sense of Bressie) of the theory of groups and quandles which arise by replacing the homotopies used to give equivalence relations in the theory of fundamental groups, fundamental quandles, and knot quandles with homotopies of all orders used as arrows of categorical dimensions one and greater, and discuss other related constructions of weakly $\\\\omega$-categorifed algebras.","output":"Weakly $\\\\omega$-Categorified Models of Algebraic Theories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anticoagulants are associated with clinical benefit against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), preventing COVID-19 associated coagulopathy.

Thus, it is worth interrogating whether there is crosstalk between inhibitors and substrates between these enzymes. Here, we found that the clinically-approved FXa inhibitor apixaban targets SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with a 21-fold higher potency than boceprevir (GC376). Apixaban displayed a non-competitive mechanism of inhibition towards Mpro, since it targets the enzyme/substrate complex and the allosteric site onto the viral protease. Enzymatic assays were further validated in infected Calu-3 cells, which reveal that apixaban decreases the production of infectious viral particles in a dose-dependent manner, with an inhibitory potency in the micromolar range. Our results are in line with the proposed early use of anticoagulants, including FXa inhibitors, to improve clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients.

Manual detection of osteosarcoma requires expertise and it is a labour-intensive process. If detected on time, the mortality rate can be reduced. With the advent of new technologies, automatic detection systems are used to analyse and classify medical images, which reduces the dependency on experts and leads to faster processing. In this paper, an automatic detection system: Integrated Features-Feature Selection Model for Classification (IF-FSM-C) to detect osteosarcoma from the high-resolution whole slide images (WSIs) is proposed. The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of integrated features obtained by fusion of features extracted using traditional handcrafted (HC) feature extraction techniques and deep learning models (DLMs) namely EfficientNet-B0 and Xception. To further improve the performance of the proposed system, feature selection (FS) is performed. Here, two binary variants of recently proposed Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) known as BAOA-S and BAOA-V are proposed to perform FS. The selected features are given to a classifier that classifies the WSIs into Viable tumor (VT), Non-viable tumor (NVT) and non-tumor (NT). Experiments are performed to compare the performance of proposed IF-FSM-C to the classifiers which use HC or deep learning features alone as well as state-of-the-art methods for osteosarcoma detection. The best overall accuracy of 96.08% is obtained when integrated features extracted using HC techniques and Xception are used. The overall accuracy is enhanced to 99.54% after applying BAOA-S for FS. Further, the application of BAOA-S for FS reduces the number of features with the best model having only 188 features compared to 2118 features if no FS is applied.","output":"Automatic detection of osteosarcoma based on integrated features and feature selection using binary arithmetic optimization algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. Despite the fact that most people with COVID-19 (C-19) do not require hospitalization, little is known about the changes in ECG in this group of patients (pts). The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the leading tools to assess the extent of cardiac involvement in C-19 pts. Our main aim was to asses ECG abnormalities related to cardiac involvement in patients without hospitalization with mild and moderate course of C-19 . METHODS: Only pts without co morbidities, not taking any medications were included to the study. In all pts standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (EKG) mean 8,2week +/- 4,6) after C-19 was performed in supine position after 15 minutes in rest. The following parameters were analyzed: mean heart rate (mHR), bradycardia and tachycardia episodes defined as HR <40bpm and HR> 100 bpm, PQ duration, QRS durations, the Bazett-corrected QT interval, changes in the ST-T segment and the T wave. Additionally heart rhythm disturbances were assessed and atrial fibrillation/flutter episodes, the presence of atrial premature contractions (APCs), ventricular premature contractions VES) Number of atrioventricular blocks, bundle branch blocs (BBB) C (RBBB, LBBB, a nonspecific intraventricular conduction block) were also analyzed. RESULTS: 264 pts were included to final assessment, with mean age 43,5  13,5 years. The results were as follow: HR <40bpm - in 0pts, HR> 100 bpm in 9(3%)pts, PQ duration > 200ms in 7(3%)pts, QRS durations > 100ms in 19(6%)pts, QTc interval in 16 (6%)pts, ST-T segment abnormalities in 21(8%)pts and the T wave abnormalities in16(6%)pts Following heart rhythm disturbances were noted: AF/AFl in 0pts, (APCs) in 0pts, VES C in 3(1%)pts. No episodes of atrioventricular blocks were recorded, but BB in bundle branch blocs (BBB) C (RBBB, LBBB, a nonspecific intraventricular conduction block) in 14 (3%) pts were noted. Conclusions. The most frequent ECG abnormalities in pts without co-morbidities after COVID-19 without hospitalization were ST-T segment and T abnormalities.

This retrospective study included 704 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at two hospitals in Daegu, Korea from February 19 to March 31, 2020. AKI was defined according to the serum creatinine criteria in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. The final date of follow-up was May 1, 2020. Of the 704 patients, 28 (4.0%) developed AKI. Of the 28 patients with AKI, 15 (53.6%) were found to have AKI stage 1, 3 (10.7%) had AKI stage 2, and 10 (35.7%) had AKI stage 3. Among these patients, 12 (42.9%) recovered from AKI. In the patients with AKI, the rates of admission to intensive care unit (ICU), administration of mechanical ventilator (MV), and in-hospital mortality were significantly higher than in patients without AKI.

The intent in existing homes is to find a practical means to mitigate exposure to airborne contaminants. In creating an IZ in an occupied single-family home in the study, four simple strategies were tested. The test configurations were: (1) IZ windows closed with IZ bathroom exhaust ventilation fan off, (2) IZ windows closed with IZ exhaust fan on, (3) IZ window open with IZ exhaust fan off, and (4) IZ window open with IZ exhaust fan on. Incense-generated fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was used as a marker for virus transmission. The measured transfer of PM2.5 from the IZ into the main zone (MZ) of the house enabled us to determine the relative effectiveness of four containment strategies. Collectively, the data from pressure differential (across zones) and PM2.5 measurements suggested that the best containment strategy was achieved through continuously operating the bathroom exhaust fan while keeping the windows closed in the IZ (configuration 2). Interventions using open windows were found to be less reliable, due to variability in wind speed and direction, resulting in an unpredictable and sometimes detrimental pressure differential in the IZ with reference to MZ.

This randomised controlled trial tests the effectiveness of a short video promoting help-seeking by Australian men. METHODS: This study is an online randomised controlled trial (RCT). Participants will attend an online group orientation session, where they will provide consent to participate and complete a baseline questionnaire (T1). After completion of the T1 questionnaire, participants will be randomised to watch either the intervention or control video on a 1:1 basis. After randomisation, participants will be able to access their allocated video for 1 week. Seven days after T1, participants will again be sent links to the video and to the post-exposure questionnaire (T2). One month after T2, participants will be emailed the follow-up questionnaire (T3).

This retrospective, two-centre study was conducted between 2000 and 2009. Data on patients with VO were retrieved from the diagnosis database and confirmed by checking medical records. A total of 300 patients with VO were identified; 31 received antibiotics without bacteriological diagnosis, and 269 patients with spondylodiscitis imaging were included. Eighty-three (30.9%) and 18 (6.7%) infections were documented by blood cultures and by bacteriological samples other than PNB, respectively; 168 patients with no bacteriological diagnosis had PNB. Of these, 92 (54.8%) were positive and identified the pathogen and 76 (45.2%) were negative. The most common bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (34.3%), Streptococcus spp. (20.6%) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (14.8%). After multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with negative PNB was previous antibiotic intake (OR: 2.31 [1.07-5.00]). When VO was suspected on imaging, bacteriological investigation identified the microorganism in 209/300 (70%) of the cases. The yield of PNB was 54.8%. The only predictor of PNB negativity was previous antibiotic intake. Therefore, we believe that a second PNB should be done after a sufficient delay withdrawal of antibiotics if the first sample was negative.

This preliminary study set out to develop and measure the effectiveness of a face recognition system to identify the identity of a person with a face mask. The system uses a deep learning model for face mask detection and Procrustes analysis to measure the face identity similarity. A combination of standard face recognition performance measures was used to measure the effectiveness of the system. A self-obtained dataset consists of 35 images of persons with a face mask from different identity background was investigated. The results indicate that the system effectively recognizes the identity of a person with a face mask up to 97.14% accuracy.

This was most evident in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with JHM. Such CNS lesions were not observed in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with the MHV3 strain. An in vitro system is described in which the rat glial RN2 cell line functions as a discriminating host for the JHM virus. Shortly after inoculation, this virus establishes a persistent infection in which there is a cyclical rise and fall in titer with an accompanying cytopathology. Furthermore, this host cell confers a thermal lability which the virus does not demonstrate in the fully permissive host cell, L-2. By comparison, infection of RN2 cells with the prototype MHV3 is aborted immediately. In the persistent infection of RN2 cells with measles virus, Hall strain, the cell again confers a temperature sensitivity which the virus does not possess when replicating in Vero cells. This appears to be the first instance in which a cloned cell line of glial origin determines the outcome of the infectious process, discriminating in favor of a neurotropic variant which possesses a tropism for the glia in vivo.

However, the amount and intensity of exercise needed to obtain positive results are unknown. Several considerations must be kept in mind for its implementation in rehabilitation, as monitoring of patients intensity, which is essential to avoid extreme fatigue conditions, may cause physical and physiological complications. The use of machine learning models has been implemented in fatigue management, but is limited in practice due to the lack of understanding of how an individuals performance deteriorates with fatigue; this can vary based on physical exercise, environment, and the individuals characteristics. As a first step, this paper lays the foundation for a data analytic approach to managing fatigue in walking tasks. The proposed framework establishes the criteria for a feature and machine learning algorithm selection for fatigue management, classifying four fatigue diagnoses states. Based on the proposed framework and the classifier implemented, the random forest model presented the best performance with an average accuracy of 98% and F-score of 93%.

Covid-19 was diagnosed in symptomatic patients who had a positive PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 or having typical lung lesions on imaging. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, management of immunosuppression, treatment for Covid-19, and clinical outcomes (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death) were recorded. Risk factors for severe disease or death were determined. Of the 279 patients, 243 were admitted to hospital and 36 were managed at home. The median age of hospitalized patients was 61.6 years; most had comorbidities (hypertension, 90.1%; overweight, 63.8%; diabetes, 41.3%; cardiovascular disease, 36.2%). Fever, cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea were the most common symptoms on admission. Laboratory findings revealed mild inflammation frequently accompanied by lymphopenia. Immunosuppressive drugs were generally withdrawn (calcineurin inhibitors: 28.7%; antimetabolites: 70.8%). Treatment was mainly based on hydroxychloroquine (24.7%), antiviral drugs (7.8%), and tocilizumab (5.3%). Severe Covid-19 occurred in 106 patients (46%).

Photography of the tarsal conjunctiva and remote interpretation may help alleviate these challenges. The purpose of this study was to develop, and field test an Image Capture and Processing System (ICAPS) to acquire hands-free images of the tarsal conjunctiva for upload to a virtual reading center for remote grading. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This observational study was conducted during a district-level prevalence survey for trachomatous inflammationfollicular (TF) in Chamwino, Tanzania. The ICAPS was developed using a Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone, a Samsung Gear VR headset, a foot pedal trigger and customized software allowing for hands-free photography. After a one-day training course, three trachoma graders used the ICAPS to collect images from 1305 children ages 1C9 years, which were expert-graded remotely for comparison with field grades. In our experience, the ICAPS was successful at scanning and assigning barcodes to images, focusing on the everted eyelid with adequate examiner hand visualization, and capturing images with sufficient detail to grade TF. The percentage of children with TF by photos and by field grade was 5%. Agreement between grading of the images compared to the field grades at the child level was kappa = 0.53 (95%CI = 0.40C0.66). There were ungradable images for at least one eye in 199 children (9.1%), with more occurring in children ages 1C3 (18.5%) than older children ages 4C9 (4.2%) ((2) = 145.3, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The prototype ICAPS device was robust, able to image 1305 children in a district level survey and transmit images from rural Tanzania to an online grading platform. More work is needed to improve the percentage of ungradable images and to better understand the causes of disagreement between field and photo grading.","output":"Evaluation of photography using head-mounted display technology (ICAPS) for district Trachoma surveys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Evidence suggests that adverse outcomes in COVID-19 may be driven by a cytokine-induced vascular inflammatory response, caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Aim We aimed to develop a non-invasive method for quantifying cytokine-driven vascular inflammation in patients with acute COVID-19 infection that could allow risk stratification. Methods We developed a platform for rapid development of novel imaging biomarkers of vascular inflammation, by applying quantitative radiotranscriptomics to images from standard Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA). We used this platform to train a radiotranscriptomic signature (C19-RS) from the perivascular space around the aorta and the internal mammary artery, visualized in routine chest CTAs, to best describe cytokine-driven vascular inflammation, defined using transcriptomic profiles from RNA sequencing data from human arterial biopsies. This signature was tested externally in 435 clinically indicated CT pulmonary angiograms (CTPAs) from patients with or without COVID-19 from 3 different geographical regions. Results COVID-19 patients were characterised by significantly higher C19-RS values (adjusted odds ratio of 2.97 [95%CI: 1.43-6.27], p=0.004), while patients infected with the new B.1.1.7 variant (UK variant) were also found to have higher C19-RS values compared to those with the original variant, evidence suggestive of higher degrees of vascular inflammation. C19-RS had prognostic value for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19, with hazard ratios of 3.31 ([95%CI: 1.49-7.33], p=0.003) and 2.58 ([95%CI: 1.10-6.05], p=0.028) in two external testing cohorts respectively, after correction for clinical factors and biochemical biomarkers of inflammation (WBC, CRP) and myocardial injury (troponin). Importantly, the corrected HR for in-hospital mortality was 8.24[95%CI: 2.16- 31.36], P=0.002 for those who received no treatment with dexamethasone, but only 2.27[95%CI: 0.69-7.55], p=0.18 in those who received dexamethasone after the test, suggesting that anti-inflammatory treatment may be modifying the natural history of COVID-19 infection by improving outcomes specifically in those patients with high vascular inflammation. Conclusions Our study introduces a new radiotranscriptomic signature, C19-RS, extracted from routine CTPAs, trained to detect cytokine-driven arterial inflammation, and demonstrates that vascular inflammation determined in this way has prognostic value in patients with COVID-19. The UK variant leads to higher vascular inflammation measured in this way, and the risk associated with COVID-19 arteritis is modifiable by dexamethasone.","output":"Radiotranscriptomic analysis of perivascular adipose tissue quantifies vascular inflammation in COVID-19 from routine ct angiograms: stratification of new uk variant infection and prediction of inhospital outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Up to date, there has been no specific cure to treat the disease Indonesia is one of the countries that is still fighting to control virus transmission Yet, at the same time, Indonesia has a rich biodiversity of natural medicinal products that potentially become an alternative cure Thus, this study examined the potency of a natural medicinal product, Sulawesi propolis compounds produced by Tetragonula sapiens, inhibiting angiotensin-converting activity enzyme-2 (ACE-2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in the human body In this study, molecular docking was done to analyze the docking scores as the representation of binding affinity and the interaction profiles of propolis compounds toward ACE-2 The results illustrated that by considering the docking score and the presence of interaction with targeted sites, five compounds, namely glyasperin A, broussoflavonol F, sulabiroins A, (2S)-5,7-dihydroxy-4-methoxy-8-prenylflavanone and isorhamnetin are potential to inhibit the binding of ACE-2 and SARS-CoV-2, with the docking score of ?10 8, ?9 9, ?9 5, ?9 3 and ?9 2 kcal/mol respectively The docking scores are considered to be more favorable compared to MLN-4760 as a potent inhibitor","output":"Evaluating the potency of Sulawesi propolis compounds as ACE-2 inhibitors through molecular docking for COVID-19 drug discovery preliminary study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Frontline healthcare nurses devoted themselves to deal with the outbreak of COVID-19, saving many lives.

These patients were followed up every three months after starting the hormone therapy. A total of 62 cases were screened, among which nine cases were asymptomatic. Furthermore, 38 patients were diagnosed as stage I and were given low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and vasodilator drugs. Moreover, 22 cases were diagnosed as stage IIa/b and underwent core decompression. In addition, two cases were diagnosed as stage IIc and underwent pedicled bone transplantation. During the follow-up period, ARCO staging was used for radiological evaluation, the HHS score was applied to evaluate for clinical efficacy, and SPSS 22.0 statistical software was used for the data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were followed up for 24 months. Among these patients, 38 patients were diagnosed with ARCO stage I and underwent systematic therapy. No progress was found in 29 cases (76.3%). Furthermore, three cases progressed to stage IIb (7.8%), four cases progressed to stage IIc (10.5%), two cases progressed to stage III and IV, respectively (2.6%), and 16 cases (80%) did not progress after core decompression.

This manuscript gives a summary of how the chaotic maps are used to generate pseudo-random numbers and perform multimedia encryption. After carefully analyzing all the recent literature, we found that the lowest correlation coefficient was 0.00006, which was achieved by Ikeda chaotic map. The highest entropy was 7.999995 bits per byte using the quantum chaotic map. The lowest execution time observed was 0.23 seconds with the Zaslavsky chaotic map and the highest data rate was 15.367 Mbits per second using a hyperchaotic map. Chaotic map-based pseudo-random number generation can be utilized in multi-media encryption, video-game animations, digital marketing, chaotic system simulation, chaotic missile systems, and other applications.","output":"A Review on Applications of Chaotic Maps in Pseudo-Random Number Generators and Encryption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and its effect on oxidative stress and apoptosis in patients with new coronavirus infection COVID-19 Materials and methods 90 patients diagnosed with new coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus were examined Hyperbaric oxygen therapy sessions were conducted in 57 patients (38 in severe condition (CT 3C4), 19 in moderate condition (CT 1C2)) The procedures were performed in 1 4C1 6 ATA mode for 40 min-utes, 247 sessions in total were performed The effect of hyperbaric oxygenation was assessed by measuring the level of oxygen saturation, the severity of oxidative stress and apoptosis of blood lymphocytes Results In all examined patients with new coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, positive changes such as dyspnea reduction and improvement of general well-being were registered after hyperbaric oxygen therapy sessions The level of oxygen saturation after the end of the hyperbaric oxygen therapy course was 95 01 6% (before the course  91 35 9%), which allowed to return almost all patients to spontaneous res-piration without the need for further oxygenation therapy Hyperbaric oxygen therapy did not reduce the total antioxidant activity, however, it was associated with a decrease in the blood malone dialdehyde from 4 340 52 mol/l to 3 980 48 mol/l and a decrease in open circuit potential of platinum electrode from-22 7824 58 mV to-37 6917 4 mV Besides, the positive effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy was manifested in normalization of blood cell apoptosis Conclusion Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in patients with new coronavirus infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is an effective treatment method with multiple effects resulting in improvement of subjective indicators of the patients' condition, increase of hemoglobin oxygen saturation, decrease of lipid peroxidation intensity, activation of antioxidant system, restoration of pro-and antioxidant balance and apoptosis normalization ? 2020, V A Negovsky Research Institute of General Reanimatology All rights reserved","output":"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores the vulnerability and resilience of the US Leisure and Hospitality industry sector-wise by taking employment levels in seven different business segments.

Here, with a view to understanding the underlying mechanisms, we first systematically dissected the exact signaling network in BTV-induced autophagy. We found that the activity of mTOR, a crucial pivot, was inhibited by BTV1 infection, subsequently leading to downstream p70S6K suppression and autophagy initiation. We then explored the upstream regulators of mTOR and analyzed their activities via a series of assays. We found BTV1-induced autophagy to be independent of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. However, the BTV1-induced inhibition of PI3K/Akt was found to be partially responsible for mTOR inactivation and subsequent autophagy initiation. Furthermore, we found unexpectedly that AMPK seemed to play a more important role in BTV1-induced autophagy. Elevated [Ca(2+)](cyto)-mediated activation of CaMKK exactly managed the activation of AMPK, which then positively regulated autophagy through suppressing mTOR. We must emphasize that TSC2 is a fatal mediator between upstream Akt or AMPK and downstream mTOR through its phosphorylation. Taken together, our data suggested that the BTV1-induced inhibition of the Akt-TSC2-mTOR pathway and the upregulation of the AMPK-TSC2-mTOR pathway both contributed to autophagy initiation and further favored virus replication.","output":"Dissection and integration of the autophagy signaling network initiated by bluetongue virus infection: crucial candidates ERK1/2, Akt and AMPK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND We previously investigated antibody titers against four kinds of superantigens [streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA), streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and staphylococcal enterotoxin B] in patients with Kawasaki syndrome (KS) younger than 6 months of age and reported a relationship between toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and KS patients. In this study we have investigated antibody titers in KS patients older than 6 months of age. METHODS Serum of 81 patients with KS older than 6 months of age, before intravenous gamma-globulin therapy, and 88 normal age-matched children were used in this study. The IgG antibody titers against four kinds of superantigens were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS The KS patients showed significantly elevated mean SPEA titer (P = 0.006) and significantly higher incidence of high SPEA (P = 0.0024) compared with the controls. The SPEA titer in KS patients showed a significant positive correlation with the number of days from onset of illness (P = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS The elevated antibody titer against superantigens of KS patients older than 6 months of age was different from that of KS patients younger than 6 months of age. Our results suggest that KS patients' exposure to SPEA occurred a few weeks before the onset of KS.

In the field of education, there was an increase in the privatization of higher education, inadequate to the requirements of national development, characterizing it more as a commodity than as a right. This article aims to discuss some challenges, risks, and possible strategies to face the impact of the COVID19 pandemic in undergraduate dental education. This pandemic had an immediate and dramatic impact on dental education in more than 130 countries, prompting teachers and students to adopt remote teaching activities. In Brazil, theoretical classes were offered remotely, mainly in private institutions where there was an intensification of academic work for both teachers and students. This process requires support in technological and pedagogical aspects, including tools, resources, and training courses. In the resumption of clinical education, changes in biosafety actions are being proposed to preserve the health of the actors involved. The application of these measures will imply a great mobilization of students, teachers, and technicians and extra attention so that the constitutive dimensions of the teaching-learning process in health are not minimized or forgotten.","output":"Challenges and Dilemmas for Dental Undergraduate Teaching with the Advent of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the hotel sector has engaged in various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives to show solidarity with local communities.

RESULTS: A national survey conducted during the year 2020 across the French reference centers for hemoglobinopathies identified 16 cases of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR in beta-thalassemia patients. Their age ranged from 11 months to 60 years. 15 patients were transfusion-dependent and 6 were splenectomized. Concerning iron overload related complications, none had diabetes or cirrhosis and only one had experienced heart failure. All 4 pediatric patients were pauci-symptomatic during the viral episode. Three patients (41, 49 and 57 years old) developed COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen therapy without the need for mechanical ventilation. Neutropenia (absolute neutrophils count <0.5 10 9/L) was observed in 2 patients receiving long-term treatment with hydroxycarbamide and deferiprone. No thrombosis event, organ failure or death occurred. All patients recovered. CONCLUSION: Severity of COVID-19 in this population of young and middle-aged patients appeared increased compared to the general population but remained mild to moderate as already described in the few series reported in the literature. Occurrence of adverse events related to chronic treatment administered in thalassemia disease may be favored by the infectious episode.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with ?-thalassemia: The French experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has been widely reported to present stress to medical systems globally and to disrupt the lives of patients and health care practitioners (HCPs). Given that spontaneous reporting heavily relies on both HCPs and patients, an understandable question is whether the stress of the pandemic has diminished spontaneous reporting. Herein, the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the spontaneous reporting of adverse drug events was assessed. METHODS: Spontaneous-report counts from 119 weeks (January 1, 2018, to April 12, 2020) were identified using Pfizer's safety database and were analyzed. Autoregressive integrated moving-average models were fitted to aggregated and disaggregated time series (TSs). Model residuals were charted on individual-value and moving-range charts and exponentially weighted moving-average charts for the identification of statistically unexpected changes associated with the pandemic. FINDINGS: Overall, the reporting of serious adverse events showed no unexpected decline. Total global reporting declined, driven by HCP reporting (of both serious and nonserious events), starting after week 8 of 2020 and exceeding model expectations by week 15 of 2020, suggesting the pandemic as an assignable cause. However, reporting remained within longer-term historical ranges. The TS from Japan was the only national TS that showed a significant decline, and an unusual periodicity related to national holidays. A few countries, notably Taiwan, showed unexpected statistical increases in reporting associated with the pandemic, commencing as early as week 3 of 2020. In the literature, the reporting of adverse drug events was stable. Ancillary findings included prevalent year-end/beginning reporting minima, with more reports from HCPs than from consumers. IMPLICATIONS: Using data from a large-scale and diverse safety database from a pharmaceutical company, a significant global decline in total reporting was detected, driven by HCPs, not consumers, and reports of nonserious events, consistent with the pandemic as an assignable cause, but the reporting remained within long-term ranges, suggesting relative durability. Importantly, the analyses found no unexpected decline in overall reporting of serious events. Future avenues of research include the use of data from large-scale, publicly available spontaneous reporting systems for assessing the generalizability of the present findings and whether they correlate with impaired signal detection, as well as a follow-up analysis of whether the effects on spontaneous reporting abate after the pandemic.","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Spontaneous Reporting: Global and National Time-Series Analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COV spike (S) glycoprotein and Mpro are two key targets that have been identified for vaccines and drug development against the COVID-19 disease.

To understand the phylogenetic relationship among these cathepsin L-like proteins, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on their sequences. In addition, models of the tertiary structures of cathepsin L were constructed using homology modeling methods and subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to obtain reasonable structure to understand its dynamical behavior. Our findings demonstrate that all of the potential Drosophila cathepsin L-like proteins contain at least one cathepsin propeptide inhibitor domain. Multiple sequence alignment and homology models clearly highlight the conservation of active site residues, disulfide bonds, and amino acid residues critical for inhibitor binding. Furthermore, comparative modeling indicates that the sequence/structure/function profiles and active site architectures are conserved.","output":"Structural and functional conservation profiles of novel cathepsin L-like proteins identified in the Drosophila melanogaster genome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 pandemic has massive impacts on the activity of human in the world, including in Indonesia. To reduce the transmission of the virus, Indonesian government issues a policy to restrict daily public activities, affecting key national sectors, such as education systems. All learning activities are switched from the conventional face-to-face mode to being remote via the use of the Internet. After the pandemic begins to subside, the government then plans to reopen all schools and to allow face-to-face learning. However, this decision has sparked controversy in the social media, including Twitter. This paper describes a methodology to perform sentiment analysis on a collection of tweets that are in connection with the restart of the face-to-face learning mode. In particular, our experiments using hand-crafted features based on the tweets demonstrate that data-driven models are useful for automatic sentiment orientation classification on Twitter data.

Methods: We applied an evidence-educated Delphi-panel approach to elicit the impact of NPIs on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate R0 in Germany. Effectiveness was defined as the product of efficacy and compliance. A discrete, deterministic SEIR model with time step of 1 day, a latency period of 1.8 days, duration of infectiousness of 5 days, and a share of the total population of 15% assumed to be protected by immunity was developed in order to estimate the impact of selected NPI measures on the course of the pandemic. The model was populated with the Delphi-panel results and varied in sensitivity analyses. Results: Efficacy and compliance estimates for the three most effective NPIs were as follows: test and isolate 49% (efficacy)/78% (compliance), keeping distance 42%/74%, personal protection masks (cloth masks or other face masks) 33%/79%. Applying all NPI effectiveness estimates to the SEIR model resulted in a valid replication of reported occurrence of the German SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A combination of four NPIs at consented compliance rates might curb the CoViD-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Employing an evidence-educated Delphi-panel approach can support SARS-CoV-2 modelling.

The source of these neuropeptides have been confined to the contributions of small afferent nerves or possibly neuroendocrine cells. We tested the hypothesis that repeated exposure to allergen would alter the sources and abundance of neuropeptides in airways. Right middle lobes from rats (8 wk old) exposed to 2.5% ovalbumin (OVA) for five episodes (30 min each) or filtered air were inflation fixed with paraformaldehyde. The lobes were dissected to expose the airway tree, permeabilized with DMSO, and incubated in antibody to rat calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), followed with a fluorochrome-labeled second antibody. CGRP-positive structures were imaged via confocal microscopy. Airways were later embedded in plastic and sectioned for cell identification. In animals challenged with OVA, CGRP-positive cells, not neuroendocrine or neuronal in origin (confirmed by a lack of protein gene product 9.5 signal), were recorded along the axial path. In section, this fluorescent signal was localized to granules within epithelial cells. Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff staining of these same sections positively identify these cells as mucous cells. Mucous cells of animals not challenged with OVA were not positive for CGRP. We conclude that episodic allergen exposure results in the accumulation of CGRP within mucous cells, creating a new source for the release of this neuropeptide within the airway.","output":"Proximal airway mucous cells of ovalbumin-sensitized and -challenged Brown Norway rats accumulate the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of novel Coronavirus 2019 and the subsequent pandemic are presenting a challenge to neurologists managing patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Timely identification of these patients is crucial for a proper administration of health-care resources. OBJECTIVE: To develop a predictive score that estimates the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) among patients with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of 401 COVID-19 patients diagnosed from March 12, to August 10, 2020. The score development cohort comprised 211 patients (52.62% of total sample) whereas the validation cohort included 190 patients (47.38% of total sample). We divided participants according to the need of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and looked for potential predictive variables. RESULTS: We developed two predictive scores, one based on Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the other one on the Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ratio (NLR), using the following variables: respiratory rate, SpO2/FiO2 ratio and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). The area under the curve (AUC) in the development cohort was 0.877 (0.823C0.931) using the NLR based score and 0.891 (0.843C0.939) using the IL-6 based score. When compared with other similar scores developed for the prediction of adverse outcomes in COVID-19, the COVID-IRS scores proved to be superior in the prediction of IMV.

However, the vaccine rollout rates associated with the gross domestic product (GDP) and few deaths are required for verification. Three hypotheses were made: 1. the inflection point (IP) days on the cumulative number of confirmed cases (CNCCs) in 2021 are improved (i.e., shorter than 2021); 2. the vaccinations are associated with national GDP and fewer deaths; and 3. the association is weak between vaccinations and CNCC IP based on the argument that vaccinations are limited to protection against milder infection. METHODS: The corresponding CNCCs and deaths were downloaded from the GitHub website. Four variables, including IP days on CNCCs and deaths, GDP per capita, and vaccine doses administered per 100 people (VD100) in countries/regions, were collected. Correlation coefficients (CCs) between variables were computed to verify the association with vaccination rates. Four tasks were achieved: 1. determining IP days for each country/region; 2. drawing forest plots to identify the improvement in 2021; 3. using a pyramid plot to identify the improvement in US states; and 4. applying the Kano diagram to verify the three hypotheses mentioned above. RESULTS: We observed that: 1. the IP days on CNCCs in 2021 were shorter than those in 2021 among continents and US states; 2. the CCs were 0.66 (t = 12.21, P < .01) and ?0.15 (t = 2.11, P < .01) using the paired variables of [VD100, GDP] and [VD100, deaths IP], respectively; and 3. the CC between CNCC IP and deaths IP was 0.73 (t = 14.84, P < .01), but a weak association with CC = ?0.01 existed between CNCC IP and VD100.

Although at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, the epidemic seems controllable in Southern Iran, the disease presents a critical pattern as of May 2020. After a few months of COVID-19 emergence, in a twisted turn of events, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 increased dramatically. It has been proposed that the antibodies obtained from previous exposure to local circulating human coronaviruses or possibly SARS-CoV-2 might contribute to the development of more severe and lethal presentations of COVID-19 possibly by triggering antibody-dependent enhancement. The binding of virions complexed with antibodies to Fc?3 receptors on the target cells initiates receptor-mediated signaling events leading to enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines and suppression of intracellular antiviral responses at the transcriptomic level, followed by endocytosis of the virus and subsequent activation of immune cells. The activated immune cells might accumulate in the lung and promote cytokine storm and lymphopenia. Furthermore, the formation of immune complexes can promote complement activation and subsequent tissue damage. Although there are currently no clinical data to support this hypothesis, a better understanding of these immunopathologic phenomena and their relation to disease course and severity might give insight into the development of the most efficient prophylactic and therapeutic approaches.

A growing body of evidence suggests that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family of transcriptional corepressors has emerged as crucial mediators of IPF pathogenesis. HDACs deacetylate histones and result in chromatin condensation and epigenetic repression of gene transcription. HDACs also catalyse the deacetylation of many non-histone proteins, including transcription factors, thus also leading to changes in the transcriptome and cellular signalling. Increased HDAC expression is associated with cell proliferation, cell growth and anti-apoptosis and is, thus, a salient feature of many cancers. In IPF, induction and abnormal upregulation of Class I and Class II HDAC enzymes in myofibroblast foci, as well as aberrant bronchiolar epithelium, is an eminent observation, whereas type-II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) of IPF lungs indicate a significant depletion of many HDACs. We thus suggest that the significant imbalance of HDAC activity in IPF lungs, with a cancer-like increase in fibroblastic and bronchial cells versus a lack in AECII, promotes and perpetuates fibrosis. This review focuses on the mechanisms by which Class I and Class II HDACs mediate fibrogenesis and on the mechanisms by which various HDAC inhibitors reverse the deregulated epigenetic responses in IPF, supporting HDAC inhibition as promising IPF therapy.","output":"Targeting Histone Deacetylases in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: A Future Therapeutic Option"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to propose decontamination methods that are suitable for use by members of the public to cope with the shortage of surgical masks during the current COVID-19 pandemic. 3-ply surgical masks were subjected to different decontamination protocols (heat, chemical, ultraviolet irradiation) to assess their abilities to achieve at least 4-log reduction of two common respiratory pathogens, H1N1 Influenza A virus, a single-stranded RNA enveloped virus similar to SARS-CoV-2 and Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive bacterium that is more resistant to decontamination than single stranded RNA enveloped virus.

This pandemic has not only affected people but also caused economic crisis throughout the world. Researchers have shown good progress in revealing the molecular insights of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and developing vaccines, but effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2-infected patients are yet to be found. Several vaccines are available and used in many countries, while many others are still in clinical or preclinical studies. However, this involves a long-term process, considering the safety procedures and requirements and their long-term protection capacity and in different age groups are still questionable. Therefore, at present, the drug repurposing of the existing therapeutics previously designed against other viral diseases seems to be the only practical approach to mitigate the current situation. The safety of most of these therapeutic agents has already been tested. Recent clinical reports revealed promising therapeutic efficiency of several drugs such as remdesivir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, baricitinib, and cepharanthine. Besides, plasma therapies were used to treat patients and prevent fatal outcomes.

Decreased physical activity and an increase in inactive behaviours may lead to an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: Our study focused on changes in physical activity (aerobic exercise, muscle strengthening, team sports) and subjective perceptions of health status in adolescents and young adults during the pandemic. METHOD: High school students in 66 public schools in 37 cities in Hungary (n = 2508) were surveyed. Questionnaire items on physical activity and subjective perceptions of health were adapted from the WHO Health Behaviour of School-aged Children Survey and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Youth Risk Behavior Survey. 2  2  4 factorial ANCOVA was used to test the effect of gender and/or age and region on changes in subjective perceptions of physical activity and health before and during distance education. RESULTS: The majority of the high school students reported a decrease in physical activity frequency during the distance learning period, with an average of 2-3 fewer days of physical activity per week regardless of region. Nearly a quarter of them rated their health as worse during distance learning than before. A higher proportion of those who reported a subjective decline in health also reported a decline in physical activity. CONCLUSION: A decline in physical activity during the period of distance learning is associated with a decline in subjective perceptions of health, especially among rural adolescent girls.

There is still no specific medicine for COVID-19, which leaves a critical gap for the identification of new drug candidates for the disease. Recent studies have reported that the small-molecule enoxacin exerts an antiviral activity by enhancing the RNAi pathway. The aim of this study is to analyze if enoxacin can exert anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects. We exploit multiple computational tools and databases to examine (i) whether the RNAi mechanism, as the target pathway of enoxacin, could act on the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and (ii) microRNAs induced by enoxacin might directly silence viral components as well as the host cell proteins mediating the viral entry and replication. We find that the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 might be a suitable substrate for DICER activity. We also highlight several enoxacin-enhanced microRNAs which could target SARS-CoV-2 components, pro-inflammatory cytokines, host cell components facilitating viral replication, and transcription factors enriched in lung stem cells, thereby promoting their differentiation and lung regeneration. Finally, our analyses identify several enoxacin-targeted regulatory modules that were critically associated with exacerbation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, our analysis suggests that enoxacin could be a promising candidate for COVID-19 treatment through enhancing the RNAi pathway.","output":"In silico analysis suggests the RNAi-enhancing antibiotic enoxacin as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Depending on the extent of surgery, coagulation status and the number of anastomoses, drains are routinely used during liver transplantation.

Avian immunoglobulins (IgY) have been previously shown in animal models to protect against new infection and mitigate established infection when applied intranasally. We carried out a proof-of-concept study to address the feasibility of using such antibodies as mucosally-applied prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Hens were immunized with recombinant S1 spike glycoprotein of the virus, and the resulting IgY was evaluated for binding specificity, inhibition of glycoprotein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein (the requisite binding site for the virus), and inhibition of viral replication in Vero cell culture. RESULTS: Titers of anti-S1 glycoprotein IgY were evident in yolks at 14 days post-immunization, peaking at 21 days, and at peak concentrations of 16.8 mg/ml. IgY showed strong and significant inhibition of S1/ACE2 binding interactions, and significantly inhibited viral replication at a concentration of 16.8 mg/ml. Four weeks' collection from eggs of two hens produced a total of 1.55 grams of IgY. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept study we showed that avian immunoglobulins (IgY) raised against a key virulence factor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus successfully inhibited the critical initial adhesion of viral spike glycoproteins to human ACE2 protein receptors and inhibited viral replication in vitro, in a short period using only two laying hens.

In order to recover from this extraordinary level of suspended activity, we will be obliged to prioritize pathologies based on purely clinical criteria, for which tables including the relevance of each pathology within each area of urology are being proposed.

However, recent studies show that single-stage laparoscopic CBD exploration (LCBDE) is safe and feasible. Three-dimensional (3D) laparoscopy enhances depth perception and facilitates intracorporeal suturing. The application of 3D technology for LCBDE is emerging, and we report our case series of 3D LCBDE. Methods: We audited the 27 consecutive 3D LCBDE performed from July 2017 to January 2020. We have a liberal policy for magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in patients with deranged liver function tests (LFT). All CBD explorations were done through choledochotomy with a 5 mm flexible choledochoscope and primarily repaired with an absorbable barbed suture without a stent or T-tube. Results: The mean age of patients was 68 (range 44-91) years, and 12 (44%) were male. The indications for surgery were choledocholithiasis 67% (n=18), cholangitis 22% (n=6), and gallstone pancreatitis 11% (n=3). About 67% (n=18) had pre-operative ERCP. About 37% (n=10) had pre-operative biliary stent. Pre-operative MRCP was done in 74% (n=20), and the mean diameter of CBD was 14.5 mm (range 7-30). The median operative time was 160 (range 80-265) min. The operative drain was inserted in 18 patients. One patient each (4%) had a bile leak and a retained stone. There was no open conversion, readmission, or mortality. Conclusion: 3D LCBDE with primary repair by an absorbable barbed suture is safe and feasible. Relevance for patients: This paper emphasized that one stage LCBDE should be a treatment option which is comparable with two stage ERCP followed by LC to treat CBD stones. In addition, 3D technology and barbed sutures use in LCBDE are safe and useful.","output":"3D Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration with primary repair by absorbable barbed suture is safe and feasible"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this introductory chapter we discuss what happens to corporate social responsibility during the COVID-19 crisis.

While the efficacy of these therapies has been studied in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the clinical outcomes associated with oxygen masks, high-flow oxygen therapy by nasal cannula and non-invasive mechanical ventilation in critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients remain unclear. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we used the best of nine covariate balancing algorithms on all baseline covariates in critically ill COVID-19 patients supported with > 10 L of supplemental oxygen at one of the 26 participating ICUs in Catalonia, Spain, between March 14 and April 15, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 1093 non-invasively oxygenated patients at ICU admission treated with one of the three stand-alone non-invasive oxygenation strategies, 897 (82%) required endotracheal intubation and 310 (28%) died during the ICU stay. High-flow oxygen therapy by nasal cannula (n = 439) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 101) were associated with a lower rate of endotracheal intubation (70% and 88%, respectively) than oxygen masks (n = 553 and 91% intubated), p < 0.001. Compared to oxygen masks, high-flow oxygen therapy by nasal cannula was associated with lower ICU mortality (hazard ratio 0.75 [95% CI 0.58C0.98), and the hazard ratio for ICU mortality was 1.21 [95% CI 0.80C1.83] for non-invasive mechanical ventilation.

However, despite vulnerability to poorer outcomes, disaster preparedness for individuals with SCI is inadequate. Telemedicine has been effectively used to mitigate the impact of natural disasters. In this case study, we describe the provision of clinical care, via telemedicine, to an individual with SCI who was affected by the California Valley Fire in 2015. CASE PRESENTATION: The individual described was an adult who sustained a SCI. Before discharge from acute inpatient rehabilitation, they enrolled in a research study, through which they received outpatient SCI-specific care via telemedicine (teleSCI). The participant attended several teleSCI visits prior to the start of the Valley Fire. In the midst and immediate aftermath of prolonged wildfire, and despite experiencing significant personal loss as a result of the fire, the participant continued to receive teleSCI services. TeleSCI was used to address emergent and extant medical concerns and to facilitate replacement of medical supplies and equipment destroyed by fire. DISCUSSION: TeleSCI was used to provide continuity of care and was responsive to the needs of an individual with SCI severely affected by wildfire. Emergency preparedness that meets the needs of persons with disabilities is critical during times of crisis.

However, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic and likely to go undetected and untreated in the routine care of patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). METHODS We randomly assigned 572 patients 55 years of age or older, without known atrial fibrillation, who had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months (cause undetermined after standard tests, including 24-hour electrocardiography [ECG]), to undergo additional noninvasive ambulatory ECG monitoring with either a 30-day event-triggered recorder (intervention group) or a conventional 24-hour monitor (control group). The primary outcome was newly detected atrial fibrillation lasting 30 seconds or longer within 90 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes included episodes of atrial fibrillation lasting 2.5 minutes or longer and anticoagulation status at 90 days. RESULTS Atrial fibrillation lasting 30 seconds or longer was detected in 45 of 280 patients (16.1%) in the intervention group, as compared with 9 of 277 (3.2%) in the control group (absolute difference, 12.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.0 to 17.6; P<0.001; number needed to screen, 8). Atrial fibrillation lasting 2.5 minutes or longer was present in 28 of 284 patients (9.9%) in the intervention group, as compared with 7 of 277 (2.5%) in the control group (absolute difference, 7.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.4 to 11.3; P<0.001). By 90 days, oral anticoagulant therapy had been prescribed for more patients in the intervention group than in the control group (52 of 280 patients [18.6%] vs. 31 of 279 [11.1%]; absolute difference, 7.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.6 to 13.3; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with a recent cryptogenic stroke or TIA who were 55 years of age or older, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was common. Noninvasive ambulatory ECG monitoring for a target of 30 days significantly improved the detection of atrial fibrillation by a factor of more than five and nearly doubled the rate of anticoagulant treatment, as compared with the standard practice of short-duration ECG monitoring.

METHODS Primary culture of mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with Kappa Cg. The supernatant and cell lysate were used for ELISA, western blotting, immunofluorescence. Cg-induced mouse colitis was also developed. RESULTS Here we show that Cg activates peritoneal macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1. While Cg-induced TNF production/secretion depends on TLR4/MyD88 signaling, the production of pro-IL-1 relies on TLR4/TRIF/SYK/reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway. The maturation of pro-IL1 into IL-1 is dependent on canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation via Pannexin-1/P2X7/K+ efflux signaling. In vivo, Cg-induced colitis was reduced in mice in the absence of NLRP3 inflammasome components.

Novel malaria and chikungunya examples are presented, detailing how geospatial data in combination with information on air traffic can be used to predict the risks of vector-borne disease importation and establishment. Finally, we describe the development of an online tool, the Vector-Borne Disease Airline Importation Risk (VBD-Air) tool, which brings together spatial data on air traffic and vector-borne disease distributions to quantify the seasonally changing risks for importation to non-endemic regions. Such a framework provides the first steps towards an ultimate goal of adaptive management based on near real time flight data and vector-borne disease surveillance.","output":"Air travel and vector-borne disease movement."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Theoretically, in the tourism context this study introduced a new concept of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) for influenza, and tested the impact of NPI on the behavioral intention of potential international tourists.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?) is a key factor that is released during SARS-CoV-2 infection. TGF-?, by internalization of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), suppresses the anti-oxidant system, downregulates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and activates the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and nuclear factor-kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB). These changes cause inflammation and lung injury along with coagulopathy. Moreover, reactive oxygen species play a significant role in lung injury, which levels up during SARS-CoV-2 infection. DRUG SUGGESTION: Pirfenidone is an anti-fibrotic drug with an anti-oxidant activity that can prevent lung injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the maturation process of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?) and enhancing the protective role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Pirfenidone is a safe drug for patients with hypertension or diabetes and its side effect tolerated well. CONCLUSION: The drug as a theoretical perspective may be an effective and safe choice for suppressing the inflammatory response during COVID-19. The recommendation would be a combination of pirfenidone and N-acetylcysteine to achieve maximum benefit during SARS-CoV-2 treatment.","output":"Role of pirfenidone in TGF-? pathways and other inflammatory pathways in acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection: a theoretical perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To determine how serologic antibody testing outcome links with virus neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, we evaluated a unique set of individuals for SARS-CoV-2 antibody level and viral neutralization.

We then applied these platforms to a clinically relevant cohort of 114 individuals with unknown histories of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: In controls, the best performing virus-specific antibody detection platforms were SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG [specificity 87%, sensitivity 100%, positive predictive value (PPV) 100%, negative predictive value (NPV) 93%], spike IgG3 [specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%], and nucleocapsid protein (NP) IgG [specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%].

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been proven to be a major receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and could mediate virus entry into cells.

We prove that irradiation of aqueous suspensions of poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-coated silver nanoplates (PVPAgNP) or PVPAgNP in HeLa cells with red or NIR lasers causes a sizeable photothermal effect, which in cells can be visualized with the temperature sensing fluorophore Rhodamine B (RhB) using spinning disk confocal fluorescence microscopy or fluorescence lifetime imaging. Upon red-light irradiation of cells that were incubated with both, RhB and PVPAgNP at concentrations with no adverse effects on cell viability, a substantial heat release is detected. Initiation of cell death by photothermal effect is observed by positive signals of fluorescent markers for early and late apoptosis. Surprisingly, a new nanomaterial-assisted cell killing mode is operating when PVPAgNP-loaded HeLa cells are excited with moderate powers of fs-pulsed NIR light. Small roundish areas are generated with bright and fast (<1 ns) decaying emission, which expand fast and destroy the whole cell in seconds. This characteristic emission is assigned to efficient optical breakdown initiation around the strongly absorbing PVPAgNP leading to plasma formation that spreads fast through the cell.","output":"Photothermal therapy with silver nanoplates in HeLa cells studied by in situ fluorescence microscopy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both search and recommendation algorithms provide results based on their relevance for the current user.

The consumer culture of livestream e-commerce is becoming popular in China. However, a report from Southern Finance Omnimedia Corp of China pointed out that among China's top 1,000 livestream sellers, the top 20 sellers have contributed to nearly half of the gross merchandise volume (GMV), using three major Chinese streaming platforms: Taobao, Douyin, and Kuaishou. Moreover, a novice in livestream e-commerce knows less about the important impact factors of the realm. Akin to the adage, \\"well aware is well prepared,\\" knowing more about the influencing factors of livestream e-commerce more will be the chances to promote the commercial value. A benchmark research is needed to systematically trace out the most important and influencing factors and to make possible the rising of selling with less effort, hence this study. The research intends to sort out the relevant influencing factors that affect consumers' shopping motivation in livestream e-commerce by reviewing previous related literature. Then, through the Delphi method, eight experts constructed the 14 main influencing factors that affect consumers' shopping motivation in livestream e-commerce. Through DEMATEL-ANP, we can not only find the key factors but also sort out the causal relationship between the main key factors, forming a preliminary evaluation model of the commercial value of livestream sellers. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) of these impact factors found that \\"seller popularity\\" is the most critical factor affecting consumers' shopping motivation. At the same time, product discounts, product quality, and the attractiveness of the sellers are being included in effects by the \\"seller popularity.\\" The investigation followed in this study revealed that characteristics of the livestream seller are one of the most influencing factor achieving a total weight of 0.3020, whereas the streaming platform is the least influencing factor (total weight is 0.1333). The assessment made the study explore the sustainability of livestream e-commerce in China, and the proposed evaluation model can be used for the preliminary business value evaluation of people engaged in livestream sellers and related industries.

The school closures that followed lasted for a full school semester, including final exams. Italy is already known as a country with a high degree of educational inequality, where reproduction of social disadvantages by social origins is prominent. In such a situation, we hypothesise that a prolonged lockdown and the consequent reliance on remote education have played an important role in exacerbating existing inequalities. Families were forced to take on the full responsibility of educating their children, which has reinforced the role of household resources. The analysis presented in this article draws on results from an online survey of the effects of school closures on educational practices, the analysis focused on responses from parents of primary school students. The survey was carried out in Milan in June 2020 and was disseminated through institutional and informal channels after two months of school closure in Italy. Results were re\\\\balanced to represent different social classes. The survey explored the relationships between economic and social inequalities on the one hand, and school activity experienced at home during the lockdown on the other. It also explored the involvement of pupils and their parents in school activities. We aimed to capture what educational and organisational resources families were able to mobilise in this situation, and to what extent these are unequally distributed. Our results contribute to an understanding of the impact of family resources on educational chances, identifying resources and how they are distributed through the population. Our findings confirm that the pandemic has exacerbated already existing inequalities.","output":"Families between care, education and work: The effects of the pandemic on educational inequalities in Italy and Milan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"between experienced and assigned gender that does not have to be associated with discomfort or suffering. However, the aspect of suffering is emphasized in the understanding of the diagnostic unit of gender dysphoria according to the DSM-5 of the American Psychiatric Association. People with gender incongruence are exposed to misunderstanding, persecution and stigmatization, often related to experienced minority stress. The aim of this study was to analyze the available literature in terms of the relationship between gender dysphoria and some mental disorders and minority stress, and to draw attention to the suffering of these people in the context of social confrontation with the phenomenon of gender transposition. The unfavorable image of a person with gender dysphoria created by some media, persecution and, as a result, bans on gender reassignment in some countries mean that a steady increase in mental disorders in these patients can be expected. The main psychiatric problems in people with gender dysphoria, accompanied by minority stress for most of their lives so far, concern the coexistence of depressive and anxiety disorders, self-destructive behaviors and the tendency to addiction. An important aspect of the functioning of people with gender dysphoria are also difficulties in taking up and maintaining employment, fear of losing income due to attempting to live in accordance with the perceived gender. The authors of the presented review wanted to emphasize the importance of minority stress in the lives of these people and the need for social education and a change in the approach to the concept of \\"employee,\\" excluding the record gender from it, which - according to the authors - could help people with gender incompatibility in their working life by reducing minority stress.

Here, the synonymous nucleotide composition (SNC) of Sarbecovirus genomes was analysed by examining third codon-positions, dinucleotides, and degenerate codons. The results show evidence for the eigth following groups: (i) SARS-CoV related coronaviruses (SCoVrC including many bat viruses from China), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses (SCoV2rC; including five bat viruses from Cambodia, Thailand and Yunnan), (iii) pangolin viruses, (iv) three bat viruses showing evidence of recombination between SCoVrC and SCoV2rC genomes, (v) two highly divergent bat viruses from Yunnan, (vi) the bat virus from Japan, (vii) the bat virus from Bulgaria, and (viii) the bat virus from Kenya. All these groups can be diagnosed by specific nucleotide compositional features except the one concerned by recombination between SCoVrC and SCoV2rC. In particular, SCoV2rC genomes are characterised by the lowest percentages of cyosine and highest percentages of uracil at third codon-positions, whereas the genomes of pangolin viruses exhibit the highest percentages of adenine at third codon-positions. I suggest that latitudinal and taxonomic differences in the imbalanced nucleotide pools available in host cells during viral replication can explain the seven groups of SNC here detected among Sarbecovirus genomes. A related effect due to hibernating bats is also considered. I conclude that the two independent host switches from Rhinolophus bats to pangolins resulted in convergent mutational constraints and that SARS-CoV-2 emerged directly from a horseshoe bat virus.","output":"Variation in synonymous nucleotide composition among genomes of sarbecoviruses and consequences for the origin of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to identify hub genes closely correlated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their association with immune cell infiltration.

Concerns about the contribution of prescribed opioids, and particularly high-dose opioids, continue to mount as do initiatives to reduce prescribing. Evidence around opioid tapering, which can be challenging and potentially hazardous, is not well developed. A recent national guideline has recognized this and recommended referral to multidisciplinary care for challenging cases of opioid tapering. However, multidisciplinary care for opioid tapering is not well understood or defined. OBJECTIVE Identify the existing literature on any multidisciplinary care programs that evaluate impact on opioid use, synthesize how these programs work and clarify whom they benefit. STUDY DESIGN Systematic rapid realist review. DATASET Bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library), grey literature, reference hand search and formal expert consultation. RESULTS 95 studies were identified. 75% of the programs were from the United States and the majority (n = 62) were published after 2000. A minority (n = 23) of programs reported on >12 month opioid use outcomes. There were three necessary but insufficient mechanisms common to all programs: pain relief, behavior change and active medication management. Programs that did not include a combination of all three mechanisms did not result in opioid dose reductions. A concerning 20-40% of subjects resumed opioid use within one year of program completion. CONCLUSIONS Providing alternative analgesia is insufficient for reducing opioid doses. Even high quality primary care multidisciplinary care programs do not reduce prescribed opioid use unless there is active medication management accomplished by changing the primary opioid prescriber. Rates of return to use of opioids from these programs are very concerning in the current context of a highly potent and lethal street drug supply. This contextual factor may be powerful enough to undermine the modest benefits of opioid dose reduction via multidisciplinary care.","output":"Multidisciplinary care for opioid dose reduction in patients with chronic non-cancer pain: A systematic realist review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Exposure to telestroke in neurology residency is sparse despite its implementation in daily practice Due to COVID-19, we increased our utilization of telestroke Given this change in workflow, we investigated how residents utilize telestroke for Code Brain (CB) acute stroke evaluations and if expanding the use of telestroke in neurology residency programs is justified Methods: We retrospectively compared the number of CB evaluations, door to needle (DTN) times, door to decision (DTD) times, and NIHSS from March - June 2019 (in-person evaluations) against those in March - June 2020 (telestroke evaluations) We limited our study to resident-involved cases Nighttime and weekend CBs are run by a neurology resident and are remotely supervised Daytime CBs can be run by a resident, fellow, or attending We assumed that nighttime CBs are resident-run and daytime evaluations are the stroke team's evaluation Statistical analysis was performed using R Results: There were a total of 217 CBs in March - June 2019 and 115 in March - June 2020 In 2019, there were 120 daytime and 97 nighttime CBs;in 2020 there were 62 and 53 The mean DTN for the day for 2019 and 2020 was 45 9  23 2 and 48 4  20 2 (P=0 08) The mean DTN during the night for 2019 and 2020 was 67 3  53 7 and 53 8  25 8 (P=0 64) The mean DTD during the day for 2019 and 2020 was 48 1  41 0 and 44 9  37 6 (P=0 25) The mean DTD during the night for 2019 and 2020 was 60 9  51 1 and 65 8  94 6 (P=0 68) Using a generalized linear model approach to correct for shift (day/night), age, NIHSS, we found no significant differences in DTN or DTD before and after implementing resident-run telestroke Using Cohen's approach (1988) we estimated a Type 2 error probability at 7% Discussion: Our findings show that resident-run telestroke CBs are comparable to CBs run by fellows and attendings as DTN and DTD were not significantly different between the CBs run by residents in-person or via telestroke These metrics are also comparable for CBs in which a fellow or attending are supervising or running the CB Implementing resident-run telestroke consultation showed no effect on DTN or DTD after accounting for patient age, NIHSS, or the time of day These data should reassure programs seeking to grant telestroke privileges to trainees","output":"Efficacy and utility of resident-run telestroke evaluations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of October 2021, SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported among 512,613 children and adolescents in Israel (~33% of all COVID-19 cases).

One key area of inequity that has yet to be explored is disparities based on preferred language. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 164,368 adults tested for COVID-19 in a large healthcare system across Washington, Oregon, and California from March C July 2020. Using electronic health records, we constructed multi-level models that estimated the odds of testing positive for COVID-19 by preferred language, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and social factors. We further investigated interaction between preferred language and both race/ethnicity and state. Analysis was performed from OctoberCDecember 2020. RESULTS: Those whose preferred language was not English had higher odds of having a COVID-19 positive test (OR 3.07, p < 0.001); this association remained significant after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and social factors. We found significant interaction between language and race/ethnicity and language and state, but the odds of COVID-19 test positivity remained greater for those whose preferred language was not English compared to those whose preferred language was English within each race/ethnicity and state. CONCLUSIONS: People whose preferred language is not English are at greater risk of testing positive for COVID-19 regardless of age, race/ethnicity, geography, or social factors C demonstrating a significant inequity.

The current level of education had a statistically significant relationship with the intention to be vaccinated (p < 0.05). Respondents answered 11 questions encompassing five different domains of the Health Belief Model (HBM). All the items of HBM were significantly associated with the positive intention towards receiving the vaccine (p < 0.05). We conducted a multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess the relative contribution of different factors towards the intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Multiple factors such as belief that vaccination should be mandatory for everyone (AOR: 3.99, 95% CI: 3.20C4.98) and willingness to take vaccine even if it is not free (AOR: 3.91, 95% CI: 3.18C4.81) were observed to be associated with high odds of showing willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Most of our study participants intended to take vaccines based on their belief regarding the high effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine. But as rumor-mongers are generating and spreading conspiracy theories daily, the health department and policymakers need to undertake evidence-based campaigns through electronic and social media to ensure expected countrywide vaccination coverage. In this case, our study findings can serve as a foundation for them to ensure mass vaccination coverage among university students, which is crucial now to reopen the dormitories and restore everyday life on campuses.","output":"Factors affecting intention to take COVID-19 vaccine among Pakistani University Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews quantitative methods to estimate the basic reproduction number of pandemic influenza, a key threshold quantity to help determine the intensity of interventions required to control the disease. Although it is difficult to assess the transmission potential of a probable future pandemic, historical epidemiologic data is readily available from previous pandemics, and as a reference quantity for future pandemic planning, mathematical and statistical analyses of historical data are crucial. In particular, because many historical records tend to document only the temporal distribution of cases or deaths (i.e. epidemic curve), our review focuses on methods to maximize the utility of time-evolution data and to clarify the detailed mechanisms of the spread of influenza. First, we highlight structured epidemic models and their parameter estimation method which can quantify the detailed disease dynamics including those we cannot observe directly. Duration-structured epidemic systems are subsequently presented, offering firm understanding of the definition of the basic and effective reproduction numbers. When the initial growth phase of an epidemic is investigated, the distribution of the generation time is key statistical information to appropriately estimate the transmission potential using the intrinsic growth rate. Applications of stochastic processes are also highlighted to estimate the transmission potential using similar data. Critically important characteristics of influenza data are subsequently summarized, followed by our conclusions to suggest potential future methodological improvements.","output":"Quantifying the transmission potential of pandemic influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused severe damage to the world.

We interviewed a sample of these older adults recruited from local retirement communities and from primary care practices to learn their perceptions of barriers and enablers for their medication safety. The present study is part of the Partnership in Resilience for Medication Safety (PROMIS) study. One of the aims of this project is to identify barriers and opportunities to improve older adults' medication safety. These interviews were conducted during COVID-19 pandemic conditions. Results from this qualitative study suggest that trust between these older adults and their healthcare providers is an essential component of medication safety. Overarching themes include disruptions in medication management, caregivers caring for each other, patient safety practices or habits, and medication management literacy. Participants also shared strain due to lack of skills to navigate telemedicine visits, trust in Primary Care Providers (PCPs) and pharmacists to prescribe and dispense safely for them, reliance on PCPs and pharmacists to give essential information about medications without having to be asked. Our interviews illustrated large variations in older adults perceived role in medication safety, with some developing expertise in understanding how medications work for them and how long-term medications should be periodically reviewed. The types of information needs and supports from PCPs were likely different.

Between March and May 2020, the region of southern Switzerland was affected by the first pandemic peak, which was managed by dividing hospitals in Covid and non Covid facilities and by reducing elective surgery. At the end of the pandemic peak hospitals returned to their original structure but there was concern as to possible avoidance of former COVID facilities by patients because of fear of contracting of COVID-19 infection. For acute situations such as acute appendicitis, this could imply a delay of treatment. The aim of this retrospective study is to analyse the increment in incidence of complicated appendicitis in the post-pandemic period at our institution. METHODS: Clinical data of patients who underwent appendectomies in the period before and after the COVID-19 pandemic were analysed and compared. Diagnosis was based histopathological examination and/or on intra-operative or CT findings. Complicated appendicitis was defined as the presence of perforated or gangrenous appendicitis on histopathology or the presence of an abscess on CT scan. The incidence of complicated appendicitis, the time between onset of symptoms and patient admission (TOSA), the initial inflammatory blood tests and the complication rate was compared between the two periods. RESULTS: 79 patients were included in the study, 31 in the post-COVID-19 peak group (A), April - October 2020, and 48 in the pre-pandemic group (B), April - October 2019. Incidence of complicated appendicitis was significantly higher in group A (55% vs 14% p = 0.02). These findings correlate with a greater TOSA (mean time 35 hours vs 17 hours, p = 0.01) and higher inflammatory values in the initial blood test, (mean WBC count 14.8 G/l vs 12.9 G/l, p = 0.08 and mean CRP value 73 mg/l vs 43 mg/l, p = 0.01) in group A. CONCLUSION: Our data show a clear increase of incidence of complicated acute appendicitis after the pandemic peak in our hospital. Indeed patients tended to wait longer to visit our emergency department after the pandemic peak. One explanation is a possible fear by the patients of contracting COVID-19 infection in a former COVID hospital. Management of surgical emergencies during and after a pandemic peak phase should take into account the fact that patients may wait longer to visit a doctor thus aggravating the degree of their disease.","output":"Increased incidence of complicated acute appendicitis after the first COVID-19 pandemic peak: Have patients a different attitude towards COVID-hospitals?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NETosis is a program for formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which consist of modified chromatin decorated with bactericidal proteins from granules and cytoplasm.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 649 patients with PTC who underwent an initial surgical treatment. Retrospectively enrolled patients were categorized according to the ATA risk stratification system. Intermediate-risk patients were further categorized into subgroups by the number of ATA intermediate risk factors. The recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates of these subgroups were compared with those of low- and high-risk patient groups. Additionally, the patients were classified according to their response to the initial therapy using the dynamic risk stratification (DRS) system, and the percentages of patients in each category were compared among the subgroups. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 102 months. Structural recurrence occurred in 9.2% of all enrolled patients (60/649) and in 13.0% of intermediate-risk patients (40/308). Patients with two or more current intermediate risk factors had a poorer RFS than patients with only one risk factor (p < 0.001) and showed a comparable RFS to high-risk patients (p > 0.050). The percentages of patients with an excellent response category for DRS significantly decreased with an increase in the number of intermediate risk factors.

Candidemia, a fungal healthcare-associated infection, has been described in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. However, studies of candidemia and COVID-19 co-infection have been limited in sample size and geographic scope. We assessed differences in patients with candidemia with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a case-level analysis using population-based candidemia surveillance data collected through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infections Program during April-August 2020 to compare characteristics of candidemia patients with and without a positive test for COVID-19 in the 30 days before their Candida culture using chi-square or Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: Of the 251 candidemia patients included, 64 (25.5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Liver disease, solid organ malignancies, and prior surgeries were each >3 times more common in patients without COVID-19 co-infection, whereas intensive care unit-level care, mechanical ventilation, having a central venous catheter, and receipt of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants were each >1.3 times more common in patients with COVID-19. All cause in-hospital fatality was two times higher among those with COVID-19 (62.5%) than without (32.1%). CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of candidemia patients had COVID-19. These patients were less likely to have certain underlying conditions and recent surgery commonly associated with candidemia and more likely to have acute risk factors linked to COVID-19 care, including immunosuppressive medications.

Schematically, effector T cells specific for self-antigens exist normally, but their activity is modulated and prevented by networks of regulatory T cells. As a result of mimicry between molecular components of microorganisms and self-antigens, autoimmune disease can be triggered by specific foreign pathogens which alter the state of activity of the network from suppression to activation. Conversely, by a procedure known as T-cell vaccination, autologous effector T cells re-injected after in vitro stimulation and attenuation may alter the state of the network from an activation to a suppression. Numerous observations are reviewed that support the concept of autoimmune activity in the destruction of non-infected T4 cells. Such activity is presumed to be triggered by an antigen of viral origin, the most likely, but not the only one, being the envelope protein gp120. Based on this hypothesis, a T-cell vaccination procedure against effector T cells responsible for autoimmunopathic activity in HIV-seropositive patients is proposed, similar to the one known from experimental study of autoimmunity and presently being tested in human autoimmune diseases. Its purpose would be to prevent T-cell loss and the onset of immunodeficiency disease in HIV-seropositive patients. Apart from its potential therapeutic value, this procedure will have use as a therapeutic test from which insight will be gained about the immunopathogenesis of AIDS.","output":"Mechanisms of autoimmunity and AIDS: prospects for therapeutic intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zika virus (ZIKV) has received widespread attention because of its effect on the developing fetus. It is becoming apparent, however, that severe neurological sequelae, such as Guillian-Barr? syndrome (GBS), myelitis, encephalitis, and seizures can occur after infection of adults. This study demonstrates that a contemporary strain of ZIKV can widely infect astrocytes and neurons in the brain and spinal cord of adult, interferon / receptor knockout mice (AG129 strain) and cause progressive hindlimb paralysis, as well as severe seizure-like activity during the acute phase of disease. The severity of hindlimb motor deficits correlated with increased numbers of ZIKV-infected lumbosacral spinal motor neurons and decreased numbers of spinal motor neurons. Electrophysiological compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes in response to stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord were reduced when obvious motor deficits were present. ZIKV immunoreactivity was high, intense, and obvious in tissue sections of the brain and spinal cord. Infection in the brain and spinal cord was also associated with astrogliosis as well as T cell and neutrophil infiltration. CMAP and histological analysis indicated that peripheral nerve and muscle functions were intact. Consequently, motor deficits in these circumstances appear to be primarily due to myelitis and possibly encephalitis as opposed to a peripheral neuropathy or a GBS-like syndrome. Thus, acute ZIKV infection of adult AG129 mice may be a useful model for ZIKV-induced myelitis, encephalitis, and seizure activity.

Early mortality remains significantly high among patients with HLH. Our aim was to investigate clinical features and risk factors associated with 7-day and 30-day mortality among pediatric HLH patients. We retrospectively collected medical records of patients with discharge diagnosis of HLH between August 2014 and October 2018 from a tertiary childrens hospital in China. The main outcome measures were the 7-day and 30-day outcome after hospital admission. The associations between symptoms, concomitant diagnoses, laboratory test results, and the risk of 7-day and 30-day mortality were examined. RESULTS: Among 160 pediatric HLH patients, 18 (11.3%) patients were deceased within 7 days after admission, and 46 (28.8%) patients were deceased within 30 days. The identified strong risk factors (OR > 10 and p < 0.05) for 30-day mortality were myocardial damage, severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, gastrointestinal disorder, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Factors strongly associated with 7-day mortality were sepsis, myocardial damage, shock, and respiratory failure. All patients deceased within 7 days developed hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, and MODS. CONCLUSIONS: The identified risk factors could help to stratify patients with high risk of early death, and need to be considered in the development of treatment protocols.

There is limited data on survivability after inhospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly in rural and resource-limited settings. In this study, we describe the characteristics and outcomes for COVID-19 patients suffering IHCA at a rural hospital in Southern California. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective observational study performed at a rural situated community hospital in Southern California. A hospital registry of COVID-19 patients was queried for all patients who suffered IHCA and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) between May 1st 2020 and July 31st 2020. A manual chart review was performed to confirm cardiac arrest (CA), COVID-19 positivity, as well as to obtain patient demographics, medical comorbidities, COVID-19 specific therapies administered, oxygen requirement prior to CA, details of the resuscitation, and final disposition. Results: We identified twenty one patients who suffered IHCA and received CPR. The majority of these patients were Hispanic, male, and aged 50-70, and the most common medical comorbidities were diabetes and hypertension. Many patients received COVID-19 specific therapies, including dexamethasone, remdesivir, or convalescent plasma. 20/21 patients suffered respiratory arrest, with an initial rhythm of pulseless electrical activity or asystole. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in 3/9 patients already receiving mechanical ventilation, but all 3 expired within the following 24 hours. ROSC was achieved in 10/12 patients not already intubated, though most also expired within a few days. The only 2 patients who survived to discharge suffered respiratory arrest after their oxygen delivery dislodged. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study of COVID-19 cardiac arrests specifically in a rural setting in the United States. In this study at a small community hospital with limited resources and a predominantly Hispanic population, we found low survivability after IHCA in COVID-19 patients. While more is being learned about the disease, and treatment modalities are improving, cardiac arrest portends an extremely poor prognosis. A better appreciation of these outcomes should help inform providers and patients when discussing code status and attempts at resuscitation, particularly in resource limited settings.","output":"Outcomes for in-hospital cardiac arrest for COVID-19 patients at a rural hospital in Southern California"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Targeted screening for sexual abuse is needed for social workers to accurately identify those at risk.

Internalized EGF-receptor is either recycled or degraded, which fate is regulated in part by Ras interference 1 (RIN1). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that RIN1, a Ras effector protein and Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, controls several signaling molecules leading to the modulation of the telomerase activity; thus, allowing proper cell proliferation. We report that expression of RIN1 completely blocked proliferation of MCF-12 A and MCF-7 cells, while partially inhibited proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells upon EGF stimulation. Furthermore, expression of the C-terminal region of RIN1 selectively plays a critical role in the inhibition of the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. However, this inhibitory effect was specifically affected by the independent expression of RIN1:Vsp9 and RIN1:RA domains. Additionally, endogenous level of expression of RIN1 was decreased in metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells as compared with non-tumorigenic MCF-12 A cells. We observed that expression of RIN1:R94A mutant blocked the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells, while expression of RIN1:Y561F and RIN1:R629A mutants completely reversed the inhibitory effect of RIN1:WT. Consistent with our observations, we found that expression of RIN1:WT in MDA-MB-231 cells diminished both protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activities while p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were unaffected, but it produced downregulation of cellular-myelocytomatosis (c-Myc), erythroblast transformation specific (Ets2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) activities. Inversely, expression of high-mobility group box 1 (HMBG1) was inhibited whereas expression of forkhead box transcription factor 1 (FOXO1) was increased in cells expressing RIN1. Interestingly, expression of RIN1 blocked telomerase activity and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression, which correlated with the downregulations of c-Myc, Ets-2 and Stat3 activation. Taken together these findings indicate that RIN1 is a critical player in the modulation of the telomerase activity as well as hTERT expression in MDA-MB-231 cells upon EGF stimulation.","output":"Role of RIN1 on telomerase activity driven by EGF-Ras mediated signaling in breast cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"B Results: b 475 patients received remdesivir therapy and a total of 444 patients were included in the final study cohort.

While highly disruptive, the pandemic also brought mainstream attention to a wide array of scientific concepts and provided an opportunity to educate students about the science of COVID19 through multidisciplinary approaches about science in real\\\\time. Approaching this from many different disciplines, such as virology, immunology, biochemistry, genetics, public health, pharmacology, systems biology, and synthetic biology, we have brought together lessons devised by the authors and present a series of 25 curriculum modules that can be used either collectively or in parts to provide students with a multidisciplinary look at the virus. These modules are designed for both virtual and in person teaching and engages students to answer their own curiosity about the disease that will define their generation.","output":"A 360?

In response, states have passed regulations for office-based surgeries, private organizations have established standards for facility accreditation, and professional associations have developed clinical guidelines. While abortions have been performed in office setting for decades, states have also enacted laws requiring that facilities that perform abortions meet specific requirements. The extent to which facility requirements have an impact on patient outcomes-for any procedure-is unclear. METHODS AND FINDINGS We conducted a systematic review to examine the effect of outpatient facility type (ASC vs. office) and specific facility characteristics (e.g., facility accreditation, emergency response protocols, clinician qualifications, physical plant characteristics, other policies) on patient safety, patient experience and service availability in non-hospital-affiliated outpatient settings. To identify relevant research, we searched databases of the published academic literature (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science) and websites of governmental and non-governmental organizations. Two investigators reviewed 3049 abstracts and full-text articles against inclusion/exclusion criteria and assessed the quality of 22 identified articles. Most studies were hampered by methodological challenges, with 12 of 22 not meeting minimum quality criteria. Of 10 studies included in the review, most (6) examined the effect of facility type on patient safety. Existing research appears to indicate no difference in patient safety for outpatient procedures performed in ASCs vs. physician offices. Research about specific facility characteristics is insufficient to draw conclusions. CONCLUSIONS More and higher quality research is needed to determine if there is a public health problem to be addressed through facility regulation and, if so, which facility characteristics may result in consistent improvements to patient safety while not adversely affecting patient experience or service availability.","output":"The effect of facility characteristics on patient safety, patient experience, and service availability for procedures in non-hospital-affiliated outpatient settings: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control suggest that individuals over the age of 70 years or with underlying cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or diabetes are at increased risk of severe COVID-19. However, the prevalence of these prognostic factors is unknown in many countries. We aimed to describe the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors of severe COVID-19 at national and county level in Sweden. We calculated the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on records from the Swedish national health care and population registers for 3 years before 1st January 2016. 9,624,428 individuals were included in the study population. 22.1% had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). We show that one in five individuals in Sweden is at increased risk of severe COVID-19. When compared with the critical care capacity at a local and national level, these results can aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the current pandemic.

The spread of aerosols through singing and musical instruments in music performances has necessitated the need for utilizing precautionary methods such as masks and portable purifiers. This study investigates the effects of placing portable air purifiers at different locations inside a classroom, as well as the effects of different aerosol injection rates (e.g., with and without masks, different musical instruments etc.). The time varying deposition of aerosols on the walls and the airborne aerosol concentration are analyzed in this study. It was found that proper placement of purifiers could offer a significant advantage in reducing airborne aerosol numbers (offering orders of magnitude higher aerosol removal when compared to having no purifiers, where the removal is sometimes nearly zero), while improper placement of the purifiers could worsen the situation. It was concluded that in general, the purifier should be placed as close to the injector as possible in order to yield a benefit, and also away from the people to be protected. Moreover, using purifiers could help in achieving ventilation rates close to the prescribed values by WHO, while also achieving aerosol removal times within the CDC recommended guidelines. This could help in deciding effective break periods between classroom sessions, which was found to be around 25 minutes through this study. The injection rate was found to have an almost linear correlation with the average airborne aerosol suspension rate and aerosol surface deposition rate, which could be used to predict the trends for scenarios with other injection rates.","output":"Airborne Transmission of Virus-Laden Aerosols inside a Music Classroom: Effects of Portable Purifiers and Aerosol Injection Rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clear guidance is needed in the development and implementation of laboratory biomarkers in medicine.

These models work well for counterfactual studies in which a fully mixed large-scale population is relevant. However, with finite size populations, chance variations may lead to significant departures from the mean. In real-life applications, finite size effects arise from the variance of individual realizations of an epidemic course about its fluid limit. In this article, we consider the classical stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, and derive a martingale formulation consisting of a deterministic and a stochastic component. The deterministic part coincides with the classical deterministic SIR model and we provide an upper bound for the stochastic part. Through analysis of the stochastic component depending on varying population size, we provide a theoretical explanation of finite size effects. Our theory is supported by quantitative and direct numerical simulations of theoretical infinitesimal variance.

At present, mood symptoms are the foremost common psychological problems worldwide, yet little is known regarding their magnitude and associated factors in developing countries. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the magnitude and associated factors of anxiety, depressive, manic symptoms, and suicidal behavior among the rural Jimma community, Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based quantitative cross-sectional survey was employed on 423 households selected through systematic random sampling. An adapted version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview tool was used for the structured face-to-face interview. The collected data were checked for completeness, coded, and inserted into Epi Data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Variables with P < g0.05 and odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] on multivariate logistic regression analysis were considered as factors associated with the outcome variable. Results: Overall, 185 (44.0%), 55 (13.1%), 44 (10.5%), and 23 (5.5%) of the respondents had anxiety, depressive, manic symptom, and suicide behavior, respectively. The odds of having anxiety symptoms were nearly 5 times higher among those who had perceived discrimination and racism experience compared to their counterpart [adjusted OR (AOR), 5.02; 95% CI, 1.90C13.26]. Likewise, recently bereaved participants had 4-fold higher odds of reporting depressive symptoms (AOR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.4C10.4) than the non-bereaved ones. Furthermore, respondents who had depressive symptoms were almost four and a half times more likely to have manic symptoms compared to those who did not (AOR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.71C11.02).

These various types of cells have several important functions; thus, communication between these cells plays an important role in homeostasis as well as in the pathophysiology of diseases in the lungs. For a better understanding of the pathophysiology of lung diseases, researchers have isolated each type of lung cell to investigate the changes in their gene expressions, including their humoral factor or adhesion molecules, to reveal the intercellular communication among these cells. In particular, investigations during the past decade have focused on extracellular vesicles, which are lipid bilayer delimited vesicles released from a cell that can move among various cells and transfer substances, including microRNAs, mRNAs and proteins, thus, functioning as intercellular messengers. Extracellular vesicles can be classified into three general groups: apoptotic bodies, exosomes, and microparticles. Extracellular vesicles, especially exosomes and microparticles, are attracting increasing attention from pulmonologists as tools for understanding pathogenesis and disease diagnosis. Here, we review studies, including our own, on exosomes and microparticles and their roles in both lung homeostasis and the pathogenesis of lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive lung diseases, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

This tool has been successfully implemented in different specialties. It is useful for providing quick solutions, improving the overload of the medical care and for the early detection of inflammatory diseases1. In our centre, virtual consultation from Primary Care (PC) to Hospital Care (HC) has been implemented. Objectives: The main objective is to describe our experience with the use of virtual consultation and its value as a new modality of specialised medical care. The second aim is to identify the most frequent reasons for consultation and diagnoses, to assess the concordance between the two and to analyse the trend over time of the number of virtual consultations and their relationship with the different waves of the COVID 19 pandemic. Methods: Retrospective observational study. The virtual consultations made from PC (47 centres) to Rheumatology during 2020 were analysed. They were carried out through a computer programme, using the Andalusian Health Service Virtual Consultation Platform tool. A specific agenda was established for virtual consultations. The reason for the referral and the rheumatologist's diagnosis were collected. The response given to the PC was divided into four models: NON-TRIBUTARY (not related to the speciality), DISCHARGE (a diagnosis and therapeutic response is concluded), APPOINTMENT FOR CONSULTATION and FOLLOW-UP (new contact is requested, completing the information). The reasons for consultation, diagnoses, time and type of response were analysed. Results: 47 virtual consultations were carried out. 54.5% (n 298) were closed as DISCHARGE. 27.4% (n 150) were APPOINTMENT FOR CONSULTATION, and 17.7% (n 97) indicated FOLLOW-UP. Only 0.4% (n 2) were NOT TRIBUTARY. The average response time was 2 days 15 hours and 56 min. The most frequent reason for consultation was polyarthralgias (26.7%, n 146) and after the rheumatologist's assessment a diagnosis was established in 89% of them. Inflammatory arthropathy accounted for 30.8% (n 45), osteoarthritis for 19.9% (n 29), fibromyalgia for 12.3% (n 18), polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) for 6.9% (n 10), osteoporosis for 2.7% (n 4) and connective tissue disease for 2.1% (n 3). Another frequent reason for consultation was osteoporosis (13.5% n 74), of which 85.1% (n 63) had a confirmed diagnosis and/or need for revision. A diagnosis could be made via telematics in 89.6% of the consultations. 15.5% were osteoporosis (n 85), 14.9% osteoarthritis (n 81), 10.5% soft tissue injuries, 8.8% mechanical/ nonspecific pain (n 47), 7.1% rheumatoid arthritis (n 39), 6.5% fibromyalgia (n 34), 6.2% connective tissue disease (n 34), 5.7% PMR (n 31), 4.9% suspected spondyloarthritis (n 26), 4.2% psoriatic arthritis (n 23) and 4.2% microcrystalline arthritis (n 23). 27.4% (n 150) of the virtual consultations were required for assessment in a face-to-face appointment. We analysed the distribution over time (Figure 1). In the COVID 19 confinement phase (14 March -21 June), the number of consultations increased, peaking in June, a behaviour that has persisted in the other mobility phases (October/November). Conclusion: More than half of the virtual consultations carried out were resolved without face-to-face assessment, with a diagnosis being established in almost 90%. It is an effective tool for rapid access to Rheumatology, detecting pathology requiring preferential attention, with a face-to-face appointment, as well as for the early diagnosis of inflammatory arthropathy, which was detected in a quarter of the consultations, as well as for the diagnosis and follow-up of osteoporosis.

Environmental conditions, behaviors, and social determinants of health account for 80 percent of overall health outcomes. With shortages of clinical providers stressing an already burdened healthcare system, Community Health Workers (CHWs) can bridge healthcare gaps by addressing these nonmedical factors influencing health. This paper details how a comprehensive training model equips CHWs for workforce readiness so they can perform at the top of their practice and profession and deliver well-coordinated client/patient-centered care. Methods: Literature reviews and studies revealed that training CHWs alone is not sufficient for successful workforce readiness, rather CHW integration within the workforce is needed. Consequently, this comprehensive training model is developed for CHWs with varying skill levels and work settings, and supervisors to support organizational readiness and CHW integration efforts. A systematic training program development approach along with detailed implementation methods are presented. Continuing education sessions to support CHW practice and Organizational Readiness Training for supervisors, leadership and team members directly engaged with CHWs in the workplace are also discussed. CHWs were involved in all phases of the research, development, implementation, and actively serve in evaluations and curriculum review committees. Results: Components of the comprehensive training model are presented with an emphasis on the core CHW training. Two CHW training tracks are offered using three delivery modalities. Process measures with student learning objectives, outcome measures developed using the Kirkpatrick model to capture attitude, perceptions, knowledge acquisition, confidence, behavior, and overall experience, and impact stories by two CHWs are presented. Lessons learned from the implementation of the training program are discussed in three categories: Practice-driven curricula, student-centered training implementation, and adaptations in response to COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: This comprehensive training model recognizes that training CHWs in a robust training program is key as the demand for well-rounded CHWs increases. Furthermore, a comprehensive training program must include training for supervisors, leadership, and team members working directly with CHWs.

In response to this overload, they produced negative thoughts and more negative (fear and anger) than positive (protection) emotions. These distinct reactions had differential effects on media attention and risk perceptions. Fear and protection were positively related to media attention and risk perceptions, while anger and negative thinking undermined attention and perceptions. Furthermore, all reactions depended on media trust, which mediated the effect on media attention. These findings highlighted desirable and some undesirable effects of health communication in the fight against COVID-19, which can be used to improve health communication in the future.","output":"Emotional and Cognitive Responses to COVID-19 Information Overload under Lockdown Predict Media Attention and Risk Perceptions of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While much is known on how the maternal diet affects offspring fitness, less is known on the role of taste in guiding and promoting food intake during this crucial period.

We performed longitudinal brief-access taste testing in female mice before, during, and after pregnancy, along with quantitative PCR on taste buds and morphological analysis of taste tissues from pregnant and non-pregnant mice. Sucrose licking response decreased progressively during pregnancy compared to that prior to mating, with partial recovery in the post-partum period. No change in taste morphology was evident between pregnant and non-pregnant mice, however a notable decrease in T1R3 sweet taste receptor expression was recorded in pregnant dams.

Hence, the diagnostics and treatment of COVID-19 should address such a possibility in the anamnesis, treatment and final recommendations for avoiding of adverse exposure. ABBREVIATED DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE As SARS-CoV-2 attacks primarily the respiratory system and the severe manifestation of COVID-19 is interstitial pneumonia, diagnostics should include the following clinical and laboratory examinations: chest X-ray; high resolution computed tomography (HRCT); pulmonary function tests; arterial-blood gas test; genetic tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, in the future with the use of highly specific and sensitive nano-based biosensors; tests for the presence of specific immunity against the antigens of microorganisms causing other infectious or allergic pulmonary diseases (in the case of anamnestic indications). Because an universally accepted treatment for COVID-19 does not exist, the hitherto prescribed antiviral and immune-modulating drugs should be used be with caution. In many cases, a better alternative could be a safe supportive therapy, such as supplementation of the diet with probiotics, prebiotics, vitamins and microelements. SUMMARY The most important preventive measures against COVID-19 should include: vaccination; the use of filter or surgical masks; disinfection and sterilization; maintaining of well-functioning ventilation and air conditioning systems; reduction of the community air pollution which has been identified as an important factor increasing the COVID-19 severity. In the choice of preventive measures, the above should be considered for their potential efficacy against other bioaerosols as potential disease-aggravating agents.","output":"COVID 19 - Possible interrelations with respiratory comorbidities caused by occupational exposure to various hazardous bioaerosols.

In heart, NO produced by cardiac myocytes has diverse and even opposite effects on myocardial contractility depending on the subcellular location of its production. Approximately a decade ago, using a combination of biophysical and biochemical approaches, we discovered and characterized high- and low-affinity CATs that function simultaneously in the cardiac myocyte plasma membrane. Later on, we reported a negative feedback regulation of NO on the activity of cardiac CATs. In this way, NO was found to modulate its own biosynthesis by regulating the amount of L-arginine that becomes available as NOS substrate. We have recently solved the molecular determinants for this NO regulation on the low-affinity high-capacity CAT-2A.

We compared data among four different periods: from 1 January 2020 to 17 March 2020 (Pre-Lockdown); from 18 March 2020 to 17 May 2020 (Lockdown); from 18 May 2020 to 2 November 2020 (Post-Lockdown) and from 3 November 2020 to 30 November 2020 (Regional Lockdown). RESULTS: The overall number of performed routine outpatient visits per day (ROVs) was 11,871 (Mean  SD = 35.76  17.81), whereas booked appointments (BAs) were 21272 (Mean  SD = 63.86  9.27), meaning a decline in the number of ROVs by 44.01%.

This risk factor refrains many potential investors from investing in the share market directly.

To avoid the risk factors and increase the gain, they put the accumulated capital in multiple stocks. They need to perform many calculations and predictions to overcome the uncertainties and unpredictability and need to ensure higher gains to the investors of that mutual fund. In this research work initially, a data mining based approach employs a curve fitting/regression technique to forecast the individual stock price. Based on the above analysis, we propose a framework to diversify the investment of the capital fund. This method employs buy and hold strategy using both statistical features and basic domain knowledge of the share market. The proposed framework distributes the capital first, by distributing sector-wise, and then for each sector, investing company-wise, as a diversified approach among different stocks for higher return but maintaining lower risks.

We investigated whether mental imagery of the 9/11 terrorist attacks following media exposure is dampened by taxing working memory (WM). METHODS Forty-five young adult UK residents, who were exposed to the 9/11 terrorist attacks as children via the media, identified a personally-relevant mental image of the attacks. They were then randomly allocated to: (1) recall + Tetris, (2) recall + eye movements (EMs), or (3) recall-only. Ratings on imagery vividness and emotionality were provided at three time points: pre-, post-manipulations, and at 24-hr follow-up. RESULTS Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that recall + Tetris and recall + EMs (relative to recall-only) significantly reduced imagery vividness and emotionality from pre- to post-manipulations, but not to follow-up. LIMITATIONS A passive control group is needed to fully rule out the role of natural memory decay; the follow-up was exploratory and took place outside the laboratory with reduced experimental control. CONCLUSIONS Aversive memory imagery from media trauma in civilians can be dampened by taxing WM, at least temporarily, which could be therapeutically useful.

The goal of 3D mammography is to improve accuracy compared to 2D digital mammography (DM), by increasing sensitivity and decreasing recall rates. To capture the broad utilization of DBT in populations receiving both screening and diagnostic imaging, this analysis investigates DBT usage over time in a longitudinal sample from 2016 through 2020 for adult women ranging from 18-74 years of age. Methods Retrospective analyses were conducted using de-identified administrative claims data from a large national U.S. health insurer. The study cohort consisted of women who were continuously enrolled in a commercial or Medicare Advantage plan from 1/2016 to 12/2020 and aged 18 to 74 years old as of 2016. All procedures were identified based on Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes. For each study year, receipt of breast cancer screening with DM (S-DM) or including DBT (S-DBT) were captured. Receipt of DM and DBT not specified for screening based on CPT code descriptions were categorized as diagnostic, D-DM and D-DBT respectively. Women that received both DBT and DM in the same year were included in the DBT group. In addition, women who received MRI and ultrasound were also captured. Rates of each procedure by study year, insurance type, and age categories that align with recommended screening guidelines (<40 years old, 40-49 years old and 50-74 years old) were examined. Results Approximately 3.8 million women met study criteria;85% were commercially insured and 15% were Medicare Advantage. Table 1 shows rates of adult women who received mammography, MRI and ultrasound over the study period. About 74% of study subjects receiving screening were 50-74 years old at the start of the study period, 25% were 40-49 years and 1% were under 40 years old. In 2020, there were fewer women (3%-13%) receiving imaging procedures compared to counts in 2019. During the 5-year study period, there was a 3.5-fold increase in the number of women who received S-DBT. In 2016, 23% of women who received a screening mammogram received S-DBT and by 2020, this percent increased to 82%. The percent of women who received a diagnostic mammogram using D-DBT compared to D-DM also increased overtime;29% of women received a D-DBT in 2016 and this increased to 77% in 2020. The number of women with receipt of ultrasound and MRI were similar in each study year. The percent diagnostic/screening tests (including DBT and DM) were in the range of 18.5%-20.2% each year. Conclusion Among this cohort of women who were continuously enrolled in the health plan throughout the 5-year study period, this analysis shows that screening and diagnostic DBT utilization rates increased from 2016 to 2020 while DM screening and diagnostic imaging utilization concomitantly decreased. The percentages of women that received S-DBT and D-DBT were highest in 2020, even though 8%-13% fewer women had evidence of mammography than in 2019, which is largely due to COVID-19 related healthcare service disruptions. The rate of diagnostic tests as a percent of screening tests did not decrease with the adoption of DBT.

The compound is formed during fermentation and the following mash storage by enzymatic hydrolysis of naturally present pectins. Methanol is toxic above certain threshold levels and legal limits have been set in most jurisdictions. Therefore, the methanol content needs to be mitigated and its level must be controlled. This article will review the several factors that influence the methanol content including the pH value of the mash, the addition of various yeast and enzyme preparations, fermentation temperature, mash storage, and most importantly the raw material quality and hygiene. From all these mitigation possibilities, lowering the pH value and the use of cultured yeasts when mashing fruit substances is already common as best practice today. Also a controlled yeast fermentation at acidic pH facilitates not only reduced methanol formation, but ultimately also leads to quality benefits of the distillate.

AIM: To document knowledge, perception, and attitude of the public from Two large countries in the MENA region (Egypt and Saudi Arabia) towards participation in clinical trials focused on evaluating potential COVID-19 treatments. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted that used a snowball sampling strategy for recruitment. General population 18 years old or older, who lived in Saudi Arabia or Egypt were invited. The survey was adopted from literature and was approved by an ethics committee. RESULTS: Out of 800 participants in the survey, 407 participants were from Egypt, and 393 were from Saudi Arabia.

The purpose of instance segmentation is to jointly detect, classify and segment individual instances in images, so it is used to solve a large number of industrial tasks such as novel coronavirus diagnosis and autonomous driving. However, it is not easy for instance models to achieve good results in terms of both efficiency of prediction classes and segmentation results of instance edges. We propose a single-stage instance segmentation model EEMask (edge-enhanced mask), which generates grid ROIs (regions of interest) instead of proposal boxes. EEMask divides the image uniformly according to the grid and then calculates the relevance between the grids based on the distance and grayscale values. Finally, EEMask uses the grid relevance to generate grid ROIs and grid classes. In addition, we design an edge-enhanced layer, which enhances the models ability to perceive instance edges by increasing the number of channels with higher contrast at the instance edges. There is not any additional convolutional layer overhead, so the whole process is efficient. We evaluate EEMask on a public benchmark. On average, EEMask is 17.8% faster than BlendMask with the same training schedule. EEMask achieves a mask AP score of 39.9 on the MS COCO dataset, which outperforms Mask RCNN by 7.5% and BlendMask by 3.9%.","output":"Edge-enhanced instance segmentation by grid regions of interest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Silastic ring vertical gastroplasty (SRVG), a newer modification of Mason's vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG), was the restrictive procedure of choice for many bariatric surgeons before the advent of the laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. However, a high rate of reoperations for failure and severe complications was reported in long-term studies. Around 50% of the patients underwent conversion to other bariatric procedures. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to report our experience in laparoscopic conversion of failed VBG and SRVG to biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). SETTINGS The setting of the study was at the University hospital. METHODS Between March 2010 and July 2013, 12 patients underwent laparoscopic conversion of VBG and SRVG to BPD. Using a prospectively collected database, we analyzed their data and outcomes. RESULTS Eighty-six percent of the conversions were successfully completed laparoscopically. The mean operative time was 220 min. There was no mortality. Perioperative complications occurred in four patients (33%). One (9%) late complication, an adhesional small bowel obstruction, was encountered later than 30 days postoperatively. The follow-up rate was 100%, but only three patients reached 3 years at the time of this writing. At a mean follow-up of 19 (3-40) months, the mean body mass index (BMI) decreased from 45.3 to 27.8 kg/m2. Percent excess weight loss (EWL) was 65.7, and 86.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic conversion of failed VBG to BPD is feasible and effective in further reducing weight in morbidly obese patients. Weight loss continues beyond the first postoperative year. However, the complication rate is much higher than in the primary procedure.","output":"Laparoscopic conversion of failed silastic ring vertical gastroplasty (SRVG) and vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) into biliopancreatic diversion (BPD)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction in COVID-19 and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) are two diseases that can associate with an altered immune response to the infecting virus. To determine the similarities and differences in the cytokine and chemokine responses in these two infections, we compared responses in patients with varying severity of COVID-19 and acute dengue at different time points of illness. During early disease, patients who proceeded to develop COVID-19 severe pneumonia (SP) and DHF had significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-10 and MIP3&#945; than those who developed mild illness. The lowest levels of IFN?3 in early illness were seen in those who succumbed to their illness due to COVID-19. Levels of serum IL-10 (p = 0.0001), IL-6 (p = 0.002), MIP-3&#945; (p = 0.02) and CD40-L levels (p = 0.002) significantly increased from 5 to 9 day of illness to 10-21 day of illness in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, but not in those with mild illness. In contrast, these cytokine/chemokine levels remained unchanged in those with DHF or dengue fever (DF) during febrile and critical phases. Although IL-10 levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with SP, patients with DHF had 25-fold higher levels, whereas IL-6 levels were 11-fold higher in those with COVID-19 SP. IL-10 and other cytokines were evaluated in a larger cohort of patients during early illness (&#8804; 4 days) who proceeded to develop DF (n = 71) or DHF (n = 64). Of the cytokines evaluated, IL-10 was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in those who went on to develop DHF compared to DF. Low IFN?3 response to the SARS-CoV2 and high levels of immunosuppressive IL-10 in both COVID-19 and dengue during early illness are indicators of an altered antiviral response potentially contributing to disease severity.","output":"Similarities and differences between the 'cytokine storms' in acute dengue and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown have been a seismic shock for youth in India, elevating their risk of mental health problems like depression.

The BDI-II was self-administered by 783 respondents (males = 243; females = 540). Results indicated overall mild levels of depression (mean BDI = 16.48) and high point prevalence, with 51.8% (n = 406) of the population being symptomatic, of which 16.3% had severe, 17.9% had moderate, and 17.8% had mild levels of depression. No association was found with age, gender, educational level of participants, period of hostel stay, education, and occupational level of parents. Overall percentages of symptomatic women were higher, suggesting the gendered effects of the pandemic. This study explored the symptomatology of depression wherein sadness, changes in sleep patterns, and concentration difficulties emerged as the most commonly experienced symptoms. Symptom expression was found to vary with intensity and gender. Symptomatic men experienced significantly more cognitive symptoms like self-criticalness, punishment feelings, thoughts about past failures, and changes in sleep patterns, while symptomatic women felt significantly high loss of energy. No significant gender differences were seen in the experience of cognitive-affective symptoms. Possible reasons are discussed.

Higher education institutions were expected to be the least affected due to their long history of distance education, which has enabled the development of expertise and technical infrastructure, but were they? The present study focuses on faculty members' experiences at the time of emergency remote teaching and afterwards. The survey method was devised to conduct the study. An online questionnaire called the Emergency Remote Teaching Views Questionnaire was developed by the researchers and administered at higher education institutions throughout Turkey. With a combination of convenience and snowball sampling, 351 faculty members from 72 different public and private higher education institutions were reached. The descriptive analysis of the data revealed that almost 62% of the faculty members had never taken any form of training regarding online distance education before the Covid-19 pandemic. Although one fifth of the faculty members indicated that they had had distance education experience three times or more before the pandemic, around 62% of them encountered remote teaching for the first time. Many faculty members indicated that they spent more time on remote teaching than face-to-face teaching;they had trouble following students' development;the students were disinterested in the classes;they had technical problems, but they also received support from their institutions. Although only one fourth of the faculty members reported being unsure about the quality of their remote teaching, three fourths of them believed that it was not as fruitful as face-to-face teaching. This was especially evident in the area of assessment and evaluation. Based on these results, it can be concluded that higher education institutions were caught unprepared, but their adaptation was very quick.","output":"Challenge Accepted: Experiences of Turkish Faculty Members at the Time of Emergency Remote Teaching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Limited data about disease management strategies are available for pediatric patients with coronavirus disease-2019, particularly in Turkey. This study aimed to share the data on patients aged under 18 years in our country to be beneficial for understanding the disease course in children. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of pediatric patients aged under 18 years who were confirmed as coronavirus disease-2019 between March 11, and June 23, 2020, and were admitted to our hospitals was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 220 pediatric patients with coronavirus disease-2019 were evaluated, of which 48.2% were boys, with a median age of 10 years, and 9.5% had underlying diseases. Patients were classified according to severity, with the percentages of asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and critical/severe cases determined to be 25.5%, 45%, 26.8%, and 2.7%, respectively.

We present the clinical case of an 82-year-old male patient, SARS COV-2 infected, with MSE after 48 h with invasive mechanical ventilation in critical intensive care. He was treated with negative pressure therapy (NPT) allowing effective resolution of the MSE in a short period (5 days) with a minimally invasive bedside approach, reducing the potential air exposure of health personnel by keeping the viral load retained by the emphysema.

Each oligonucleotide was 29 bases long, starting at every 5th base of every sequence, resulting in an overlap of 24 bases in two consecutive oligonucleotides. The applicability of the array for virus identification was examined using PCR amplified products from multiple HAV and CV strains. PCR products labeled with biotin were hybridized to the array, and the biotin was detected using a brief reaction with Cy3-labeled streptavidin, the array subjected to laser scanning, and the hybridization data plotted as fluorescence intensity against each oligonucleotide in the array. The combined signal intensities of all probes representing a particular strain of virus were calculated and plotted against all virus strains identified on a linear representation of the array. The profile of the total signal intensity identified the strain that is most likely represented in the amplified cDNA target.

The Spanish government has enforced social distancing, quarantine, and home confinement measures. Such restrictions on activities of daily life and separation from loved ones may lead to social isolation and loneliness with health-related consequences among community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and their caregivers. Additionally, inadequate access to health care and social support services may aggravate chronic conditions. Home-based technological interventions have emerged for combating social isolation and loneliness, while simultaneously preventing the risk of virus exposure. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cohort study is to explore, analyze, and determine the impact of social isolation on (1) cognition, quality of life, mood, technophilia, and perceived stress among community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and on the caregiver burden; (2) access to and utilization of health and social care services; and (3) cognitive, social, and entertainment-related uses of information and communication technologies. METHODS: This study will be conducted in Mlaga (Andaluca, Spain). In total 200 dyads, consisting of a person with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and his/her informal caregiver, will be contacted by telephone. Potential respondents will be participants of the following clinical trials: support, monitoring, and reminder technology for mild dementia (n=100) and television-based assistive integrated service to support European adults living with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment (n=100). RESULTS: As of May 2021, a total of 153 participants have been enrolled and assessed during COVID-19 confinement, of whom 67 have been assessed at 6 months of enrollment. Changes in the mean values of the variables will be analyzed relative to baseline findings of previous studies with those during and after confinement, using repeated-measures analysis of variance or the nonparametric Friedman test, as appropriate. The performance of multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to introduce potential covariates will also be considered. Values of 95% CI will be used.

RESULTS: The model was presented for three groups based on the incidence rate: less than 200, between 200 and 1000, and above 1000. The mean absolute error of model evaluation were 4.71, 8.54, and 6.13%, respectively. Also, comparing the forecast results with the actual values in the period in question showed that the proposed model predicted the number of globally confirmed cases of COVID-19 with a very high accuracy of 98.45%. CONCLUSION: Using data from different geographical regions within a country and discovering the pattern of prevalence in a region and its neighboring areas, our boosting-based model was able to accurately predict the incidence of COVID-19 within a two-week period.","output":"Predicting the incidence of COVID-19 using data mining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter of this case is continuous manufacturing and how it relates to the production of generic drugs Students in accounting, management, and supply chain programs will benefit from the case The case is appropriate for senior-level undergraduate courses and for first-year graduate students This case can be taught within three hours of classroom time Students will need two to three hours of outside preparation, depending upon their familiarity with supply chain issues and batch and continuous manufacturing CASE SYNOPSIS Over the past decade, as brand-name drug prices have soared, generic drug prices have steadily decreased relative to the consumer price index Manufacturers have little incentive to produce generic drugs at such low profit margins With few manufacturers producing a given drug, there is a significant risk of shortages, and the supply chain is vulnerable to external events The recent COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates these problems with alarming clarity In addition to shortages of ventilators and personal protective equipment, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reported shortages of key antibiotics and ventilator-associated drugs (FDA) Generic drugs make up 90% of all prescriptions in the United States (National Conference of State Legislators, 2019) Thus, problems arising from the pricing and supply of generic drugs have the potential to affect millions of patients Most pharmaceuticals are produced using batch manufacturing (Myerson et al , 2014), in which inputs undergo a series of steps that convert them into a final product An alternative production system, continuous manufacturing, can alleviate problems associated with batch production and has the potential to mitigate generic drug shortages This case explores the use of continuous manufacturing using fictitious company Jazzy Pharmaceuticals and its experience with its drug Premier","output":"Generic Drug Shortages: a Case for Continuous Manufacturing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various reports indicate an association between COVID-19 and anosmia, suggesting an infection of the olfactory sensory epithelium, and thus a possible direct virus access to the brain.

We analyzed a human olfactory single-cell RNA-seq dataset and determined that sustentacular cells, which maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, express ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We then observed that the ACE2 protein was highly expressed in a subset of sustentacular cells in human and mouse olfactory tissues.

Healthcare workers remain one of the most affected groups due to life threatening risks in addition to increased working hours and labor intensity. All these factors may affect sleep quality of this population. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sleep behaviors of healthcare professionals working in secondary and tertiary hospitals in a large population in Turkey and to show how sleep quality is affected during the pandemic process using the easily applicable Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS). The population of this cross-sectional descriptive study consists of two pandemic hospitals determined in Kahramanmara? province. In our questionnaire, we asked subjective sleep quality, sleep time, time to fall asleep, total sleep time, and medication use. We also used JSS Turkish version (JSS-TR) to assess sleep quality and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) for increased daytime sleepiness. RESULTS: Healthcare workers who participated in our survey reported that they started to go to bed later, fell asleep later (mean: 41.75  35.35 min), their total sleep time (mean: 6.67  1.88 h) was shortened, and they needed medication to sleep more (5.7%) after the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, bedtime behavior after 24:00 decreased from 80.1 to 43.9% of those who previously went to bed before 24:00. For those who went to bed after 24:00 before, it increased from 19.9 to 56.1%. In addition, sleep quality as assessed by subjective and JSS significantly deteriorated after the COVID-19 pandemic. Excessive daytime sleepiness increased. Those with ESS > 10 before and after COVID-19 were 3.9% and 14.1%, respectively (p < 0.001).

Studies show that health professionals in training have reported that GHE has improved their teamwork, responsiveness to contextual factors that impact health, and understanding of health systems; however, there is little research on the impact of GHE courses in undergraduate settings, especially in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: Our study analyzes a multidisciplinary online global health course at Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mxico. We conducted a cross-sectional study with pre- and post-design. Students who took the multidisciplinary course of Global Health for Leaders in the Fall of 2019 (n = 153) and Spring of 2020 (n = 348) were selected for this study. Using a five-point Likert scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree), the survey assessed seven competencies as well as questions about course expectations, takeaways, and recommendations to improve the course. We performed descriptive statistical analyses comparing the combined pre-tests (from Fall and Spring cohorts) to the combined post-tests. Fishers exact test was used to compare the samples. RESULTS: Of the 501 pre-course surveys administered, 456 responses were completed in the pre-course and 435 in the post-course (91% overall response rate). Only 8.7% of the respondents in the pre-course survey strongly agreed that they could describe fundamental aspects of global health such as the Millennium Development Goals or Sustainable Development Goals, in contrast to a 56% of the students who strongly agreed in the post-course survey (p < 0.001). Similar differences were captured in understanding the global burden of disease, social determinants of health, the effects of globalization in health, health systems goals and functions, and human rights. 38% felt that the course helped them develop a more empathetic perception of the suffering of others experiencing global health-related issues. CONCLUSION: In this study, we have presented our experience in teaching an online global health course for multidisciplinary undergraduates in a LMIC. The competencies reported by our students indicate that the course prepared them to confront complex global health issues.

The aim of the current study is to elucidate the specific miRNA profile which can act as new biomarkers for distinguishing acute COVID-19 disease from the healthy group and those in the post-acute phase of the COVID-19 disease. METHODS: The expression level of selected miRNAs including let-7b-3p, miR-29a-3p, miR-146a-3p and miR-155-5p were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients, in both the acute and post-acute COVID-19 phase of the disease and healthy groups, by real-time PCR assays. Specificity and sensitivity of miRNAs was tested by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The expression level of all miRNAs in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than in the healthy group. Therefore, the expression pattern of miR-29a-3p, miR-146a-3p and let-7b-3p in the post-acute COVID-19 phase was significantly different from the acute COVID-19 phase. ROC analyses demonstrated that miR-29a-3p, -155-5p and -146a-3p may serve as the novel biomarker for COVID-19 diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates were cultured and analyzed with polymerase chain reaction tests for PeV-A and 19 other pathogens. The cycle threshold levels of PeV-A were reported as measures of viral genomic loads. Parechovirus A-positive samples were genotyped by amplification and sequencing of the VP3/VP1 junction. RESULTS: Parechovirus A was detected in 8.8% (323/3689) patients with RTI and in 10.1% (45/444) of the children in the comparison group (P = .34). Parechovirus A genotyping (n = 188) revealed PeV-A1 (n = 121), PeV-A3 (n = 15), PeV-A5 (n = 6), and PeV-A6 (n = 46).

Less is known about the association of caregiver strain with health behaviors among caregivers with diabetes, a disease that requires a high degree of self-care. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between caregiver strain and diabetes self-care among caregivers with diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted between July 13, 2018, and June 25, 2020, using data on 795 US caregivers aged 45 years or older with self-reported diabetes from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, which comprised 30 239 Black and White adults 45 years or older throughout the US enrolled from January 2003 to October 2007. EXPOSURES: Caregiver strain, assessed by self-report in response to the question, How much of a mental or emotional strain is it to provide this care? Response options were no strain, some strain, or a lot of (high) strain. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diabetes self-care, which was assessed across 4 domains (Mediterranean diet adherence, physical activity, smoking status, and medication adherence), and a composite self-care score summing performance across these domains. The association between caregiver strain and diabetes self-care was examined with multivariable Poisson regression adjusting for demographic, clinical, physical and mental functioning, and caregiving covariates. RESULTS: Among the 795 caregivers with diabetes included in the study, the mean (SD) age was 63.7 (8.6) years, 469 (59.0%) were women, and 452 (56.9%) were Black individuals. Overall, 146 caregivers (18.4%) reported high caregiver strain. In unadjusted models, high caregiver strain was associated with less physical activity (prevalence ratio [PR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.97), low medication adherence (PR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.94), and worse self-care (PR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.98). In adjusted models, the association between some and high caregiving strain with low medication adherence remained significant (adjusted PR: some strain, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78-0.99]; high strain, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69-0.99]).

An extensive survey of five major grapevine viruses in the country was carried out in 2019. A total of 630 samples from the two dominant autochthonous cultivars, named ?ilavka and Blatina, were tested by DAS-ELISA for the presence of grapevine leafroll-associated viruses (GLRaV-1 and 3), grapevine fleck virus (GFkV), grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) and Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV). Eighty-eight % of the samples were positive for at least one virus, and all five viruses were detected, thought with different incidence, i.e. GLRaV-3 (84%), GFLV (43%), GLRaV-1 (14%), GFkV (10%) and ArMV (0.2%). The majority of infected plants (about 75%) were asymptomatic. Specific virus symptoms were observed in the remaining infected plants, together with the reported GLRaV vectors, Planococcus ficus and Parthenolecanium corni, while nematodes of the Xiphinema genus were not found in the GFLV- or ArMV-infected vineyards. The GLRaV-3 CP phylogenetic analyses showed 75C100% nucleotide identity between the BiH and reference isolates, and the BiH isolates clustered into the major group. The dNS/dS ratio indicated a negative selection of the virus population, and the lack of geographical structuring within the population was observed. In addition, putative GLRaV-3 recombinants with breakpoints in the 5 of the CP gene were detected, while no recombinant strains were identified for the other four viruses. The obtained results indicate a deteriorated sanitary status of the cultivated grapevines, the prevalence and intraspecies genetic diversity of GLRaV-3 throughout the country. The establishment of certified grapevine material and adequate virus vector control is therefore of primary importance to prevent further spread of these viruses.

Little is known, at the country level, where and how patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have been mostly affected. METHODS: Survey of the network of Nephrology centers using a simplified 17 items electronic questionnaire designed by Italian Society of Nephrology COVID-19 Research Group. We used spatial epidemiology and geographical information systems to map SARS-CoV-2 spread among RRT patients in Italy. RESULTS: On April 9th 2020, all nephrology centers (n = 454) listed in the DialMap database were invited to complete the electronic questionnaire. Within 11 days on average, 365 centers responded (80.4% response rate; 2.3% margin of error) totaling 60,441 RRT patients. The surveyed RRT population included 30,821 hemodialysis (HD), 4139 peritoneal dialysis (PD), and 25,481 transplanted (Tx) patients respectively. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive RRT patients in Italy was 2.26% (95% CI 2.14C2.39) with significant differences according to treatment modality (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher in HD (3.55% [95% CI 3.34C3.76]) than PD (1.38% [95% CI 1.04C1.78] and Tx (0.86% [95% CI 0.75C0.98]) (p < 0.001), with substantial heterogeneity across regions and along the latitude gradient (p < 0.001). In RRT patients the highest rate was in the north-west (4.39% [95% CI 4.11C4.68], followed by the north-east (IR 2.06% [1.79C2.36]), the center (0.91% [0.75C1.09]), the main islands (0.67% [0.47C0.93]), and the south (0.59% [0.45C0.75]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, among SARS-Cov-2 positive RRT patients the fatality rate was 32.8%, as compared to 13.3% observed in the Italian population as of April 23rd.

V-ATPases are conserved proton pumps that populate and acidify multiple organelles of the secretory and the endocytic pathway. Complete loss of V-ATPase activity causes embryonic lethality in higher animals and conditional lethality in yeast, while partial loss of V-ATPase function is associated with multiple disease states. On the other hand, many cancer cells increase their virulence by upregulating V-ATPase expression and activity. The pH of individual organelles is tightly controlled and essential for function, but the mechanisms for compartment-specific pH regulation are not completely understood. There is substantial evidence indicating that the PIP content of membranes influences organelle pH. We present recent evidence that PIPs interact directly with subunit isoforms of the V-ATPase to dictate localization of V-ATPase subpopulations and participate in their regulation. In yeast cells, which have only one set of organelle-specific V-ATPase subunit isoforms, the Golgi-enriched lipid PI(4)P binds to the cytosolic domain of the Golgi-enriched a-subunit isoform Stv1, and loss of PI(4)P binding results in mislocalization of Stv1-containing V-ATPases from the Golgi to the vacuole/lysosome. In contrast, levels of the vacuole/lysosome-enriched signaling lipid PI(3,5)P(2) affect assembly and activity of V-ATPases containing the Vph1 a-subunit isoform. Mutations in the Vph1 isoform that disrupt the lipid interaction increase sensitivity to stress. These studies have decoded zip codes for PIP lipids in the cytosolic N-terminal domain of the a-subunit isoforms of the yeast V-ATPase, and similar interactions between PIP lipids and the V-ATPase subunit isoforms are emerging in higher eukaryotes. In addition to direct effects on the V-ATPase, PIP lipids are also likely to affect organelle pH indirectly, through interactions with other membrane transporters. We discuss direct and indirect effects of PIP lipids on organelle pH, and the functional consequences of the interplay between PIP lipid content and organelle pH.","output":"Regulation of V-ATPase Activity and Organelle pH by Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Lipids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Despite high levels of vaccine coverage, sub-national heterogeneity in immunity to measles can create pockets of susceptibility, which are hard to detect and may result in long-lasting outbreaks. The elimination status defined by the World Health Organization aims to identify countries where the virus is no longer circulating and can be verified after 36 months of interrupted transmission. However, since 2018, numerous countries have lost their elimination status soon after reaching it, showing that the indicators used to define elimination may not be predictive of lower risks of outbreaks. Methods and Findings We quantified the impact of local vaccine coverage and recent levels of incidence on the dynamics of measles in each French department between 2009 and 2018, using mathematical models based on the 'Epidemic-Endemic' regression framework. High values of local vaccine coverage were associated with fewer imported cases and lower risks of local transmissions. Regions that had recently reported high levels of incidence were also at a lower risk of local transmission, potentially due to additional immunity accumulated during these recent outbreaks. Therefore, all else being equal, the risk of local transmission was not lower in areas fulfilling the elimination criteria (i.e., low recent incidence). After fitting the models using daily case counts, we used the parameters' estimates to simulate the effect of variations in the vaccine coverage and recent incidence on future transmission. A decrease of 3% in the three-year average vaccine uptake led to a five-fold increase in the number of cases simulated in a year on average. Conclusions Spatiotemporal variation in vaccine coverage because of disruption of routine immunisation programmes, or lower trust in vaccines, can lead to large increases in both local and cross regional transmission. The association found between local vaccine coverage and incidence suggests that, although regional vaccine uptake can be hard to collect and unreliable because of population movements, it can provide insights into the risks of imminent outbreak. Periods of low local measles incidence were not indicative of a decrease in the risks of local transmission. Therefore, the incidence indicator used to define the elimination status was not consistently associated with lower risks of measles outbreak in France. More detailed models of local immunity levels or subnational seroprevalence studies may yield better estimates of local risk of measles outbreaks.","output":"The impact of local vaccine coverage and recent incidence on measles transmission in France between 2009 and 2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online research methods have risen in popularity over recent decades, particularly in the wake of COVID-19.

The sensitivity of mammography is lower in dense breasts, and additional imaging techniques are sometimes warranted. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) has shown similar sensitivity and in some cases better specificity, than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in small, observational studies. CEM may be more cost-effective than MRI, and may provide better identification of the tumor extent, however, no randomized trials have been performed to date to investigate the added value of CEM. In a feasibility study, we found that the treatment was changed in 10/47 (21%) cases after additional CEM. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the added value of CEM in preoperative staging of breast cancer in a randomized study. METHOD: This prospective randomized study will include 440 patients with strongly suspected or established diagnosis of breast malignancy, based on assessment with mammography, ultrasound and core biopsy/cytology, and for whom primary surgery is planned. Patients will be randomized 1:1 using a web-based randomization tool to additional investigation with CEM or no further imaging. The CEM findings will be taken into consideration, which may lead to changes in primary treatment, which is the primary endpoint of this study. Secondary endpoints include rate of reoperation and number of avoidable mastectomies, as well as a cost-benefit analysis of additional CEM. Patient-reported health-related quality of life will be investigated at 1 year with the validated Breast-Q? questionnaire. The rate of local recurrence or new cancer ipsi- or contralaterally within 5 years will be assessed from medical records and pathology reports. DISCUSSION: The aim of this trial is to explore the added value of CEM in preoperative staging of breast cancer. The results obtained from this study will contribute to our knowledge on CEM as an additional imaging method to standard investigation with digital mammography and ultrasound. The findings may also provide additional information on which patient groups would benefit from CEM, and on the economic aspects of CEM in standard preoperative practice.

Memory T cells can respond quickly to the infection and provide long-term immune protection to reduce the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms. Also, CD45RA? memory T cells confer protection from other pathogens the donors encountered in their life. This is vital to clear other secondary infections usually developed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 specific memory T cells were found within all the CD45RA? subsets CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and in the central memory and effector memory subpopulations. The procedure to obtain the cells is feasible, easy to implement for small scale manufacture, quick and cost-effective involving minimal manipulation, and without GMP condition requirements.

METHODS: This is a qualitative investigation of low-income postpartum individuals enrolled in a trial of postpartum care, who gave birth in the United States in the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed in-depth semi-structured interviews that addressed healthcare experiences during and after birth, both for in-person and telemedicine encounters. Transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparative method. RESULTS: Of 46 eligible individuals, 87% (N = 40) completed an interview, with 50% identifying as non-Hispanic Black and 38% as Hispanic. Challenges were organized into three domains: unanticipated changes in the birth experience, delayed care, and perceived disadvantages of telemedicine. Changes in the birth experience addressed uncertainty about COVID-19 status, COVID-19 testing, separation from newborn, and visitor restrictions. Delayed care themes addressed logistical challenges, postpartum care, health maintenance, and pediatric care. Participants reported multiple telemedicine-related challenges, including difficulty establishing rapport with providers. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the challenges experienced by low-income peripartum individuals as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves is critical to informing guidelines and diminishing inequities in healthcare delivery.

In this model, data collected by the Iran Ministry of Health have been used for modeling and verification of the results. Findings The results show that besides the intervening policies, early application of them is also of utmost priority and makes a significant difference in the result of the system. Also, if the number of patients with extreme conditions passes available hospital intensive care capacity, the death rate increases dramatically. Intervening policies play an important role in reducing the rate of infection, death and consequently control of pandemic.

METHODS A systematic review of the literature from database inception to May 2021 was performed to identify all studies evaluating the relationship between eosinophils and/or eosinophil-derived proteins (EDPs) and clinical outcomes, such as disease activity, clinical relapse, severity of disease, and response to treatment. RESULTS A total of 55 studies were identified. Thirty-four studies evaluated the relationship between eosinophils in colonic tissue and outcomes and 15 in blood. Eighteen studies assessed the relationship between EDPs and outcomes. In 25 of 34 studies, a positive correlation between eosinophils and/or EDPs and disease activity was reported, 3 studies found a negative correlation, and 9 studies found no correlation. Positive correlations between eosinophils and clinical relapse were shown in 4 of 9 studies and disease outcomes severity in 5 of 7 studies. Four of 15 studies showed that subjects with higher eosinophil levels had a poor response to treatment.

Booming of the food and beverage (F&B) industry has aggravated the situation by generating more plastic waste with no economic values. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the overall environmental performance of existing and alternative waste management technologies that are available in Malaysia based on net greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (kg CO(2)-eq) per tonne of plastic waste that are analysed through life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology.

Negative net GHG emission in WTE incineration was mainly due to higher GHG saving achieved through cleaner electricity generation as compared to conventional power production. This alternative technology was proven to have the potential to reduce the dependence on landfills and is served as the basis of environmental sustainability framework development for plastic waste management based on case study in Malaysia.

Following the recent correspondence where the authors have rightly stated the need to take seriously the ethical issues under the COVID-19 vaccination, this paper highlights the ethical and legal impediments of 'no-jab, no-job clause' arising in many countries.","output":"No-jab, no-job clause: ethical issues and legal impediments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Across the world's coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hot spots, the need to streamline patient diagnosis and management has become more pressing than ever. As one of the main imaging tools, chest X-rays (CXRs) are common, fast, non-invasive, relatively cheap, and potentially bedside to monitor the progression of the disease. This paper describes the first public COVID-19 image data collection as well as a preliminary exploration of possible use cases for the data. This dataset currently contains hundreds of frontal view X-rays and is the largest public resource for COVID-19 image and prognostic data, making it a necessary resource to develop and evaluate tools to aid in the treatment of COVID-19. It was manually aggregated from publication figures as well as various web based repositories into a machine learning (ML) friendly format with accompanying dataloader code. We collected frontal and lateral view imagery and metadata such as the time since first symptoms, intensive care unit (ICU) status, survival status, intubation status, or hospital location. We present multiple possible use cases for the data such as predicting the need for the ICU, predicting patient survival, and understanding a patient's trajectory during treatment.

The present study aimed to fulfil the knowledge gap on SARS-CoV-2 circulation in wastewaters and surface waters in this region and to extend the current knowledge on potential presence of SARS-CoV-2 contamination in BMS. The study included 13 archive wastewater and surface water samples from the start of epidemic and 17 influents and effluents from nine wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) of different capacity and treatment stage, sampled during the second epidemic wave. From that period are the most of 77 collected BMS samples, represented by mussels, oysters and warty venus clams harvested along the Dalmatian coast. All samples were processed according to EN ISO 15216-1 2017 using Mengovirus as a whole process control. SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed by real-time and conventional RT-PCR assays targeting E, N and nsp14 protein genes complemented with nsp14 partial sequencing. Rotavirus A (RVA) real-time RT-PCR assay was implemented as an additional evaluation criterion of virus concentration techniques. The results revealed the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in nine influents and two secondary treatment effluents from eight WWTPs, while all samples from the start of epidemic (wastewaters, surface waters) were negative which was influenced by sampling strategy. All tertiary effluents and BMS were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The results of RVA amplification were beneficial in evaluating virus concentration techniques and provided insights into RVA dynamics within the environment and community. In conclusion, the results of the present study confirm SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Croatian wastewaters during the second epidemic wave while extending the knowledge on wastewater treatment potential in SARS-CoV-2 removal.

We employ a large panel data of 5.6 million daily transactions from 2.6 million debit cards owned by the low-income population in the U.S. to quantify the joint impacts of the state lockdowns and stimulus payments on this populations spending along the inter-temporal, geo-spatial, and cross-categorical dimensions. Leveraging the difference-in-differences analyses at the per card and zip code levels, we uncover three key findings. (1) Inter-temporally, the state lockdowns diminished the daily average spending relative to the same period in 2019 by $3.9 per card and $2,214 per zip code, whereas the stimulus payments elevated the daily average spending by $15.7 per card and $3,307 per zip code. (2) Spatial heterogeneity prevailed: Democratic zip codes displayed much more volatile dynamics, with an initial decline three times that of Republican zip codes, followed by a higher rebound and a net gain after the stimulus payments; also, Southwest exhibited the highest initial decline whereas Southeast had the largest net gain after the stimulus payments. (3) Across 26 categories, the stimulus payments promoted spending in those categories that enhanced public health and charitable donations, reduced food insecurity and digital divide, while having also stimulated non-essential and even undesirable categories, such as liquor and cigar. In addition, spatial association analysis was employed to identify spatial dependency and local hot spots of spending changes at the county level. Overall, these analyses reveal the imperative need for more geo- and category-targeted stimulus programs, as well as more effective and strategic policy communications, to protect and promote the well-being of the low-income population during public health and economic crises.","output":"Impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns and stimulus payments on low-income populations spending in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the article, the author discusses how the best in himself and their employees were revealed during the COVID-19 pandemic Also cited are the ingenuity and innovative ways they adopted to fight the novel virus, the number of COVID-19 patients they took care off at the Atrium Health Hospital at Home, and their Atrium Health Courageous Conversations program to tackle racism","output":"When It Matters Most, The Best of Who We Are Shows Up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a devastating global health crisis.

We hypothesized that same-day discharge strategy is safe and feasible in patients with AF undergoing CA. METHODS A systematic review of studies comparing the safety of same-day discharge vs hospital admission for AF patients undergoing CA was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. No randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria; therefore, observational cohort studies were included. Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios were calculated and I2 statistics were reported for heterogeneity assessment. RESULTS A total of 8 observational studies with 10,102 patients were included. There were no statistically significant differences between same-day discharge vs hospital admission in all studied outcomes including post-discharge 30-day hospital visits (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.40-2.02; p = 0.81), post-discharge vascular/bleeding complications (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.46-1.88; p = 0.85), post-discharge stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism (RR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.23-2.20; p = 0.55), and post-discharge recurrent arrhythmias (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.60-1.09; p = 0.1).

Part of conserving this vulnerable and threatened species is maintaining the health of penguins within zoo collections. A variety of cardiovascular diseases has been reported in individuals from the Spheniscidae family including ventricular septal defects, Dirofilaria immitis infection, pulmonary hypertension, and valvular dysplasia, ultimately resulting in congestive heart failure. An accurate clinical picture of cardiovascular disease in Humboldt penguins requires diagnostics tailored to this specific species. The aim of this study was to establish a routine methodology for evaluating the cardiac silhouette of clinically healthy Humboldt penguins using vertebral heart scale (VHS), cardiocoelomic width ratio (CCWR), and a novel cardiac silhouette-to-keel ratio (CKR). Ventrodorsal and right lateral radiographs were taken of 10 mature Humboldt penguins during routine health evaluations. An echocardiographic exam of each penguin was performed to confirm that there was no evidence of cardiac structural remodeling from disease. Two penguins were excluded on the basis of echocardiographic findings; therefore, data from eight penguins were used to calculate objective cardiac measurements for the clinically healthy population. Right lateral radiographs were used to determine VHS (7.4-10.4) and CKR (3.4-4.4). Ventrodorsal radiographs were used for calculating CCWR (0.45-0.59). The excluded penguins had CCWRs that were outside the 95% confidence interval for the range generated by this study. This initial work supports that standardizing radiographic views provides objective measures for cardiac silhouette evaluation in this species.

Nearly one-third of the adult population is hypertensive worldwide, it is urgent to identify the factors that determine the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: 148 COVID-19 patients with pre-existing hypertension with clarified outcomes (discharge or deceased) from a national cohort in China were included in this study, of whom 103 were discharged and 45 died in hospital. Multivariate regression showed higher odds of in-hospital death associated with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) > 28 pg/ml (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55-6.91) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) > 7 pg/ml (HR: 3.63, 95% CI:1.54-8.55) at admission. Patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) (n = 52) which were defined as systolic BP &#8805;140 mm Hg or diastolic BP &#8805;90 mm Hg for more than once (&#8805;2 times) during hospitalization, were more likely to have ICU admission (p = 0.037), invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.028), and renal injury (p = 0.005). A stricter BP control with the threshold of 130/80 mm Hg was associated with lower mortality. Treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) suppressors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and spironolactone, was associated with a lower rate of ICU admission compared to other types of anti-hypertensive medications (8 (22.9%) vs. 25 (43.1%), p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Among COVID-19 patients with pre-existing hypertension, elevated hs-cTn and IL-6 could help clinicians to identify patients with fatal outcomes at an early stage, blood pressure control is associated with better clinical outcomes, and RAAS suppressors do not increase mortality and may decrease the need for ICU admission.","output":"Predictors of fatal outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pre-existing hypertension in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: People with Down syndrome (DS) are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 and show altered immune response to vaccination. We aimed to evaluate the immune response of a group of adults with DS treated with standard regimens of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as compared with an aged- and sex-matched group of persons without DS. METHODS: We compared antibody responses between 42 subjects with DS (41.6 10.8 years, 57% male), and an age- and sex-matched comparison group of healthy health care workers (HCW) (41.48.8 years, 54.8% male) after SARS-CoV2 vaccination with the standard regimen of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19. Receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies were assessed at 4 time points (baseline, 21 days after the first dose, 21 days after the second dose and 6 months after the first dose) with Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG (COV2G) antibody test. RESULTS: We observed significantly different antibody responses at all time points after vaccination (HCW vs. DS: 7.93.9 vs. 1.43.6 IU/ml at 21 days after first dose; 358.53.8 vs. 38.13.0 IU/ml at 21 days after second dose; 34.62.4 vs. 7.93.1 IU/ml at 6 months after vaccination) and a significantly different time course of decline in antibody titers between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with DS have a valid antibody response to SARS-CoV2 vaccination. However, this response is lower than that of subjects in the HCW group.

Protest intensity, use of tear gas, government control measures, and testing rates were estimated in 12 cities. A correlation analysis was conducted to assess the potential effect of mask use and other measures, adjusting for testing rates, on COVID-19 epidemiology 4 weeks (two incubation periods) post-protests. Mask use ranged from 69 to 96% across protests. There was no increase in the incidence of COVID-19 post-protest in 11 cities. After adjusting for testing rates, only Miami, which involved use of tear gas and had high protest intensity, showed a clear increase in COVID-19 after one incubation period post-protest. No significant correlation was found between incidence and protest factors. Our study showed that protests in most cities studied did not increase COVID-19 incidence in 2020, and a high level of mask use was seen.

Results showed that in all domains (living areas) in GTG, food shortage prevalence decreased between 1999 and 2018, from 55.0% to 29.6% in urban informal areas, from 34.1% to 19.4% in urban formal areas and from 42.1% to 15.6% in rural areas. While the prevalence of food shortage in urban formal areas in the WC remained similar in 2018, prevalence decreased from 81.8% to 35.7% in urban informal areas and from 38.3% to 20.6% in rural areas. Energy and macronutrient intakes improved significantly in GTG between 1999 and 2018 but not in the WC; intakes were significantly higher in the WC at both time points. The only significant change in stunting, wasting, overweight and obesity prevalence was that 7C<10-year-olds in GTG were significantly more likely to be wasted (BAZ < 2SD) in 2018 than in 1999 (20.2% versus 6.9% respectively). In the WC, 1C3-year-olds were significantly more likely to be obese in 2018 than in 1999 (8.1% versus 1.7% respectively) and 7C<10-year-olds were less likely to be stunted (14.5% versus 4.9% respectively). There were significant negative correlations between the hunger score and dietary variables in both provinces in 1999. In GTG in 2018, only the correlation with fat intake remained while there were still several significant correlations in WC in 2018.

Few data clarify the hemodynamic effects of these interventions in this specific condition. We performed a physiologic study to assess the hemodynamic effects of PEEP and prone position during COVID-19 respiratory failure. METHODS: Nine adult patients mechanically ventilated due to COVID-19 infection and fulfilling moderate-to-severe ARDS criteria were studied. Respiratory mechanics, gas exchange, cardiac output, oxygen consumption, systemic and pulmonary pressures were recorded through pulmonary arterial catheterization at PEEP of 15 and 5 cmH(2)O, and after prone positioning. Recruitability was assessed through the recruitment-to-inflation ratio. RESULTS: High PEEP improved PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio in all patients (p = 0.004), and significantly decreased pulmonary shunt fraction (p = 0.012), regardless of lung recruitability. PEEP-induced increases in PaO2/FiO2 changes were strictly correlated with shunt fraction reduction (rho=-0.82, p = 0.01). From low to high PEEP, cardiac output decreased by 18 % (p = 0.05) and central venous pressure increased by 17 % (p = 0.015). As compared to supine position with low PEEP, prone positioning significantly decreased pulmonary shunt fraction (p = 0.03), increased PaO(2)/FiO(2) (p = 0.03) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (p = 0.016), without affecting cardiac output. PaO(2)/FiO(2) was improved by prone position also when compared to high PEEP (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS due to COVID-19, PEEP and prone position improve arterial oxygenation. Changes in cardiac output contribute to the effects of PEEP but not of prone position, which appears the most effective intervention to improve oxygenation with no hemodynamic side effects.","output":"Hemodynamic response to positive end-expiratory pressure and prone position in COVID-19 ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 poses a major risk to global health, highlighting the importance of faster and proper diagnosis. To handle the rise in the number of patients and eliminate redundant tests, healthcare information exchange and medical data are transmitted between healthcare centres.

This study presents a new encryption with the image steganography model for secure data transmission (EIS-SDT) for COVID19 diagnosis. The EIS-SDT model uses a multilevel discrete wavelet transform for image decomposition and Manta Ray Foraging Optimization algorithm for optimal pixel selection. The EIS-SDT method uses a double logistic chaotic map (DLCM) is employed for secret image encryption. The application of the DLCM-based encryption procedure provides an additional level of security to the image steganography technique. An extensive simulation results analysis ensures the effective performance of the EIS-SDT model and the results are investigated under several evaluation parameters.

To prepare the conductive specimens, PU nanofiber-web, 1 wt% of AgNW dispersion in ethanol, and two types of PDMS precursors were used. A total of four specimens were prepared: Specimen A (The AgNW/PU nanofiber-web), Specimen AH (The heat-treated AgNW/PU nanofiber-web), Specimen AP (The PDMS-coated AgNW/PU nanofiber-web), and Specimen AHP (The heat-treated AgNW/PDMS/PU nanofiber-web). The specimen was rinsed and dehydrated after laundering under the conditions according to ISO 6330. To investigate the changes of porosity after a single washing cycle, mean pore diameter and pore size distribution were measured. Linear electrical resistance and microscopic surface view of the specimen were evaluated. As a result, many micro-pores were distributed in Specimen AH because of the heat treatment. After laundering, Specimen AH still had the micro-pores, and thus, the heat treatment improved the durability to laundering. Also, the electrical resistance of Specimen AH was only changed slightly even after laundering, which was because the heat treatment strengthened the bonding between the nanofibers and the silver nanowires, thus the silver nanowires sufficiently remained on the specimen surface even after laundering. And, Specimen AH showed that the silver nanowires formed a network even after laundering and were evenly covered with silver nanowires onto the specimen surface. This result affected the aforementioned electrical performance, and in fact, the electrical resistance of Specimen AH was the lowest regardless of laundering. However, it was impossible to measure the porosity of Specimen AP and Specimen AHP due to the PDMS coating. Therefore, the heat treatment affected the durability to laundering as well as the electrical conductivity to increase, but PDMS coating blocked the micro-pores of the nanofiber-web and enabled higher initial resistance.","output":"Changes in Porosity, Electrical and Surface Properties after Laundering of Heat-treated AgNW/PDMS/PU Nanofiber-web"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Medical workforce scarcity in rural and remote communities is a global problem, severely challenging healthcare delivery and health equity.

OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to investigate the incremental impact of COVID-19 lockdown on treatment outcomes of post-bariatric patients in the risk period for weight regain. SETTINGS: Main hospital center. METHODS: This work uses data from an ongoing longitudinal study of bariatric patients assessed before surgery (T(0)), 1.5 (T(1)), and 3 years after surgery (T(2)). Two independent groups were compared: the COVID-19_Group (n=35) C T(0) and T(1) assessment were conducted before the pandemic started, but T(2) assessment was conducted at the end of the mandatory COVID-19 lockdown; and the NonCOVID-19_Group (n=66) C who completed T(0), T(1) and T(2) assessment before the epidemic began. Assessment included self-report measures for disordered eating, negative urgency, depression, anxiety, stress, and weight outcomes. RESULTS: General Linear Models for repeated measures showed that the COVID-19_Group presented significantly higher weight concern (F=8.403, p=.005, ?(2)(p)=.094), grazing behavior (F=7.166, p=.009, ?(2)(p)=.076), and negative urgency (F=4.522, p=.036, ?(2)(p)=.05) than the NonCOVID-19_Group.

Second: Why do physiological signatures of inhibition occur at two different latencies after stop-signals (for visual signals, either before or after 150ms)? Here, we address both questions via two pre-registered experiments that combined transcranial magnetic stimulation, electromyography, and multi-variate pattern analysis of whole-scalp electroencephalography.

SARS-CoV-2 uses as a receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), a critical member of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid system. In addition to the systemic endocrine functions, RAAS components are also involved in intracrine and organ-specific local functions. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is a key component of RAAS and a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. It is expressed in many tissues with gastrointestinal (GI) tract ACE-2 levels far exceeding those in the respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 binding to its receptor results in a deficiency of ACE-2 activity in endocrine, intracrine, and local lung and GI tract ACE-2. The local ACE-2 has different organ-specific functions, including hypertension-independent activities; dysregulations of these functions may contribute to multiorgan COVID-19 pathology, its severity, long-term effects, and mortality. We review supporting evidence from this standpoint. Notably, COVID-19 comorbidities involving hypertension, obesity, heart disease, kidney disease, and diabetes are associated with gastrointestinal problems and display ACE-2 deficits. While RAAS inhibitors target both endocrine and intracrine ACE-2 activity, the deficit of the local ACE-2 activity in the lungs and more so in the gut have not been targeted. Consequently, the therapeutic approach to COVID-19 should be carefully reconsidered. Ongoing clinical trials testing oral probiotic bound ACE-2 delivery are promising.","output":"A Dual-Route Perspective of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Lung- vs. Gut-specific Effects of ACE-2 Deficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper introduces a novel approach to spatio-temporal data analysis using metric geometry to study the spatial propagation of COVID-19 across the United States and reveal periods when the change in geographic distribution was most profound.

A total of 685 bats of 8 species representing 4 families were collected from 10 sites, and were tested by the indirect fluorescent antibody test using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated protein A/G mixture and viral neutralization test. Rabies antibody response was only detected from three bat species (Rousettus leschenaulti, Rhinolophus blythi, and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). The overall rabies seroconversion rate was only 2.2% (15/685). Of the 15 positive sera, 13 (12 fruit bats and 1 insectivorous bat) were indirect fluorescent antibody test positive, and two insectivorous bats were virus neutralization positive when tested by the modified fluorescent antibody viral neutralization test, albeit extremely low. To our knowledge, this is the first published report describing rabies seroprevalences from Chinese bats.

METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective analysis to compare the mortality changes of all-cause injury and transport injuries, poisoning, falls, fire/heat/hot substances, drowning, self-harm and interpersonal violence, which were further stratified by sex and age. Comparisons were made between the COVID-19 period (between January 2020 and June 2020) and control period (between January 2019 and June 2019) in Guangdong province. We used the negative binomial models to explore the associations of deaths during the COVID-19 period, according to the different sex and age strata. RESULTS: The all-cause injury mortality in Guangdong province decreased significantly from 28.65 per 100 000 population during the control period to 23.24 per 100 000 population during COVID-19 pandemic period. Similar results were found in specific injury categories. Mortality of self-harm increased by 139.26% in the 10C14 year group during the COVID-19 period as compared with the control period. Although mortality changes in some groups were not statistically significant, some increases were noteworthy during the COVID-19 period (ie, self-harm, transport injury and falls) in the 70C79 year group.

We aim to explore the correlation between the different doses of corticosteroid administration and the prognosis of ARDS. Methods: All patients were diagnosed with ARDS on initial hospital admission and received systemic corticosteroid treatment for ARDS. The main outcomes were the effects of corticosteroid treatment on clinical parameters and the mortality of ARDS patients. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with the mortality of ARDS patients. Results: 105 ARDS patients were included in this study. Corticosteroid treatment markedly decreased serum interleukin-18 (IL-18) level (424.0  32.19 vs. 290.2  17.14; p = 0.0003) and improved arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) (174.10  65.28 vs. 255.42  92.49; p < 0.0001). The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score (16.15  4.41 vs. 14.88  4.57, p = 0.042) decreased significantly on the seventh day after systemic corticosteroid treatment. Interestingly, the serum IL-18 decreased significantly (304.52  286.00 vs. 85.85  97.22, p < 0.0001), whereas the improvement of PaO(2)/FiO(2) (24.78  35.03 vs. 97.17  44.82, p < 0.001) was inconspicuous after systemic corticosteroid treatment for non-survival patients, compared with survival patients. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) model revealed, when equivalent methylprednisolone usage was 146.5 mg/d, it had the best sensitivity and specificity to predict the death of ARDS. Survival analysis by KaplanCMeier curves presented the higher 45-day mortality in high-dose corticosteroid treatment group (logrank test p < 0.0001). Multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that serum IL-18 level, APACHE II score, D-dimer, and high-dose corticosteroid treatment were associated with the death of ARDS. Conclusion: Appropriate dose of corticosteroids may be beneficial for ARDS patients through improving the oxygenation and moderately inhibiting inflammatory response. The benefits and risks should be carefully weighed when using high-dose corticosteroid for ARDS. Trial registration: This work was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov.

For instance, remdesivir, a potent SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug based on studies in vitro, if administered orally would be poorly effective because low drug levels would reach the lungs due to its high first pass destruction in the liver. This is the reason remdesivir can only be administered intravenously, a requirement that clearly limits its use as a prophylactic agent for COVID-19, although novel formulations for its easier administration are under development. Whether an antiviral prophylaxis could further control or even stop the COVID-19 epidemic in synergy with other non-pharmacological based mitigation strategies is today unknown. Since the mid-1960s, pharmacologists have investigated the use of lipid-based nanoparticles for efficient delivery of antivirals to tissues, for example by transforming the route of administration from intravenous to oral, subcutaneous or aerosol administrations. These novel encapsulation strategies have also the potential to maintain high levels of the antiviral drugs in tissues, with reduced dose frequency compared to the non-encapsulated drug. Several lipid-based nanoparticles are today approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or being tested in clinical studies with favorable toxicity profiles. Nonhuman primate models of coronavirus infection offer unique platforms to accelerate the search for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral prophylaxis. Paradigms, to corroborate this claim, are borrowed from nonhuman primate research studies, some of which had a profound impact on global public health in the specific setting of the AIDS pandemic. Sharing information from nonhuman primate research programs, invoking principles of scientific transparency and bioethics similar to those universally agreed for human studies, would also likely significantly help our collective fight (as the human species) against this public health emergency.","output":"Towards COVID-19 Prophylaxis: An AIDS Preclinical Research Perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza vaccine effectiveness against influenza and noninfluenza respiratory viruses (NIRVs) was assessed by test-negative design using historic datasets of the community-based Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network, spanning 2010-2011 to 2016-2017.

SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays play a central role in diagnosis and have fixed technical performance metrics. Interpretation becomes challenging because the clinical sensitivity changes as the virus clears and the immune response emerges. Our goal was to examine the clinical sensitivity of two most common SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test modalities, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology, over the disease course to provide insight into their clinical interpretation in patients presenting to the hospital. Methods: A single-center, retrospective study. To derive clinical sensitivity of PCR, we identified 209 PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients with multiple PCR test results (624 total PCR tests) and calculated daily sensitivity from date of symptom onset or first positive test. To calculate daily clinical sensitivity by serology, we utilized 157 PCR-positive patients with a total of 197 specimens tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgM, IgG, and IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Results: Clinical sensitivity of PCR decreased with days post symptom onset with >90% clinical sensitivity during the first 5 days after symptom onset, 70-71% from days 9-11, and 30% at day 21. In contrast, serological sensitivity increased with days post symptom onset with >50% of patients seropositive by at least one antibody isotype after day 7, >80% after day 12, and 100% by day 21. Conclusion: PCR and serology are complimentary modalities that require time-dependent interpretation.

The article aims to compare the vision of the development of passenger shipping in the Polish part of the Vistula Lagoon between local governments creating the spatial policy and ship owners offering transport services. We have made an attempt to verify the development prospects. The collation of these visions was based primarily on the qualitative analysis of the content of planning and strategic documents (desk research method) and a survey conducted among all six ship owners.

Hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, hyperglycemia, and hearing loss are some characteristics of this disorder, and it has a prevalence of < 1/1000. The aim of this report is to spread awareness among otologists, audiologists, and pediatricians about this syndrome and its audiological features. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old male with a diagnosed H syndrome registered to our clinic with a complaint of hearing loss. The patient was diagnosed with hearing loss in a different clinic using only the air-conducted click auditory brainstem response test which showed wave V at 60 dB nHL for the right ear and at 80 dB nHL for the left ear. The initially performed pure tone audiometry (PTA) test in our clinic revealed a bilateral asymmetric hearing loss with a moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and a profound mixed hearing loss in the left ear. The performed air conducted click auditory brainstem response (ABR) result showed wave V at 55 dB nHL for the right ear and at 70 dB nHL for the left ear. Then, the repeated PTA test revealed a mild-severe sensorineural sloping hearing loss in the right ear and a severe sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear. CONCLUSION: Although hearing thresholds in H syndrome could be within normal limits in some patients, sensorineural hearing loss is an important characteristic feature for this syndrome. Sensorineural hearing loss could be progressive or of sudden onset and ranges from mild to profound. Thus, it must be taken into consideration to apply the audiological follow-up regularly and paying attention to the patients complaints; also, a regular follow-up for language development of children with H syndrome and for the hearing aids is advised.","output":"Audiological findings of a patient with H syndrome: case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of May 2021, the United States remains the world leader with 33 million of 165 million cases worldwide (20%) and 590,000 of 3.4 million deaths worldwide (17%) from COVID-19.

The future perfect of the vaccine should not be the enemy of the present good, which is masking. Masking, especially when combined with social distancing, crowd avoidance, frequent hand and face washing, increased testing capabilities, and contact tracing, is likely to prevent at least as many premature deaths as the widespread utilization of an effective and safe vaccine.

This policy received various responses including on social media such as Twitter. Based on this this study aims to analyze public sentiment from Twitter tweets regarding the handling of COVID-19 in Indonesia. The method used is the Na?ve Bayes Classification because it has a simple algorithm with high accuracy. The results showed that the public gave more negative sentiments towards the policy of handling COVID-19 especially PSBB mandatory masks and curfews. On the positive sentiment the three words with the highest frequency were demo Jakarta and work. Meanwhile the negative sentiment is Jakarta demo and orang. The appearance of the words demoes and Jakarta in both sentiments shows that the publics tweet regarding the policy for handling COVID-19 cannot be separated from the events / incidents when data collection was carried out. In addition, the high frequency of the word Jakarta in negative sentiments also shows that the implementation of policies for handling COVID-19 in Jakarta has not been implemented optimally.

As many countries around the world, Malaysia and other southeast Asian (SEA) countries have also enforced lockdown at different degrees to contain the spread of the disease, which has brought some positive effects on natural environment. Therefore, evaluating the reduction in anthropogenic emissions due to COVID-19 and the related governmental measures to restrict its expansion is crucial to assess its impacts on air pollution and economic growth. In this study, we used aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from Himawari-8 satellite, along with tropospheric NO2 column density from Aura-OMI over SEA, and ground-based pollution measurements at several stations across Malaysia, in order to quantify the changes in aerosol and air pollutants associated with the general shutdown of anthropogenic and industrial activities due to COVID-19. The lockdown has led to a notable decrease in AOD over SEA and in the pollution outflow over the oceanic regions, while a significant decrease (27% - 30%) in tropospheric NO2 was observed over areas not affected by seasonal biomass burning. Especially in Malaysia, PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO concentrations have been decreased by 26-31%, 23-32%, 63-64%, 9-20%, and 25-31%, respectively, in the urban areas during the lockdown phase, compared to the same periods in 2018 and 2019. Notable reductions are also seen at industrial, suburban and rural sites across the country.

Studies on pediatric populations remain limited, as the burden of disease in pediatric patients appears to be low at this time. OBJECTIVES: To further describe clinical characteristics and severity of disease of confirmed pediatric COVID-19 patients seen and evaluated in a community-based hospital. DESIGN/METHODS: A retrospective chart review of positive COVID-19 patients  18 years seen in COVID clinic or in the Emergency Department (ED) between April and December 2020 was performed. The results of nasopharyngeal swabs were confirmed using real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. A descriptive analysis of illness severity, performed via Excel 2019, was based on clinical presentation, laboratory data, and chest x-ray imaging. The categories of illness severity were: asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe or critical. RESULTS: A total of 53 positive COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study, which consisted of 24 (45.3%) males and 29 (54.7%) females. The median age was 7.5 years (2.4-12.8). The majority of patients presented with mild symptoms (64.2%), with fever and cough being the main symptoms in 20 (37.7%) and 16 (30.2%) cases, respectively. Other symptoms included sore throat (15.1%), diarrhea (13.2%), headache (9.4%), runny nose (7.5%) and abdominal pain (7.5%). The remaining patients (35.8%) were asymptomatic. Of note, one patient (1.9%) presented with COVID toes requiring referral to a tertiary centre, and one (1.9%) was diagnosed with acute appendicitis. A history of contact with a confirmed COVID-19-positive family member was present in 43 (81.1%) patients, and 6 (11.3%) reported a history of recent travel. Laboratory tests were performed in 7 (13.2%) patients, and chest x-rays were performed in 9 (17%). There were no abnormalities detected in either, other than an elevated CRP seen in one patient with appendicitis. Two (3.8%) patients were admitted, including the patient with appendicitis who developed a perforation and was later transferred to a tertiary care centre to undergo an appendectomy. The majority of patients (96.2%) were discharged home. CONCLUSION: All patients either presented with mild symptoms or were asymptomatic. Fever and cough were the most common presenting symptoms. Due to this, the vast majority of patients were discharged home. The infection in the majority of patients could be traced to a positive family contact. Our findings are consistent with what has been observed previously in our centre as well as worldwide.

METHODS A feasibility study among South African sexually active women not desiring pregnancy within 1 year, and not using long-acting or injectable contraceptives. At recruitment, we provided five free urine pregnancy tests for self-testing on the first day of each of the next 3 months. We sent monthly text reminders to use the tests with requests for no-cost text replies. Our main outcome was the proportion of participants self-testing within 5 days of the text reminder over three consecutive months. Other outcomes were ease of use of tests, preference for self-testing versus clinic testing, acceptability of routine self-testing (all binary responses followed by open response options) and response to text messages (four-point Likert scale). RESULTS We followed up 71/76 (93%) participants. Two confirmed new pregnancies at the first scheduled test and completed exit interviews, and 64/69 (93%) self-reported completing all three monthly tests. Self-testing was easy to do (66/71, 93%); advantages were convenience (21/71, 30%) and privacy (18/71, 25%), while the main disadvantage was no nurse present to advise (17/71, 24%).

These differences capture genuine uncertainty in the understanding of disease dynamics and in the choice of simplifying assumptions underpinning the model.

In general, governments and health authorities have taken precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce viral spread and protect vulnerable citizens. Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have an increased risk of being infected with COVID-19 and developing a fatal course due to the MM-related immunodeficiency (Glenth?j, A et al. PMID: 32939853). To some extent, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed standard of care towards extended use of oral regimens and limiting hospital visits (Terpos E et al.PMID: 32444866). We aimed to investigate the quality of life (QoL) of Danish patients with MM during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that patients living alone and those under the age of 65 years, as a consequence of the pandemic, would experience impaired QoL due to social isolation and fear of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: The Danish prospective, nation-wide, observational survey Quality of life in Danish patients with multiple myeloma (QoL-MM) (Nielsen LK et al. PMID: 30656677) framed our study. In QoL-MM, survey data are obtained at enrolment and subsequently at 12 follow-up time points over a two-year period. The following PRO questionnaires are used; the cancer-generic instrument of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life (EORTC) QLQ-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), the Multiple Myeloma module QLQ-MY20 (EORTC QLQ-MY20), the Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy module (EORTC QLQ-CIPN20) and the Short-form health survey version 2 (SF12v2). In the present study, a subpopulation of the QoL-MM cohort was constructed, based on the response time of the questionnaires. QoL was compared using patient-reported outcome (PRO) data obtained before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at group level. In a Danish context, first wave was defined as April to June 2020 and the second wave as November 2020 to January 2021. The QoL data were analyzed using mixed effects linear regression, with a year-period-interaction. Pre-COVID versus COVID mean domain score difference was considered evident, if the difference was both statistically significant (p-value <0.05) and clinically relevant, using minimal important difference (MID) defined as 0.3 standard deviation of the mean score. Results: The study included 616 patients (63% newly diagnosed and 37% relapsed) with a mean age of 68.2 years (standard deviation, 9.2); 40% were females; 76% were married/cohabiting, and 24% single. Questionnaire completion rates during the investigated periods were between 96% and 97%. In total, 1,685 completed sets of questionnaires were included in the analyses. The patients reported no statistically significant and clinically relevant difference in QoL during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to one year earlier, see table 1. When analyzing the subpopulations, we found that patients below 65 years reported improved physical health summaries (p-value 0.016), decreased fatigue (p-value < 0.001), less insomnia (p-value 0.002) and improved role functioning (p-value <0.001) during the first wave, reaching both statistical significance and the threshold of MID. The group of patients living alone reported improved role functioning during the first wave, reaching both statistical significance (p-value <0.001) and the threshold of MID. These findings were not evident during the second wave, see table 1. Conclusion: As a group, Danish patients with MM did not report impaired QoL during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrary, we observed improvements in some domains in patients below 65 years. Our observations indicate that the patients with MM have felt cared for and in good hands during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, part of the reason for our finding of no negative impact on QoL by the pandemic could be that the questionnaires used were not developed to capture the impact of the pandemic on QoL. Importantly, our results suggest that QoL data collected in clinical trials during the pandemic allow interpretation without adjusting for the impact of the pandemic.

However, these selection criteria preclude the vast majority of patients that undergo PCNL. The objective of our study was to compare complication and stone free rates after aPCNL in standard selection criteria vs. extended criteria patients. METHODS: Retrospective review of prospective data on all patients who underwent aPCNL at one academic center from 2007- 2018. Extended criteria patients were defined as any: Age >75 years, BMI >30 kg/m2, ASA >2, bilateral stones, solitary kidney, staghorn calculi, stone burden >40 mm, multiple tracts, or pre-existing nephrostomy tubes/stents. Primary outcomes were complication rates (Clavien-Dindo classification) and stone free rates (no fragments >/ =3 mm). All patients were discharged with a ureteric stent and no nephrostomy tube after meeting discharge criteria which included hemodynamic stability, no fever, and no significant pain. RESULTS: We identified 118 patients of which 92 (78%) met extended criteria. Mean BMI was 31 kg/m2 and 45% were ASA 3 or higher. Mean sum maximum stone diameter was 24 mm. Multiple stones were present in 25%, bilateral stones in 7%, staghorn stones in 4%, and pre-existing tubes/stents in 4%. There was no difference in complication (12% vs. 18%, p=0.56), Emergency department visit (12% vs 18%, p=0.56), or readmission (4% vs. 5%, p=1) rates between standard and extended criteria patients respectively (Table 1). Of the complications, 85% were Clavien-Dindo grade 1. Stone free rates were not different between standard (84%) and extended (83%) criteria patients (p=1).

A sample of 350 University students from Italy completed measures that included the General Mattering Scale and the Anti-Mattering Scale, as well as measures of self-esteem, difficulties in emotion regulation, life satisfaction, perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. Psychometric analyses confirmed the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the General Mattering Scale and the Anti-Mattering Scale. As expected, feelings of not mattering were associated with lower life satisfaction as well as with greater reported difficulties in emotion regulation, stress, and distress. Mattering and self-esteem were both unique predictors of levels of life satisfaction during the pandemic. The results of mediational analyses suggested that individuals who feel as though they do not matter may be especially vulnerable to stress, depression, and anxiety and this may promote a decline in life satisfaction. Given the potential destructiveness of feelings of not mattering, in general but especially during a global pandemic, it is essential to proactively develop interventions and programs that are designed to enhance feelings of mattering and reduce anti-mattering experiences and feelings.","output":"Mattering and Anti-Mattering in Emotion Regulation and Life Satisfaction: A Mediational Analysis of Stress and Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To investigate the temporal pattern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presence on ocular surfaces using conjunctival swabs in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients METHODS: This study included 59 patients (32 newly admitted and 27 hospitalized for 2 weeks) with a COVID-19-confirmed diagnosis at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from March 3, 2020, to March 21, 2020 Conjunctival swab samples were collected from both eyes of all the 59 patients and were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay The range of sampling time lies widely between 1 and 50 days since symptom onset RESULTS: Among the 32 newly admitted patients, positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival swab samples were reported in 2 patients (one eye for each) without ocular discomfort, but 1 positive case had conjunctival congestion The positive results were detected on Day 5 for 1 patient and Day 7 for the other, but repeated tests after 1 week were negative for both patients All 27 patients who had been hospitalized for 2 weeks had negative test results The mean time from symptom onset to sampling of 2 positive cases was significantly less than that of 57 negative cases (P&lt;0 001) CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 on the ocular surface can be detected in the early phase of COVID-19 The risk of ocular transmission remains and might be higher in the early phase","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular surface in different phases of COVID-19 patients in Shanghai, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main protease (M(pro)) is a potential druggable target in SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Promising toxins were subsequently characterized using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding energy estimations. According to the MM-GBSA binding energies over 200 ns MD simulations, three toxinsnamely philanthotoxin (T3D2489), azaspiracid (T3D2672), and taziprinone (T3D2378)demonstrated higher binding affinities against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) than the co-crystalized inhibitor XF7 with MM-GBSA binding energies of ?58.9, ?55.9, ?50.1, and ?43.7 kcal/mol, respectively.

We share a case report of a patient admitted to the Creighton University Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska with the clinical presentation and diagnostics suggestive of SCAD after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old caucasian woman with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) during pregnancy, was brought to the hospital after she had a syncopal episode due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) leading to cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation on site. She had been tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by PCR with mild symptoms, about 12 weeks prior to this episode and she recovered within a week after self-quarantine at home. In the emergency room, she had AF with a rapid ventricular response, hypothermia, bilateral decreased breath sounds, a non-tender abdomen, and equal pulses. She required endotracheal intubation for airway protection. Her initial laboratory studies revealed normal complete blood counts, CRP 71.2 mg/L, and initial Troponin I 2.55 ng/mL (with a peak of 21 ng/mL). Subsequently, she progressed to refractory cardiogenic shock necessitating four vasopressor agents. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20% with new-onset global hypokinesis and myocardial wall thickness. The coronary angiogram revealed SCAD in the left circumflex artery. An Impella device was placed for cardiovascular support initially, but she ultimately required Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO. She was also given pulse dose IV methylprednisone due to concerns for myocarditis as a late inflammatory sequela of COVID-19. She was managed conservatively without coronary intervention. The follow-up TTE one week later showed improvement in her LVEF to 60%. DISCUSSION: SCAD should be kept in the differential diagnosis in the patients who have COVID-19 infections within the past 2-12 weeks and noted to have symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or new-onset cardiac arrhythmias. So far there are very few reported cases of SCAD after COVID-19, all having a variable clinical course (1C3). Overall, SCAD is an underreported coronary event and has a prevalence of around 4%, mostly associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Various mechanisms of SCAD have been proposed including infection-related endothelial dysfunction and intra-plaque hemorrhage leading to an intra-adventitial hematoma, followed by longitudinal spread along the coronary artery and eventually dissection. Even though SCAD can be due to other contributory factors in critical illness, however, the association of SCAD with COVID-19 needs to be further elaborated. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 may lead to various cardiovascular disorders ranging from ACS to SCAD and management protocols need further research. REFERENCE #1: Kumar K, Vogt JC, Divanji PH, Cigarroa JE.

METHODS: A pediatric-specific dermatology registry was created by the Pediatric Dermatology COVID-19 Response Task Force of the Society for Pediatric Dermatology (SPD) and Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance (PeDRA) and was managed by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia using REDCap. RESULTS: Data from 378 children 0-18 years entered into the registry between April 13 and July 17, 2020 were analyzed. Data were drawn from a standardized questionnaire completed by clinicians which asked for demographics, description of acral lesions, symptoms before and after acral changes, COVID-19 positive contacts, treatment, duration of skin changes, laboratory testing including SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing, as well as histopathology. 229 (60.6%) were male with mean age of 13.0 years ( 3.6 years). Six (1.6%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Pedal lesions (often with pruritus and/or pain) were present in 96%. 30% (114/378) had COVID-19 symptoms during the 30 days prior to presentation. Most (69%) had no other symptoms and an uneventful course with complete recovery. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children with acral pernio-like changes were healthy and all recovered with no short-term sequelae.

All ED encounters for suspected opioid overdose (n = 48,301) occurring during the first 31 weeks of 2020 were included. We examined the impact of the national public health emergency for COVID-19 (declared on March 14, 2020) on trends in ED encounters for suspected opioid overdose. RESULTS: Three of four states (Massachusetts, New York and Ohio) experienced a statistically significant immediate decline in the rate of ED encounters for suspected opioid overdose (per 100,000) after the nationwide public health emergency declaration (MA: -0.99; 95% CI: -1.75, -0.24; NY: -0.10; 95% CI, -0.20, 0.0; OH: -0.33, 95% CI: -0.58, -0.07). After this date, Ohio and Kentucky experienced a sustained rate of increase for a 13-week period.

Vaccination can prevent infection through the activation of humoral and cellular immune responses. This is particularly pertinent in the era of emerging novel vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), which affect the immune system, may impact immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines in people with MS. The objective of this article is to provide information on immune system responses to vaccinations and review previous studies of vaccine responses in people with MS to support the safety and importance of receiving currently available and emerging COVID-19 vaccines. Immunological studies have shown that coordinated interactions between T and B lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system are key to successful generation of immunological memory and production of neutralizing antibodies following recognition of vaccine antigens by innate immune cells. CD4(+) T cells are essential to facilitate CD8(+) T cell and B cell activation, while B cells drive and sustain T cell memory. Data suggest that some classes of DMT, including type 1 interferons and glatiramer acetate, may not significantly impair the response to vaccination. DMTssuch as sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, which sequester lymphocytes from circulation; alemtuzumab; and anti-CD20 therapies, which rely on depleting populations of immune cellshave been shown to attenuate responses to conventional vaccines. Currently, three COVID-19 vaccines have been granted emergency use authorization in the USA on the basis of promising interim findings of ongoing trials.

Given that the virus is transmitted via droplets, open airway procedures such as bronchoscopy pose a significant risk to health-care workers (HCWs). The goal of this guideline was to examine the current evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the optimal protection of patients and HCWs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format that addressed specific topics on bronchoscopy related to COVID-19 infection and transmission. MEDLINE (via PubMed) was systematically searched for relevant literature and references were screened for inclusion. Validated evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of studies and to grade the level of evidence to support each recommendation. When evidence did not exist, suggestions were developed based on consensus using the modified Delphi process. RESULTS: The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on six PICO questions resulted in six statements: one evidence-based graded recommendation and 5 ungraded consensus-based statements. INTERPRETATION: The evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse. To maximize protection of patients and HCWs, bronchoscopy should be used sparingly in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections. In an area where community transmission of COVID-19 infection is present, bronchoscopy should be deferred for nonurgent indications, and if necessary to perform, HCWs should wear personal protective equipment while performing the procedure even on asymptomatic patients.","output":"The Use of Bronchoscopy During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: CHEST/AABIP Guideline and Expert Panel Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Big datathe collection of vast quantities of data about individual behavior via online, mobile, and other data-driven serviceshas been heralded as the agent of a third industrial revolutionone with raw materials measured in bits, rather than tons of steel or barrels of oil.

Instead, todays successful big data business models largely use data to scale old modes of value creation, rather than invent new ones altogether. Moreover, todays big data cannot deliver the promised revolution. In this way, todays big data landscape resembles the early phases of the first industrial revolution, rather than the culmination of the second a century later.

In TD-DCS, a picosecond pulsed laser with a long coherence length, adequate illumination power, and narrow instrument response function (IRF) is required, and satisfying all these features is challenging. To this purpose, in this study we characterized the performance of three different laser sources for TD-DCS. First, the sources were evaluated based on their emission spectrum and IRF. Then, we compared the signal-to-noise ratio and the sensitivity to velocity changes of scattering particles in a series of phantom measurements. We also compared the results for in vivo measurements, performing an arterial occlusion protocol on the forearm of three adult subjects. Overall, each laser has the potential to be successfully used both for laboratory and clinical applications. However, we found that the effects caused by the IRF are more significant than the effect of a limited temporal coherence.","output":"Performance assessment of laser sources for time-domain diffuse correlation spectroscopy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This retracts the article DOI: 10.1039/C9RA04591K.].","output":"Retraction: Melatonin protects spinal cord injury by up-regulating IGFBP3 through the improvement of microcirculation in a rat model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine costs of hospitalization associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) during the first year in very low birth weight infants.

However, most research has focused on the concentration of these aerosols and the factors that influence it rather than the correlation between microbial activity and air quality. Thus, this study used a modified technique of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis to evaluate the activity of microorganisms in the PM2.5 during three seasons (summer, autumn and winter) in Beijing. 0.155C5.388 ng mC3 and 0.091C5.740 ng mC3 of sodium fluorescein, a marker of microbial activity, were measured indoors and outdoors, respectively;thus, no significant difference in concentration between the two environments was detected, but the indoor activity was affected by outdoor conditions to an extent. The most active season was autumn, followed by winter and summer. Furthermore, the highest activity in summer and autumn was observed during conditions of excellent air quality, and in summer, the activity during conditions of good air quality also obviously exceeded that during conditions of slight pollution. Additionally, the microbial activity in a room varied according to the rooms ventilation (or lack thereof), suggesting a strong association between these parameters. In general, when the air quality was excellent, 20 minutes of ventilation achieved the optimal air exchange, but this duration should be reduced during polluted conditions.

Highly efficient production of microalgal biomass without the need for light is now feasible in inexpensive, well-defined mineral medium, typically supplemented with glucose. Cell densities of more than 100 g l(?1) cell dry weight have been achieved with Chlorella, Crypthecodinium and Galdieria species while controlling the addition of organic sources of carbon and energy in fedbatch mode. The ability of microalgae to adapt their metabolism to varying culture conditions provides opportunities to modify, control and thereby maximise the formation of targeted compounds with non-recombinant microalgae. This review outlines the critical aspects of cultivation technology and current best practices in the heterotrophic high-cell-density cultivation of microalgae. The primary topics include (1) the characteristics of microalgae that make them suitable for heterotrophic cultivation, (2) the appropriate chemical composition of mineral growth media, (3) the different strategies for fedbatch cultivations and (4) the principles behind the customisation of biomass composition.

A simple quality appraisal tool was constructed which can be used to evaluate rapidly emerging guidelines for evidence as well as for the needs of the global south. This rapid scoping review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews protocol. Electronic databases were searched with predefined strategy and retrieved papers were screened according to relevant criteria. A simple objective tool to assess the quality of rapidly emerging guidelines including evidence, methodology, ease, resource optimization, geography, and the economy was constructed. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. None of the guidelines qualified to be evidence-based clinical practice guidelines as the level of evidence was uniformly rated low. A newly constructed tool showed good validation, reliability, and internal consistency. This rapid scoping review found two major research gaps: lack of systematic review of evidence during their development and insufficient weightage of their impact on surgical services from the global south.

However, SCNT requires the use of monoclonal cells as donors, and the time-consuming and laborious monoclonal selection process limits the production of large populations of gene-edited animals. Here, we developed a rapid and efficient method named RE-DSRNP (reporter RNA enriched dual-sgRNA/CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins) for generating gene-edited donor cells. RE-DSRNP takes advantage of the precise and efficient editing features of dual-sgRNA and the high editing efficiency, low off-target effects, transgene-free nature, and low cytotoxic characteristics of reporter RNA enriched RNPs (CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins), thus eliminating the need for the selection of monoclonal cells and thereby greatly reducing the generation time of donor cells from 3C4 weeks to 1 week, while also reducing the extent of apoptosis and chromosomal aneuploidy of donor cells. We applied RE-DSRNP to produce cloned pigs bearing a deletion edit of the wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1) gene: among 32 weaned cloned pigs, 31 (97%) carried WIP1 edits, and 15 (47%) were homozygous for the designed fragment deletion, and no off-target event was detected. The WIP1 knockout (KO) pigs exhibited male reproductive disorders, illustrating the utility of RE-DSRNP for rapidly generating precisely edited animals for functional genomics and disease research. RE-DSRNPs strong editing performance in a large animal and its marked reduction in the required time for producing SCNT donor cells support its application prospects for rapidly generating populations of transgene-free cloned animals.

In sepsis and other pathological conditions, bacterial lipopolysaccharide endotoxin can induce alveolar macrophages (AM) to release proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6. Studying the mechanisms that control alveolar macrophage cytokine production may lead to better therapies for conditions involving inflammatory lung injury. We and others have noted significant differences between alveolar macrophages and peritoneal macrophages, but large numbers of human or murine alveolar macrophages are rarely available for detailed mechanistic studies. We have obtained three murine alveolar macrophage cell lines (AMJ2C8, AMJ2C11, and AMJ2C20) and have begun to characterize their cytokine responses to proinflammatory stimuli. We measured the effects of endotoxin, interferon gamma, and the combination of the two on production of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-6 in each line. We also studied the expression of the endotoxin receptor CD14 by these cells, and investigated the effect of serum on their endotoxin responsiveness. We show here that all three of the cell lines responded in a manner comparable to that of primary murine alveolar macrophages. Observed variations between these lines may reflect the documented heterogeneity seen in populations of primary alveolar macrophages. These cell lines should expand the repertoire of tools available to investigators studying regulation of murine alveolar macrophage responses.","output":"Characterization of proinflammatory cytokine production and CD14 expression by murine alveolar macrophage cell lines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Photodynamic therapy is witnessing a revival of its origins as a response to the rise of multi-drug resistant infections and the shortage of new classes of antibiotics.

Novel opportunities resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic are briefly discussed. The molecular features of promising photosensitizers are emphasized and contrasted with those of photosensitizers used in the treatment of solid tumors. The development of photosensitizers has been accompanied by the fabrication of a variety of affordable and customizable light sources. We critically discuss the combination between photosensitizer and light source properties that may leverage PDDI and expand its applications to wider markets. The success of PDDI in the management of infectious diseases will ultimately depend on the efficacy of photosensitizers, affordability of the light sources, simplicity of the procedures, and availability of fast and efficient treatments.

We utilized the developmental assets framework to measure protective factors; we assessed (1) prevalence of depressive symptoms, high adverse childhood experiences (ACEs;  4 ACEs), and few developmental assets ( 2 assets) over time, and (2) associations among these three phenomena. Using 2016 and 2019 Minnesota Student Survey data, we utilized descriptive statistics, multivariable logistic regression, and post-estimation analyses (adjusting for school clustering and demographics). Using pooled data, we examined how high ACEs and few assets predicted depressive symptoms and we tested three-way interactions for high ACEs, few assets, and survey year. There were statistically significant increases in prevalence of depressive symptoms, high ACEs, and few assets between 2016 and 2019. High ACEs (AOR = 2.74; 95% CI = 2.61, 2.89) and few assets (AOR = 3.13; 95% CI = 3.00, 3.26) were positively related to depressive symptoms; interactions were statistically significant. Additive interactions showed that, compared to their counterparts, adolescents with high ACEs and few assets had the highest prevalence of depressive symptoms, and this group exhibited the largest increase in prevalence between 2016 and 2019. Depressive symptoms are highest among adolescents with high risk and few protective factors, and recent increases in the prevalence of depressive symptoms appear to have disproportionately occurred among these adolescents.

BACKGROUND The anthrax attack on the USA in 2001 resulted in the development of global response strategies for future bioterrorist events. However, despite these actions, it remains unclear whether nurses are prepared to respond to such events. DATA SOURCES A search for relevant research articles was conducted using the MEDLINE, CINAHL, BNI, and EMBASE databases to locate articles published in the period 1996-March 2010. DESIGN Narrative synthesis. REVIEW METHODS A narrative synthesis of qualitative and quantitative studies was undertaken and the articles reviewed using Greenhalgh's critical appraisal criteria. The review was conducted with inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to ensure the studies examined focussed on the hospital nurse's role in responding to a bioterrorist event. RESULTS Seven original research studies were included in the review. Four themes were identified as affecting nurses' preparedness for a bioterrorist attack. These were perceptions of bioterrorism, the role of formal knowledge, the role of institutional plans and policies, and personal factors. The overarching theme centred on nurses' willingness to respond to a bioterrorist event. It was clear that, although nurses were willing to respond to a bioterrorist attack, they felt unprepared to do so.

Recent studies in BCRL have demonstrated that resistance exercise can improve symptoms and quality of life without worsening lymphoedema. No studies have explored whether combining the principles of progressive resistance exercise training with therapeutic strategies of compression therapy and the decongestive lymphatic exercise sequence are beneficial in reducing arm lymphoedema volume. The aim of this three-arm, provincial randomised controlled trial is to determine the efficacy of a 12-week decongestive progressive resistance exercise (DRE) programme in combination with the one of two types of compression garments compared with standard care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Sixty women with BCRL will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: (1) Standard care, (2) DRE with use of a daytime compression garment during exercise and (3) DRE with use of an adjustable compression wrap during exercise. The primary outcome is the percentage reduction in arm lymphoedema volume. Secondary outcomes include bioimpedance analysis, muscular strength, shoulder range of motion, physical activity level and health-related quality of life. Exploratory outcomes include evaluating changes in arm tissue composition using MRI and examining outcomes between the two DRE experimental groups. The primary analysis will compare changes between the groups from baseline to week 12 reflecting the end of the randomised control trial period.

About 80% of Ethiopians are dependent on agriculture and have direct contact with livestock or other domestic animals. As a result, the country is vulnerable to the spread of zoonotic diseases. As the first step of the country's engagement in the Global Health Security Agenda, a zoonotic disease prioritization workshop was held to identify significant zoonotic diseases of mutual concern for animal and human health agencies. METHODS: A semi-quantitative tool developed by the US CDC was used for prioritization of zoonotic diseases. Workshop participants representing human, animal, and environmental health ministries were selected as core decision-making participants. Over 300 articles describing the zoonotic diseases considered at the workshop were reviewed for disease specific information on prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and DALYs for Ethiopia or the East Africa region. Committee members individually ranked the importance of each criterion to generate a final group weight for each criterion. RESULTS: Forty-three zoonotic diseases were evaluated. Criteria selected in order of importance were: 1)severity of disease in humans, 2)proportion of human disease attributed to animal exposure, 3)burden of animal disease, 4)availability of interventions, and 5)existing inter-sectoral collaboration. Based on the results from the decision tree analysis and subsequent discussion, participants identified the following five priority zoonotic diseases: rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis, and echinococcosis. DISCUSSION: Multi-sectoral collaborations strengthen disease surveillance system development in humans and animals, enhance laboratory capacity, and support implementation of prevention and control strategies. To facilitate this, the creation of a One Health-focused Zoonotic Disease Unit is recommended. Enhancement of public health and veterinary laboratories, joint outbreak and surveillance activities, and intersectoral linkages created to tackle the prioritized zoonotic diseases will undoubtedly prepare the country to effectively address newly emerging zoonotic diseases.","output":"Prioritizing zoonotic diseases in Ethiopia using a one health approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND. COVID-19 is a prothrombotic disease, characterized by endotheliopathy, hypercoagulability, and thromboembolic complications. We hypothesized that the pathogenesis of thromboembolism associated with COVID-19 might differ from thromboembolism in patients without COVID-19. In this study, we sought to evaluate the proteomic signatures of plasma from patients with venous thromboembolism with and without COVID-19. METHODS. Between December 17, 2020 and February 25, 2021 blood was collected from 48 hospitalized patients. Of these 24 had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection (COVID+) and radiologic confirmation of arterial or venous thromboembolism (TE+); 17 had COVID-19 infection with absence of arterial thrombosis clinically and absence of venous thromboembolism on lower extremity Doppler ultrasound or chest CT angiography (COVID+/TE-), while 7 were arterial or venous thromboembolism in the absence of COVID-19 (COVID-/TE+). Blood was collected in sodium citrate tubes and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 minutes, with resulting plasma supernatant used for protein profiling performed at Eve Technologies (Calgary, Alberta, Canada). Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for this study. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (v9.1, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) and R (v4, R Core Team).

In COVID-19 patients who developed thromboembolic events, several proteins associated with inflammation, complement activation, and hemostasis were present at higher levels than in non-COVID-19 patients who developed thromboembolic events (Fig. 1). These included complement factors C2 and C5a, pentraxin-3 (PTX-3), lipocalin-2 (LCN2), resistin (RETN), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (Pecam1), serum amyloid A (SAA), and tissue factor (TF).

Heatmap revealed relatively lower levels of all proteins in patients with thromboembolism without COVID-19 and relatively higher levels of proteins in patients with COVID-19, and especially in ICU patients with COVID-19 and thromboembolism. CONCLUSIONS. Thromboembolic complications in patients with COVID-19 are associated with increased levels of various proteins involved in complement activation and immunothrombotic cascades, compared to thrombotic events in the absence of COVID-19. Activation of the classical complement pathway as evidenced by a relative increase in complement factor C2 may lead to increased TF activation, reflecting more substantial endothelial damage in COVID-19 patients. Higher levels of Pecam1, SAA, LCN2, and RETN all point to increased endotheliopathy, inflammation, and tissue damage in COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 thrombosis. These findings may offer insights into novel therapeutic strategies to treat immunothrombotic complications of COVID-19.

Unfortunately, access to RNA extraction reagents can represent a bottleneck for quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based methodologies, stemming from both extraordinary supply-chain stresses and the global reach of the virus into resource-limited settings. To provide flexible diagnostic options for such environments, we report here an \\"unextracted modification\\" for qRT-PCR using the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC's) widely utilized primers/probe sets for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (N1/N2/N3 targeting viral nucleocapsid and RP-control targeting human RNase P). This approach replaces RNA extraction/purification with a heat-inactivation step of viral transport media (VTM), followed by direct inoculation-with or without VTM spin concentration-into PCR master mixes. Using derivatives of care from our clinical workflow, we compared traditional and unextracted CDC methodologies. Although some decrease in analytic sensitivity was evident (by higher Ct values) without extraction, in particular for the N2 primer/probe-set, we observed high categorical positive agreement between extracted and unextracted results for N1 (unconcentrated VTM-38/40; concentrated VTM-39/41), N3 (unconcentrated VTM-38/40; concentrated VTM-41/41), and RP (unconcentrated and concentrated VTM-81/81). The negative categorical agreement for N1/N2/N3 was likewise high. Overall, these results suggest that laboratories could adapt and validate unextracted qRT-PCR protocols as a contingency to overcome supply limitations, with minimal impact on categorical results.","output":"COVID-19 diagnostics for resource-limited settings: Evaluation of \\"unextracted\\" qRT-PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The dosing interval for AZD1222/Covishield vaccine was prolonged for 16 weeks, due to short supply in Sri Lanka. As robust secondary immune response depends on the presence of memory B cell (Bmem), we investigated their frequency following a single dose of the AZD1222. Methods & Materials: Bmem responses were assessed to S1, S2 and N protein of the SARS-CoV-2 by B cell ELISpot assays in 45 individuals after 16 weeks of receiving a single dose of the vaccine. The mean2 SD of the background responses was defined as the threshold for positive response of antibody secreting cells (ASCs)/1 million cells. Results: In this cohort, 40/45 (88.9%) individuals responded to S1, 39/45 (86.7%) to S2 and 36/45 (80%) to N. Responses to S1 (p<0.0001, median 90, IQR 50 to 137.5 ASCs/1 million cells) and S2 (p=0.0067, median 70, IQR 47.5 to 97.5 ASCs/1 million cells) were significantly higher than N (median 50, IQR 22.5 to 80 ASCs/1 million cells). A significant difference in the frequency of responses to S1 (p=0.0017) and S2 (p=0.046), were seen in different age groups, with a higher frequency of ASCs to S1 and S2 proteins in individuals age between 40-60 and >60 years of age, compared to younger individuals. There was a significant, positive correlation for the frequency of ASCs to S1 (Spearman's r=0.49, p=0.0007), S2 (Spearman's r=0.32, p=0.0308) and N (Spearman's r=0.33, p=0.0274) with age. Conclusion: 86.7% to 88.9% of individuals had Bmem to the spike protein of the virus, suggesting that a single dose of the vaccine, induced potent Bmem responses. Although 80% of individuals had a low frequency of responses to the N protein, which was not present in the vaccine, this could be due to the presence of cross reactive Bmem responses to N protein of previous beta-coronavirus infections, in older individuals.","output":"Memory B Cell Responses at 16 Weeks Following a Single Dose of AZD1222/Covishield in Sri Lankan Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the organ of highest metabolic demand, utilizing over 25% of total body glucose utilization via an enormous vasculature with one capillary every 73 m, the brain evolves a barrier at the capillary and postcapillary venules to prevent toxicity during serum fluctuations in metabolites and hormones, to limit brain swelling during inflammation, and to prevent pathogen invasion.

Therefore, the objectives of this critical review are to establish the association between COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines with the development of HVS. HVS may develop in various viral infections due to impairment of humoral and cellular immunity with elevation of immunoglobulins. COVID-19 can increase blood viscosity (BV) through modulation of fibrinogen, albumin, lipoproteins, and red blood cell (RBC) indices. HVS can cause cardiovascular and neurological complications in COVID-19 like myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. HVS with or without abnormal RBCs function in COVID-19 participates in the reduction of tissue oxygenation with the development of cardio-metabolic complications and long COVID-19. Besides, HVS may develop in vaccine recipients with previous COVID-19 due to higher underlying Ig concentrations and rarely without previous COVID-19. Similarly, patients with metabolic syndrome are at the highest risk for propagation of HVS after COVID-19 vaccination. In conclusion, COVID-19 and related vaccines are linked with the development of HVS, mainly in patients with previous COVID-19 and underlying metabolic derangements. The possible mechanism of HVS in COVID-19 and related vaccines is increasing levels of fibrinogen and immunoglobulins. However, dehydration, oxidative stress, and inflammatory reactions are regarded as additional contributing factors in the pathogenesis of HVS in COVID-19. However, this critical review cannot determine the final causal relationship between COVID-19 and related vaccines and the development of HVS.

In March 2020, the Australian Government introduced telehealth services to ensure that people more vulnerable to COVID-19 do not delay routine care from their general practitioners. Evidence about patients' experience of telehealth and its impact on patient care is scarce. This study aimed to investigate the experience with telehealth by Australian general practice patients at high risk of poor health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 30 patients from nine general practices in metropolitan Adelaide (May-June 2020). Participants were identified by their regular doctor as being at high risk of poor health outcomes. Interviews sought participants' perspectives and experiences about telehealth services in the general practice setting during COVID-19, and the value of offering continued telehealth services post pandemic. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a coding structure developed based on deductive codes derived from the research questions and any additional concepts that emerged inductively from interviews. RESULTS: Participants expressed satisfaction with telehealth including convenient and timely access to general practice services. Yet, participants identified challenges including difficulties in expressing themselves and accessing physical exams. Prescription renewal, discussing test results and simple follow-ups were the most common reasons that telehealth was used. Telehealth was mainly via phone that better suited those with low digital literacy. Participants indicated that an existing doctor-patient relationship was important for telehealth services to be effective. Subjects believed that telehealth services should be continued but needed to be combined with opportunities for face-to-face consultations after the COVID-19 pandemic was over. CONCLUSIONS: The expansion of telehealth supported access to general practice including chronic disease management during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the future, telehealth in Australia is likely to have a stronger place in primary healthcare policy and practice and an increased acceptance amongst patients.","output":"The experience of Australian general practice patients at high risk of poor health outcomes with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still underway An understanding of the virus's mode of transmission and infection is required for its effective containment Besides the respiratory and digestive tracts, the ocular surface presents an additional mucosal surface that is exposed to infectious droplets and direct/indirect contact The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the eye remains controversial This review examines up-to-date information on ocular manifestation, laboratory testing, transmission, and prevention of COVID-19 Based on clinical observations, the risk of conjunctivitis in COVID-19 is low Despite the low incidence, positive SARS-CoV-2 results in eye specimens suggest that the ocular surface may harbor SARS-CoV-2, which may increase the infection and transmission risk We conclude that the ocular surface remains a potential transmission route for the virus that should not be ignored In addition, the intraocular findings have also been described in COVID-19 The measures for eye and face protection should be widely adopted to stem the tide of the pandemic","output":"Ocular Involvement in Coronavirus Disease 2019: Up-to-Date Information on Its Manifestation, Testing, Transmission, and Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To outline strategies for the treatment of migraine which do not require in\\\\person visits to clinic or the emergency department, and to describe ways that health insurance companies can remove barriers to quality care for migraine.

However, during their development process, the imbalance between the supply and demand of shared bicycles has restricted the public's willingness to use them. Thus, it is necessary to forecast the demand for shared bicycles in different urban regions. This article presents a prediction model called QPSO-LSTM for the origin and destination (OD) distribution of shared bicycles by combining long short-term memory (LSTM) and quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO). LSTM is a special type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that solves the long-term dependence problem existing in the general RNN, and is suitable for processing and predicting important events with very long intervals and delays in time series. QPSO is an important swarm intelligence algorithm that solves the optimization problem by simulating the process of birds searching for food. In the QPSO-LSTM model, LSTM is applied to predict the OD numbers. QPSO is used to optimize the LSTM for a problem involving a large number of hyperparameters, and the optimal combination of hyperparameters is quickly determined. Taking Nanjing as an example, the prediction model is applied to two typical areas, and the number of bicycles needed per hour in a future day is predicted. QPSO-LSTM can effectively learn the cycle regularity of the change in bicycle OD quantity. Finally, the QPSO-LSTM model is compared with the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), back propagation (BP), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This shows that the QPSO-LSTM prediction result is more accurate.","output":"Prediction for Origin-Destination Distribution of Dockless Shared Bicycles: A Case Study in Nanjing City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Indonesian government decided to keep organizing the Head of the Region Elections amid the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Then, regarding the neutrality of the state civil apparatus, the government stated that the neutrality principle still applies. This research shows that many health protocols were violated by the General Election Commission, Polling Station Committee, and voters, thus increasing the number of COVID-19 infections at the election regions. The neutrality of public servant was violated by some of public servant but if the violation goes viral then would be sanctioned. CONCLUSION: These violations are often not followed up according to the regulation, but the violators were only warned. Then, in the case of the neutrality of the state civil apparatus in the general elections, there is state civil apparatus who is not neutral in this event.","output":"Organizing Quality and Healthy Election Amid the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Election Health Protocol Policies and Neutrality of State Civil Servants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AORN conducted its 19th annual compensation survey for perioperative nurses in June and July of 2021.

Methods: We proposed to use a retrospective case-control study to give a comparison between suspected patients and confirmed patients in the clinical characteristics. Results: (56%) patients were confirmed for COVID-19 from suspected 167 patients. We find that elder people were more likely to be infected by COVID-19. Among the confirmed 94 patients, 2 (2%) patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 0 (0%) patients died during the study period. We find that images of CT scan of patients with a COVID-19 are significantly different from patients without a COVID-19. Conclusions: To our best knowledge, it is the first time to use the case-control design to study the coronavirus disease, since it is particularly appropriate for investigating infectious disease outbreaks. The clinical treatment experience in this study can supply a guideline for treating COVID-19 as the number of the infected patients is increasing in the world. Compared with other studies, we find that the mortality rate and the intensive care unit rate can be reduced if patients can be treated timely in the right identification and detection with nucleic acid testing and chest CT scan. Therefore, we recommend nucleic acid testing and chest CT scan for the clinical treatment practice from this successful clinical treatment study.","output":"Chest CT Scan of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Case-Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Increased expression of the transcription factor Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) has been reported to play an important role in the progression and development of multiple tumors, but the molecular mechanisms that regulate FOXM1 expression remain unknown, and the role of FOXM1 in aerobic glycolysis is still not clear. METHODS: The expression of FOXM1 and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) in normal brain tissues and glioma was detected in data from the TCGA database and in our specimens. The effect of NOX4 on the expression of FOXM1 was determined by Western blot, qPCR, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production assays, and luciferase assays. The functions of NOX4 and FOXM1 in aerobic glycolysis in glioblastoma cells were determined by a series of experiments, such as Western blot, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), lactate production, and intracellular ATP level assays. A xenograft mouse model was established to test our findings in vivo. RESULTS: The expression of FOXM1 and NOX4 was increased in glioma specimens compared with normal brain tissues and correlated with poor clinical outcomes. Aberrant mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation of NOX4 induced FOXM1 expression. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that NOX4-derived MitoROS exert their regulatory role on FOXM1 by mediating hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) stabilization. Further research showed that NOX4-derived MitoROS-induced HIF-1 directly activates the transcription of FOXM1 and results in increased FOXM1 expression. Overexpression of NOX4 or FOXM1 promoted aerobic glycolysis, whereas knockdown of NOX4 or FOXM1 significantly suppressed aerobic glycolysis, in glioblastoma cells. NOX4-induced aerobic glycolysis was dependent on elevated FOXM1 expression, as FOXM1 knockdown abolished NOX4-induced aerobic glycolysis in glioblastoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: Increased expression of FOXM1 induced by NOX4-derived MitoROS plays a pivotal role in aerobic glycolysis, and our findings suggest that inhibition of NOX4-FOXM1 signaling may present a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment.

This study proposes a novel measure for the probable pathogenic virus transmission risk of a high-rise drainage stack with the occurrence of positive air pressure. The proposed approach is based on time-variant positive air pressures measured in a 38 m high drainage stack of a full-scale experimental tower under steady flow conditions of flow rate 1-4 Ls-1 discharging at a height between 15 m to 33 m above the stack base. The maximum pressure and probabilistic positive air pressures in the discharging stack ventilation section with no water (Zone A of the discharging drainage stack) were determined. It was demonstrated that the positive air pressures were lower in frequency as compared with those in other stack zones and could propagate along the upper 1/3 portion of the ventilation pipe (H' &#8805; 0.63) towards the ventilation opening at the rooftop. As the probabilistic positive pressures at a stack height were found to be related to the water discharging height and flow rate, a risk model of positive air pressure is proposed. Taking the 119th, 124th, 140th and 11,547th COVID-19 cases of an epidemiological investigation in Hong Kong as a baseline of concern, excessive risk of system overuse was evaluated. The results showed that for a 20-80% increase in the frequency of discharge flow rate, the number of floors identified at risk increased from 1 to 9 and 1 to 6 in the 34- and 25-storey residential buildings, respectively.

Respiratory diseases and gastrointestinal or enteroviral diseases declined more than sexually transmitted or bloodborne diseases and vector-borne or zoonotic diseases. Early pandemic phases with more stringent NPIs were associated with greater reductions in disease incidence. Non-respiratory diseases, such as hand, foot and mouth disease, rebounded substantially towards the end of the year 2020 as the NPIs were relaxed. Statistical modeling analyses confirm that strong NPIs were associated with a broad mitigation effect on communicable diseases, but resurgence of non-respiratory diseases should be expected when the NPIs, especially restrictions of human movement and gathering, become less stringent.","output":"Changes in notifiable infectious disease incidence in China during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: International and national guidelines state that palliative care should be offered to everyone who needs it. To promote the implementation of palliative care in nursing homes, a partnership collaboration was initiated with the goal of implementing high quality palliative care. The partnership consisted of three partner groups: a project group from a non-profit organisation providing health care, managers at the nursing homes and an academic partner. The aim was to explore the social processes within academic-community partnership in a collaboration project. METHODS: Digital focus group discussions were conducted with 16 participants, representing all three partner groups. One individual digital interview was also carried out. A constructivist perspective of a grounded theory approach was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The core category, partnership positioning, covers the social processes of the academic-community partnership in a collaboration project to implement and evaluate health-promoting interventions in clinical health care. The core category was found to have four categories: Pre-positioning, Co-positioning, Re-positioning and GoOn-positioning. The process of partnership positioning is conceptualised in a model. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that a new partnership in an implementation project needs holistic, systemic thinking. To enhance implementation in a collaborative project involving different professionals and actors a plan is required to facilitate positioning activities. The process, the roles and the components need to be clearly defined and documented, and the management of a system requires knowledge of the interrelationships between all the components within the system.

Resins, particularly those with a significant level of compressibility, require proper knowledge of the packing methodology to ensure scalable performance. The study demonstrates the applicability of pressure-flow modeling based on the Blake-Kozeny equation for cellulose based resins, using the MEP HyperCel (Pall) resin as a case study. This approach enabled the understanding of the appropriate bed compressibility and the determination of the minimum column diameter that can predict bed integrity during commercial manufacturing scale operation. Studies suggested that scale-dependent wall effects become negligible for column diameters exceeding 20 cm. Pressure-flow modeling produced a minimum compression recommendation of 0.206 for the MEP HyperCel resin. Columns with diameters up to 80 cm packed with this bed compression yielded incompressible beds with pressure-flow curves consistent with model predictions. Model parameter (particle diameter, viscosity, porosity) values were then varied to demonstrate how changing operating conditions influence model predictions. This analysis supported the successful troubleshooting of unexpected high pressures at the commercial manufacturing scale using MEP HyperCel resin, further supporting the applicability of this approach.","output":"Pressure-Flow experiments, packing, and modeling for scale-up of a mixed mode chromatography column for biopharmaceutical manufacturing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advances in self-organizing cardiac organoids to recapitulate human cardiogenesis have provided a powerful tool for unveiling human cardiac development, studying cardiovascular diseases, testing drugs, and transplantation.

Methods A population-based cohort study including all individuals registered in Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP). SIDIAP includes primary care records covering > 80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain, and was linked to region-wide testing, hospital and mortality records. Outpatient diagnoses of COVID-19, hospitalisations with COVID-19, and deaths with COVID-19 were identified between 1st March and 6th May 2020. A multi-state model was used, with cause-specific Cox survival models estimated for each transition. Findings A total of 5,664,652 individuals were included. Of these, 109,367 had an outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19, 18,019 were hospitalised with COVID-19, and 5,585 died after either being diagnosed or hospitalised with COVID-19. Half of those who died were not admitted to hospital prior to their death. Risk of a diagnosis with COVID-19 peaked first in middle-age and then again for oldest ages, risk for hospitalisation after diagnosis peaked around 70 years old, with all other risks highest at oldest ages. Male gender was associated with an increased risk for all outcomes other than outpatient diagnosis. The comorbidities studied (autoimmune condition, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, heart disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, malignant neoplasm, obesity, and type 2 diabetes) were all associated with worse outcomes. Interpretation There is a continued need to protect those at high risk of poor outcomes, particularly the elderly, from COVID-19 and provide appropriate care for those who develop symptomatic disease.

However, when compared to the published normative EORTC QLQ-C30 data, there was no evidence that the Covid-19 pandemic had significantly impacted upon overall quality of life. Subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 were significantly inversely correlated with the C-19EIS, validating its use in skin cancer patients. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, skin cancer patients in our tertiary referral center were surprisingly resilient. However, given the geographical variations in the rates of Sars-CoV-2 infection it is possible that the low incidence in Northern Germany may have resulted in a lack of general QoL impairments. Multi-center studies are required to further determine the impact of Covid-19 on psychological wellbeing in skin cancer patients in order to develop supportive interventions and to ensure that engagement with cancer care services is maintained in order to enable early detection of cancer progression and/or recurrence.","output":"The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on quality of life in skin cancer patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: We introduce in this study CovMulNet19, a comprehensive COVID-19 network containing all available known interactions involving SARS-CoV-2 proteins, interacting-human proteins, diseases and symptoms that are related to these human proteins, and compounds that can potentially target them. Materials and Methods: Extensive network analysis methods, based on a bootstrap approach, allow us to prioritize a list of diseases that display a high similarity to COVID-19 and a list of drugs that could potentially be beneficial to treat patients. As a key feature of CovMulNet19, the inclusion of symptoms allows a deeper characterization of the disease pathology, representing a useful proxy for COVID-19-related molecular processes. Results: We recapitulate many of the known symptoms of the disease and we find the most similar diseases to COVID-19 reflect conditions that are risk factors in patients. In particular, the comparison between CovMulNet19 and randomized networks recovers many of the known associated comorbidities that are important risk factors for COVID-19 patients, through identified similarities with intestinal, hepatic, and neurological diseases as well as with respiratory conditions, in line with reported comorbidities. Conclusion: CovMulNet19 can be suitably used for network medicine analysis, as a valuable tool for exploring drug repurposing while accounting for the intervening multidimensional factors, from molecular interactions to symptoms.","output":"CovMulNet19, Integrating Proteins, Diseases, Drugs, and Symptoms: A Network Medicine Approach to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The practice of social distancing and wearing masks has been popular worldwide in combating the contraction of COVID-19. Undeniably, although such practices help control the COVID-19 pandemic to a greater extent, the complete control of viral-laden droplet and aerosol transmission by such practices is poorly understood. This review paper intends to outline the literature concerning the transmission of viral-laden droplets and aerosols in different environmental settings and demonstrates the behavior of droplets and aerosols resulted from a cough-jet of an infected person in various confined spaces. The case studies that have come out in different countries have, with prima facie evidence, manifested that the airborne transmission plays a profound role in contracting susceptible hosts. Interestingly, the nosocomial transmission by airborne SARS-CoV-2 viral-laden aerosols in healthcare facilities may be plausible.

A total of 1285 genes were significantly upregulated by MH96 during infection; 829 genes responded to in vivo conditions during at least one stage of infection, 289 responded during two stages of infection, and 167 transcripts responded throughout all three stages of infection compared to in vitro conditions at equivalent cell densities. Genes upregulated during the earliest infection stage included components of the insecticidal toxin complex Yen-TC (chi1, chi2, and yenC1), genes for rearrangement hotspot element containing protein yenC3, cytolethal distending toxin cdtAB, and vegetative insecticidal toxin vip2. Genes more highly expressed throughout the infection cycle included the putative heat-stable enterotoxin yenT and three adhesins (usher-chaperone fimbria, filamentous hemagglutinin, and an AidA-like secreted adhesin). Clustering and functional enrichment of gene expression data also revealed expression of genes encoding type III and VI secretion system-associated effectors.

Despite the high mortality rates from SARS-CoV-1 and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV infections, which both sparked the interest of the scientific community, the underlying physiopathology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, remains partially unclear. SARS-CoV-2 shares similar features with SARS-CoV-1, notably the use of the angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the host cells. However, some features of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are unique. In this work, we focus on the association between obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes on the one hand, and the severity of COVID-19 infection on the other, as it seems greater in these patients. We discuss how adipocyte dysfunction leads to a specific immune environment that predisposes obese patients to respiratory failure during COVID-19. We also hypothesize that an ACE2-cleaved protein, angiotensin 1-7, has a beneficial action on immune deregulation and that its low expression during the SARS-CoV-2 infection could explain the severity of infection.

To achieve that level of confidence, monitoring the stability of the microscope performance over time with standardized quality testing routines is essential for mining quantitative data. Three levels of microscope quality control procedures should be considered: i) usage of accessible and affordable tools and samples, ii) execution of easy and fast, preferably automatized, acquisition protocols, iii) analysis of data in the most automated way possible with adequate metrics for long-term monitoring. In this paper, we test the acquisition protocols on the mainly used microscope techniques (wide-field, spinning disk and confocal microscopy) with simple quality control tools. Seven protocols specify metrics on measuring the lateral and axial resolution (Point-Spread Function) of the system, field flatness, chromatic aberrations and co-registration, illumination power monitoring and stability, stage drift and positioning repeatability and finally temporal and spatial noise sources of camera detectors.

At the same time, the so-called 'lockdown' restrictions have decreased overall mobility, thereby challenging the traditional concept of clinical examination. Moreover, the need for security for both patients and healthcare personnel has posed a further limitation to face-to-face meeting. Telemedicine has provided a valuable solution for such issues, allowing the evaluation of oral and maxillofacial surgery patients through technological interfaces, restricting physical consultations to cases with high clinical priority, intercepting suspects, and maintaining contact with discharged patients. Thanks to the experience gained during the previous wave of infections, the purpose of this study was to present a reorganization of clinical services for oral and maxillofacial surgery in order to help cope with the latest COVID-19 resurgence. Using commonly available software for telecommunications and online meetings, the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the University Hospital of Udine has reshaped the organization of healthcare services, with telemedicine central to the continuity of assistance, while at the same time minimizing the risk of exposure for both patients and operators. Additionally, the high number of patients evaluated through telemedicine improved our ability to define signs and symptoms of diseases using informatic tools, thus allowing the introduction of the concept of 'telesemiology'.

Bilateral nasal (NA) swabs applied to a commercial antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT) offer a simpler and more comfortable alternative to nasopharyngeal (NP) collection; however, little is known about the sensitivity of this method in an asymptomatic population. Participants in community-based asymptomatic testing sites were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using an Ag-RDT with NP sampling. Positive individuals returned for confirmatory molecular testing and consented to repeating the Ag-RDT using a bilateral NA swab for comparison. Residual test buffer (RTB) from Ag-RDTs was subjected to real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Of 123,617 asymptomatic individuals, 197 NP Ag-RDT-positive participants were included, with 175 confirmed positive by RT-PCR. Of these cases, 154 were identified from the NA swab collection with Ag-RDT, with a sensitivity of 88.0% compared to the NP swab collection. Stratifying results by RT-PCR cycle threshold demonstrated that sensitivity of the nasal collection method varied based on the cycle threshold (C(T)) value of the paired RT-PCR sample. RT-PCR testing on the RTB from the Ag-RDT using NP and NA swab collections resulted in 100.0% and 98.7% sensitivity, respectively. NA swabs provide an adequate alternative to NP swab collection for use with Ag-RDT, with the recognition that the test is most sensitive in specimens with high viral loads. With the high sensitivity of RT-PCR testing on RTB from Ag-RDT, a more streamlined approach to confirmatory testing is possible without recollection or use of paired collections strategies.

In many countries, this directive has been extended on shopping malls or public transportation. The aim of this paper is to critically analyze the statutory regulation to wear protective masks during the COVID-19 crisis from a medical standpoint. METHODS: We performed an extensive query of the most recent publications addressing the prevention of viral infections including the use of face masks in the community as a method to prevent the spread of the infection. We addressed the issues of practicability, professional use, and acceptability based on the community and the environment where the user resided. RESULTS: Upon our critical review of the available literature, we found only weak evidence for wearing a face mask as an efficient hygienic tool to prevent the spread of a viral infection. However, the use of MNC seems to be linked to relevant protection during close contact scenarios by limiting pathogen-containing aerosol and liquid droplet dissemination. Importantly, we found evidence for significant respiratory compromise in patients with severe obstructive pulmonary disease, secondary to the development of hypercapnia. This could also happen in patients with lung infections, with or without SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Epidemiologists currently emphasize that wearing MNC will effectively interrupt airborne infections in the community. The government and the politicians have followed these recommendations and used them to both advise and, in some cases, mandate the general population to wear MNC in public locations. Overall, the results seem to suggest that there are some clinically relevant scenarios where the use of MNC necessitates more defined recommendations.

Developing reliable and secure electronic frailty assessment tools can benefit virtual appointments, a need especially relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. An emerging effort has targeted web-based software applications to improve accessibility and usage. The objectives of this scoping review are to identify and evaluate web-based frailty assessment tools currently available and to identify challenges and opportunities for future development. METHODS: We conducted a review with literature (e.g., using MEDLINE databases) and Google searches (last updated on October 10, 2021). Each of the identified web applications were assessed based on eight featured categories and assigned a rating score accordingly. RESULTS: Twelve web-based frailty assessment applications were found, chiefly provided by the USA (50%) or European countries (41%) and focused on frailty grading and outcome prediction for specific patient groups (59%). Categories that scored well among the applications included the User Interface (2.8/3) and the Cost (2.7/3). Other categories had a mean score of 1.6/3 or lower. The least developed feature was Data Saving. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based applications represent a viable option for remote frailty assessments and multidisciplinary integrated care of older adults.

RESULTS: Psychological acceptance was correlated with hallucination severity, behavioral activation, and family functioning; mindfulness was correlated with depression severity and behavioral activation; and values-action consistency was correlated with family functioning. Significant associations between acceptance, mindfulness, and values remained in most cases in multivariate analyses after controlling for the presence of the other variables and accounted for large amounts of variance. CONCLUSIONS: Although requiring future replication due to the sample size, findings support the conclusion that acceptance, mindfulness, and values appear to have meaningful and somewhat unique associations with important aspects of symptoms and functioning in individuals with psychotic depression.

This study characterizes the impact of the ban on surgical delays for patients scheduled for surgery during this first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods Patients who were scheduled for surgical treatment of malignant or pre-invasive disease by gynecologic oncologists at three NYC hospitals during NYCs ban on elective surgery were included. Outcomes of interest were the percentage of patients experiencing surgical delay and the nature of delays. Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square, and logistic regression tests were performed with significance at p<0.05. Results Of the 145 patients with malignant or pre-invasive diseases scheduled for surgery during the ban on elective surgery, 40% of patients experienced one or more surgical delays, 10% experienced two or more and 1% experienced three surgical delays. Of patients experiencing an initial delay, 77% were hospital-initiated and 11% were due to known or suspected personal COVID-19. Overall, 81% of patients completed their planned treatment, and 93% of patients underwent their initially planned surgery. Among patients for whom adjuvant therapy was recommended, 67% completed their planned treatment, and the most common reasons for not completing treatment were medically indicated followed by concerns regarding COVID-19.

Its wide deployment, however, must first address the tension between inference accuracy and resource (compute/network) cost. This has led to the development of video analytics pipelines (VAPs), which reduce resource cost by combining DNN compression/speedup techniques with video processing heuristics. Our measurement study on existing VAPs, however, shows that today's methods for evaluating VAPs are incomplete, often producing premature conclusions or ambiguous results. This is because each VAP's performance varies substantially across videos and time (even under the same scenario) and is sensitive to different subsets of video content characteristics. We argue that accurate VAP evaluation must first characterize the complex interaction between VAPs and video characteristics, which we refer to as VAP performance clarity. We design and implement Yoda, the first VAP benchmark to achieve performance clarity. Using primitive-based profiling and a carefully curated benchmark video set, Yoda builds a performance clarity profile for each VAP to precisely define its accuracy/cost tradeoff and its relationship with video characteristics. We show that Yoda substantially improves VAP evaluations by (1) providing a comprehensive, transparent assessment of VAP performance and its dependencies on video characteristics; (2) explicitly identifying fine-grained VAP behaviors that were previously hidden by large performance variance; and (3) revealing strengths/weaknesses among different VAPs and new design opportunities.","output":"Towards Performance Clarity of Edge Video Analytics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives TikTok is a popular social media platform, especially among those who are 13-24 years of age.

We estimated hierarchical linear models to test overall and conditional differences over the trial timepoints, in the interval between the trial and May 2020, and between the pandemic timepoints. RESULTS: Compared to MEUC, ACT led to greater improvement on the outcomes during the 8 month trial follow-up, consistent with the main trial findings. Across the entire sample, anxiety symptoms and emotional approach coping worsened from the final trial assessment timepoint to May 2020 (ps <.001). During this period, ACT participants worsened significantly more on emotional approach coping (p = .035) and marginally more on fear of recurrence (p = .064) than MEUC participants. No conditional differences emerged at later pandemic timepoints.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ACT several years earlier did not provide protective benefit to anxious cancer survivors during the pandemic, relative to MEUC.

Litter size environmental variability has been related to environmental sensitivity. A divergent selection experiment for environmental variance of litter size variance was carried out successfully in rabbits over thirteen generations.

In conclusion, the decrease of environmental sensitivity seems to increase the adaptation of the animal to the environment, and thus, its welfare. ABSTRACT: A divergent selection experiment for environmental variance of litter size variance was carried out in rabbits over thirteen generations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inflammatory response in the two lines of the experiment, in order to analyse the effect of selection on susceptibility to diseases after challenging to stressful situations, such as 24 h after the first delivery. A total of 78 females were used in this study, 39 from each line. The line selected for litter size heterogeneity (the high line) showed lower white blood leukocyte count (WBC; ?0.87  10(3)/L), lower percentage of basophils (?0.11%), higher concentration of TNF- (+13.8 pg/mL), and greater concentration of CRP (+38.1 g/mL) than the line selected for litter size homogeneity (the low line). The high line had also higher concentrations of bilirubin, cholesterol, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) compared to the low line (difference between lines were +0.08 mol/L, +0.14 mol/L, +0.35 U/L and +2.4 U/L, respectively). The high line showed higher inflammatory response than the low line, in accordance with a larger susceptibility to infectious disorders. In conclusion, the line selected to increase litter size environmental variability seems to have poor capacity coping with environmental stressors.

However, the creation of such database is often tedious and cumbersome and involves human labor. Hence, we developed a Raspberry Pi-based system for archiving EEG signals recorded from patients under anesthesia in operating rooms (ORs) with minimal human involvement. METHODS Using this system, we archived patient EEG signals from over 500 unique surgeries at the Emory University Orthopaedics and Spine Hospital, Atlanta, for about 18 months. For this, we developed a software package that runs on a Raspberry Pi and archives patient EEG signals from a SedLine Root EEG Monitor (Masimo) to a secure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant cloud storage. The OR number corresponding to each surgery was archived along with the EEG signal to facilitate retrospective EEG analysis. We retrospectively processed the archived EEG signals and performed signal quality checks. We also proposed a formula to compute the proportion of true EEG signal and calculated the corresponding statistics. Further, we curated and interleaved patient medical record information with the corresponding EEG signals. RESULTS We retrospectively processed the EEG signals to demonstrate a statistically significant negative correlation between the relative alpha power (8-12 Hz) of the EEG signal captured under anesthesia and the patient's age.

RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that TRIM22 directly or indirectly interacts with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)4E, and inhibits the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G, thus disturbing the assembly of the eIF4F complex, which is necessary for cap\\\\dependent translation. Furthermore, TRIM22 exerts a repressive effect on luciferase reporter protein levels and to some extent on radiolabelled methionine incorporation.

Interestingly, L1342P neuronal culture displayed a degree of resistance to the anticonvulsant medication phenytoin, which recapitulated aspects of clinical observation of patients carrying the L1342P variant. In contrast, phrixotoxin-3 (PTx3), a Nav1.2 isoform-specific blocker, can potently alleviate spontaneous and chemically-induced hyperexcitability of neurons carrying the L1342P variant. Our results reveal a possible pathogenic underpinning of Nav1.2-L1342P mediated epileptic seizures and demonstrate the utility of genome-edited hiPSCs as an in vitro platform to advance personalized phenotyping and drug discovery.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTA mounting number of SCN2A genetic variants have been identified from patients with epilepsy, but how SCN2A variants affect the function of human neurons contributing to seizures is still elusive. This study investigated the functional consequences of a recurring SCN2A variant (L1342P) using human iPSC-derived neurons and revealed both intrinsic and network hyperexcitability of neurons carrying a mutant Nav1.2 channel. Importantly, this study recapitulated elements of clinical observations of drug-resistant features of the L1342P variant, and provided a platform for in vitro drug testing. Our study sheds light on cellular mechanism of seizures resulting from a recurring Nav1.2 variant, and helps to advance personalized drug discovery to treat patients carrying pathogenic SCN2A variant.","output":"Hyperexcitability and pharmacological responsiveness of cortical neurons derived from human iPSCs carrying epilepsy-associated sodium channel Nav1.2-L1342P genetic variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.","output":"Author Correction: A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is spreading globally and treatment options remain limited. A formulation of niclosamide, a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent and a broad-spectrum antiviral treatment candidate, optimized for inhalation and intranasal administration (UNI91104) was developed. Methods: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-centre, dose-ascending Phase 1 trial to assess the safety of UNI91104 in Denmark (NCT04576312). Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to a ascending single dose in cohort 1-4 and five doses over 2.5 days in cohort 5. Inclusion criteria included a minimum 80% of predicted lung function. Exclusion criteria included severe, clinically significant allergies and current acute or chronic condition especially airway diseases. Safety was evaluated through adverse events (AEs) and pulmonary function tests including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests. The primary endpoints were defined as the frequency of reported AEs and the change of safety variables relative to pre-dose. Data from all enroled healthy volunteers receiving any amount of IMP was included in the primary analyses. The pharmacokinetics of UNI91104 was determined. Findings: The trial was conducted between 29 June 2020 and 08 August 2020. Thirty-four healthy volunteers received UNI91104 and ten placebo. No serious AEs or discontinuation were reported. Mild irritation in the upper respiratory tract following inhalation of UNI91104 was reported as most frequent AE (45 events in 26 healthy volunteers, 59% of all healthy volunteers). Nasal application was well-tolerated. There was no evidence of difference in the change of mean levels of pulmonary function tests between active and placebo group across all cohorts. Five healthy volunteers (11.4%) (1 on placebo) had signs of increased transient FeNO and 4 on active (9.1%) experienced asymptomatic drops in FEV1, which resolved spontaneously or were reversible with a ?2-agonist. Niclosamide exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics following inhalation and intranasal administration. Interpretation: UNI91104, a promising candidate for inhalation and intranasal therapy against COVID-19 and other viral respiratory tract infections is well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and warrants further testing in patient trials.

METHODS: Human fibroblasts were placed on a plastic device containing 500m human dentin discs treated with each adhesive or without treatment (control). Other groups were directly exposed to media conditioned with adhesive samples according to ISO 10993-5:2009. After 24h exposure, cell viability was assessed by XTT, and released inflammatory mediators were detected with a multiparametric immunoassay. RESULTS: The standardized test without barrier indicated both etch-and-rinse adhesives and self-etch as cytotoxic, promoting viabilities under 70% of the control group (p<0.05). The dentin-barrier model identified increased cell viability for self-etch adhesives, with Clearfill SE Bond identified as non-cytotoxic. The immunoassay evidenced high rates of cytokines by cells exposed to the conditioned media of Adper Scotchbond, Optibond S, and Single Bond Universal. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a dentin-barrier in vitro model detected a better biocompatibility for self-etching adhesives and, in the case of Clearfill SE Bond, with a reversion from cytotoxic to biocompatible when compared to the indirect standardized test.

METHODS: A national representative sample of 2,869 adults took part in an assessment that was carried out through a self-administrated questionnaire including sections relating to NK and AMD. AMD was evaluated following the PREDIMED PLUS methodology. Descriptive statistics were provided, and ordinal measures of NK score and AMD were calculated based on quartiles of the quantitative scores. A contingency analysis was performed to check associations between variables. RESULTS: In Italy, the average NK score was 50  13.3, equivalent to 56.8% of correct answers. The average value of AMD was 6.8, corresponding to 40% of the maximum score with 31.4% of the population demonstrating low AMD, 31.3% in the lower-middle range, 24% in the medium-high range, and only 13.3% reporting a high AMD.

Atomistic simulations and functional dynamics analysis are combined with alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with the ACE2 host receptor and the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail(REG10987+REG10933). Using alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity analysis, we have shown that K417, E484, and N501 residues correspond to key interacting centers with a significant degree of structural and energetic plasticity that allow mutants in these positions to afford the improved binding affinity with ACE2. Through perturbation-based network modeling and community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with ACE2, we demonstrate that E406, N439, K417, and N501 residues serve as effector centers of allosteric interactions and anchor major intermolecular communities that mediate long-range communication in the complexes. The results provide support to a model according to which mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations constrained by the requirements for host receptor binding and preservation of stability may preferentially select structurally plastic and energetically adaptable allosteric centers to differentially modulate collective motions and allosteric interactions in the complexes with the ACE2 enzyme and REGN-COV2 antibody combination.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive retrospective molecular epidemiological analysis (genetic, phylogenetic, phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses) of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Cyprus from April 2020 to January 2021, covering the first ten months of the SARS-CoV-2 infection epidemic on the island. The primary aim of this study was to assess the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. Whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from 596 clinical samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) obtained from community-based diagnostic testing centers and hospitalized patients. The phylogenetic analyses revealed a total of 34 different lineages in Cyprus, with B.1.258, B.1.1.29, B.1.177, B.1.2, B.1 and B.1.1.7 (designated a Variant of Concern 202012/01, VOC) being the most prevalent lineages on the island during the study period.

EMRs play crucial roles in improving the quality of care and medical decision-making and in facilitating cross-hospital health information exchange. Although many hospitals have invested considerable resources and efforts to develop EMRs for several years, the factors affecting the long-term success of EMRs, particularly in the EMR infusion stage, remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of technology, user, and task characteristics on EMR infusion to determine the factors that largely affect EMR infusion. In addition, we examined the effect of EMR infusion on individual HCP performance. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was used to collect data from HCPs with >6 months experience in using EMRs in a Taiwanese teaching hospital. A total of 316 questionnaires were distributed and 211 complete copies were returned, yielding a valid response rate of 66.8%. The collected data were further analyzed using WarpPLS 5.0. RESULTS: EMR infusion (R(2)=0.771) was mainly affected by user habits (=.411), portability (=.217), personal innovativeness (=.198), technostress (=.169), and time criticality (=.168), and individual performance (R(2)=0.541) was affected by EMR infusion (=.735). This finding indicated that user (habit, personal innovativeness, and technostress), technology (portability), and task (mobility and time criticality) characteristics have major effects on EMR infusion. Furthermore, the results indicated that EMR infusion positively affects individual performance. CONCLUSIONS: The factors identified in this study can extend information systems infusion theory and provide useful insights for the further improvement of EMR development in hospitals and by the government, specifically in its infusion stage. In addition, the developed instrument can be used as an assessment tool to identify the key factors for EMR infusion, and to evaluate the extent of EMR infusion and the individual performance of hospitals that have implemented EMR systems. Moreover, the results can help governments to understand the urgent needs of hospitals in implementing EMR systems, provide sufficient resources and support to improve the incentives of EMR development, and develop adequate EMR policies for the meaningful use of electronic health records among hospitals and clinics.","output":"Health Professionals Perspectives on Electronic Medical Record Infusion and Individual Performance: Model Development and Questionnaire Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preeclampsia (PE) is a life-threatening disease of pregnant women associated with severe hypertension, proteinuria, or multi-organ injuries. Mitochondrial-mediated placental oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PE. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be revealed. Here, we identify Rnd3, a small Rho GTPase, regulating placental mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). We showed that Rnd3 is down-regulated in primary trophoblasts isolated from PE patients. Loss of Rnd3 in trophoblasts resulted in excessive ROS generation, cell apoptosis, mitochondrial injury, and proton leakage from the respiratory chain. Moreover, Rnd3 overexpression partially rescues the mitochondrial defects and oxidative stress in human PE primary trophoblasts.

We aim to describe the global impact of COVID-19 on OHT volumes one year after the pandemic. Methods Using data from the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation (GODT), the world's most comprehensive source of data on organ donation and transplantation, we determined the number of OHT procedures performed in the years 2019 (pre-COVID-19 era) and 2020 (COVID-19 era). Countries with reported data on OHT volumes in both years (n=51 countries) were included. OHT volumes were reported for each country per million population (PMP), and change in the COVID-19 era was expressed as a percentage of the pre-COVID-19 rates of OHT PMP. Results Among countries included in this analysis, the number of OHT decreased by 9.3% during the COVID-19 era (a decrease from 1.82 to 1.65 OHT PMP). However, significant variability existed among included countries, such that 76.5% (39/51) of countries experienced a reduction in OHT volumes during the COVID-19 era (median OHT of 2.56 PMP in 2019 vs. 1.84 in 2020, median difference -0.53 OHT PMP, IQR [-0.83, -0.2], p<0.001) while the rest experienced an increase in OHT volumes (median OHT of 4.1 PMP in 2019 vs. 5 in 2020, median difference 0.47 OHT PMP, IQR [0.12, 0.95], p=0.002). Figure.1 features changes in OHT volumes after COVID-19 around the world. Conclusion In a representative sample of countries around the world, OHT volumes decreased significantly during the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic in most, but not all countries around the world.

Terrorist attacks can affect both demand for and provision of health care services and often places a unique burden on first responders, hospitals, and health systems. This study aims to provide an epidemiological description of all terrorism-related attacks in the Middle East sustained from 1970-2019. METHODS: Data collection was performed using a retrospective database search through the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). The GTD was searched using the internal database search functions for all events which occurred in Iraq, Yemen, Turkey, Egypt, Syria, West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel, Lebanon, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, North Yemen, Qatar, and South Yemen from January 1, 1970 - December 31, 2019. Primary weapon type, primary target type, country where the incident occurred, and number of deaths and injuries were collated and the results analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 41,837 attacks occurred in the Middle East from 1970-2019 accounting for 24.9% of all terrorist attacks around the world. A total of 100,446 deaths were recorded with 187,447 non-fatal injuries. Fifty-six percent of all attacks in the region occurred in Iraq (23,426), 9.4% in Yemen (3,929), and 8.2% in Turkey (3,428). \\"Private Citizens and Properties\\" were targeted in 37.6% (15,735) of attacks, 15.4% (6,423) targeted \\"Police,\\" 9.6% targeted \\"Businesses\\" (4,012), and 9.6% targeted \\"Governments\\" (4,001). Explosives were used in 68.4% of attacks (28,607), followed by firearms in 20.4% of attacks (8,525). CONCLUSION: Despite a decline in terrorist attacks from a peak in 2014, terrorist events remain an important cause of death and injuries around the world, particularly in the Middle East where 24.9% of historic attacks took place. While MENA countries are often clustered together by economic and academic organizations based on geographical, political, and cultural similarities, there are significant differences in terrorist events between countries within the region. This is likely a reflection of the complexities of the intricate interplay between politics, culture, security, and intelligence services unique to each country.","output":"Terrorist Attacks in the Middle East: A Counter-Terrorism Medicine Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this issue of the American Journal of Transplantation, two articles highlight recent COVID-19 vaccine mandates for transplant recipients.1,2 As a heart transplant recipient of nearly 34 years, I am decidedly in favor of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for all organ transplant candidates and healthcare workers.

This study compared the prognostic factors and treatment effectiveness of GKRS and EVT for different CSDAVF types. METHODS The charts of 200 patients undergoing GKRS and 105 patients undergoing EVT were reviewed for data on symptoms (e.g. orbital, cavernous, ocular, and cerebral). The CSDAVFs were classified into proliferative, restrictive, and late restrictive types. The prognostic factors for complete obliteration (CO) were evaluated in both the GKRS and EVT groups and the latent period to CO was measured. For statistical analysis 2-tests were used to compare final CO rates for EVT and GKRS across the three CSDAVF types. RESULTS The EVT and cavernous symptoms were significant independent predictors of CO. The CO rate after EVT (97.9%) was significantly higher than that after GKRS (63.5%) for restrictive CSDAVFs (P < 0.001) but not for proliferative or late restrictive types. In the GKRS group, cavernous symptoms (hazard ratio, HR: 0.557) and target volume (HR: 0.853) predicted CO, but only target volume remained significant in multivariate analysis. In the EVT group, the latent period to CO was shortest for restrictive CSDAVFs (3.2  1.6 months, P = 0.05). CONCLUSION Angioarchitecture did not affect treatment outcomes. Cavernous symptoms were strongly associated with lower complete obliteration rates in the GKRS but not the EVT group. The EVT method remains the treatment of choice, especially for restrictive CSDAVFs; however, compared to EVT, GKRS had lower complication rates and similar therapeutic effects for proliferative type fistulas.","output":"Treatment Outcomes of Cavernous Sinus Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas: Comparison of Radiosurgery and Endovascular Embolisation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Evaluation of the usefulness and the parental opinion about teleconsultation (TC) for rare pediatric epilepsies.

RESULTS We included 151 TCs (145 patients) among the 259 epilepsy TCs done during the study period. The parental questionnaire has been answered 105 times. The physicians felt confident to organize a TC for the next visit of 74.8% of the children, but some limits were identified such as the absence of physical examination, weight, and psychomotor development evaluation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield of bacteriological tests, including blood and sputum cultures, and the association of multiple biomarkers and the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) with clinical and microbiological outcomes in patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This is a substudy of a large observational cohort study (PredictED study). The PredictED included adult patients from whom a blood culture was drawn at the ED of Haga Teaching Hospital, The Netherlands. For this substudy, all patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in March and April 2020 were included. The primary outcome was the incidence of bacterial coinfection. We used logistic regression analysis for associations of procalcitonin, C reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lymphocyte count and PSI score with a severe disease course, defined as intensive care unit admission and/or 30-day mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) quantified the discriminatory performance. RESULTS: We included 142 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. On presentation, the median duration of symptoms was 8 days. 41 (29%) patients had a severe disease course and 24 (17%) died within 30 days. The incidence of bacterial coinfection was 2/142 (1.4%). None of the blood cultures showed pathogen growth while 6.3% was contaminated. The AUCs for predicting severe disease were 0.76 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.84), 0.70 (0.61 to 0.79), 0.62 (0.51 to 0.74), 0.62 (0.51 to 0.72) and 0.72 (0.63 to 0.81) for procalcitonin, CRP, ferritin, lymphocyte count and PSI score, respectively.

Hence, identification of SES zones in thirty-eight sub-basins (SB) for basin prioritization is necessary. The present research addressed the issue by using four multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models: VlseKriterijumska optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), simple additive weighing (SAW), compound factor (CF). To determine the best fitted method from MCDM for erosion susceptibility (ES), a comparison has been made with Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), where fifteen morphometric parameters were considered for MCDM, and meteorological data, soil, slope and land use land cover (LULC) were considered for SWAT model. Two validation indices of percentage change and intensity change were used for evaluation and comparison of MCDM results. With SWAT model performance, SWAT calibration and uncertainty analysis programs (CUP) was used for sensitive analysis of SWAT parameters on flow discharge and sediment load simulation. The results showed that 23, 16, 18 SB have high ES; therefore they were given 1 to 3 ranks, whereas 31, 37, 21SB have low ES, hence given 38 to 36 rank as predicted by MCDM methods and SWAT. MCDM validation results depict that VIKOR and CF methods are more acceptable than TOPSIS and SAW. Calibration (flow discharge R2 0.86, NSE 0.75; sediment load R2 0.87, NSE 0.69) and validation (flow discharge R2 0.79, NSE 0.55; sediment load R2 0.79, NSE 0.76) of SWAT model indicated that simulated results are well fitted with observed data. Therefore, VIKOR reflects the significant role of morphometric parameters on ES, whereas SWAT reflects the significant role of LULC, slope, and soil on ES. However, it could be concluded that VIKOR is more effective MCDM method in comparison to SWAT prediction.","output":"Sub-basin prioritization for assessment of soil erosion susceptibility in Kangsabati, a plateau basin: A comparison between MCDM and SWAT models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neuropsychological assessment involves the comprehensive evaluation of intellectual, attentional, executive, social-cognitive, language, and motor functioning.

We designed and administered a global survey to examine the impact of COVID-19 on vascular surgeons. We describe the impact of the pandemic on the practices of Vascular Surgeons in the United States. METHODS: The Pandemic Practice, Anxiety, Coping, and Support Survey for Vascular Surgeons is an anonymous cross-sectional survey sponsored by the Society for Vascular Surgery Wellness Task Force disseminated April 14-24, 2020. This analysis focuses on pattern changes in vascular surgery practices in the United States including the inpatient setting, ambulatory, and vascular laboratory setting. Specific questions regarding occupational exposure to COVID-19, adequacy of personal protective equipment (PPE), elective surgical practice, changes in call schedule, and redeployment to non-vascular surgery duties were also included in the survey. Regional variation was assessed. The survey data were collected using REDCap and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 535 vascular surgeons responded to the survey from 45 states. Most of the respondents were male (73.1%), White (70.7%), practiced in urban settings (81.7%), and in teaching hospitals (66.8%). Almost half were in hospitals with greater than 400 beds (46.4%). There was no regional variation in the presence of pre-operative COVID-19 testing, COVID-19 OR protocols, adherence to national surgical standards, and the presence of PPE. The overwhelming majority of respondents (91.7%) noted elective surgery cancellation, with the Northeast and Southeast regions having the most case cancellations 94.2% and 95.8% respectively %). The Northeast region reported the highest percentage of operations/procedures on patients with COVID-19, which was either identified at the time of the surgery or later in the hospital course (82.7%). Ambulatory visits were performed via telehealth (81.3%), with 71.1% having restricted hours. Over half of OBLs were closed, although there was regional variation with over 80% in the Midwest being closed. Cases performed in OBLs focused on critical limb ischemia (42.9%) and dialysis access maintenance (39.9%). Call schedules modifications were common, although the number of call days remained the same (45.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Vascular surgeons in the United States report substantial impact on their practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, and regional variations are demonstrated - particularly in OBL utilization, ICU bed availability, and COVID-19 exposure at work.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgery practice in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: International studies point to increased mental health problems of medical staff during the Corona pandemic (COVID 19) This is the first study to investigate mental health, i e adjustment disorder, depression, stress symptoms, Corona related fears as well as coping mechanisms in this group in a German-speaking country Material and methods: In April 2020, N = 100 subjects were recruited that currently are engaged in a hospital A series of standardized assessments were included: adjustment disorder (ADNM-20), depression (PHQ-9), stress symptoms and coping strategies (SCI) Currently, cross-sectional data are analyzed, because the study is still going on and longitudinal data is not yet assessed Results: Frequencies of adjustment disorder and depression are 8 and 15 %, respectively Two hierarchical regression models were run to predict adjustment disorder and depression;predictive power was higher for the first (41 vs 35 %) Fear of infection was reported to be higher regarding one's family than oneself Nursing staff, those with preloads, and women were found to report more mental health problems Those with direct contact to people that fell ill with COVID 19 did not differ from those with no direct contact Discussion: Currently, medical staff has a high risk for being mentally stressed China, being epidemically experienced, has published principles for psychiatric interventions in January 2020 This might be relevant for Switzerland, too Specific psychotherapeutic interventions, targeting at cognitive restructuring and sensitizing regarding dealing with alcohol and cigarettes, may be needed in order to protect this vulnerable group of person during and after the Corona pandemic (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (German) Einleitung: Studien aus dem internationalen Raum weisen auf eine erhohte psychische Belastung des Klinikpersonals wahrend der Corona Pandemie (COVID-19) hin Dies ist die erste Studie, die psychische Belastung, i e Anpassungsstorung, Depression, Stresssymptome und Corona bezogene Sorgen, sowie Bewaltigungsstrategien in dieser Personengruppe im deutschen Sprachraum untersuchte Material und Methoden: Es wurden 100 Personen, die derzeit in einer Klinik beschaftigt sind, im April 2020 befragt Erhoben wurden Anpassungsstorung (ADNM-20), Depression (PHQ-9), Stresssymptome und Bewaltigungsstrategien (SCI) Vorliegend wurde der Querschnitt ausgewertet, die Datenerhebung lauft derzeit noch, es werden Langsschnittdaten uber 15 Monate hinweg entstehen Ergebnisse: Die Haufigkeit von Anpassungsstorung betragt 8% und diejenige von Depression 15% Ein Modell zur Vorhersage beider Storungen durch Vorbelastungen und aktuelle Belastungen fand eine geringfugig verbesserte bessere Vorhersageleistung fur Anpassungsstorung (41% Varianzaufklarung) als fur Depression (35%) Die Ansteckungssorge fur die eigene Person fiel geringer aus als diejenige fur die Familie Personen aus der Pflege, Personen mit Vorbelastungen und Frauen sind am meisten belastet Personen mit direktem vs ohne direktem Kontakt mit COVID-19 Patient/innen unterschieden sich nicht Diskussion: Das Klinikpersonal ist derzeit psychisch belastet Das hinsichtlich Epidemie erfahrene China hat bereits im Januar 2020 erste Prinzipien fur psychiatrische Interventionen herausgegeben Solche durften fur die Schweiz ebenfalls sinnvoll sein Es bedarf spezifischer psychotherapeutischer Interventionen, insbesondere auf kognitive Umstrukturierung fokussierend und fur den Umgang mit Alkohol und Zigaretten sensibilisierend, um diese vulnerable und im Rahmen der Pandemie besonders wichtige Personengruppe zu schutzen (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Adjustment disorder, depression, stress symptoms, corona related anxieties and coping strategies during the corona pandemic (COVID-19) in Swiss medical staff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Introduction: There is an increasing literature describing neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection (MIS-N) and infants infected with SARS-CoV-2 who presented with a severe disease (MIS-C).

Here we show that IFN-I regulates co-inhibitory receptor expression on human T cells, inducing PD-1/TIM-3/LAG-3 while surprisingly inhibiting TIGIT expression. High-temporal-resolution mRNA profiling of IFN-I responses enabled the construction of dynamic transcriptional regulatory networks uncovering three temporal transcriptional waves. Perturbation of key transcription factors on human primary T cells revealed unique regulators that control expression of co-inhibitory receptors. We found that the dynamic IFN-I response in vitro closely mirrored T cell features with IFN-I linked acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in human, with high LAG3 and decreased TIGIT expression. Finally, our gene regulatory network identified SP140 as a key regulator for differential LAG3 and TIGIT expression, which were validated at the level of protein expression.

Additionally, 28 phytochemicals of MC and their competence on inhibiting cytochrome P450 (CYP: CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1) functions were resolved. In silico analysis of vitamin E and stigmasterol revealed that their binding to either CYP1A1 or CYP1A2 was more efficient than the binding of each positive control (alizarin or purpurin).

METHODS Data was analysed from the Chinese National Transgender Survey in 2017; the survey was distributed through community-based organizations to transgender adolescents and adults residing in China, with representation from all 32 provinces and autonomous regions. A total of 1293 youth that self-identified as transgender or gender queer completed the study. Measures covered psychopathological symptoms including depression, anxiety, risk of suicideand self-harm. Parental psychological abuse was assessed in terms of neglect and avoidance, force to change, and verbal insults. Both the edges and centralities were computed via network analysis, and the network properties were then compared among the three gender minority subgroups. In addition, linear regression was adopted to test the predictive ability of node centrality for low self-esteem. RESULTS Descriptive analysis revealed that among the three subgroups, transgender women had more severe psychopathological symptoms and reported the most psychological abuse. Network analysis revealed that the risk of suicide and self-harm was directly connected with one type of parental psychological abuse (\\"neglect and avoidance\\").

METHODS We used the TriNetX platform to analyze 20 health care institutions that have relevant, up-to-date encounter data. Using this COVID and Cancer Research Network (CCRN), we compared cancer cohorts identified by querying encounter data pre-COVID (January 2019-April 2019) and current (January 2020-April 2020). Cohorts were generated for all patients with neoplasms (malignant, benign, in situ, and of unspecified behavior), with new incidence neoplasms (first encounter), with exclusively malignant neoplasms, and with new incidence malignant neoplasms. Data from a UK institution were similarly analyzed. Additional analyses were performed on patients with selected cancers, as well as on those having had cancer screening. RESULTS Clear trends were identified that suggest a significant decline in all current cohorts explored, with April 2020 displaying the largest decrease in the number of patients with cancer having encounters. Of the cancer types analyzed, lung, colorectal, and hematologic cancer cohorts exhibited smaller decreases in size in April 2020 versus 2019 (-39.1%, -39.9%, -39.1%, respectively) compared with cohort size decreases for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma (-47.7%, -49.1%, -51.8%, respectively). In addition, cancer screenings declined drastically, with breast cancer screenings dropping by -89.2% and colorectal cancer screenings by -84.5%. CONCLUSION Trends seen in the CCRN clearly suggest a significant decrease in all cancer-related patient encounters as a result of the pandemic. The steep decreases in cancer screening and patients with a new incidence of cancer suggest the possibility of a future increase in patients with later-stage cancer being seen initially as well as an increased demand for cancer screening procedures as delayed tests are rescheduled.","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cancer-Related Patient Encounters."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airborne infectious diseases such as the new Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pose serious threat to human health. Indoor air pollution is a problem of global environmental concern as well.

In this study, we found that commercially available filters typically deployed in air purifier and air conditioning units, when impregnated with Rose Bengal (RB) as a 1O2 sensitizer, can be used for heterogeneous gas-phase generation of 1O2. It was confirmed that irradiation of the RB filter under oxygen gas stream produced 1O2, which was measured using furfuryl alcohol trapping method followed by HPLC analysis. It was also observed that the amount of 1O2 generated increases as the light intensity increased. Similarly, the sensitizer loading also positively influenced the 1O2 generation. The heterogeneous gas-phase generation of 1O2 can find potential applications in air purifier and air conditioning units for the purpose of bacteria/virus inactivation and/or pollutant degradation thereby improving indoor air quality.","output":"A simple, inexpensive method for gas-phase singlet oxygen generation from sensitizer-impregnated filters: Potential application to bacteria/virus inactivation and pollutant degradation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emphasis of risk has been recognized as a crucial component to effective and successful policy compliance amidst crisis. Yet, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the dreadfulness of the risk may fluctuate with the severity of the prolonged pandemic, and the nature of public health policy is not confined purely to public health concerns, perceived risk may not always lead to policy compliance. Two surveys (during almost zero case period and during the biggest outbreak) were conducted to examine the dichotomous role of perceived risk and perceived susceptibility in influencing policy compliance in Hong Kong. Although policy compliance increases with the scale of the outbreak, results from path analysis showed that perceived susceptibility and perceived severity have an indirect role in policy complying behaviour when the objective risk is low. Risk variables, such as attitude, knowledge, benefit and trust, have directly shaped policy compliance. More importantly, perceived severity of COVID-19 boosts policy compliance but perceived susceptibility was associated with disobedience to public health policy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong citizens have a selective and conscious preference in regard to the stringency of public health policy: they welcome more law and order, with increasing magnitude of penalty, but reject lockdown measures such as curfew. Regression results implied that demography had a mild contribution to public health policy stringency, with only the female gender being statistically related to higher policy acceptance. This study calls for further reflection on the role of risk, especially perceived susceptibility, in mobilizing policy compliance to COVID-19 related measures.","output":"Risk perception as a double-edged sword in policy compliance in COVID-19 pandemic?

It is appreciated as a tecton for the rational design of new bio-active substances. Herein, we present a short overview of the subject. We analyzed 2366 proline-derived structures deposited in the Cambridge Structure Database, with emphasis on the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The latter are the first-line antihypertensive and cardiological drugs. Their side effects prompt a search for improved pharmaceuticals. Characterization of tectons (molecular building blocks) and the resulting supramolecular synthons (patterns of intermolecular interactions) involving proline derivatives, as presented in this study, may be useful for in silico molecular docking and macromolecular modeling studies. The DFT, Hirshfeld surface and energy framework methods gave considerable insight into the nature of close inter-contacts and supramolecular topology. Substituents of proline entity are important for the formation and cooperation of synthons. Tectonic subunits contain proline moieties characterized by diverse ionization states: -N and -COOH(-COO(?)), -N(+) and -COOH(-COO(?)), -NH and -COOH(-COO(?)), -NH(+) and -COOH(-COO(?)), and -NH(2)(+) and -COOH(-COO(?)).

However, in order to distinguish the difference between the measurement matrices, the CS imaging system needs to have a higher signal sampling accuracy.

We propose a dual-optical imaging system that uses the bidirectional reflection characteristics of digital micromirror devices (DMD) to simultaneously acquire CS measurements and images under the same viewing angle. Since deep neural networks have powerful modeling capabilities, we trained the filter network and the reconstruction network separately. The filter network is used to filter the noise in the measurements, and the reconstruction network is used to reconstruct the CS image. Experiments have proved that the method we proposed can filter the noise in the sampling process of the CS system, and can significantly improve the quality of image reconstruction under a variety of algorithms.","output":"Dual Optical Path Based Adaptive Compressive Sensing Imaging System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence and widespread circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) or interest (VOI) imposes an enhanced threat to global public health. In Brazil, one of the countries most severely impacted throughout the pandemic, a complex dynamics involving variants co-circulation and turnover events has been recorded with the emergence and spread of VOC Gamma in Manaus in late 2020. In this context, we present a genomic epidemiology investigation based on samples collected between December 2020 and May 2021 in the second major Brazilian metropolis, Rio de Janeiro. By sequencing 244 novel genomes through all epidemiological weeks in this period, we were able to document the introduction and rapid dissemination of VOC Gamma in the city, driving the rise of the third local epidemic wave. Molecular clock analysis indicates this variant has circulated locally since the first weeks of 2021 and only seven weeks were necessary for it to achieve a frequency above 70%, consistent with rates of growth observed in Manaus and other states. Moreover, a Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction indicates VOC Gamma spread throughout Brazil between December 2020 and January 2021, and that it was introduced in Rio de Janeiro through at least 13 events coming from nearly all regions of the country. Comparative analysis of RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values provides further evidence that VOC Gamma induces higher viral loads (N1 target; mean reduction of Ct: 2.7, 95% CI = {+/-}0.7). This analysis corroborates the previously proposed mechanistic basis for this variant enhanced transmissibility and distinguished epidemiological behavior. Our results document the evolution of VOC Gamma and provide independent assessment of scenarios previously studied in Manaus, therefore contributing to the better understanding of the epidemiological dynamics currently being surveyed in other Brazilian regions.","output":"Epidemiological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 VOC Gamma in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with type-2 diabetes (T2D) are at increased risk for hospital admissions, and acute hospitalizations are associated with a worse prognosis. However, outcomes related to all-cause hospital admissions (ACHA) were often overlooked in the trials that demonstrated the cardiovascular and kidney benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). This review includes a contemporary literature summary of emerging data regarding the effects of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs on ACHA. SGLT2i role in preventing ACHA was shown in exploratory investigations of several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and was further supported by real-world evidence (RWE). However, the association between GLP-1 RAs use and lower ACHA risk was mainly shown with RWE, with minimal available RCTs data. The manuscript also discusses the advantages and challenges of studying ACHA. Finally, it proposes an easily memorized ('ABCDE' acronym) clinical approach to evaluating T2D status and treatment in admitted patients, as they transition from hospital to community care. This systematic approach may assist clinicians in recognizing possible pitfalls in T2D management, thereby preventing subsequent hospitalizations and improving patients' prognoses. While acute admission can sometimes be perceived as a management failure, it should also be viewed as an opportunity to take action to prevent the next hospitalization.

We collected data from web pages presenting vaccination information. We assessed whether web pages presented medical misinformation, had an overarching gist, used narrative, and employed emotional appeals. We used Search Engine Optimization tools to determine the number of backlinks from other web pages, monthly Google traffic, and Google Keywords. We used Coh-Metrix to measure readability and Gist Inference Scores (GIS). For medical misinformation web pages, Google traffic and backlinks were heavily skewed with means of 138.8 visitors/month and 805 backlinks per page. Medical misinformation pages were significantly more likely than other vaccine pages to have backlinks from other pages, and significantly less likely to receive at least one visitor from Google searches per month. The top Google searches leading to medical misinformation were the truth about vaccinations, dangers of vaccination, and pro con vaccines. Most frequently, pages challenged vaccine safety, with 32.7% having an overarching gist, 7.7% presenting narratives, and 17.3% making emotional appeals.

We therefore assessed seroprevalence and identified risk factors for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) seropositivity in this population. METHODS: Between June 22nd and August 15th 2020, HCW from institutions in Northern/Eastern Switzerland were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We recorded baseline characteristics, non-occupational and occupational risk factors. We used pairwise tests of associations and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with seropositivity. RESULTS: Among 4'664 HCW from 23 healthcare facilities, 139 (3%) were seropositive. Non-occupational exposures independently associated with seropositivity were contact with a COVID-19-positive household (adjusted OR=59, 95%-CI: 33-106), stay in a COVID-19 hotspot (aOR=2.3, 95%-CI: 1.2-4.2), and male sex (aOR=1.9, 95%-CI: 1.1-3.1). Blood group 0 vs. non-0 (aOR=0.5, 95%-CI: 0.3-0.8), active smoking (aOR=0.4, 95%-CI: 0.2-0.7), living with children <12 years (aOR=0.3, 95%-CI: 0.2-0.6), and being a physician (aOR 0.2, 95%-CI: 0.1-0.5) were associated with decreased risk. Other occupational risk factors were close contact to COVID-19 patients (aOR=2.7, 95%-CI: 1.4-5.4), exposure to COVID-19-positive co-workers (aOR=1.9, 95%-CI: 1.1-2.9), poor knowledge of standard hygiene precautions (aOR=1.9, 95%-CI: 1.2-2.9), and frequent visits to the hospital canteen (aOR=2.3, 95%-CI: 1.4-3.8). CONCLUSIONS: Living with COVID-19-positive households showed the strongest association with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. We identified several potentially modifiable work-related risk factors, which might allow mitigation of the COVID-19 risk among HCW. The lower risk among those living with children, even after correction for multiple confounders, is remarkable and merits further study.","output":"Non-occupational and occupational factors associated with specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among hospital workers - A multicentre cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Driven by flexibility, precision, repeatability and eco-friendliness, laser-based technologies have attracted great interest to engineer or to analyze materials in various fields including energy, environment, biology and medicine.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting incidence, mortality and risk factors for AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We systematically searched 11 electronic databases until 29 May 2020 for studies in English reporting original data on AKI and kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Incidences of AKI and KRT and risk ratios for mortality associated with AKI were pooled using generalized linear mixed and random-effects models. Potential risk factors for AKI were assessed using meta-regression. Incidences were stratified by geographic location and disease severity. RESULTS: A total of 3042 articles were identified, of which 142 studies were included, with 49 048 hospitalized COVID-19 patients including 5152 AKI events. The risk of bias of included studies was generally low. The pooled incidence of AKI was 28.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.8C39.5] among hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the USA and Europe (20 studies) and 5.5% (95% CI 4.1C7.4) among patients from China (62 studies), whereas the pooled incidence of KRT was 7.7% (95% CI 5.1C11.4; 18 studies) and 2.2% (95% CI 1.5C3.3; 52 studies), respectively. Among patients admitted to the intensive care unit, the incidence of KRT was 20.6% (95% CI 15.7C26.7; 38 studies). Meta-regression analyses showed that age, male sex, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and chronic kidney disease were associated with the occurrence of AKI; in itself, AKI was associated with an increased risk of mortality, with a pooled risk ratio of 4.6 (95% CI 3.3C6.5).

However, recommendations and possibilities for vaccination for pregnant and breastfeeding women are inconsistent and dynamically changing. METHODS: An anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey was conducted among pregnant and breastfeeding women in Germany between 30th March and 19th April 2021 addressing COVID-19 vaccination attitudes including the underlying reasons for their decision. Additionally, anxiety regarding a SARS-CoV-2 infection and a symptomatic course of the infection were evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 2339 women (n = 1043 pregnant and n = 1296 breastfeeding) completed the survey. During pregnancy the majority (57.4%) are not in favour of receiving the vaccine, 28.8% are unsure and only 13.8% would get vaccinated at the time of the survey. In contrast, 47.2% would be in favour to receive the vaccine, if more scientific evidence on the safety of the vaccination during pregnancy would be available. Breastfeeding women show higher vaccination willingness (39.5% are in favour, 28.1% are unsure and 32.5% not in favour). The willingness to be vaccinated is significantly related to the womens anxiety levels of getting infected and to develop disease symptoms. Main reasons for vaccination hesitancy are the womens perception of limited vaccination-specific information, limited scientific evidence on vaccination safety and the fear to harm the fetus or infant.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective, observational study. SETTING Outpatient clinic of a Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and research institute in an academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS Individuals with chronic ( 1 year from injury) SCI and uninjured individuals. OUTCOME MEASURES Serum antibody titers were determined by commercial multiplex ELISA. RESULTS Blood samples were collected from individuals with chronic SCI (N = 29, 83% males) and uninjured individuals (N = 25, 64% males). Among participants with SCI, the distribution of American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grades was: A (n = 15), B (n = 2), C (n = 4), D (n = 8). Neurological levels of injury were: cervical (n = 17), thoracic (n = 10), and lumbar (n = 2). IgA levels were significantly elevated in participants with SCI compared to uninjured participants (median: 1.98 vs. 1.21 mg/ml, P < 0.0001), with levels most elevated in individuals with motor complete injuries compared to uninjured participants (P < 0.0003). IgG2 antibodies were also significantly elevated in participants with SCI compared to uninjured participants (median: 5.98 vs. 4.37 mg/ml, P < 0.018). CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of elevated IgA, the antibody type most prevalent at respiratory, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, common sites of infections in individuals with SCI. IgG2 levels were also elevated in individuals with SCI. These data support further investigations of IgA and other antibody types in individuals with chronic SCI, which may be increasingly important in the context of emerging novel infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Elevated levels of IgA and IgG2 in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory disease that was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and has since spread around the globe, claiming more than 69,000 lives by the time this protocol is written.

We propose a mathematical model that predicts the dynamics of COVID-19 in 17 provinces of India and the overall India. A complete scenario is given to demonstrate the estimated pandemic life cycle along with the real data or history to date, which in turn divulges the predicted inflection point and ending phase of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed model monitors the dynamics of six compartments, namely susceptible (S), asymptomatic (A), recovered (R), infected (I), isolated infected (I(q)) and quarantined susceptible (S(q)), collectively expressed SARII(q)S(q). A sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the robustness of model predictions to parameter values and the sensitive parameters are estimated from the real data on the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Our results reveal that achieving a reduction in the contact rate between uninfected and infected individuals by quarantined the susceptible individuals, can effectively reduce the basic reproduction number.

We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 scales to assess depression and anxiety symptoms. We adapted the U.S. Department of Agriculture six-question scale to assess household food insecurity. RESULTS: Nearly 20% of study participants reported symptoms of depression and 15% reported symptoms of anxiety. Six percent reported increasing an increase in their substance use and 37% experienced food insecurity during the pandemic. Depression and anxiety symptoms were more frequent among women or those who had experienced 1 recent COVID-19 related symptom, but less frequent among those who were married and/or worked in the fields. Increased substance use was more common among farmworkers who had 1 COVID-19 related symptom, but less common among women and those who spoke a language other than English at home, were born outside the U.S., or lived in crowded housing.

Communication and interaction between different host cells at the early stage of viral infections determine the quality and magnitude of immune responses against the invading virus. The release of membrane-encapsulated extracellular vesicles (EVs), from host cells, is defined as a refined system of cell-to-cell communication. EVs contain a diverse array of biomolecules, including microRNAs (miRNAs). We hypothesized that the activation of the tracheal cells with different stimuli impacts the cellular and EV miRNA profiles. Chicken tracheal rings were stimulated with polyI:C and LPS from Escherichia coli 026:B6 or infected with low pathogenic avian influenza virus H4N6. Subsequently, miRNAs were isolated from chicken tracheal cells or from EVs released from chicken tracheal cells. Differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified in treated groups when compared to the control group.

Technique-specific data captured from videos and a questionnaire included bougie size, stapler vendor, number of staple loads, use of staple line reinforcement, fibrin sealant, intraoperative leak test, endoscopy, and drain placement. Surgeon-specific outcomes were obtained from cases performed by surgeons during the study period (n = 7023) using a state-wide bariatric-specific data registry. Surgeons were ranked based on 30-day risk-adjusted surgical complication rates (\\"safety\\") and excess body weight loss (EBWL) % (\\"efficacy\\") at 1 year after surgery. Technique-specific variables were compared between surgeons ranked in the top and bottom quartile for both safety and efficacy. RESULTS Surgical complication rates ranged from 0 to 4.32% while EBWL varied from 45.3 to 65.3%. There was no correlation between surgeon rankings for safety and efficacy (Pearson's r = 0.063, p = 0.741). Surgeons ranked in the top quartile for safety and efficacy had significantly shorter mean operative times than surgeons ranked in the bottom quartile (65 min vs. 69 min, p < 0.0001).

However, observational studies point to low acceptance in most countries, and few studies have yet examined theory-based predictors of app use in the general population to guide health communication efforts. OBJECTIVE: This study utilizes established health behavior change and technology acceptance models to predict adoption intentions and frequency of current app use. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey between May and July 2020 in a German convenience sample (N=349; mean age 35.62 years; n=226, 65.3% female). To inspect the incremental validity of model constructs as well as additional variables (privacy concerns, personalization), hierarchical regression models were applied, controlling for covariates. RESULTS: The theory of planned behavior and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology predicted adoption intentions (R2=56%-63%) and frequency of current app use (R2=33%-37%). A combined model only marginally increased the predictive value by about 5%, but lower privacy concerns and higher threat appraisals (ie, anticipatory anxiety) significantly predicted app use when included as additional variables. Moreover, the impact of perceived usefulness was positive for adoption intentions but negative for frequency of current app use. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several theory-based predictors of contact tracing app use. However, few constructs, such as social norms, have a consistent positive effect across models and outcomes. Further research is required to replicate these observations, and to examine the interconnectedness of these constructs and their impact throughout the pandemic.

OBJECTIVES: The study was aimed to reveal and compare the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among patient-facing HCWs across 3 dental clinics equipped with different types of aspirating systems. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 157 HCWs (43.58  1.66 y) from 3 dental clinics in Ekaterinburg (Russian Federation) who reported to work during the coronavirus disease pandemic. All HCWs underwent serological testing once a week to detect immunoglobulin G and M antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2. The V6000 aspirating system with a vacuum controller (dry or semidry mode) and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters was used at clinics A and B, and the aspirated aerosol and air were evacuated and dissipated into the atmosphere. The VS900 aspirating vacuum pump without HEPA filters was used at clinic C. The aspirated aerosol and air were evacuated and dissipated into the operatories. All dental clinics followed the same recommendations for dental patient management and types of personal protective equipment used. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.5% (19 HCWs) over a 5-mo follow-up (May to August 2020). The prevalence of infection was unaffected by sex or the role of the member in the dental team (dentist/dental assistant).

CONCLUSION: The type of aspirating system used and the presence of HEPA filters could affect the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection across dental clinics. Therefore, we recommend the use of aspirating systems installed with HEPA filters, which evacuate and dissipate aerosols into specialized areas.

It is unclear how the changes in effort affected physicians' personal well-being, particularly burnout. This study sought to identify changes in faculty's clinical, teaching, research, and administrative efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic and how effort shifts were associated with burnout. We also examined associations with important demographics and burnout. METHODS We took data from the 2020 Council of Academic Family Medicine's Educational Research Alliance survey of family medicine educators and practicing physicians during November 2020 through December 2020. We analyzed self-report measures of demographics, effort (clinical, teaching, research, and administrative) before and during the pandemic, COVID-19 exposure level, and rates of burnout (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization) using logistic regressions. RESULTS Most participants reported no change in efforts. If changes were reported, clinical (21.6%) and administrative (24.8%) efforts tended to increase from before to during the pandemic, while teaching tended to decrease (27.7%). Increases in teaching and clinical efforts were associated with higher rates of emotional exhaustion. Higher depersonalization was associated with increased clinical efforts. Being older and working in a rural setting was associated with lower burnout, while being female was associated with higher burnout. CONCLUSIONS Shifts in effort across academic family physicians' multiple roles were associated with emotional exhaustion and, to a lesser degree, depersonalization.

Recently, toxicant exposure has been reported to result in poorer health outcomes of (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Thus, we hypothesized that co-exposure to toxicants and SARS-CoV-2 will cause greater BBB disruption than exposure to toxicants or SARS-CoV-2 alone. BBB permeability was assessed in vitro by measuring transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER; ohms cm2 ) of a monolayer of primary adult human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). Cells were allowed to form a confluent monolayer on a 96-well plate outfitted with circuit electrodes. Cells were treated with BaP (2, 10, and 50 uM), TCDD (1.5, 15, and 150 nM), PFOS (3, 30, and 300 uM), or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP; 0.1, 1, and 10 nM). In experiments to test the synergistic effects of toxicants and SP, cells were treated with toxicants, then immediately were treated with SP (10 nM). Cell viability was assessed 24 hours after treatment using Cell Proliferation Kit I (Roche Diagnostics, Inc). Gene expression of tight junction protein 1 (TJP1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was measured by RT-qPCR. One- and two-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak post-hoc comparisons were performed to detect differences in TEER (resistance, ohms cm2 ) and cell viability (absorbance, nm). T-tests were performed to compare RT-qPCR data. Statistical significance was reached at p < 0.05. Technical triplicates were averaged on 4 different days to obtain N = 4/group. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein did not significantly affect the resistance or leakiness of the monolayer of hBMECs at any of the concentrations tested. However, when hBMECs were treated with SP (10 nM) in conjunction with BaP or PFOS, TEER was significantly reduced beyond treatment with the toxicants alone. When compared to BaP treatment alone, SP significantly lowered TEER in hBMECs treated with 10 uM or 50 uM of BaP at 9 to 24 hours after treatment (Holm-Sidak, t's > 2.507, p's < 0.04), indicating a synergistic effect of SP and BaP in increasing leakiness of the hBMEC barrier. Similarly, SP caused a significant reduction in TEER of hBMECs treated with 3 uM PFOS starting at 15 hours post treatment when compared to PFOS treatment alone (Holm-Sidak, t's > 2.273, p's < 0.04). TEER of TCDD-treated hBMECs were not affected by SP treatment. At 24 hours after treatment, cell viability and expression of VCAM-1 and TJP1 were not altered by treatment by SP alone, nor did SP affect cell viability or gene expression of toxicant-treated hBMECs. These results suggest that disruption of the hBMEC monolayer was not due to cell death, or expression levels of VCAM-1 and TJP1. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the synergistic effects of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and environmental toxicants in an in vitro model of the BBB.

Wounds can be a source of infection by allowing unconstrained entry of microorganisms into the body, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. The development of new antimicrobials (particularly antibiotics) is not keeping pace with the evolution of resistant microorganisms and novel ways of addressing this problem are urgently required. One such initiative has been the development of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes, which educate healthcare workers, and control the prescribing and targeting of antimicrobials to reduce the likelihood of AMR. Of great importance has been the European Wound Management Association (EWMA) in supporting AMS by providing practical recommendations for optimising antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of wound infection. The use of wound dressings that use a physical sequestration and retention approach rather than antimicrobial agents to reduce bacterial burden offers a novel approach that supports AMS. Bacterial-binding by dressings and their physical removal, rather than active killing, minimises their damage and hence prevents the release of damaging endotoxins. AIM Our objective is to highlight AMS for the promotion of the judicious use of antimicrobials and to investigate how dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC)-coated dressings can support AMS goals. METHOD MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Google Scholar were searched to identify published articles describing data relating to AMS, and the use of a variety of wound dressings in the prevention and/or treatment of wound infections. The evidence supporting alternative wound dressings that can reduce bioburden and prevent and/or treat wound infection in a manner that does not kill or damage the microorganisms (for example, by actively binding and removing intact microorganisms from wounds) were then narratively reviewed. RESULTS The evidence reviewed here demonstrates that using bacterial-binding wound dressings that act in a physical manner (for example, DACC-coated dressings) as an alternative approach to preventing and/or treating infection in both acute and hard-to-heal wounds does not exacerbate AMR and supports AMS. CONCLUSION Some wound dressings work via a mechanism that promotes the binding and physical uptake, sequestration and removal of intact microorganisms from the wound bed (for example, a wound dressing that uses DACC technology to successfully prevent/reduce infection). They provide a valuable tool that aligns with the requirements of AMS (for example, reducing the use of antimicrobials in wound treatment regimens) by effectively reducing wound bioburden without inducing/selecting for resistant bacteria.","output":"Antimicrobial stewardship strategies in wound care: evidence to support the use of dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC)- coated wound dressings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Furthermore, phage may play a role in the survival and metabolic capabilities of indoor bacteria, for example aerobic methane oxidation (Chen et al., 2020) and antibiotic resistance (Zhang and Buckling, 2012).

A key research focus is in predicting the development trend of COVID-19 scientifically through mathematical modelling. We conducted a systematic review of epidemic prediction models of COVID-19 and the public health intervention strategies by searching the Web of Science database. 55 studies of the COVID-19 epidemic model were reviewed systematically. It was found that the COVID-19 epidemic models were different in the model type, acquisition method, hypothesis and distribution of key input parameters. Most studies used the gamma distribution to describe the key time period of COVID-19 infection, and some studies used the lognormal distribution, the Erlang distribution, and the Weibull distribution. The setting ranges of the incubation period, serial interval, infectious period and generation time were 4.9C7 days, 4.41C8.4 days, 2.3C10 days and 4.4C7.5 days, respectively, and more than half of the incubation periods were set to 5.1 or 5.2 days. Most models assumed that the latent period was consistent with the incubation period. Some models assumed that asymptomatic infections were infectious or pre-symptomatic transmission was possible, which overestimated the value of R0. For the prediction differences under different public health strategies, the most significant effect was in travel restrictions. There were different studies on the impact of contact tracking and social isolation, but it was considered that improving the quarantine rate and reporting rate, and the use of protective face mask were essential for epidemic prevention and control. The input epidemiological parameters of the prediction models had significant differences in the prediction of the severity of the epidemic spread.

Recently, drugs targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway raised new hopes. CGRP, a potent vasodilator, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of migraine attacks. The deficiency of CGRP is involved in Raynauds phenomenon, which consists of abnormal vasoconstriction of the digits. We aimed to assess the potential association of Raynauds phenomenon with CGRP-targeting drugs, analyzing real-world data from the World Health Organization (VigiBase?). METHODS: We queried all reports of Raynauds phenomenon involving a CGRP-targeting drug. We sought disproportionate reporting of Raynauds phenomenon with these drugs. For this purpose, we relied on the calculation of the Information Component (IC). A positive lower end of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the IC defines a statistically significant association. As migraine patients are prone to Raynauds phenomenon, we also calculated the IC of Raynauds phenomenon with CGRP-targeting drugs compared to 5HT1(B/D) agonists (triptans), and beta-blockers used in the treatment of migraine. RESULTS: Overall, 99 reports of Raynauds phenomenon involving CGRP-targeting drugs have been yielded in VigiBase?. The most reported CGRP-targeting drug was erenumab, with 56 reports (56.6%). The median time to onset was 84 days. No fatality was notified, but one patient suffered from gangrene and extremity necrosis. As a whole, CGRP-targeting drugs were significantly associated with Raynauds phenomenon, with an IC of 3.3 (95%CI: 3.0C3.5). There was a disproportionate reporting of Raynauds phenomenon with CGRP-targeting drugs compared to triptans (IC 0.4; 95%CI: 0.1C0.6) and to beta-blockers (IC 0.5; 95%CI: 0.2C0.7) as well. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant disproportionality signal of Raynauds phenomenon with CGRP-targeting. This signal stands out when CGRP-targeting drugs are compared to other drugs used in patients with migraine. This study is limited by missing data in pharmacovigilance reports. CGRP-targeting drugs may be subject to Weber effect and reporting bias. Nonetheless, CGRP blockade might be the last straw that disrupts the physiological balance of vascular response in patients at-risk of Raynauds phenomenon. Pending further data regarding vascular safety of CGRP-targeting drugs, caution is warranted in these patients.","output":"Calcitonin gene-related peptide-targeting drugs and Raynauds phenomenon: a real-world potential safety signal from the WHO pharmacovigilance database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: In this study, we aimed to examine the risk perception of Chinese students studying in Germany, which is the country fifth-most affected by COVID-19 in the world, who wish to return to China.

RESULTS We included 16 case series and 12 case reports describing a total of 223 pregnant women and 201 infants. Four newborns born to mothers affected by COVID-19 were reported to have laboratory-confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection within 48 hours after birth. However, Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction tests of the breast milk, placenta, amniotic fluids, and cord blood and maternal vaginal secretions were all negative for SARS-CoV-2 in the reported cases. Fetal death was reported in two cases, and 48 of 185 newborns (25.9%) were born prematurely. Infants born small for gestational age and low birth weight (< 2,500 g) accounted for 8.3% and 15.6% of reported cases, respectively. Birth asphyxia and respiratory distress syndrome were observed in 1.8% and 6.4% of neonates, respectively. There was one neonatal death due to intractable gastric bleeding among the SARS-CoV-2-negative infants. CONCLUSIONS Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 during pregnancy rarely affects fetal and neonatal mortality, but can be associated with adverse neonatal morbidities.

The University of Arizona Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicines global wellness mobile app, My Wellness Coach (MWC), guides patients to improve their health and well-being through facilitating behavior changes. METHODS: Of the 30 patients enrolled in a 12-week intervention, 16 (53%) were retained through the final assessment. Feasibility was assessed by the ease of recruitment, participant adherence, and mobile app acceptability. App acceptability was measured using the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale. MPN symptom burden was measured at baseline and 12 weeks after the intervention. RESULTS: Recruitment was efficient, with the participant goal reached within a 60-day period, suggestive of a demand for such an intervention. Adherence was less than the target within study design (75%), although similar to mobile device app use in other studies (53%).

Modification of standards for pediatric emergency mass critical care should include incorporation of family-centered care principles. Family-centered care, which is an integral aspect of current pediatric practice, encourages active participation of the child's family in medical care delivery. While family-centered care should be practical in most disasters, whether we can operationalize it in pediatric emergency mass critical care is unknown. However, every effort to adhere to the principles should be made. This manuscript addresses some of the basic tensions that exist between creating efficient disaster-related standards and offering family-centered care by augmenting the concepts outlined elsewhere in the supplement with practical suggestions on incorporating family-centered care. In addition, this manuscript demonstrates how family-centered care benefits not only children and families, but also the staff providing care to pediatric patients in disasters. METHODS In May 2008, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care published guidance on provision of mass critical care to adults. Acknowledging that the critical care needs of children during disasters were unaddressed by this effort, a 17-member Steering Committee, assembled by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education with guidance from members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, convened in April 2009 to determine priority topic areas for pediatric emergency mass critical care recommendations.Steering Committee members established subgroups by topic area and performed literature reviews of MEDLINE and Ovid databases. The Steering Committee produced draft outlines through consensus-based study of the literature and convened October 6-7, 2009, in New York, NY, to review and revise each outline. Eight draft documents were subsequently developed from the revised outlines as well as through searches of MEDLINE updated through March 2010.The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts from diverse public health, medical, and disaster response fields, convened in Atlanta, GA, on March 29-30, 2010. Feedback on each manuscript was compiled and the Steering Committee revised each document to reflect expert input in addition to the most current medical literature. TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS This paper offers a list of practical suggestions for incorporating family-centered care principles into each of the following healthcare settings during a disaster, including a pediatric emergency mass critical care event: emergency medical services transport, emergency departments, pediatric intensive care units, general pediatric wards, and alternative sites. Disaster and pediatric emergency mass critical care responses must incorporate family-centered care principles to the extent possible in a variety of healthcare settings.","output":"Pediatric emergency mass critical care: focus on family-centered care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome -coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to become a long-lasting global health crisis. The number of people infected with the novel coronavirus has surpassed 22 million globally, resulting in over 700,000 deaths with more than 15 million people having recovered (https://covid19.who.int). Enormous efforts are underway for rapid vaccine and treatment developments. Amongst the many ways of tackling the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging. SUMMARY: EVs are lipid bilayer-enclosed structures secreted from all types of cells, including those lining the respiratory tract. They have established roles in lung immunity and are involved in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, including viral infection. In this review, we point out the roles and possible contribution of EVs in viral infections, as well as ongoing EV-based approaches for the treatment of COVID-19, including clinical trials. KEY MESSAGES: EVs share structural similarities to viruses and recent findings demonstrate that viruses exploit EVs for cellular exit and EVs exploit viral entry mechanisms for cargo delivery. Moreover, EV-virus interplay could be exploited for future antiviral drug and vaccine development. EV-based therapies, especially the mesenchymal stem cell-derived EVs, are being intensively studied for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 and Extracellular Vesicles: An Intriguing Interplay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We aimed to determine prognostic values of NEWS2 and laboratory parameters during the first week of COVID-19. Methods: All adult patients who were hospitalized for a confirmed COVID-19 between the 11th of March and the 11th of May 2020 were retrospectively included. To evaluate the factors in prognosis which are admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and in-hospital death, univariate logistic regression analysis was performed at admission (D0), at day-3 (D3), day-5 (D5), and day-7 (D7). Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed. Results: Overall, 611 patients were included. Clinical deterioration was observed in 79 (12.9%) patients during hospitalisation, 36 (5.9%) during the first three days, 54 (8.8%) during the first five days, and 62 (10.1%) during the first week of hospitalisation. Our results showed that NEWS2, procalcitonin, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and albumin were the best predictors for clinical deterioration at D0, D3, D5, and D7. Procalcitonin had the highest odds ratio for clinical deterioration on all days in univariate analysis. ROC analyses showed that NEWS2 at D7, procalcitonin at D5, albumin at D7, and NLR at D5 had highest AUC values. Additionally, we detected a strong correlation between NEWS2 and laboratory parameters including neutrophil, lymphocyte, NLR, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin, and urea on all days. Conclusion: This study provides a list of several laboratory parameters correlated with NEWS2 and potential predictors for ICU admission or in-hospital death during the clinical course of COVID-19. Dynamic monitoring of NEWS2 and laboratory parameters is vital for improving clinical outcomes.","output":"NEWS2 and laboratory predictors correlated with clinical deterioration in hospitalised patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multi-component grammars, known in the literature as multiple context-free grammars and linear context-free rewriting systems, describe the structure of a string by defining the properties of k-tuples of its substrings, in the same way as ordinary formal grammars (Chomskys context-free) define properties of substrings.

Purpose To evaluate the inter- and intraobserver variability of the Covid Visual Assessment Scale (Co.V.A.Sc.) used for stratifying chest CT disease extent and to estimate its prospect to predict clinical outcomes. Materials and methods This single-center, retrospective observational cohort study included all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 adult patients undergoing admission chest CT, between 01/03/2021 and 17/03/2021. CTs were independently evaluated by two radiologists according to the Co.V.A.Sc. (0: 0%, 1: 1C10%, 2: 11C25%, 3: 26C50%, 4: 51C75%, 5: > 75%). Patient demographics, laboratory, clinical, and hospitalization data were retrieved and analyzed in relation to the Co.V.A.Sc. evaluations. Results Overall, 273 patients (mean age 60.7  14.8 years;50.9% male) were evaluated. Excellent inter- and intraobserver variability was noted between the two independent radiologists Co.V.A.Sc. evaluations. Co.V.A.Sc. classification (Exp(B) 0.391, 95%CI 0.212C0.719;p = 0.025) and patient age (Exp(B) 0.947, 95%CI 0.902C0.993;p = 0.25) were the only variables correlated with ICU admission, while age (Exp(B) 1.111, p = 0.0001), Co.V.A.Sc.

Specifically, for each Co.V.A.Sc. unit increase, the probability of ICU admission increased by 1.47 times, and the probability of death increased by 11.1 times. According to ROC analysis, Co.V.A.Sc. could predict ICU admission and in-hospital death with an optimal cutoff value of unit 3 (sensitivity 56.0%, specificity 84.3%) and unit 4 (sensitivity 41.9%, specificity 93.6%), respectively. Conclusion Co.V.A.Sc. upon hospital admittance seems to predict ICU admission and in-hospital death and could aid in optimizing risk-stratification and patient management.","output":"Covid Visual Assessment Scale (Co.V.A.Sc.): quantification of COVID-19 disease extent on admission chest computed tomography (CT) in the prediction of clinical outcomea retrospective analysis of 273 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is frequently associated with microvascular thrombosis.The microthrombosis in COVID-19 is the result of the interplay between inflammation and endotheliopathy. Elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) characterizes COVID-19 inflammation resulting in endotheliopathy and coagulopathy marked by elevated D-dimer (). Aim of this study is to identify and to describe the coagulation changes in 100 moderate COVID-19 patients having lung involvement and to determine the association of coagulopathy with the severity and prognosis. METHODS: Inflammation, endothelial and coagulation molecules were measured in moderate and mild disease. RESULTS: IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and tissue factor (TF), von Willebrand factor (VWF), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) significantly increased in moderate disease as well as D-dimer, thrombin antithrombin complex (TAT), Fibrinogen (Fib), platelet factor-4 (PF4), -thromboglobulin (-TG), P-selectin, and platelet adhesion. Shortened clotting time (CT) and clot formation time (CFT), high maximum clot firmness (MCF) and low LY at 30 min were present in 100% of moderate COVID-19 patients compared with mild COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that moderate COVID-19 has a profound inflammation associated with severee ndotheliopathy and intense coagulation activation uncontrolled by TFPI. Attention should be paid to coagulopathy in COVID-19. Closely monitoring of coagulation and application of appropriate anticoagulation may improve the prognosis of moderate COVID-19 and to prevent the progression to severe COVID-19 disease.","output":"Cellular and molecular mechanisms in COVID-19 coagulopathy: role of inflammation and endotheliopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hemorrhage is the leading cause of death from trauma. Intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation in these patients may cause hemodilution and secondary hemorrhage. In addition, hypothermia may interfere with coagulation. The purposes of this study were to compare the effectiveness QuikClot Combat Gauze (QCG) to a control group on hemorrhage in a hemodiluted, hypothermic model, and to determine the effects of IV volume resuscitation on rebleeding. This was a prospective, between subjects, experimental design. Yorkshire swine were randomly assigned to two groups: QCG (n = 13) or control (n = 13). The subjects were anesthetized. Hypothermia (temperature of 34.0 C) was induced; 30% of their blood volume was exsanguinated. A 3:1 replacement of Lactated Ringer's was administered to dilute the remaining blood. The femoral artery and vein were transected. After 1 min of uncontrolled hemorrhage, QCG was placed into the wound followed by standard wound packing. The control group underwent the same procedures without QCG. After 5 min of manual pressure, a pressure dressing was applied. Following 30 min, the dressings were removed, and blood loss was calculated. For subjects achieving hemostasis, up to 5 L of IV fluid was administered or until bleeding occurred, which was defined as >2% total blood volume. The QCG had significantly less hemorrhage than the control (QCG = 30  99 mL; control = 404  406 mL) (p = .004).

Long-term exposure to the PD solution creates functional and morphological alterations, and these alterations diminish the efficacy of PD. It is important to establish an evaluation of the changes in PD patients and strategies for the prevention of PD damage and encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). We determined the relationship between clinical findings and macroscopic morphological findings by laparoscopy in patients receiving PD. Macroscopic intraperitoneal findings were recorded at the PD catheter removal in 23 PD patients. We examined macroscopic morphological findings such as fibrin deposition, peritoneal turbidity, vasculopathy, adhesion and calcification in both parietal and visceral peritoneum of upper and lower peritoneal cavities, and assessed the score semi-quantitatively. We then evaluated the relationship between the morphological score and clinical findings, especially observational parts and findings in EPS patients. The total macroscopic score increased with PD duration. Peritoneal turbidity, fibrin deposition, and calcification were observed in the whole peritoneal cavity. Scores of fibrin deposition, turbidity, and calcification increased with PD duration. Vasculopathy in the parietal peritoneum was more serious compared with that in the visceral peritoneum, but there was no difference in the vasculopathy between the upper and lower areas. A characteristic of the macroscopic findings in EPS patients was peritoneal calcification in this study. It appears that macroscopic findings using laparoscopy is significant in evaluating the degree of the peritoneum damage and predicting EPS development.","output":"Morphologic characteristics of macroscopic peritoneal finding in patients with peritoneal dialysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Concerns have been raised about the ability of patients with plasma cell disorders (PCD) to mount adequate immune responses to vaccination, particularly considering the initial extension to vaccination intervals in the United Kingdom to up to 12 weeks in December 2020, the start of the vaccination roll-out. Protecting this vulnerable patient group with anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is critical. Methods We measured the humoral responses in PCD patients after the first dose of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx-1 nCOV-19 vaccines. Antibody levels were measured using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2S assay for quantitative detection of IgG Abs, specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein receptor binding domain. Positive cut-off of 0.80 U/mL defined serologic response. Testing was performed at (or closest to) 4 and 8 weeks post-dose. Baseline nucleocapsid Ab results were available from previous screening in a subset of patients. Clinical information was retrieved from medical records. Results 198 PCD patients (178 multiple myeloma, 15 amyloid, 3 SMM/MGUS, other 2 PCD), median age 63 (range 35-84), had serologic assessment after one vaccine dose against SARS-CoV-2. 69% (138) were on chemo-immunotherapy treatment (CIT) within 4 weeks of first dose. Previous COVID-19 infection and exposure was defined as a positive COVID-19 PCR swab or positive N-antibody at baseline and were excluded from analysis. Patients were tested at median 42 days (range 11-90) after their first dose. After one dose, 68% (135/198) were seropositive, with median Ab titres 21 U/mL (IQR 3.92-133.5). In those with negative baseline Ab test, seroconversion to one dose was 67% (64/96). Forty-one patients were tested more than once after one dose, at median 33 days (12-62) and again at 67 days (38-91). 22 were seronegative at first testing, of these, 6 seroconverted on second testing, prior to second dose. Age 70, light chain (LC) disease, disease status less than VGPR, CIT within 4 weeks, low IgM and ASCT more than 12m were statistically significant seronegative predictors on univariate analyses. LC disease, less than VGPR and IgM less than 0.4g/L, retained statistical significance on multivariate analyses. On linear regression analysis in seropositive patients, more lines of treatment and CIT within 4 weeks were significantly associated with lower antibody titres. Conclusion Serologic response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is lower in PCD patients than reported healthy controls at 68% after one dose. Further work in PCD is needed to understand how Ab levels correlate to neutralisation capability, cellular responses, protection from infection and how long seroconversion lasts to better define correlates of protection. Nearly a third do not respond to a single vaccine dose causing concerns that PCD patients are left vulnerable with a delayed vaccination strategy and should be prioritised to receiving the second dose at the recommended manufacturers time scale of 3 or 4 weeks.","output":"OAB-047: Plasma cell disorder patients are left vulnerable after one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA or the ChAdOx-nCOV-19 COVID-19 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many older adults' traditional sources of formal and informal supports, increasing demand for Area Agency on Aging services (AAAs).

Pulmonology OBJECTIVE: Rare co-existance of disease or pathology BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), patients with the illness have presented with considerable variation in severity. Some infected individuals present mild or no symptoms, while others present severe illness with some fatal outcomes. Multiple lines of management have been suggested for critically ill patients, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and steroids. IVIG is the main treatment for patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Multiple studies have reported that these patients have excellent outcomes when they contract COVID-19. This report describes the clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a 19-year-old man on IVIG replacement therapy for X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). CASE REPORT: A patient with XLA receiving a monthly dose of IVIG and having bronchiectasis managed by prophylactic azithromycin presented with fever, shortness of breath, productive cough, and diarrhea. He was admitted to our hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection. His treatment course for COVID-19 was uncomplicated and had excellent results. He completed a 10-day course of piperacillin/tazobactam and his symptoms resolved 3 days after admission, without complications, oxygen supplementation, or intensive care unit admission. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with XLA have weakened immunity and therefore may present with an infection as a first symptom. This report describes the mild course of COVID-19 pneumonia in an immunologically vulnerable patient with XLA who presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection while undergoing IVIG replacement therapy. Currently, IVIG is one of many supportive immune therapies undergoing clinical evaluation in patients with severe COVID-19.","output":"The Clinical Course of COVID-19 Pneumonia in a 19-Year-Old Man on Intravenous Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy for X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fetal medicine services are essential part of prenatal care.

METHODS All patients admitted to PCU between April and June 2020 from ED were included. The clinical criteria adopted to identify suspected COVID-19 cases were: being in contact with a suspected or confirmed case less than 14 days ago and / or presenting fever with no defined focus and / or respiratory symptoms not explained by oncological disease and / or suggestive image in radiological examination (if necessary). All suspected cases were submitted to deep nasal and throat swab for SARS COV-2 investigation by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Test, adopted as gold standard. Inpatients hospitalized by ED, without suspicion, and then diagnosed with COVID-19 within 10 days of hospitalization were considered as false-negative cases. RESULTS During the period, 327 patients were admitted from ED. Of these, 69 (21%) were considered suspects, of whom 34 (49%) tested positive for COVID-19.

In 2016, out of 667 million children under five years of age, 159 million were stunted worldwide. The prevalence of stunting has been decreasing greatly from 58% in 2000 to 44% in 2011 and 38% in 2016 in Ethiopia. However, the prevalence of stunting is still high and considered as public health problem for the country. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the prevalence of stunting and its associations with wealth index among children under five years of age in Ethiopia. Methodology. The databases searched were MEDLINE, Scopus, HINARI, and grey literature studies. The studies' qualities were assessed by two reviewers independently, and any controversy was handled by other reviewers using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist. The JBI checklist was used in assessing the risk of bias and method of measurement for both outcome and independent variables. Especially, the study design, study participants, definition of stunting, statistical methods used to identify the associations, results/data presentations, and odds ratios (ORs) with confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed. In the statistical analysis, the funnel plot, Egger's test, and Begg's test were used to assess publication bias. The I(2) statistic, forest plot, and Cochran's Q-test were used to deal with heterogeneity. RESULTS: In this review, 35 studies were included to assess the pooled prevalence of stunting. Similarly, 16 studies were used to assess the estimated effect sizes of wealth index on stunting. In this meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of stunting was 41.5% among children under five years of age, despite its considerable heterogeneity (I(2) = 97.6%, p < 0.001, Q = 1461.93). However, no publication bias was detected (Egger's test p=0.26 and Begg's test p=0.87). Children from households with a medium or low/poor wealth index had higher odds of stunting (AOR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.07, 1.65 or AOR: 1.92, 95% CI 1.46, 2.54, respectively) compared to children from households with a high/rich wealth index. Both of the estimated effect sizes of low and medium wealth indexes had substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 63.8%, p < 0.001, Q = 44.21 and I(2) = 78.3%, p < 0.001, Q = 73.73) respectively). In estimating the effect, there was no publication bias (small-studies effect) (Egger and Begg's test, p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The pooled prevalence of stunting was great. In the subgroup analysis, the Amhara region had the highest prevalence of stunting, followed by the Oromia and Tigray regions, respectively. Low economic status was associated with stunting in Ethiopia. This relationship was found to be statistically more accurate in Oromia and Amhara regions.

RESULTS In all, 872 deliveries were evaluated. There was no delivery with accompanying person in group 1 and 181 and 254 in groups 2 and 3. Groups were balanced in caesarean section rate. There were more acute CS in the group 1 than in the group 3 (36% vs 25%, p = 0.028), however there were no diferrence when compared with the group 2 (36% vs 33%, p = 0.602).

DESIGN: To complement a longitudinal survey administered to medical critical care physicians at the end of an ICU rotation, which began in May 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among critical care professionals across four hospitals in December 2018 to January 2019. We report the results of the cross-sectional survey and, to examine the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the longitudinal survey results from July 2019 to May 2020. SETTING: Academic medical center. SUBJECTS: Four-hundred eighty-one critical care professionals, including 353 critical care nurses, 58 advanced practice providers, 57 physicians, and 13 pharmacists, participated in the cross-sectional survey; 15 medical critical care physicians participated in the longitudinal survey through the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Burnout was present in 50% of ICU clinicians, ranging from 42% for critical care physicians to 55% for advanced practice providers. Professional fulfillment was less common at 37%, with significant variability across provider (p = 0.04), with a low of 23% among critical care pharmacists and a high of 53% among physicians. Well-being varied significantly at the hospital and ICU level. Workload and job demand were identified as drivers of burnout and meaning in work, culture and values of work community, control and flexibility, and social support and community at work were each identified as drivers of well-being. Between July 2019 and March 2020, burnout and professional fulfillment were present in 35% (15/43) and 58% (25/43) of medical critical care physician responses, respectively. In comparison, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, burnout and professional fulfillment were present in 57% (12/21) and 38% (8/21), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Burnout was common across roles, yet differed across ICUs and hospitals. Professional fulfillment varied by provider role. We identified potentially modifiable factors related to clinician well-being that can inform organizational strategies at the ICU and hospital level. Longitudinal studies, designed to assess the long-term impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the well-being of the critical care workforce, are urgently needed.","output":"Benchmarking Critical Care Well-Being: Before and After the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Awake prone positioning has been broadly utilised for non-intubated patients with COVID-19-related acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, but the results from published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the past year are contradictory. We aimed to systematically synthesise the outcomes associated with awake prone positioning, and evaluate these outcomes in relevant subpopulations. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, two independent groups of researchers searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and ClinicalTrials.gov for RCTs and observational studies (with a control group) of awake prone positioning in patients with COVID-19-related acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure published in English from Jan 1, 2020, to Nov 8, 2021. We excluded trials that included patients intubated before or at enrolment, paediatric patients (ie, younger than 18 years), or trials that did not include the supine position in the control group. The same two independent groups screened studies, extracted the summary data from published reports, and assessed the risk of bias. We used a random-effects meta-analysis to pool individual studies. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to assess the certainty and quality of the evidence. The primary outcome was the reported cumulative intubation risk across RCTs, and effect estimates were calculated as risk ratios (RR;95% CI). The analysis was primarily conducted on RCTs, and observational studies were used for sensitivity analyses. No serious adverse events associated with awake prone positioning were reported. The study protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021271285. FINDINGS: A total of 1243 studies were identified, we assessed 138 full-text articles and received the aggregated results of three unpublished RCTs; therefore, after exclusions, 29 studies were included in the study. Ten were RCTs (1985 patients) and 19 were observational studies (2669 patients). In ten RCTs, awake prone positioning compared with the supine position significantly reduced the need for intubation in the overall population (RR 084 [95% CI 072C097]). A reduced need for intubation was shown among patients who received advanced respiratory support (ie, high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation) at enrolment (RR 083 [071C097]) and in intensive care unit (ICU) settings (RR 083 [071C097]) but not in patients receiving conventional oxygen therapy (RR 087 [045C169]) or in non-ICU settings (RR 088 [044C176]). No obvious risk of bias and publication bias was found among the included RCTs for the primary outcome. INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19-related acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, awake prone positioning reduced the need for intubation, particularly among those requiring advanced respiratory support and those in ICU settings. Awake prone positioning should be used in patients who have acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and require advanced respiratory support or are treated in the ICU.

Although the World Health Organization and national health authorities are sparing no effort to contain the disease and to find a cure for the potentially deadly infection, SARS has an impact on our liver transplantation (LTx) program. Before the SARS outbreak, an average of 1 LTx was performed per month in our center. For 6 months since the outbreak, there had been no LTx performed. The intensive care unit had to be dedicated to patients with SARS. Two of the LTx team members were struck by SARS. A survey conducted among LTx recipients and their family members (n = 45) demonstrated symptoms of anxiety and stress in all. Some LTx recipients were treated at the Emergency Department for suspected SARS, which were later confirmed to be false alarms. Many LTx patients were too frightened to come back for follow-up. A new strain of coronavirus was identified as the causative agent. The origin of this virus is uncertain but the probability of zoonoses is being seriously discussed. Not only are immunosuppressed patients exposed to higher risk of infection, but also the waiting list mortality is also expected to increase.

COVID-19 started in China in 2019, and it is still spreading even now. Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) scan are the most important imaging techniques for diagnosing COVID-19. All researchers are looking for effective solutions and fast treatment methods for this epidemic. To reduce the need for medical experts, fast and accurate automated detection techniques are introduced. Deep learning convolution neural network (DL-CNN) technologies are showing remarkable results for detecting cases of COVID-19. In this paper, deep feature concatenation (DFC) mechanism is utilized in two different ways. In the first one, DFC links deep features extracted from X-ray and CT scan using a simple proposed CNN. The other way depends on DFC to combine features extracted from either X-ray or CT scan using the proposed CNN architecture and two modern pre-trained CNNs: ResNet and GoogleNet. The DFC mechanism is applied to form a definitive classification descriptor. The proposed CNN architecture consists of three deep layers to overcome the problem of large time consumption. For each image type, the proposed CNN performance is studied using different optimization algorithms and different values for the maximum number of epochs, the learning rate (LR), and mini-batch (M-B) size.

We plot the emergence and extinction of new variants of concern (VOCs) over time and show how this corresponds to the ongoing accumulation of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes and individual proteins.

Several management strategies exist for both non-operative and operative care, with each strategy offering unique risks and benefits. Traditional pairwise meta-analyses have been performed to compare management strategies; however, all treatment options have never been integrated in a single analysis. Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a generalization of pairwise meta-analysis, which allows for the comparison of multiple interventions based on all available direct and indirect evidence. The objectives of this review are to synthesize the evidence on the management options for acute Achilles tendon rupture and identify which treatment gives the best functional outcomes. METHODS A systematic review with NMA is planned. An electronic literature search will be performed in conjunction with an experienced information specialist in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We will include randomized controlled trials with a minimum 6-month follow-up. Two independent reviewers will screen citations for eligibility, extract study data, and perform risk of bias assessments. The primary outcome will be disease-specific functional outcome scores (AOFAS, Leppilahti, modified Leppilahti) at 1 year. Secondary outcomes will include complications (re-rupture, sural nerve injury, wound complications, deep infection, secondary surgeries), strength, range of motion, return to work, return to sport, and quality-of-life measures (including the SF-36 questionnaire). Traditional pairwise meta-analyses will be performed for all direct comparisons where evidence is available, and NMAs will subsequently be performed where possible to compare all management strategies. DISCUSSION The data generated from this review will provide health-care providers with a clear evidence synthesis of all Achilles tendon rupture management strategies.

This study set out to describe the clinical course and outcomes of these patients. Methods This single-center retrospective study was performed at Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had pre-existing CVD (N=69) were identified. COVID-19 patients without CVD were randomly selected and matched by age and sex to the patients with CVD. Clinical data were analyzed and compared between the 2 groups. The composite endpoint included intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation, and death. Multivariable Cox regression analyses with control for medical comorbidities were used to examine the relationship between pre-existing CVD and clinical outcome of COVID-19. Results Compared with patients without CVD, patients with pre-existing CVD were more likely to present with unapparent symptoms at first; however, at admission, these patients tended to be in a severer condition than those without CVD, with more underlying hypertension and diabetes. The levels of interleukin-6, creative kinase MB, aspartate transaminase, and creatinine, as well as prothrombin time, were also markedly higher in patients with CVD. Patients with pre-existing CVD were more likely to develop multi-organ dysfunction, deteriorate to critical condition, and yield poorer clinical outcomes than patients without CVD. Concerning therapeutics, greater proportions of patients with pre-existing CVD required mechanical ventilation, higher-order anti-bacterials, and drugs targeting underlying diseases and complications. In the multivariable analysis, pre-existing CVD was significantly associated with a poor clinical outcome. Conclusions Patients with a history of CVD are more vulnerable to an over-activated inflammatory response and subsequent multi-organ dysfunction, resulting in a poor clinical outcome.

METHODS: This systematic review was conducted through searching five databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Science Direct. Inclusion criteria included studies clearly defining any use of telehealth services in all aspects of health care during COVID-19 outbreak, published from December 31, 2019, written in English language and published in peer reviewed journals.

This study aims to evaluate the potential of a web-cloud-based database on patients follow-up in extraordinary situations, when a traditional in-person follow-up cannot be warranted. Methods: Patients who underwent joint arthroplasty at our Institute between 21 February and 16 March 2020 were included in the study group and were matched to a similar population undergoing joint arthroplasty in February/March 2019. All patients routinely complete questionnaires before and after treatment, including patient-reported outcome measures such as the Visual Analogues Scale (VAS), Knee/Hip Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Physical Function Short Form (KOOS-PS/HOOS-PS) and Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) for the monitoring of clinical improvements. Results: 56 (study group) and 144 (control group) patients were included in the study. Both groups demonstrated significant improvements at 3 months. HOOS-PS improvement was significantly reduced in the 2020 group compared to 2019 (21.7 vs. 33.9, p < 0.001). This reduction was related to intense physical activities. Similarly, the functional score improvement related to these activities was reduced for patients undergoing knee replacement (8 vs. 10, p < 0.05). Conclusions: The web-based Institute Registry emerged as a meaningful and sensitive tool during an extraordinary situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic to monitor patients progression after total joint arthroplasties. Thanks to this tool, it was possible to observe that the prevention of usual postoperative care due to pandemic-related restrictions did not alter the benefits observed after joint replacement surgeries, even if this condition reduced the postoperative improvements in the most burdensome physical activities. A broader use of this kind of tool would improve and potentially reduce the burden and costs of postoperative patients monitoring in standard and extraordinary conditions.

CoVs are a large group of enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, which encode large replicase polyproteins that are processed by viral peptidases to generate the nonstructural proteins (Nsps) that mediate viral RNA synthesis. Papain-like peptidases (PLPs) and chymotrypsin-like cysteine 3C-like peptidase are essential for coronaviral replication and represent attractive antiviral drug targets. Furthermore, CoVs utilize the activation of their envelope spike glycoproteins by host cell peptidases to gain entry into cells. CoVs have evolved multiple strategies for spike protein activation, including the utilization of lysosomal cysteine cathepsins. In this review, viral and host peptidases involved in CoV cell entry and replication are discussed in depth, with an emphasis on papain-like cysteine cathepsins. Furthermore, important findings on cysteine peptidase inhibitors with regard to virus attenuation are highlighted as well as the potential of such inhibitors for future treatment strategies for CoV-related diseases.","output":"The role of cysteine peptidases in coronavirus cell entry and replication: The therapeutic potential of cathepsin inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conflicting results are available regarding the influence of ACEi/ARBs on the risk of COVID-19 infection, while less is known about their impact on the clinical outcome of patients with STEMI diagnosed with COVID-19. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of ACEi/ARBs therapy on in-hospital mortality and clinical outcomes of patients with STEMI during the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients with STEMI hospitalized from February 20 to May 10, 2020 in four Hospitals in Lombardy. SARS-COV-2 diagnosis was performed by nasopharyngeal swab test. Procedural outcome, respiratory complications, and in-hospital mortality were reported. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by logistic regressions. Our population was represented by 182 patients with STEMI, 76.9% of which were males, and mean age was 67  12.5. Hypertension was reported in 53.3%, and 29.1% was treated with ACEi/ARBs. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed in 17.1% of the patients. In-hospital mortality (13.2%) was significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 (31 vs. 10%, p = 0.003), even if ejection fraction [OR 0.93 (95% CI) 0.87C0.99; p = 0.03] and respiratory complications [OR 9.39 (95% CI) 1.91C45.9; p = 0.006] were the only two independent predictors. The incidence of COVID-19 infection was not influenced by ACEi/ARBs (16.5 in na?ve vs. 18.8%) whose presence on admission did not correlate with respiratory complications or mortality both in the case of discontinuation and maintenance. In conclusion, in a high-risk population, such as that of patients with STEMI, the potential benefit of ACEi/ARB discontinuation in patients with COVID-19 is overcome by its detrimental effect. Intensive care, additional preventive respiratory investigations, regardless of swab test result, should be suggested for all patients admitted for STEMI during the pandemic.","output":"Impact of RAAS Inhibitors on Clinical Outcome and Mortality in Patients With STEMI During the COVID-19 Era: A Multicenter Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 rapidly infects millions of people worldwide since December 2019.

The current study therefore aimed at investigating any possible zoonotic gastrointestinal helminths of olive baboons (Papio anubis) at the humanCwildlife interface in two park borders and a ranch in Kenya, namely, Tsavo West National Park, Tana River Primate Reserve and Mutara Ranch, Laikipia, Kenya. One hundred and forty\\\\seven baboons were used in the study. They were trapped in the wild, sampled for stool marked and then released back to the wild. Gastrointestinal (GIT) helminths identified were Strongyloides, Oesophagostomum, Enterobius spp and Trichuris Trichiura from all the three sites while Schistosoma mansoni was only detected from Tsavo baboons and with very low incidence (2.1%). The prevalence of these parasites varied among the sites but significant difference in prevalence was only noted in Strongyloides and Oesophagostomum (p < 0.05) among the three sites. This therefore implies that even with control measures instituted on the human population, baboons will always be a source of zoonotic GIT helminths especially S. mansoni even if the incidence are low.

Nudging, defined as altering the environmental context in which a decision is made or a certain behaviour is enacted, has shown promising results in several health promotion strategies. We present a comprehensive synthesis of evidence regarding the value and impact of nudges to address VH. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to determine if nudging can mitigate VH and improve vaccine uptake. Our search strategy used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and non-MeSH terms to identify articles related to nudging and vaccination in nine research databases. 15 177 titles were extracted and assessed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The final list of included articles was evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework. FINDINGS: Identified interventions are presented according to a framework for behaviour change, MINDSPACE. Articles (n=48) from 10 primarily high-income countries were included in the review. Nudging-based interventions identified include using reminders and recall, changing the way information is framed and delivered to an intended audience, changing the messenger delivering information, invoking social norms and emotional affect (eg, through storytelling, dramatic narratives and graphical presentations), and offering incentives or changing defaults. The most promising evidence exists for nudges that offer incentives to parents and healthcare workers, that make information more salient or that use trusted messengers to deliver information. The effectiveness of nudging interventions and the direction of the effect varies substantially by context. Evidence for some approaches is mixed, highlighting a need for further research, including how successful interventions can be adapted across settings. CONCLUSION: Nudging-based interventions show potential to increase vaccine confidence and uptake, but further evidence is needed for the development of clear recommendations.

DESIGN: Prospective, observational, cohort study. METHODS: Forty eyes of 40 patients (mean age: 49.7  12.6 years old) post-SARS-CoV-2 infection and 40 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. COVID-19 patients had to be fully recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia and were evaluated 6 months after COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome resulted from OCTA studies of the following vascular structures: vessel density (VD) in the retinal superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and radial peripapillary capillaries (RPC) compared to those of controls. Structural spectral domain (SD)-OCT parameters were also evaluated: ganglion cell complex (GCC) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). RESULTS: The patients showed a significant reduction in VD of the SCP in whole images and in the DCP in all sectors compared to those in healthy subjects (P <.05). COVID-19 patients featured a reduced VD of the RPC compared to that in controls (P <.001). No differences were found in the GCC, whereas the RNFL was reduced in the COVID-19 group compared to that in controls (P = .012). Significant correlations were found between the RNFL and VD of the SCP, DCP, RPC, and FAZ area in the COVID-19 group (P <.05).

Four focus group discussions were organized with the residents of Muscat Governate, Oman through videoconference to collect their insights on the impact of social behavior change messages. A number of qualitative themes were also recorded at the end of each focus group. Of the 40 participants, 12 (30%) were females and 28 (70%) were males. From the discussions, we observed a largely positive attitude towards social behavior change messages. Almost all the participants acknowledged the importance and equally positive impact of these (persuasive) messages on transforming behavior change in society. However, it was also pointed out that the nature of a behavioural transformation is such that there is a substantial risk to psychological health. Lack of interaction, for example, led to lower motivation, a sense of losing the meaning of life, and personal suffering. While the participants acknowledged and appreciated the tremendous effort made by the health authorities in persuading the masses on such a large scale using multimodal cues, they did show concern on the extent of longevity of adherence. The findings of this study suggest that although social behavior change messages have been successful in somehow transforming the social behaviors to tackle COVID-19, there is still a need to devise rigorous public health strategies for dealing with mental and psychological health.

Yet, it is unclear how CCI individuals and their family understand their health and the importance of prognostic information following hospitalization. The research purpose was to examine expectations about health and disease prognosis of CCI residents in long-term care from the perspectives of the CCI themselves and their family members, as well as to describe healthcare provider (HCP) interpretations of, and reactions to, these health-related expectations. METHODS: In this qualitative interpretive descriptive study, conducted in British Columbia, Canada, 38 semi-structured interviews were conducted (6 CCI residents, 11 family members, and 21 HCPs) and inductively analyzed using thematic and constant comparative techniques. RESULTS: There was divergence in CCI resident, family and HCP expectations about health and the importance of disease prognosis, which contributed to conflict. CCI residents and family viewed conflict with HCPs in relation to their day-to-day care needs, while HCPs viewed this as arising from the unrealistically high expectations of residents and family. The CCI residents and family focussed on the importance of maintaining hope, and the HCPs highlighted the complexity of end-of-life decisions in conjunction with the high expectations and hopes of family.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of adult admissions across hospitals from February 1, 2020, through May 31, 2020, was conducted. The cohort was stratified into those admitted before March 17, 2020 (prepandemic) and those admitted on or after that date (SARS-CoV-2-positive and non-SARS-CoV-2). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were computed every 2 hours for each admission. RESULTS: A total of 1 794 975 scores were computed for 20 704 admissions. Before and during the pandemic, renal failure was the most common type of organ failure at admission and respiratory failure was the most common type of hospital-onset organ failure. The SARS-CoV-2-positive group showed a 231% increase in respiratory failure compared with the prepandemic group. More than 65% of hospital-onset organ failure in the prepandemic group and 83% of hospital-onset respiratory failure in the SARS-CoV-2-positive group occurred outside intensive care units. The SARS-CoV-2-positive group showed a 341% increase in multiorgan failure compared with the prepandemic group. Compared with the prepandemic and non-SARS-CoV-2 patients, SARS-CoV-2-positive patients had significantly higher mortality for the same admission and maximum organ failure score. CONCLUSION: Most hospital-onset organ failure began outside intensive care units, with a marked increase in multiorgan failure during pandemic surge conditions and greater hospital mortality for the severity of organ failure.","output":"Epidemiology of Organ Failure Before and During COVID-19 Pandemic Surge Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article analyses actual social dialogue experiences in Italy, Portugal and Spain in order to examine the social partners participation in COVID\\\\19 crisis management.

The limitations of protocol-driven medical science and avoiding the patient behind the patient have again compelled us during this pandemic to explore holistic health. This paper presents an analysis and explores the feasibility of Ayurveda as an integrative system to wellness and tests the Ayurveda concept of holistic wellness against three such dichotomies: 'health' vs wellness, 'body' vs 'mind,' and 'curative vs. preventive,' where the current medical model can be said to represent the first elements in the three dichotomies. Keeping the current Covid-19 pandemic as a critical incident, researchers tried to justify that the synergistic confluence will act as a complementary/supportive knowledge in humanity's struggle against the pandemic.

In this study, we established a sensitive SCoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SP), including an SP mutant D614G, pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system and tested their ability to infect ACE2-expressing cells. Based on this system, we have demonstrated that an aqueous extract from the Natural herb Prunella vulgaris (NhPV) displayed potent inhibitory effects on SCoV-2 SP (including SP(G614) mutant) pseudotyped virus (SCoV-2-SP-PVs) mediated infections. Moreover, we have compared NhPV with another compound, Suramin, for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities and the mode of their actions, and found that both NhPV and Suramin are able to directly interrupt SCoV-2CSP binding to its receptor ACE2 and block the viral entry step. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of NhPV and Suramin were confirmed by the wild type SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) virus infection in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results also demonstrated that the combination of NhPV/Suramin with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody mediated a more potent blocking effect against SCoV2-SP-PVs. Overall, by using SARS-CoV-2 SP-pseudotyped HIV-1-based entry system, we provide strong evidence that NhPV and Suramin have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may be developed as a novel antiviral approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Identification and evaluation of the inhibitory effect of Prunella vulgaris extract on SARS-coronavirus 2 virus entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The entire human life is passing through a very bad and unprecedented phase of the pandemic called COVID- 19.

Millions of people got affected around the globe and many lost their loving ones while fighting with the deadly disease. The two critical challenges of the pandemic are: there are no known treatments for COVID-19 and secondly, its transmission from one person to another is very prompt. Therefore, to control the deadly spread of the pandemic the countries have adopted complete lockdown for months, people were isolated and quarantined to control the spread of the disease. Several terminologies such as lockdown, quarantine, social-distancing, home isolation, and Corona waves can be heard around. In all these necessary measures to control the virus taken by the government the entire humankind suffered and still suffering from several challenges towards living a normal life. In this entire disaster, information communication technologies (ICTs) have shown a significant contribution in mitigating the effects and challenges caused due to COVID-19. In the present study, efforts have been given on highlighting the role of ICT in overcoming the challenges of life caused due to COVID-19 with the help of studies that took place in the pandemic duration. The study has also shown that how the extensive inclination of the people towards the use of ICTs helped in emerging new business opportunities.

However, their decision-making during this process is not well understood. In this article, we use an ecological approach to explore talent identification in combat sports. We interviewed twenty-four expert, international-level coaches from the Olympic disciplines of boxing, judo, and taekwondo (age: 48.7 + 7.5 years; experience: 20.8 + 8.3 years). Findings indicated that when coaches identify talent they rely on \\"gut instinct\\": intuitive judgements made without conscious thought, used to direct attention to particular athletes or characteristics. Our analysis revealed four major contributors to coaches' intuition: experiential knowledge, temporal factors, seeing athletes in context, and what can be worked with. Our findings demonstrate that i) athlete selections may be influenced by the coaches' perceived ability to improve certain athletes (rather than solely on athlete ability); and ii) \\"instinctual\\" decisions are the result of years of experience, time spent with the athlete, and the context surrounding the decision.

We sought to evaluate the sociodemographic differences in TM use among stroke survivors. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of stroke survivors evaluated at three tertiary stroke center clinics in the early period of the pandemic, 3/16/2020 till 7/31/2020. We compared the use of TM by demographics. The association between the use of TM and race/ethnicity was measured using the relative risk (RR) from a modified Poisson regression model adjusting for age, sex, insurance status, stroke type, visit type, and site. Results: A total of 2,024 individuals were included from UTHealth (n=878), MedStar Georgetown (n=269), and Columbia (n=877). Median age was 64 [IQR 52-74] and 53% were female. About half the patients had private insurance, 36% had Medicare and 15% had Medicaid. Two-thirds of the visits were established patients. TM accounted for 90% and the use of TM over office visits was primarily associated with site, not patients' characteristics. Among TM users, older age, non-White, and Medicaid were associated with lower VTM compared to TPH use. Black (aRR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85-0.95, p<0.001) and Hispanic patients (aRR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86 - 0.97, p=0.005) had 10% lower VTM use while Asian patients (aRR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 - 1.06, p=0.56) had similar VTM use compared to White patients (Figure). Conclusions: In our diverse cohort, we found differences in TM visit type by race and insurance, with overall higher utilization among established patients. These findings suggest disparities in VTM access across different stroke populations. As VTM becomes an integral part of outpatient practice, steps to ensure equitable access are essential.","output":"Disparities in telemedicine use among stroke survivors: The experience of three tertiary stroke centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: There are concerns about nonscientific and/or unclear information on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is available on the Internet.

RESULTS: The readability of COVID-19-related health information on websites was suitable for high school graduates or college students and, thus, was far above the recommended readability level. Most websites that were examined (87.2%) had not been officially certified by HONcode. There was no significant difference in the readability scores of websites with and without HONcode certification.

This study was to evaluate the most cited authors, institutes, and regions in the mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan in the field of ophthalmology in the recent 10 years using the hx-index and to display the result with visual representations. METHODS: Using the PubMed search engine to download data, we conducted an observational study of citation analyses in affiliated research institutes and regions (provinces/areas) of all ophthalmology authors since 2010. A total of 19,364 published articles from 22,393 authors in the mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were analyzed. The x-index and the Kano model were complemental to the hx-index in identifying IRAs. A pyramid plot was used to illustrate the importance of the author-weighted scheme (AWS) used in evaluating IRAs in academics. The hx-index combining both advantages of the h and x-index was proposed to assess individual IRAs. Furthermore, we drew: 1. a choropleth map on Google Maps to visualize the differences of IRA among regions and 2. a visual display to present individual hx-indexes. RESULTS: There is a significant rise over time in the number of publications. The top-ranking regions in hx-index were Shanghai (26.82), Guangdong (25.82), and Beijing (25.81). We demonstrated that Dr Wu from Taiwan published 144 articles in PMC and used the example to explain the importance of AWS when IRAs were assessed.

METHODS: Inclusion criteria were: (1) clinical and molecular diagnosis of SMA2 or SMA3; (2) nusinersen treatment started in adult age (>18 years); (3) clinical data available at least at baseline (T0-beginning of treatment) and 6 months (T6). RESULTS: We included 116 patients (13 SMA2 and 103 SMA3) with median age at first administration of 34 years (range 18-72). The Hammersmith Functional Rating Scale Expanded (HFMSE) in patients with SMA3 increased significantly from baseline to T6 (median change +1 point, p<0.0001), T10 (+2, p<0.0001) and T14 (+3, p<0.0001). HFMSE changes were independently significant in SMA3 sitter and walker subgroups. The Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) in SMA3 significantly improved between T0 and T14 (median +0.5, p=0.012), with most of the benefit observed in sitters (+2, p=0.018). Conversely, patients with SMA2 had no significant changes of median HFMSE and RULM between T0 and the following time points, although a trend for improvement of RULM was observed in those with some residual baseline function. The rate of patients showing clinically meaningful improvements (as defined during clinical trials) increased from 53% to 69% from T6 to T14.

In this context, a large body of scientific literature examining the mental health impact of this global crisis has emerged. The majority of these studies have framed this impact in terms of pre-defined categories derived from psychiatric nosology, such as anxiety disorders, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. These constructs often fail to capture the complexity of the actual experiences of the individuals being studied;more specifically, they describe these experiences exclusively in terms of disease, while neglecting their potentially adaptive or \\"salutogenic\\" aspects. Similarly, discussion of psychological assistance for these individuals has largely been confined to a reiteration of \\"evidence-based\\" psychological or pharmacological techniques which can be delivered using remote access technology. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these approaches are likely to be of mixed efficacy. Conversely, \\"negative emotions\\" or distressing psychological experiences may actually be functional in the setting of a disaster or crisis, serving to minimize harm, maximize social coherence and compliance, and facilitate adherence to safety measures. The limitations of the \\"conventional\\" approach are, to a certain degree, inherent to the prevailing medical model of mental health. Beyond these considerations lies the concept of \\"salutogenesis,\\" a term which refers to the innate capacity of individuals to create and maintain health and well-being in the face of adversity. Using principles derived from the second wave of positive psychology (PP2.0), particularly its emphasis on the totality of human experience and the possibility of deriving meaning and character growth from suffering, this paper conceptually analyses the relevant aspects of salutogenesis and PP2.0, and proposes an alternate approach for addressing mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an approach, while acknowledging the utility of the conventional medical-psychotherapeutic model in specific cases, reduces the risk of medicalizing human experience, and provides individuals and communities with opportunities for growth and adaptation. The benefits of this proposal could potentially extend far beyond the current crisis, offering an opportunity for the field of psychiatry and mental health research to move away from a purely \\"disease-centered\\" model.","output":"Suffering and Salutogenesis: A Conceptual Analysis of Lessons for Psychiatry From Existential Positive Psychology (PP2.0) in the Setting of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Direct and indirect sequels of COVID-19 in the cardiovascular system are unclear.

In this study, we numerically investigate the aerosol particle's motion in a 3D straight microchannel with rectangular cross section by fully resolved simulation of the particleCair flow. The air flow is modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations. The particle's motions, including translation and rotation, are governed, respectively, by the Newton's second law and the Euler equations without using any approximation models for the lift and drag forces. The coupled mathematical model is numerically solved by combining immersed boundary with lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM). We find that the Reynolds number (Re), the particle's initial position, particle's density and diameter are the influential parameters in this process.

We examined the timing and pattern of brain injury in mild HIE. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study includes infants with mild HIE treated at 9 hospitals. Neonatal brain MRIs were scored by 2 reviewers using a validated classification system, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Severity and timing of MRI brain injury (i.e., acute, subacute, chronic) was scored on the subset of MRIs that were performed at or before 8 days of age. RESULTS: Of 142 infants with mild HIE, 87 (61%) had injury on MRI at median age 5 (IQR 4-6) days. Watershed (23%), deep gray (20%) and punctate white matter (18%) injury were most common. Among the 125 (88%) infants who received a brain MRI at 8 days, mild (44%) injury was more common than moderate (11%) or severe (4%) injury. Subacute (37%) lesions were more commonly observed than acute (32%) or chronic lesions (1%). CONCLUSION: Subacute brain injury is common in newborn infants with mild HIE.

We collected clinical data of COVID-19 patients between January 18 and March 29 2020 in Wuhan, China . Gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), logistic regression (LR) model, and simplified LR were built to predict the mortality of COVID-19. We also evaluated different models by computing area under curve (AUC), accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) under fivefold cross-validation. A total of 2924 patients were included in our evaluation, with 257 (8.8%) died and 2667 (91.2%) survived during hospitalization. Upon admission, there were 21 (0.7%) mild cases, 2051 (70.1%) moderate case, 779 (26.6%) severe cases, and 73 (2.5%) critically severe cases. The GBDT model exhibited the highest fivefold AUC, which was 0.941, followed by LR (0.928) and LR-5 (0.913). The diagnostic accuracies of GBDT, LR, and LR-5 were 0.889, 0.868, and 0.887, respectively. In particular, the GBDT model demonstrated the highest sensitivity (0.899) and specificity (0.889). The NPV of all three models exceeded 97%, while their PPV values were relatively low, resulting in 0.381 for LR, 0.402 for LR-5, and 0.432 for GBDT. Regarding severe and critically severe cases, the GBDT model also performed the best with a fivefold AUC of 0.918. In the external validation test of the LR-5 model using 72 cases of COVID-19 from Brunei, leukomonocyte (%) turned to show the highest fivefold AUC (0.917), followed by urea (0.867), age (0.826), and SPO2 (0.704).

Negative events particularly climate change and including outbreaks have caused the world to be affected economically and socially, and caused these said negativities to become global today. The COVID-19 outbreak, which emerged in Wuhan, China's Hubei state, was declared as a pandemic in the fourth quarter of 2019, on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is estimated that the economic destruction of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as its dimension affecting human beings, will be significant by the end of 2020. In addition to the loss of numerous lives around the world, another impact of the virus has been experienced by the global economy. The fact that this flu, which originated in Central Asia, has spread to the USA and Europe has had an impact on the currencies of countries, capital markets, precious metals, barrel oil prices, and even virtual currencies, causing volatile fluctuations in the global markets. In the process that the world is in, COVID-19 has brought the entire world to a significant historical turning point. The entire world has focused on two main issues at this historical turning point. The first of them is to fight the pandemic, to minimize casualties, and to eradicate the pandemic. The second step is to take an action to avoid the crises and damage that will occur in post-epidemic economies. All countries have begun to implement socialization policies in order to protect public health and fight the pandemic when the COVID-19 disease spread around the world. Closures of educational institutions, primarily in trade and tourism, work restrictions, and restrictions on human mobility have had a rapid negative impact on all sectors. Today's economy is a structure where employees, financial institutions, companies, suppliers, consumers, and countries are interconnected. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the economy to ground to a halt. It is stated that the economy has suffered an unprecedented negative shock as a result of this pandemic. The closure of borders, restrictions on transportation, the lockdown of people in their homes, the imposition of curfews, the reduction of import and export activities, decrease in both supply and demand, as well as the unprecedented developments in the global economy, distinguished this crisis from others. It could not be avoided that all countries around the world, including Turkey, would be affected by this situation. The economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic harmed the sectors of the economy that directly benefit from natural resources, particularly agriculture (primary sector), the sector where industrial activities take place (secondary sector), and the industries where all services are provided (tertiary sector) (such as education, finance, and tourism sectors). Countries around the world implement economic measures to mitigate the effects of the economic crisis. Financial measures, which are primarily among the economic measures taken by countries in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, are discussed in the study in this context. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Financial Measures Taken in Turkey and Selected Countries in Combatting COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radioprotective effects of vitamin C and vitamin E as a water-soluble and a lipid-soluble agent, respectively, were investigated at the molecular level during the imposition of gamma radiation-induced structural changes to bovine serum albumin (BSA) at the therapeutic dose of 3 Gy. Secondary and tertiary structural changes of control and irradiated BSA samples were investigated using circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. The preirradiation tests showed nonspecific and reversible binding of vitamins C and E to BSA. Secondary and tertiary structures of irradiated BSA considerably changed in the absence of the vitamins. Upon irradiation, -helices of BSA transitioned to beta motifs and random coils, and the fluorescence emission intensity decreased relative to nonirradiated BSA. In the presence of the vitamins C or E, however, the irradiated BSA was protected from these structural changes caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The two vitamins exhibited different patterns of attachment to the protein surface, as inspected by blind docking, and their mechanisms of protection were different. The hydrophilicity of vitamin C resulted in the predominant scavenging of ROS in the solvent, whereas hydrophobic vitamin E localized on the nonpolar patches of the BSA surface, where it did not only form a barrier for diffusing ROS but also encountered them as an antioxidant and neutralized them thanks to the moderate BSA binding constant.

The current approach to determine the invasiveness of LUACs is surgical resection, which is not a viable solution to fight lung cancer in a timely fashion. An alternative approach is to analyze chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans. The radiologists' analysis based on CT images, however, is subjective and might result in a low accuracy. In this paper, a transformer-based framework, referred to as the\\"CAE-Transformer\\", is developed to efficiently classify LUACs using whole CT images instead of finely annotated nodules. The proposed CAE-Transformer can achieve high accuracy over a small dataset and requires minor supervision from radiologists. The CAE Transformer utilizes an encoder to automatically extract informative features from CT slices, which are then fed to a modified transformer to capture global inter-slice relations and provide classification labels.

This study aims to evaluate clinical and subclinical response to calcipotriol+betamethasone foam, in patients with PsO, comparing, for the first time, data from microvascular ultrasound (MicroV) and shear wave elastography (SWE) with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). METHODS Between November 2018 and April 2019 in Tor Vergata Hospital (Roma, Italy), we enrolled 26 patients with PsO who were ageds 20-75 years, with PASI score 4, candidated for calcipotriol+betamethasone foam treatment. They underwent MicroV and SWE evaluation at baseline (T0) and after 4 weeks of treatment (T4). Clinical follow-up was carried on at T4, T8 and T12. Student's t-test (p values<0.05 statistically significant) was used to compare SWE and PASI values. RESULTS At T0, SWE stiffness values of target plaques (61.5% on elbows, 23% knees, 7.7% sacrum,7.7% legs) were significantly higher than values under healthy skin. At T4, all patients showed a significant reduction of PASI; MicroV showed reduction in vascularisation of responsive plaques in 85% of cases, only in 15%, the vascularisation degree remained stable; and SWE values of target plaques were significantly lower compared with T0. Only in 7.7%, there was a relapse at T12. CONCLUSIONS Calcipotriol+betamethasone foam is a very effective topical treatment in a short-medium term follow-up in patients with PsO.

Surprisingly, dialysis patients have shown superior seroconversion rates after vaccination compared to KTRs. Therefore, we investigated peripheral blood B cell (BC) composition before and after kidney transplantation (KT) and aimed to screen the BC compartment to explain impaired antibody generation. METHODS: A total of 105 patients were recruited, and multicolor flow cytometric phenotyping of peripheral venous blood BC subpopulations was performed before and 1 year after KT. Complete follow-up was available for 71 individuals. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were collected retrospectively and were available for 40 subjects, who had received two doses of an mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273). RESULTS: Overall, relative BC frequencies within lymphocytes decreased, and their absolute counts trended in the same direction 1 year after KT as compared to CKD G5 patients. Frequencies and absolute numbers of na?ve BCs remained stable. Frequencies of double negative BCs, a heterogeneous subpopulation of antigen experienced BCs lacking CD27 expression, were increased after KT, yet their absolute counts were similar at both time points. Transitional BCs (TrBCs) and plasmablasts were significantly reduced after KT in absolute and relative terms. Memory BCs were affected differently since class-switched and IgM-only subsets decreased after KT, but unswitched and IgD-only memory BCs remained unchanged. CD86(+) and CD5(+) expression on BCs was downregulated after KT. Correlational analysis revealed that TrBCs were the only subset to correlate with titer levels after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Responders showed higher TrBCs, both absolute and relative, than non-responders. CONCLUSION: Together, after 1 year, KTRs showed persistent and profound compositional changes within the BC compartment. Low TrBCs, 1 year after KT, may account for the low serological response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in KTRs compared to dialysis patients. Our findings need confirmation in further studies as they may guide vaccination strategies.","output":"B Cell Composition Is Altered After Kidney Transplantation and Transitional B Cells Correlate With SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corruption is a worldwide phenomenon, but the crisis seems to have no bounds in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the absurdity has penetrated and continues to impair the public service sector. As long as the anomaly continues, two outcomes are inevitable. First, an average member of the public runs the risk of paying more for any government service. Second, some or all resources earmarked for other essential needs might get sacrificed to pay for a needed public service. Such unforeseen adverse shocks could potentially increase the chances of wicked problems such as food insecurity. Consequently, this paper examined the welfare effect of bureaucratic corruption on households' ability to procure food in a safe and socially acceptable manner in sub-Saharan Africa using pooled Afrobarometer micro-level data from Rounds 5, 6, and 7 spanning 2011 to 2018. Estimates from logistic regression and the endogenous dummy variable regression that addressed the endogeneity of bureaucratic corruption in the food insecurity model revealed that bureaucratic corruption induced the experience of household food insecurity. Further analyses showed that some public entities have a more significant debilitating effect than others on household food security conditions. More importantly, any contact with government institutions causes household food security status to spiral downward. These results suggest that public institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa are weak and undoubtedly contribute to household food insecurity. Therefore, there is a need for a paradigm shift in how these entities serve the public or else a lasting solution to food insecurity might remain elusive in the region.","output":"The effect of bureaucratic corruption on household food insecurity: evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the Covid-19 outbreak and the killing of the African American George Floyd, peoples attention focused again on topics such as racism and police violence, as well as socio-economic inequalities in society, from access to healthcare to work and education.

ACE2 is shed to the circulation, and a higher plasma level of soluble ACE2 (sACE2) might reflect a higher cellular expression of ACE2. The present study explored the associations between sACE2 and clinical factors, cardiovascular biomarkers, and genetic variability. METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma and DNA samples were obtained from two international cohorts of elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (n = 3999 and n = 1088). The sACE2 protein level was measured by the Olink Proteomics(?) Multiplex CVD II(96  96) panel. Levels of the biomarkers high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, D-dimer, and cystatin-C were determined by immunoassays. Genome-wide association studies were performed by Illumina chips. Higher levels of sACE2 were statistically significantly associated with male sex, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and older age. The sACE2 level was most strongly associated with the levels of GDF-15, NT-proBNP, and hs-cTnT. When adjusting for these biomarkers, only male sex remained associated with sACE2.

METHODS After a systematic review of the relevant studies, odds ratio, mean difference, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios, were calculated for the prediction of relevant COVID-19 outcomes by performing a meta-analysis using fixed and random effects models. A Fagan nomogram was used to assess the clinical utility. Heterogeneity was explored by sensitivity analysis and univariable meta-regression. RESULTS Twenty-six studies were included (22 studies and 5271 patients for AST, 20 studies and 5440 subjects for ALT, and 9 studies and 3542 patients for bilirubin). The outcomes of the studies were: survival (n=8), intensive care unit admission (n=4), and non-fatal severe complications (n=16).

RESULTS: Among 119 middle-aged patients without comorbidities, 18 (15.1%) developed into severe illness and 5 (3.9%) died in hospital. ARDS (26, 21.8%) and elevated D-dimer (36, 31.3%) were the most common complications, while other organ complications were relatively rare. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of severe illness associated with neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR, OR, 11.238; 95% CI 1.110-1.382; p < 0.001) and D-dimer greater than 1 g/ml (OR, 16.079; 95% CI 3.162-81.775; p = 0.001) on admission. The AUCs for the NLR, D-dimer greater than 1 g/ml and combined NLR and D-dimer index were 0.862 (95% CI, 0.751-0.973), 0.800 (95% CI 0.684-0.915) and 0.916 (95% CI, 0.855-0.977), respectively. SOFA yielded an AUC of 0.750 (95% CI 0.602-0.987). There was significant difference in the AUC between SOFA and combined index (z = 2.574, p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: More attention should be paid to the monitoring and early treatment of respiratory and coagulation abnormalities in middle-aged COVID-19 patients without comorbidities. In addition, the combined NLR and D-dimer higher than 1 g/ml index might be a potential and reliable predictor for the incidence of severe illness in this specific patient with COVID-19, which could guide clinicians on early classification and management of patients, thereby relieving the shortage of medical resource.

Medical education has also been impacted as appropriately stringent infection control policies precluded medical trainees from attending clinical teaching. Lecture-based education has been easily transferred to a digital platform, but bedside teaching has not. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of using a mixed reality (MR) headset to deliver remote bedside teaching. METHODS: Two MR sessions were led by senior doctors wearing the HoloLens headset. The trainers selected patients requiring their specialist input. The headset allowed bidirectional audiovisual communication between the trainer and trainee doctors. Trainee doctor conceptions of bedside teaching, impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bedside teaching, and the MR sessions were evaluated using pre- and postround questionnaires, using Likert scales. Data related to clinician exposure to at-risk patients and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were collected. RESULTS: Prequestionnaire respondents (n=24) strongly agreed that bedside teaching is key to educating clinicians (median 7, IQR 6-7). Postsession questionnaires showed that, overall, users subjectively agreed the MR session was helpful to their learning (median 6, IQR 5.25-7) and that it was worthwhile (median 6, IQR 5.25-7). Mixed reality versus in-person teaching led to a 79.5% reduction in cumulative clinician exposure time and 83.3% reduction in PPE use. CONCLUSIONS: This study is proof of principle that HoloLens can be used effectively to deliver clinical bedside teaching. This novel format confers significant advantages in terms of minimizing exposure of trainees to COVID-19, reducing PPE use, enabling larger attendance, and delivering convenient and accessible real-time clinical training.","output":"Using Mixed Reality Headsets to Deliver Remote Bedside Teaching During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Feasibility Trial of HoloLens 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a novel pandemic disease and was first identified in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.

TAb and SNAb levels were compared with avidity in previously infected individuals at 1.3 and 6.2 months post-infection in paired samples from 80 COVID-19 patients. Sera from SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals were also evaluated for antibody avidity. RESULTS: The newly designed avidity assay in this TOP panel correlated well with a reference Bio-Layer Interferometry avidity assay (r=0.88). The imprecision of the TOP avidity assay was less than 10%. Although TAb and neutralization activity (by SNAb) decreased between 1.3 and 6.2 months post-infection, the antibody avidity increased significantly (P < 0.0001). Antibody avidity in 10 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals (median 28 days post-vaccination) was comparable to the measured antibody avidity in infected individuals (median 26 days post-infection).

METHODS: This study compared the medical data on the treatment of distal radius fractures in Poland in two periods: the period of the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 15 to October 15, 2020) and the corresponding period prior to the pandemic (from March 15 to October 15, 2019). We assessed detailed data from two trauma centers for pediatric and adult patients. Outpatients seeking medical attention at emergency departments and inpatients undergoing surgery at trauma-orthopedic wards were evaluated. We compared epidemiological data, demographic data, treatment type, and hospital stay duration. RESULTS: The total number of patients hospitalized due to DRF during the pandemic was 180, it was 15.1% lower than that from the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period (212). In the case of adult patients, the total number of those hospitalized during the pandemic decreased significantly (by 22%) from 132 to 103 patients. Analysis of the individual treatment methods revealed that the number of adults who underwent conservative treatment was considerably (by 30.3%) significantly lower in the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, from 119 to 83 patients.

This paper explores the synergy between VR environments and adaptive-based learning and tests the proposed approach in the railway sector. An iterative co-design approach is adopted to develop a VR-based training system for educating train conductors. The developed system is validated with ten conductors, where their learning preference, learning outcome, and learning performance were assessed. The results show an increase in individual motivation and perceived usefulness for the developed VR-based training system, demonstrating a higher learning preference, in comparison to the currently used physical simulator. Similarly, the results outline a knowledge gain in two out of six key knowledge subjects for conductor education and indicate that time improvements per exercise are needed to meet organizational performance goals. Consequently, this research presents an attractive alternative to costly and product-specific physical simulators and offers three strategic managerial implications opening new opportunities for using VR in developing learning training programmes.

We estimated risk-standardized vaccination rates among short- and long-stay NH residents by U.S. county and identified drivers of geographic variation. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study utilizing 100% of 2013-2015 fee-for-service Medicare claims, Minimum Data Set assessments, Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reports, and LTCFocUS. We separately evaluated short-stay (<100 days) and long-stay ([]100 days) residents aged []65 years old across the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 influenza seasons. We estimated county-level risk-standardized vaccination rates (RSVRs) via hierarchical logistic regression adjusting for 32 resident-level covariates. We then used multivariable linear regression models to assess associations between county-level NHs predictors and RSVRs. Results: The overall study cohort consisted of 2,817,217 residents in 14,658 NHs across 2,798 counties. Short-stay residents had lower RSVRs than long-stay residents (2013-2014: median [IQR], 69.6% [62.8-74.5] vs 84.0% [80.8-86.4]).

Several modifiable facility-level characteristics were associated with increased RSVRs, including higher registered nurse to total nurse ratio and higher total staffing for licensed practical nurses, speech language pathologists, and social workers. Characteristics associated with lower RSVRs included higher percentage of residents restrained, with a pressure ulcer, and NH-level hospitalizations per resident-year. Conclusions: Substantial county-level variation in influenza vaccine use exists among short- and long-stay NH residents.

Two-year outcomes included aneurysm-related morbidity (endoleaks and morphology changes), aneurysm-related mortality, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS Fifty-one patients were enrolled between October 2009 and October 2010, with at least one endograft implanted in 50 patients. After the regulatory study successfully completed its primary end point and expanded to a continued-access phase, 15 additional patients were enrolled in the continued-access arm of the study from February 2011 until September 2011, for a total treatment group of 66 patients for the early results and 65 patients for the long-term clinical results with imaging evaluation. There was one 30-day death (1.5%), two patients (3%) with spinal cord ischemia, and two central strokes (3%) 30 days. Five patients (7.6%) died 1 year; 1 of ascending aortic aneurysm rupture, 2 of cardiac disease, and 2 of respiratory failure. The core laboratory adjudicated 1-month imaging in 60 patients (92.3%), where nine endoleaks (15.0%) were identified (1 type Ia, 4 type II, and 4 indeterminate). Forty-five patients (69.2%) had 2-year imaging with five endoleaks (11.1%; two type II and three indeterminate), and one patient had a distal aortic dilatation that required a secondary intervention. At 2 years, 20 of 38 imaged patients (52.6%) had aneurysm shrinkage 5 mm, 15 (39.5%) had no change in diameter, and three patients (7.9%) had an increase in aneurysm diameter of 5 mm. There were no conversions, fractures, compressions, or aneurysm ruptures of the treated segment through 2 years. CONCLUSIONS This next-generation thoracic endograft has a low rate of major device events through 2 years, with no graft compressions or device failures. The data for this new endograft demonstrate favorable outcomes and confirm low risks for treatment for patients with TAA. Follow-up will be continued for 5 years.","output":"Results of a prospective multicenter trial of CTAG thoracic endograft."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The detection of multiple viruses is important for pathogenic diagnosis and disease control. Microarray detection is a good method, but requires complex procedures for multiple virus detection. Methods: We developed a novel PCR assay, the microarray-in-a-tube system, which integrates multiple PCR processes and DNA microarrays for multiple virus detection. A 5  5 oligonucleotide microarray for detecting 4 respiratory tract viruses (severe acute respiratory syndromeCassociated coronavirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and enterovirus) with inner controls was arranged on the inner surface of a specially designed Eppendorf cap with a flat, optically transparent window. Results: We were able to perform all detection processes in the encapsulated system without opening the cap. The 4 viruses were successfully amplified by one-step reverse transcriptionCPCR in the encapsulated tube. After the PCR process, the microarray-in-a-tube was inverted, and the fluorescence-labeled PCR products were directly hybridized on the microarray. Hybridization signals were obtained with an ordinary fluorescent microscope. The sensitivity of the system for virus detection reached 10(2) copies/L. With the help of inner controls, the system provided reliable results without false negatives and false positives. Conclusions: The microarray-in-a-tube system is a rapid, labor-saving tool for multiple virus detection with several advantages, such as convenience, prevention of cross-contamination of the PCR products, and potential for multiple-gene detection.","output":"Microarray-in-a-Tube for Detection of Multiple Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Widely distributed in water environments and in soil, cyanobacteria are hosts of lysogenic or lytic bacterioviruses.

A number of COVID-19 late phase trial platforms have been developed to investigate (often repurposed) drugs both in the UK and globally (e.g. RECOVERY led by the University of Oxford and SOLIDARITY led by WHO). There is a pressing need to investigate novel candidates within early phase trial platforms, from which promising candidates can feed into established later phase platforms. AGILE grew from a UK-wide collaboration to undertake early stage clinical evaluation of candidates for SARS-CoV-2 infection to accelerate national and global healthcare interventions. METHODS/DESIGN: AGILE is a seamless phase I/IIa platform study to establish the optimum dose, determine the activity and safety of each candidate and recommend whether it should be evaluated further. Each candidate is evaluated in its own trial, either as an open label single arm healthy volunteer study or in patients, randomising between candidate and control usually in a 2:1 allocation in favour of the candidate. Each dose is assessed sequentially for safety usually in cohorts of 6 patients. Once a phase II dose has been identified, efficacy is assessed by seamlessly expanding into a larger cohort. AGILE is completely flexible in that the core design in the master protocol can be adapted for each candidate based on prior knowledge of the candidate (i.e. population, primary endpoint and sample size can be amended). This information is detailed in each candidate specific trial protocol of the master protocol. DISCUSSION: Few approved treatments for COVID-19 are available such as dexamethasone, remdesivir and tocilizumab in hospitalised patients. The AGILE platform aims to rapidly identify new efficacious and safe treatments to help end the current global COVID-19 pandemic. We currently have three candidate specific trials within this platform study that are open to recruitment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different locations of pain, according to DC/TMD clinical assessment, were considered: temporomandibular joint (TMJ), masticatory muscles, head, and neck. Sixty patients were assigned randomly to one of three treatment groups (20 patients in each): group BA received body acupuncture, group EA received electroacupuncture, and group CA received acupuncture + cupping. The groups were compared in terms of pain (verbal numeric scale), pain-related disability (Brief Inventory Pain, BPI), and impression of the treatment's effectiveness (Patients' Global Impression of Improvement Scale, PGI-I). These were recorded before sessions of acupuncture treatment (T0), after 8 sessions of acupuncture treatment (T1), and after 4 weeks of follow-up after treatment (T2). The between-group and within-group differences in the data were analyzed statistically. The baseline characteristics were similar in all groups (p > 0.05). RESULTS: Significant improvements were noted in all types of pain compared to baseline values in all groups (all p < 0.05). No significant differences were noted in the improvement of TMDs-related pain according to the different acupuncture techniques (all p > 0.05). All acupuncture methods used resulted to be significantly effective in improving the pain-related interference in the patient's common activities and quality of life. EA resulted to be significantly more effective than BA and CA in improving the interference of pain with patients' mood (p=0.015) and quality of sleep (p=0.014).

However, lung epithelial cells are increasingly recognized as active effectors of microbial defence, contributing to both innate and adaptive immune function in the lower respiratory tract. These cells express an ample repertoire of pattern recognition receptors with specificity for conserved microbial and host motifs. Modern molecular techniques have uncovered the complexity of the lower respiratory tract microbiome. The interaction between the microbiota and the airway epithelium is key to understanding how stable immune homeostasis is maintained. Loss of epithelial integrity following exposure to infection can result in the onset of inflammation in susceptible individuals and may culminate in lung disease. Here we discuss the current knowledge regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the pulmonary epithelium interacts with the lung microbiome in shaping immunity in the lung. Specifically, we focus on the interactions between the lung microbiome and the cells of the conducting airways in modulating immune cell regulation, and how defects in barrier structure and function may culminate in lung disease. Understanding these interactions is fundamental in the search for more effective therapies for respiratory diseases.","output":"Respiratory microbiome and epithelial interactions shape immunity in the lungs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a type of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus that was discovered in 2019.

This study tested for associations between ambulatory joint loading (total joint moment, TJM, and vertical ground reaction force, vGRF) and changes in serum levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) in response to a mechanical stimulus (30-minute walk) in individuals with ACL reconstruction. Twenty-five subjects (mean age: 34.59.8 years; 2.20.2 years post-surgery) with primary unilateral ACL reconstruction underwent gait analysis for assessment of peak vGRF and TJM first (TJM1) and second (TJM2) peaks. Serum COMP concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immediately before, 3.5-hours, and 5.5-hours after a 30-minute walk. Pearson correlation coefficients and backwards stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, with adjustments for age, sex, BMI and between-limb speed difference, assessed associations between changes in COMP and between limb-differences in joint loading parameters. Greater TJM1 (R=0.542, p=0.005), TJM2 (R=0.460, p=0.021), and vGRF (R=0.577,p=0.003) in the ACL-reconstructed limb as compared to the contralateral limb were associated with higher COMP values 3.5-hours following the 30-minute walk. Change in COMP at 5.5-hours became a significant predictor of the between-limb difference in TJM1 and vGRF in multivariate analyses after accounting for between-limb speed difference. These results demonstrate that higher TJM and vGRF in the ACLR limb as compared to the contralateral limb are associated with higher relative COMP levels 3.5-hours and 5.5-hours after a 30-minute walk.

We sought to examine the expression pattern of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell-entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the role of lung progenitor cells in children and older patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed clinical features in a cohort of 299 patients with COVID-19. The expression and distribution of ACE2 and lung progenitor cells were systematically examined using a combination of public single-cell RNA-seq datasets, lung biopsies, and ex vivo infection of lung tissues with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in children and older adults. We also followed up patients who had recovered from COVID-19. RESULTS: Compared with children, older patients (> 50 yrs.) were more likely to develop into serious pneumonia with reduced lymphocytes and aberrant inflammatory response (p = 0.001). The expression level of ACE2 and lung progenitor cell markers were generally decreased in older patients. Notably, ACE2 positive cells were mainly distributed in the alveolar region, including SFTPC positive cells, but rarely in airway regions in the older adults (p < 0.01). The follow-up of discharged patients revealed a prolonged recovery from pneumonia in the older (p < 0.025). CONCLUSION: Compared to children, ACE2 positive cells are generally decreased in older adults and mainly presented in the lower pulmonary tract. The lung progenitor cells are also decreased.

Ten healthy middle-aged and older adult subjects orally ingested a solution containing 25 g of isomaltulose (ISI trial) and sucrose (SSI trial) in a crossover study. In the SSI trial, the brachialCankle (ba) pulse wave velocity (PWV) increased 30, 60, and 90 min after ingestion compared with that before ingestion (p < 0.01); however, in the ISI trial, the baPWV did not change after ingestion compared with that before ingestion.

Previous studies have suggested that different host ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genetic backgrounds might contribute to differences in the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity. Recent studies have also shown that variants in 15 genes related to type I interferon immunity to influenza virus might predispose patients toward life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. Other genes (SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, XCR1, IL6, CTSL, ABO, and FURIN) and HLA alleles have also been implicated in the response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Currently, Brazil has recorded the third-highest number of COVID-19 cases worldwide. We aimed to investigate the genetic variation present in COVID-19-related genes in the Brazilian population. We analyzed 27 candidate genes and HLA alleles in 954 admixed Brazilian exomes. We used the information available in two public databases ( http://www.bipmed.org and http://abraom.ib.usp.br/ ) and additional exomes from individuals born in southeast Brazil, the region of the country with the highest number of COVID-19 patients. Variant allele frequencies were compared with the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 (1KGP) and gnomAD databases. We detected 395 nonsynonymous variants; of these, 325 were also found in the 1KGP and/or gnomAD. Six of these variants were previously reported to influence the rate of infection or clinical prognosis of COVID-19. The remaining 70 variants were identified exclusively in the Brazilian sample, with a mean allele frequency of 0.0025. In silico analysis revealed that seven of these variants are predicted to affect protein function. Furthermore, we identified HLA alleles previously associated with the COVID-19 response at loci DQB1 and DRB1. Our results showed genetic variability common to other populations and rare and ultrarare variants exclusively found in the Brazilian population.

Pandemic conditions have resulted in stress in the workplace and led to anxiety among healthcare workers (HCWs), having negative impacts on different aspects of their lives, including their sexual function. AIM: To evaluate the changes in the anxiety status of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of anxiety on their sexual functions. METHODS: This is a longitudinal study based on an online survey conducted from April 2020 to February 2021 in hospitals designated as pandemic healthcare centers. An online survey link was sent to HCWs that provided consent for participation in the study. The anxiety status of the participants was assessed using the State Anxiety Inventory, and sexual function was evaluated using the International Index of Erectile FunctionC15 for men and Female Sexual Function Index for women. OUTCOMES: Scores obtained at the beginning of the pandemic were compared with those obtained at six months into the pandemic to determine the changes in the anxiety levels and sexual functions of the HCWs. RESULTS: A total of 399 HCWs participated in the survey, and the median age was 32 (20C60) years. Compared to the beginning of the pandemic, there was a significant increase in the State Anxiety Inventory score of the female and male HCWs at the sixth month of the pandemic. Among the women, the mean total Female Sexual Function Index score was 23.55  8.69 at the beginning of the pandemic and 21.428.91 at the sixth month, and there was a significant decrease in all parameters except pain. Among the men, the International Index of Erectile FunctionC15 total score was 62.75  12.51 at the beginning of the pandemic and 55.1  12.87 at the sixth month, indicating a significant decrease in all parameters. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Considering that the pandemic will continue for a long time, more psychological support should be provided, and interventions should be made to protect the mental health of HCWs. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: The strength of the study is that it had a fairly high number of participants across several institutions. However, being conducted in one country and the sample not being randomly selected and being based on voluntariness can be considered as limitations. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the anxiety levels of both female and male HCWs, and this situation has negatively affected their sexual functions.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychosexual functions of healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Mental health problems (MHP) in COVID-19 patients and survivors were anticipated already during early stages of this pandemic. We aimed to synthesize the prevalence of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic and general distress of major virus epidemics since 2002. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase from 2002 until April 14, 2021 for peer-reviewed studies reporting prevalence of MHP in adults with laboratory-confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-1, H1N1, MERS-CoV, H7N9, Ebolavirus, or SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included studies that assessed MHP with well-validated and frequently used scales. A three-level random-effects meta-analysis for dependent sizes was conducted to account for multiple outcome reporting. We pooled MHP jointly and separately for mild or moderate-to-severe severity by acute (one month), ongoing (one to three month), and post-illness phase (longer than three months). A meta-regression was conducted to test for moderating effects. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020194535. Findings: We identified 59 studies providing a total of 187 effect sizes. Range for sample size (n=14-n=1002), females (22-79%), and mean age (32-72 years). MHP prevalence was higher for mild (35.5-46.3%) compared to moderate-to-severe MPH (17.3-22.3). MHP, in general, decreased from acute to post-illness from 46.3% to 38.8% and for mild and moderate-to-severe from 22.3% to 18.8%, respectively. We found no evidence of moderating effects except for non-random sampling and H1N1 showing higher proportions. Interpretation: MHP decreased over time but were still on a substantial level at post-illness. This highlights a need for rapid access to mental health care and rehabilitation planning in affected individuals.","output":"Post-viral mental health sequelae: Systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence proportions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics of the patients with COVID-19 complicated by pneumothorax have not been clarified.

However, the organizational implementation rate of succession management is often low C and even where present, may be mere lip service. Previous studies in the field mostly focus on the role of boards or executive directors in succession management. Grounded in shared leadership theory, this study takes a broader perspective, and stresses the shared responsibilities among boards, executive directors/division executives, and human resource (HR) professionals within the succession management process. As such, the study's framework comprises three components: shared leadership, the succession management process, and nonprofit leadership continuity as an outcome variable. The results of a large online survey in Germany (N = 1020) show that only 12.3% of responding nonprofit organizations in Germany practice tripartite shared leadership in succession management. However, applying partial least squares analysis indicates, for example, a positive relationship of shared leadership behavior among boards, executive directors/division executives, and HR professionals with the likelihood of a systematic succession management process, as well as nonprofit leadership continuity. Reflecting on our findings and current threats to nonprofits, such as COVID-19, we conclude by offering practical implications for nonprofit decision-makers and for academia. Among other things, we argue that nonprofit practice should push for more (tripartite) shared leadership to improve succession management and leadership continuity. ? 2022 The Authors.

Individuals at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection are receiving additional vaccine doses in addition to the regimen that was tested in clinical trials. Risks and adverse event profiles associated with additional vaccine doses are currently not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of third-dose vaccination with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Capproved COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted using electronic health record (EHR) data from December 2020 to October 2021 from the multistate Mayo Clinic Enterprise. Participants included all 47 999 individuals receiving 3-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccines within the study setting who met study inclusion criteria. Participants were divided into 2 cohorts by vaccine brand administered and served as their own control groups, with no comparison made between cohorts. Data were analyzed from September through November 2021. EXPOSURES: Three doses of an FDA-authorized COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Vaccine-associated adverse events were assessed via EHR report. Adverse event risk was quantified using the percentage of study participants who reported the adverse event within 14 days after each vaccine dose and during a 14-day control period, immediately preceding the first vaccine dose. RESULTS: Among 47 999 individuals who received 3-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, 38 094 individuals (21 835 [57.3%] women; median [IQR] age, 67.4 [52.5-76.5] years) received BNT162b2 (79.4%) and 9905 individuals (5099 [51.5%] women; median [IQR] age, 67.7 [59.5-73.9] years) received mRNA-1273 (20.6%). Reporting of severe adverse events remained low after the third vaccine dose, with rates of pericarditis (0.01%; 95% CI, 0%-0.02%), anaphylaxis (0%; 95% CI, 0%-0.01%), myocarditis (0%; 95% CI, 0%-0.01%), and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (no individuals) consistent with results from earlier studies. Significantly more individuals reported low-severity adverse events after the third dose compared with after the second dose, including fatigue (2360 individuals [4.92%] vs 1665 individuals [3.47%]; P < .001), lymphadenopathy (1387 individuals [2.89%] vs 995 individuals [2.07%]; P < .001), nausea (1259 individuals [2.62%] vs 979 individuals [2.04%]; P < .001), headache (1185 individuals [2.47%] vs 992 individuals [2.07%]; P < .001), arthralgia (1019 individuals [2.12%] vs 816 individuals [1.70%]; P < .001), myalgia (956 individuals [1.99%] vs 784 individuals [1.63%]; P < .001), diarrhea (817 individuals [1.70%] vs 595 individuals [1.24%]; P < .001), fever (533 individuals [1.11%] vs 391 individuals [0.81%]; P < .001), vomiting (528 individuals [1.10%] vs 385 individuals [0.80%]; P < .001), and chills (224 individuals [0.47%] vs 175 individuals [0.36%]; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that although third-dose vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased reporting of low-severity adverse events, risk of severe adverse events remained comparable with risk associated with the standard 2-dose regime. These findings suggest the safety of third vaccination doses in individuals who were eligible for booster vaccination at the time of this study.","output":"Surveillance of Safety of 3 Doses of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccination Using Electronic Health Records"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The severe acute respiratory syndrome novel corona virus-2 (SARS-nCoV-2) which is an enveloped RNA virus was defined as the cause of Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms can also be observed in COVID-19 patients This study was performed to evaluate the association between GI symptoms and laboratory results Methods: This retrospective study was carried out in the University of Health Sciences Turkey, Istanbul Haseki Health Training and Research Hospital between 11th March and 1st June 2020 This study consisted of a total of 159 patients with COVID-19 COVID-19 infection was defined via a positive nasal and pharyngeal swab test All symptoms of patients were recorded Study patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of GI symptoms or not Results: There were 41 patients in the group with GI and 118 were in the group without GI symptoms Nausea and/or vomiting were observed in 29, diarrhea in 20 and abdominal pain in 10 patients Percentages of anosmia (loss of smell sense) and ageusia (loss of taste sense) increased in patients with GI symptoms than the other group (p=0 005 and &lt;0 0001) The mean serum aspartate amino transferase (AST) level elevated in COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms (p=0 022) Conclusion: Anosmia and ageusia increased significantly in COVID-19 patients with GI Serum C-reactive protein and AST levels statistically increased in COVID-19 patients with GI","output":"Evaluation of the Association between Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Laboratory Outcomes in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Rhabdomyolysis (RM) in exertional heatstroke (EHS) often leads to multiple organ dysfunction including acute kidney injury (AKI). Studies have shown that serum creatine kinase (CK) >1000 U/L as a serological diagnostic criterion for RM does not reflect the risk of AKI or mortality. METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study included all patients with EHS who were admitted to intensive care unit between January 2008 and June 2019. Serum myoglobin (sMb) was studied as the serological marker of RM and compared with CK. Outcome events were AKI and 90-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 161 patients were enrolled, of whom 52 (32.3%) had sMb 1000 ng/mL. Patients with sMb 1000 ng/mL had higher SOFA score, higher APACHE II score, lower GCS score, and higher incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute myocardial injury, acute liver injury, AKI, and 90-day mortality than patients with sMb <1000 ng/mL. Lymphocytes, neutrophils, D-Dimer were risk factors for AKI in patients with sMb 1000 ng/mL. Curve fitting showed a curved relationship between sMb and EHS-induced AKI but not CK. sMb 1000 ng/mL showed better predictive ability for AKI (area under curve: 0.786). APACHE II, SOFA, and GCS scores were risk factors for 90-day mortality in patients with sMb 1000 ng/mL.

It is well accepted that a breakdown of the normally impermeant epithelial barrier of the intestine, the lung, and the kidney is associated with the development of inflammatory disease in these organs, yet significant controversy exists as to how this breakdown actually occurs, and how such a breakdown may lead to inflammation. In this regard, much work has focused upon the role of the epithelium as an innocent bystander, a target of a leukocyte-mediated inflammatory cascade that leads to its destruction in the mucosal inflammatory process. However, recent evidence from a variety of laboratories indicates that the epithelium is not merely a passive component in the steps that lead to mucosal inflammation, but is a central participant in the process. In addressing this controversy, we and others have determined that epithelial cells express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the innate immune system, and that activation of TLRs by endogenous and exogenous ligands may play a central role in determining the balance between a state of mucosal homeostasis, as is required for optimal organ function, and mucosal injury, leading to mucosal inflammation and barrier breakdown. In particular, activation of TLRs within intestinal epithelial cells leads to the development of cellular injury and impairment in mucosal repair in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation, while activation of TLRs in the lung and kidney may participate in the development of pneumonitis and nephritis respectively. Recent work in support of these concepts is extensively reviewed, while essential areas of further study that are required to determine the significance of epithelial TLR signaling during states of health and disease are outlined.","output":"No Longer an Innocent Bystander: Epithelial Toll-Like Receptor Signaling in the Development of Mucosal Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Philosophers of medicine have formulated different accounts of the concept of disease.

In response, telerehabilitation (TR) has emerged as alternative care model. Aims were: (1) describe baseline patient characteristics and available unadjusted outcomes for episodes of care administered during COVID-19 using TR vs. traditional in-person care, (2) describe TR frequency levels by condition and telecommunication modes. METHODS: A descriptive retrospective observational design was used to report patient variables and outcomes including physical function, number of visits, and patient satisfaction, by TR frequency (few, most, or all visits) and telecommunication modes. Standardized differences were used to compare baseline characteristics between episodes with and without TR. RESULTS: Sample consisted of 222,680 patients [59% female; mean age (SD) = 55(18)]. Overall TR rate was 6% decreasing from 10% to 5% between 2(nd) and 3(rd) quarters of 2020. Outcome measures were available for 90% to 100% of episodes. Thirty-seven percent of clinicians administered care via TR. Patients treated using TR compared to in-person care were more likely to be younger, and live in large metropolitan areas. From those with TR, 55%, 20%, and 25% had TR during few, most, or all visits, respectively. TR care was administered equally across orthopedic body parts, with lower use for non-orthopedic conditions such as stroke, edema, and vestibular dysfunction. TR was primarily administered using synchronous (video or audio) modes. The rate of patients reported being very satisfied with their treatment results was 3% higher for no TR compared to TR. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide new knowledge about to whom and how TR is being administered during the pandemic in outpatient rehabilitation practices throughout the USA. The database assessed was found to be suitable for conducting studies on associations between TR and diverse outcome measures, controlling for a comprehensive set of patient characteristics, to advance best TR care models, and promote high quality care. IMPACT: This study provided detailed and robust descriptive information using an existing national patient database containing patient health and demographic characteristics, outcome measures, and TR administration data. Findings support the feasibility to conduct future studies on associations between TR care and patient outcomes, adjusting for a wide range of patient characteristics and clinical setting factors that may be associated with the probability of receiving TR. Finding of limited and decreasing use of TR over the study period calls for studies aimed to better understand facilitators and inhibitors of TR use by rehabilitation therapists during everyday practice to promote its use when clinically appropriate.","output":"Telerehabilitation During the Covid-19 Pandemic in Outpatient Rehabilitation Settings: A Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergence of coronaviruses poses a threat to global health and economy.

Here, increased ENPP2 mRNA levels were detected in immune cells from nasopharyngeal swab samples of COVID-19 patients, and increased ATX serum levels were found in severe COVID-19 patients. ATX serum levels correlated with the corresponding increased serum levels of IL-6 and endothelial damage biomarkers, suggesting an interplay of the ATX/LPA axis with hyperinflammation and the associated vascular dysfunction in COVID-19. Accordingly, dexamethasone (Dex) treatment of mechanically ventilated patients reduced ATX levels, as shown in two independent cohorts, indicating that the therapeutic benefits of Dex include the suppression of ATX. Moreover, large scale analysis of multiple single cell RNAseq datasets revealed the expression landscape of ENPP2 in COVID-19 and further suggested a role for ATX in the homeostasis of dendritic cells, that exhibit both numerical and functional deficits in COVID-19.

Serological assays are essential for community screening, assessing infection prevalence, aiding identification of infected patients, and enacting appropriate treatment and quarantine protocols in the battle against this rapidly expanding pandemic. Antibody detection by agglutination-PCR (ADAP) is a pure solution phase immunoassay that generates a PCR amplifiable signal when patient antibodies agglutinate DNA-barcoded antigen probes into a dense immune complex. Here, we present an ultrasensitive and high-throughput automated liquid biopsy assay based on the Hamilton Microlab ADAP STAR automated liquid-handling platform, which was developed and validated for the qualitative detection of total antibodies against spike protein 1 (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 that uses as little as 4 L of serum. To assess the clinical performance of the ADAP assay, 57 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 223 control patients were tested.

Going beyond mere epidemiological tallying, the potential for racial-justice interventions, including reparations payments, to ameliorate these disparities has not been adequately explored. METHODS: We compared the COVID-19 time-varying Rt curves of relatively disparate polities in terms of social equity (South Korea vs. Louisiana). Next, we considered a range of reproductive ratios to back-calculate the transmission rates ?iaj for 4a?cells of the simplified next-generation matrix (from which R0 is calculated for structured models) for the outbreak in Louisiana. Lastly, we considered the potential structural effects monetary payments as reparations for Black American descendants of persons enslaved in the U.S. would have had on pre-intervention ?iaj and consequently R0. RESULTS: Once their respective epidemics begin to propagate, Louisiana displays Rt values with an absolute difference of 1.3-2.5 compared to South Korea. It also takes Louisiana more than twice as long to bring Rt below 1. Reasoning through the consequences of increased equity via matrix transmission models, we demonstrate how the benefits of a successful reparations program (reflected in the ratio ?bab/?waw) could reduce R0 by 31-68%. DISCUSSION: While there are compelling moral and historical arguments for racial-injustice interventions such as reparations, our study considers potential health benefits in the form of reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk.

COVID-19 IgG antibodies were positive with negative COVID-19 PCR, indicative of remote COVID 19 infection. Cardiac MRI did not show any myocarditis or infiltrative disease, and otherwise revealed a structurally normal heart. Lyme disease antibodies were negative. Toxicology screen was negative. Thyroid ultrasound showed diffuse heterogeneity of the gland. 72 hour telemetry monitoring revealed no further conduction abnormalities. At this point, CHB wes attributed to hyperthyroidism. As this was reversible, and CHB resolved after initiation of methimazole, a permanent pacemaker was not placed. He was discharged with a 30-day event monitor which did not show any conduction abnormalities. Conclusion: This case highlights a rare sequela of hyperthyroidism induced CHB. Although the pathophysiology is not well understood, a proposed mechanism is the direct toxic effect of T3 leading to focal inflammation of the AV node. Further studies are needed to evaluate the pathophysiology and chronicity of this process, which will assist in the decision to implant a permanent pacemaker.","output":"Grave Danger: Rare Case of Complete Heart Block Secondary to Graves Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the current study was to examine mental health effects of the first wave of COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease-19) in Cyprus. Accordingly, 388 individuals aged 18-65+ responded to the Components of Mental Health Questionnaire that was distributed via social media for two weeks assessing how emotional distress, support and interest in self and others, lifestyle changes, engagement in protective measures, and avoidant behaviors were related to participants' gender, age, and place of residency. Additionally, we measured the level of concern of individuals during and after the first wave outbreak of the pandemic. The results suggest that (a) females experience higher levels of anxiety, stress, fear, worry, and despair than males and are more likely to undertake protective measures, (b) older individuals and those who live in urban areas perceive greater social support and interest in the emotional experience of significant others, (c) emotional distress and support and interest in self and others are associated with all other variables, indicating the importance of these constructs to the experience of a pandemic, and (d) there was a decrease in participants' concern after the end of the first wave of the pandemic.

Although these illnesses are biologically very different, the ability for phylogenetic retrodiction based on the genomic reads is common between them and thus tree-based principles and assumptions are shared. Just as the different frequencies of tumor genomic variants presupposes the existence of multiple tumor clones and provides a handle to computationally infer them, we postulate that the different variant frequencies in viral reads offers the means to infer multiple co-infecting sublineages. RESULTS: We present a common methodological framework to infer the phylogenomics from genomic data, be it reads of SARS-CoV-2 of multiple COVID-19 patients or bulk DNAseq of the tumor of a cancer patient. We describe the Concerti computational framework for inferring phylogenies in each of the two scenarios.To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, we reproduce some known results in both scenarios. We also make some additional discoveries. CONCLUSIONS: Concerti successfully extracts and integrates information from multi-point samples, enabling the discovery of clinically plausible phylogenetic trees that capture the heterogeneity known to exist both spatially and temporally. These models can have direct therapeutic implications by highlighting birth of clones that may harbor resistance mechanisms to treatment, death of subclones with drug targets, and acquisition of functionally pertinent mutations in clones that may have seemed clinically irrelevant. Specifically in this paper we uncover new potential parallel mutations in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the context of cancer, we identify new clones harboring resistant mutations to therapy.

The dsRNAs were extracted from symptomless pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh] plants cv. Erra Kandulu. This new virus with 4.64 kb genome was tentatively named Arhar cryptic virus-1 (ArCV-1). The genomic RNAs were amplified and characterized by sequence independent single primer amplification. The dsRNAs shared a highly conserved 16 nt 5 non-coding region (5-GATAATGATCCAAGGA-3). The largest dsRNA (dsRNA-1) was identified as the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (replicase), predicted to encode a putative 55.34 kDa protein (P1). The two other smaller dsRNAs (dsRNA-2 and dsRNA-3) predicted to encode for putative capsid proteins of 38.50kDa (P2) and 38.51kDa (P3), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that ArCV-1 formed a clade together with Fragaria chiloensis cryptic virus, Rosa multiflora cryptic virus and Rose cryptic virus-1, indicating that ArCV-1 could be a new member of the genus Deltapartitivirus. ArCV-1 3D(pol) structure revealed several interesting features. The 3D(pol) in its full-length shares structural similarities with members of the family Caliciviridaeand family Picornaviridae. In addition, fourth dsRNA molecule (dsRNA-2A), not related to ArCV-1 genome, was found in the same plant tissue. The dsRNA-2A (1.6 kb) encodes a protein (P4), with a predicted size of 44.5 kDa.

Healthcare workers are the high-risk group to endure the emotional outcomes brought about by the outbreak. This study assesses the mental consequences of healthcare workers during the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic in Tehran. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study on healthcare workers from two tertiary referral hospitals in Tehran province. A total of 222 of the staff participated in the study. Our questionnaires comprised Impact of Event Scale- Revised (IES-R) and 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), which were handed to participants to obtain data on their general mental problems in addition to the psychological impacts of the evolving virus on this particular group. Epidemiologic and sociodemographic information of participants, level of perceiving exposure to disease, and underlying diseases of each of them were gathered during the recruitment period. Results: Results showed high probabilities (98.2%) in mental disorders among healthcare workers. Since our study was done during the initial phase of the pandemic, development of mental issues due to the newly emerged infectious virus was expected. However, we recorded mild (41.4%) to moderate (31.5%) impact of this novel virus. The possibility of having mental problems was much higher in females, assistant nurses, individuals with lower education, and those who provided care for COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: COVID-19 has brought about increased distress among healthcare workers. Noticeably, the forefront group in combating this virus bear the most emotional complications.

We aimed to assess the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 on health care workers and non-health care workers in three different epidemic areas in China and to identify independent risk factors. Methods: We surveyed 1,020 non-health care workers and 480 health care workers in Wuhan, other cities in Hubei except Wuhan and other provinces in China except Hubei. Results: Health care workers in Hubei had higher levels of anxiety and depression than non-health care workers (p < 0.05), but there was no such difference in other provinces in China except Hubei (p > 0.05). Compared with other regions, health care workers in Wuhan was more anxious (p < 0.05), and this anxiety may be caused by concerns about occupational exposure and wearing protective clothing for a long time daily; health care workers in Hubei had more obvious depression (p < 0.05), which may be associated with long days participating in epidemic work and wearing protective clothing for a long time daily. Meanwhile, 62.5% of health care workers were proud of their work. The anxiety and depression of non-health care workers in Wuhan were also the most serious.

We have investigated what factors related to the pandemic influenced hospital presentations following self-harm during lockdown in England. Method Mental health clinicians assessing individuals aged 18 years and over presenting to hospitals in Oxford and Derby following self-harm during the period March 23rd to 17th May 2020 recorded whether the self-harm was related to the impact of COVID-19 and, if so, what specific factors were relevant. These factors were organized into a classification scheme. Information was also collected on patients demographic characteristics, method of self-harm and suicide intent. Results Of 228 patients assessed, in 46.9% (N=107) COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions were identified as influencing self-harm. This applied more to females than males (53.5%, N=68/127 v 38.6%, N=39/101, chi square = 5.03, p=0.025), but there were no differences in age, methods of self-harm or suicide intent between the two groups. The most frequent COVID-related factors were mental health issues, including new and worsening disorders, and cessation or reduction of services (including absence of face-to-face support), isolation and loneliness, reduced contact with key individuals, disruption to normal routine, and entrapment. Multiple, often inter-connected COVID-related factors were identified in many patients. Conclusions COVID-related factors were identified as influences in nearly half of individuals presenting to hospitals following self-harm in the period following introduction of lockdown restrictions. Females were particularly affected. The fact that mental health problems, including issues with delivery of care, predominated has implications for organisation of services during such periods. The contribution of isolation, loneliness and sense of entrapment highlight the need for relatives, friends and neighbours to be encouraged to reach out to others, especially those living alone. The classification of COVID-related factors can be used as an aide-memoire for clinicians.","output":"Self-harm and the COVID-19 pandemic: a study of factors contributing to self-harm during lockdown restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Designing novel antimicrobial peptides is a hot area of research in the field of therapeutics especially after the emergence of resistant strains against the conventional antibiotics.

It is an open question to obtain an estimation using a single camera without a scale reference. In this paper, we propose a novel solution called E-SEC, which estimates interpersonal distance between a pair of dynamic human objects, area occupied by a dynamic crowd, and density using a single edge camera. The E-SEC framework comprises edge CCTV cameras responsible for capturing a crowd on video frames leveraging a customized YOLOv3 model for human detection. E-SEC contributes an interpersonal distance estimation algorithm vital for monitoring the social distancing of a crowd, and an area estimation algorithm for dynamically determining an area occupied by a crowd with changing size and position. A unified output module generates the crowd size, interpersonal distances, social distancing violations, area, and density per every frame. Experimental results validate the accuracy and efficiency of E-SEC with a range of different video datasets. ? 2021 by the authors.

A forced 9-week home confinement related to COVID-19 in Spain may have worsened these symptoms. However, no study has demonstrated the impact of home confinement on neuromuscular mechanisms in the MS population. This study was aimed at analyzing the effects of a 9-week home confinement on central activation, muscle activity, contractile function, and spasticity in MS patients. METHODS: Eighteen participants were enrolled in the study. Left and right knee extensor maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), maximal neural drive via peak surface electromyography (EMG) of the vastus lateralis, central activation ratio (CAR), and muscle contractile function via electrical stimulation of the knee extensor muscles, as well as spasticity using the pendulum test, were measured immediately before and after home confinement. RESULTS: Seventeen participants completed the study. CAR significantly decreased after lockdown (ES = 1.271, p < 0.001). Regarding spasticity, there was a trend to decrease in the number of oscillations (ES = 0.511, p = 0.059) and a significant decrease in the duration of oscillations (ES = 0.568, p = 0.038). Furthermore, in the left leg, there was a significant decrease in the first swing excursion (ES = 0.612, p = 0.027) and in the relaxation index (ES = 0.992, p = 0.001). Muscle contractile properties, MVIC, and EMG variables were not modified after confinement. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a home confinement period of 9 weeks may lead to an increase in lower limb spasticity and a greater deficit in voluntary activation of the knee extensors.","output":"Impact of Lockdown during COVID-19 Pandemic on Central Activation, Muscle Activity, Contractile Function, and Spasticity in People with Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2019, a novel coronavirus first reported from China in 2019, is the causative agent of pandemic corona virus disease 2019.

This study aims to determine perceptions of physicians in our institution on the role of telemedicine in cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess its perceived benefits and barriers. Methods. This is a cross-sectional study of physicians involved in cancer care in a tertiary referral hospital in the Philippines. We administered a 21-item online survey questionnaire between August to October 2020. Results. We received and analyzed 84 physician responses. Ninety-six percent of physicians currently use telemedicine, an increase from 59% pre-pandemic. Eighty-nine percent use telemedicine for follow-up virtual consults, while 75% use telemedicine for case discussions in multidisciplinary meetings. The mean number of monthly patient consults conducted through telemedicine increased to 29.5 (SD: 24.8) from a pre-pandemic mean of 7.7 (SD: 18.7). Eighty-four percent of respondents perceived its main benefit as an infection control measure. The other perceived benefits of telemedicine include convenience (78%), accessibility to cancer care (72%), cost-effectiveness (68%), and time efficiency (44%). A quarter of the respondents believed that telemedicine has the potential to improve cancer outcomes. Ninety-two percent of the respondents expressed that they will use telemedicine occasionally in their practice. Conclusion. Telemedicine was perceived by Filipino physicians in a tertiary hospital as an acceptable solution for the provision of cancer care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Moreover, the importance of advanced imaging in these patients has not been comprehensively assessed. Purpose To estimate the frequency of radiographically occult hip fracture in elderly patients, to define the higher-risk subpopulation, and to determine the diagnostic performance of CT and bone scanning in the detection of occult fractures by using MRI as the reference standard. Materials and Methods A literature search was performed to identify English-language observational studies published from inception to September 27, 2018. Studies were included if patients were clinically suspected to have hip fracture but there was no radiographic evidence of surgical hip fracture (including absence of any definite fracture or only presence of isolated greater trochanter [GT] fracture). The rate of surgical hip fracture was reported in each study in which MRI was used as the reference standard. The pooled rate of occult fracture, diagnostic performance of CT and bone scanning, and strength of evidence (SOE) were assessed. Results Thirty-five studies were identified (2992 patients; mean age, 76.8 years  6.0 [standard deviation]; 66% female). The frequency of radiographically occult surgical hip fracture was 39% (1110 of 2835 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 35%, 43%) in studies of patients with no definite radiographic fracture and 92% (134 of 157 patients; 95% CI: 83%, 98%) in studies of patients with radiographic evidence of isolated GT fracture (moderate SOE). The frequency of occult fracture was higher in patients aged at least 80 years (44%, 529 of 1184), those with an equivocal radiographic report (58%, 71 of 126), and those with a history of trauma (41%, 977 of 2370) (moderate SOE). CT and bone scanning yielded comparable diagnostic performance in the detection of radiographically occult hip fracture (P = .67), with a sensitivity of 79% and 87%, respectively (low SOE). Conclusion Elderly patients with acute hip pain and negative or equivocal findings at initial radiography have a high frequency of occult hip fractures. Therefore, the performance of advanced imaging (preferably MRI) may be clinically appropriate in all such patients. ?

The LAMP chamber was equipped with single-use, thermally actuated valves made with a composite consisting of a mixture of PDMS and expandable microspheres. The effect of the composite composition on its expansion was investigated, and the valves performance was evaluated. In its closed state, the valve can hold pressures as high as 200 kPa without any significant leakage. Both the LAMP chamber and the valves were actuated with thin film heaters. The utility of the cassette was demonstrated by carrying out LAMP of Escherichia coli DNA target and reverse transcribed loop meditated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) of RNA targets. The amplicons were detected in real time with a portable, compact detector. The system was capable of detecting as few as 10 target molecules per sample in well under 1 h.

METHODS We performed a retrospective medical chart review of patients with glaucoma who received ripasudil or SLT as an adjuvant therapy. We collected data on 65 eyes (65 patients) with primary open-angle glaucoma, normal-tension glaucoma, or exfoliation glaucoma with at least 12 months of follow-up. IOP and number of glaucoma medications at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were compared between and within groups. A repeated-measures mixed model was used to perform statistical analysis. We also investigated factors associated with treatment success, which was defined as  20% reduction in IOP at all follow-up periods, using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Significant IOP reduction was observed at all time-points after treatment in the ripasudil group (n = 33) and in the SLT group (n = 32), with no statistically significant difference between the groups before or after treatment. Patients in the SLT group used more anti-glaucoma medications before treatment, but fewer during follow-up, than those in the ripasudil group. Regardless of treatment, higher baseline IOP was associated with treatment success [crude odds ratio: 1.21 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.38), adjusted odds ratio: 1.37 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.77)].

These observations are compatible with a bacteriophage-like behaviour of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: : We have further elaborated on these unusual findings and here we present the results of three different supplementary experiments: (1) an electron-microscope analysis of samples of bacteria obtained from a faecal sample of a subject positive to SARS-CoV-2;(2) mass spectrometric analysis of these cultures to assess the eventual de novo synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein;(3) sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 collected from plaques obtained from two different gut microbial bacteria inoculated with supernatant from faecal microbiota of an individual positive to SARS-CoV-2. Results: : Immuno-labelling with Anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein antibody confirmed presence of SARS-CoV-2 both outside and inside bacteria. De novo synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was observed, as evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is translated in the bacterial cultures. In addition, phage-like plaques were spotted on faecal bacteria cultures after inoculation with supernatant from faecal microbiota of an individual positive to SARS-CoV-2. Bioinformatic analyses on the reads obtained by sequencing RNA extracted from the plaques revealed nucleic acid polymorphisms, suggesting different replication environment in the two bacterial cultures. Conclusions: : Based on these results we conclude that, in addition to its well-documented interactions with eukaryotic cells, SARS-CoV-2 may act as a bacteriophage when interacting with at least two bacterial species known to be present in the human microbiota. If the hypothesis proposed, i.e., that under certain conditions SARS-CoV-2 may multiply at the expense of human gut bacteria, is further substantiated, it would drastically change the model of acting and infecting of SARS-CoV-2, and most likely that of other human pathogenic viruses.","output":"Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 bacteriophage potential in human gut microbiota (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a significant threat to many countries. Since the disease does not currently have a particular treatment, there is a compelling need to find substitute means to dominate its expansion.

Methods: In this study, academic databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase, were investigated. The keywords applied in the search strategy besides the names of each country were: Public Health, Public Response, Health Policy, COVID-19, Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, and SARS-COV-2. The countries included China, Italy, Iran, Spain, South Korea, Germany, France, United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, and Singapore.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of primary prophylaxis (PP) with biosimilar filgrastim-sndz in patients with intermediate risk of FN compared with secondary prophylaxis (SP) over three different cancer types. METHODS A Markov decision analytic model was constructed from the US payer perspective over a lifetime horizon to evaluate PP versus SP in patients with breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Cost-effectiveness was evaluated over a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds for incremental cost per FN avoided, life year gained, and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty. RESULTS Compared with SP, PP provided an additional 0.102-0.144 LYs and 0.065-0.130 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ranged from $5,660 in US dollars (USD) to $20,806 USD per FN event avoided, $5,123 to $31,077 USD per life year gained, and $7,213 to $35,563 USD per QALY gained. Over 1,000 iterations, there were 73.6%, 99.4%, and 91.8% probabilities that PP was cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $50,000 USD per QALY gained for breast cancer, NSCLC, and NHL, respectively. CONCLUSION PP with a biosimilar filgrastim (specifically filgrastim-sndz) is cost-effective in patients with intermediate risk for FN receiving curative chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer, NSCLC, and NHL. Expanding the use of colony-stimulating factors for patients may be valuable in reducing unnecessary health care visits for patients with cancer at risk of complications because of COVID-19 and should be considered for the indefinite future.","output":"Primary Prophylaxis With Biosimilar Filgrastim for Patients at Intermediate Risk for Febrile Neutropenia: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The commentary focuses on the spread of Covid-19 misinformation in Italy, highlighting the dynamics that have impacted on its pandemic communication.

Given that COVID-19 is transmitted via exhaled aerosols and droplets, and that exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is an established modality for sampling exhaled aerosols, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in EBC offers a promising diagnostic approach. However, current knowledge on the detection and load of the virus in EBC collected from COVID-19 patients remains limited and inconsistent. The objective of the study was to quantify the viral load in EBC collected from COVID-19 patients and to validate the feasibility of SARS-CoV-2 detection from EBC as a diagnostic test for the infection. EBC samples were collected from 48 COVID-19 patients using a collection device, and viral loads were quantified by RT-PCR targeting the E gene. Changes in detection rates and viral loads relative to patient characteristics and days since disease onset were statistically evaluated. Need for mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with higher viral load (p< 0.05). Need for oxygen administration or mechanical ventilation, less than 3 d since onset, and presence of cough or fever were significantly associated with higher detection rates (p< 0.05). Among spontaneously breathing patients, viral load in EBC attenuated exponentially over time. The detection rate was 86% at 2 d since onset and deteriorated thereafter. In mechanically ventilated patients, detection rate and viral load were high regardless of days since onset.

In parallel with the revealed tight association between ASD risk and severity and Zn status, the particular mechanisms linking Zn2+ and ASD pathogenesis like modulation of synaptic plasticity through ProSAP/Shank scaffold, neurotransmitter metabolism, and gut microbiota, have been elucidated. The increasing body of data indicate the potential involvement of Zn2+ metabolism in neurodegeneration. Systemic Zn levels in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease were found to be reduced, whereas its sequestration in brain may result in modulation of amyloid  and -synuclein processing with subsequent toxic effects. Zn2+ was shown to possess adipotropic effects through the role of zinc transporters, zinc finger proteins, and Zn-2-glycoprotein in adipose tissue physiology, underlying its particular role in pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Objective: To investigate the association between hypertension as an existing comorbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: A systematic literature search in several databases was performed to identify studies that comment on hypertension as an existing comorbidity, and its effect on mortality in hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID- 19 infection.

We hypothesized that using home-based and wearable connected devices (CDs) and educating patients to react in case of abnormal variations in a set of parameters would allow patients to detect and manage their PEx early with their care team. OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study aimed to assess the feasibility and appropriate conditions of a new PEx management process from the users point of view by analyzing the experience of patients and of CF center teams regarding the education program, the use of CDs, and the relationship between the patient and the care team during PEx management. METHODS: We have been conducting a multicenter pilot study involving 36 patients with CF aged 12 years. The intervention was divided into 3 phases. In phase 1 (3 months), patients were equipped with CDs, and their parameters were collected on 3 nonconsecutive days each week. Phase 2 involved the development of a React to PEx educational program aimed at providing patients with a personalized action plan. A training session to the educational program was organized for the physicians. Physicians then determined the patients personalized alert thresholds by reviewing the data collected during phase 1 and their patients clinical history. In phase 3 (12 months), patients were educated by the physician during a clinic visit, and their action plan for reacting in timely fashion to their PEx signs was defined. Education and action plans were revised during clinic visits. At the end of the project, the patients experience was collected during semistructured interviews with a researcher as part of the qualitative study. The experience of CF teams was collected during focus groups using a semistructured guide once all their patients had finished the study. The interviews and focus groups were recorded and transcribed verbatim to be analyzed. Data from educational sessions were collected throughout the educational program to be put into perspective with the learnings reported by patients. Analyses are being led by 2 researchers using NVivo (QSR International). RESULTS: The study received the favorable reception of the Committee for the Protection of Persons (CPP NORTH WEST III) on June 10, 2017 (#2017-A00723-50). Out of the 36 patients included in phase 1, 27 were educated and entered phase 3. We completed collection of all data from the patients and care providers. Qualitative analysis will provide a better understanding of users experience on the conditions of data collection, how useful CDs are for detecting PEx, how useful the PEx action plan is for reacting quickly, what patients learned about PEx management, and the conditions for this PEx management to be sustainable in routine care. CONCLUSIONS: This study will open new perspectives for further research into the implementation of an optimal PEx care process in the organization of care teams in order to support patient self-management.

In this context, telemedicine and remote consultations may have the potential to provide healthcare minimizing virus exposure.

Even though this initiative was welcomed by 171 governments, not even a short-term violence reduction has happened in central conflict areas. This contribution examines the effects of the Corona pandemic in two regionally and globally significant conflict countries, Colombia with its fragile pacification and Syria with its militarily almost decided war. The article asks how the Corona crisis influences the dynamics of violence and peace after respectively at the end of civil wars. Colombia is a prominent example of a comprehensive peace agreement in complex conflicts. Nonetheless, the short-term, peace-related trend in times of the pandemic is ambivalent at best: While the absolute number of murders has declined, it is human right defenders and demobilized ex-combatants who remain the main victims of violence - and the number of massacres has increased again. The still-active guerilla Ejrcito de Liberacin Nacional (ELN) initially called for a one-sided truce, yet ended again in late April. In Syria, the consequences of the pandemic on the conflict dynamic have ranged from contradictory to negative: In the last rebel stronghold Idlib COVID-19 directly contributed to the months-long stabilization of the Russian-Turkish truce from March 2020. In Northeastern Syria, which is partly controlled by Turkey and partly by the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the humanitarian situation has clearly worsened since the beginning of the pandemic. The Assad regime does not allow international aid to pass through to the opposition territory. Despite diverse differences between Colombia and Syria, one crucial similarity is that the respective governments instrumentalize the crisis on the ground for the often violent consolidation of the political agenda. In the bigger picture, the experience from the two countries suggests that COVID-19 works locally less as a game-changer, but rather as intensifier or accelerator of pre-pandemic dynamics.","output":"Covid-19 als Chance fr den Frieden?: Ernchternde Erfahrungen aus Kolumbien und Syrien"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, is the predominant cause of severe enteropathogenic diarrhea in swine. A simple, rapid, specific, and sensitive method is critical for monitoring PEDV on pig farms. In this study, a simple and rapid lateral flow immunoassay detection system that integrates europium (Eu) (III) chelate microparticles was developed to identify PEDV in fecal swabs. This newly developed diagnostic sandwich immunoassay utilizes lateral flow test strips (LFTSs). The fluorescence peak heights of the test line (HT) and the control line (HC) were measured using a fluorescence strip reader, and the HT/HC ratio was used for quantitation. The limit of detection of PEDV with this LFTS was ten times the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per mL. Fecal swab samples were used to determine the cutoff value. Field samples, various PEDV strains and other viruses were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Eu (III) chelate microparticle-based LFTSs, which were 97.8% and 100%, respectively, with a cutoff value of 0.05, as compared with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In samples from piglets experimentally infected with PEDV, the results were in high agreement with those obtained by RT-PCR. Epidemiological surveillance of PEDV using the LFTSs in areas threatened by African swine fever virus suggested that the PEDV positive rate on pig farms had significantly decreased, mainly due to the implementation of strict biosecurity measures. The results indicate that the Eu (III) chelate microparticle-based LFTS system is a rapid, sensitive, and reliable method for the identification of PEDV, indicating its suitability for epidemiological surveillance of PEDV infection.","output":"Development of a rapid and sensitive europium (III) chelate microparticle-based lateral flow test strip for the detection and epidemiological surveillance of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Welcome to the first issue of Child and Adolescent Mental Health of 2015.

The best papers not only share the achievements and successes of new research and innovation but also shed light on the complex struggles and challenges involved in helping children and young people overcome the emotional, behavioural and other mental health difficulties they endure. Child and Adolescent Mental Health aims to publish high quality health services research that informs, influences and transforms the quality and effectiveness of the mental health care available to children, young people, their parents and families. When placed in the global context outlined by Patel and Rahman (2015) in this issue, the scale of this task is daunting. Nearly half of the world's population are under the age of 18 and only a small fraction of the global mental health resources currently available are invested in child and adolescent mental health care across low, medium and high income countries. Patel and Rahman (2015) argue that the step change needed to transform global child mental health requires a bold agenda that mobilises community assets, such as lay health workers, harnesses the use of mobile and electronic health technologies alongside more conventional improvement in access and effectiveness of both universal and specialist services from early life onwards. This agenda resonates for children and young people in high income countries as much as it does for those living in low and middle income countries. Child and Adolescent Mental Health needs to reflect the global challenge of children and young people's mental health.

However, analysis of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is currently lacking. METHODS. Here, we analyzed T cell immunity directed against SARS-CoV-2 spike-, membrane-, and nucleocapsid-protein by flow cytometry and spike-specific neutralizing antibodies in 10 Tx in comparison to 26 nonimmunosuppressed (non-Tx) COVID-19 patients. RESULTS. Tx patients (7 renal, 1 lung, and 2 combined pancreas-kidney Txs) were recruited in this study during the acute phase of COVID-19 with a median time after SARS-CoV-2-positivity of 3 and 4 d for non-Tx and Tx patients, respectively. Despite immunosuppression, we detected antiviral CD4(+) T cell-response in 90% of Tx patients. SARS-CoV-2Creactive CD4(+) T cells produced multiple proinflammatory cytokines, indicating their potential protective capacity. Neutralizing antibody titers did not differ between groups. SARS-CoV-2Creactive CD8(+) T cells targeting membrane- and spike-protein were lower in Tx patients, albeit without statistical significance. However, frequencies of anti-nucleocapsidCprotein-reactive, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyfunctional CD8(+) T cells, were similar between patient cohorts. Tx patients showed features of a prematurely aged adaptive immune system, but equal frequencies of SARS-CoV-2Creactive memory T cells. CONCLUSIONS. In conclusion, a polyfunctional T cell immunity directed against SARS-CoV-2 proteins as well as neutralizing antibodies can be generated in Tx patients despite immunosuppression. In comparison to nonimmunosuppressed patients, no differences in humoral and cellular antiviral-immunity were found.

However, toxicological and epidemiological studies focusing on the adverse effects of RCFs were still insufficient, particularly in China. We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate comprehensively the associations between occupational exposure to RCFs and respiratory health effects among Chinese workers. We measured and calculated cumulative RCFexposure levels of RCFs workers from the biggest RCFs factory in China. In total, 430 RCF-exposed workers and 121 controls were enrolled in this study. Physical examinations of the respiratory system were performed and serum levels of biomarkers including Clara cell protein 16 (CC16), surfactant protein D (SP-D), transforming growth factor ?1 (TGF-?1), and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were determined among all subjects. RCF exposure workers showed a higher prevalence rate of respiratory symptoms (cough: 11.9%) and lower levels of small airways function indices (V50 %: 82.71  20.01, maximal mid expiratory flow (MMEF)%: 81.08  19.56) compared with the control group (cough: 5.0%, V50 %: 90.64  24.36, MMEF%: 88.83  24.22).

However, the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection on the incidence of diabetes is unclear. In the SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, host microRNAs (miRNAs) may target the native gene transcripts as well as the viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Here, we investigated the role of miRNAs in linking Diabetes to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human pancreas. METHODS: Differential gene expression and disease enrichment analyses were performed on an RNA-Seq dataset of human embryonic stem cell-derived (hESC) mock-infected and SARS-CoV-2-infected pancreatic organoids to obtain the dysregulated Diabetes-associated genes. The miRNA target prediction for the Diabetes-associated gene transcripts and the SARS-CoV-2 RNAs has been made to determine the common miRNAs targeting them. Minimum Free Energy (MFE) analysis was done to identify the miRNAs, preferably targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNAs over the Diabetes-associated gene transcripts. RESULTS: The gene expression and disease enrichment analyses of the RNA-Seq data have revealed five biomarker genes, i.e., CP, SOCS3, AGT, PSMB8 and CFB that are associated with Diabetes and get significantly upregulated in the pancreas following SARS-CoV-2-infection. Four miRNAs, i.e., hsa-miR-298, hsa-miR-3925-5p, hsa-miR-4691-3p and hsa-miR-5196-5p, showed preferential targeting of the SARS-CoV-2 genome over the cells Diabetes-associated messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in the human pancreas. CONCLUSION: Our study proposes that the differential targeting of the Diabetes-associated host genes by the miRNAs may lead to diabetic complications or new-onset Diabetes that can worsen the condition of COVID-19 patients.

Appropriate treatment of stroke immediately after its onset contributes to improved survival, and delay in hospitalisation after onset affect stroke severity and mortality. This study aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency hospitalisation of stroke patients in Japan and the associated changes in stroke severity and mortality. Methods: : This was an observational study that used nationwide administrative data. The participants were selected from the data of hospitalised patients diagnosed with stroke. We cross-sectionally observed the background factors of patients during April and May 2020, when COVID-19-related state of emergency was declared, and the same period in 2019. We also modelled monthly trends in the numbers of emergency stroke admissions, of stroke admissions at each level of Japan Coma Scale (JCS), and of deaths within 24 h using interrupted time series regression (ITS). Results: : There was no difference between the pre- and the COVID-19 pandemic periods in the pre-hospital baseline characteristics of patients. No significant change was seen through ITS in the number of emergency stroke admissions between the COVID-19 and the pre-COVID-19 pandemic periods (risk ratio [RR]=0.96, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 0.90C1.02, P=0.159). There was a significant difference in the JCS3 of impaired consciousness in emergency stroke patients, which was more severe during the COVID-19 pandemic than pre-COVID-19 pandemic (RR=1.16, 95%CI: 1.04C1.28, P=0.005). There was no change in the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 compared to those without COVID-19, but there were significantly more deaths within 24 h of admission.

Conclusions: : COVID-19 infection prevalence increased the number of deaths and severity of illness within 24 h of hospitalisation in Japan. However, there was no association between the number of hospital admissions or deaths with baseline characteristics.

METHODS Twenty-two participants (4 faculty, 4 senior, and 14 junior residents) were enrolled in a 4-week robotic training curriculum developed at our institution. A set of seven robotic skills were selected based on the manufacturer's exercise primary endpoint. During their pretesting session, participants completed one trial of each of the seven simulated exercises. In two individual sessions over a 2 week period, trainees practiced a different set of exercises that evaluated the same basic robotic skills assessed during pretesting with the objective of reaching an overall score of 80 % on two consecutive attempts. If proficiency was not achieved, then a maximum of six trials per exercise was allowed before advancing to the next skill. During their fourth week of training, participants completed a post-testing session with the same set of exercises used during pretesting. Participants' overall performance and various metrics were recorded in an online database for further analysis. RESULTS A significant skills gain from pre- to post-test was observed for each of the seven basic robotic skills regardless of participant's level of training (p < .001). Interestingly, participants only achieved an overall score of 80 % or more in only five of the seven exercises. No statistical difference in gain of skills was found between groups suggesting robotic skills development is independent of level of prior surgical expertise.

We compared, as much as possible, the following parameters: background conditions, spreading of the pandemics, preceded and concurrent adverse events, duration and waves of the pandemics, symptoms, implicated infectious agents/diseases and mental/psychosocial consequences. The current pandemic was preceded by a global economic crisis, which particularly affected deprived population groups, while the ancient one started on the second year of a catastrophic civil war.

Both pandemics not sparing any age, sex, nationality, social group, may have had a zoonotic component, besides being air-born. However, their spreading is/was remarkably rapid, presenting 3-4 waves and lasting for several years. Some somatic signs and symptoms of the diseases coincide.

Collectively, these findings may provide insights into the interaction between ES proteins and key host effector cells, enhancing our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying parasite immune evasion and providing new clues for novel vaccine development.","output":"Proteomic analysis revealed T cell hyporesponsiveness induced by Haemonchus contortus excretory and secretory proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Choosing software was a key component of a compassionate approach to distance pedagogywhile there were many excellent apps and services that I could choose to use, I didn't want to overload my students with learning multiple pieces of new software, especially as they would likely be asked to learn new software in other courses too 9 I continued to emphasize grading policies that made students full participants in deciding their grades through self-evaluation and instructor-student conversation, welcoming them as collaborators in their own learning 10 I designed with a commitment to accessibility by making PDFs readable by screen readers;designing our slides with san-serif fonts in high-contrast colors (avoiding red and green);and by offering ways to satisfy assignments that did not depend on the written word but embraced audio and video as a means for students to capture their thinking 11 A feminist pedagogy must be focused on such decisions, on taking into account our students' multiple responsibilities, needs, and aspirations, on the welcoming, thoughtful design of our learning management systems and major community documents like syllabi, and in a focus on care Let's also extend that care to ourselvesnot simply in the kindness of a fifteen-minute break or a walk around the block so frequently identified as a panacea for overwork, but in our attentiveness to the systems of power which surround us, which both award us authority and challenge it in the same breath A Pedagogy of Kindness is under contract with West Virginia University Press as part of their Teaching and Learning in Higher Education series 2","output":"Feminism, Pedagogy, and a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sweden's use of soft response measures early in the COVID-19 pandemic received a good deal of international attention. Within Sweden, one of the most debated aspects of the pandemic response has been COVID-19 testing and the time it took to increase testing capacity. In this article, the development of and the debate surrounding COVID-19 testing in Sweden during 2020 is described in detail, with a particular focus on the coordination between national and regional actors in the decentralised healthcare system. A qualitative case study was carried out based on qualitative document analysis with a chronological presentation. To understand COVID-19 testing in Sweden, two aspects of its public administration model emerged as particularly important: (i) the large and independent government agencies and (ii) self-governing regions and municipalities. In addition, the responsibility principle in Swedish crisis management was crucial. Overall, the results show that mass testing was a new area for coordination and involved a number of national and regional actors with partly different views on their respective roles, responsibilities and interpretations of the laws and regulations. The description shows the ambiguities in the purpose of testing and the shortcomings in communication and cooperation during the first half of 2020, but after that an increasing consistency among the crucial actors. During the first half of 2020, testing capacity in Sweden was limited and reserved to protect the most vulnerable in society. Because mass testing for viruses is not normally carried out by the 21 self-governing regions responsible for healthcare and communicable disease prevention, and the Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that there was no medical reason to test members of the public falling ill with COVID-like symptoms, the responsibility for mass testing fell through the cracks during the first few months of the pandemic. This article thus illustrates problems associated with multi-level governance in healthcare during a crisis and illustrates the discrepancy between the health service's focus on the individual and the public health-oriented work carried out within communicable disease control.","output":"COVID-19 Testing in Sweden During 2020CSplit Responsibilities and Multi-Level Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diagnosis of acute kidney injury by evaluating the activity of urinary enzymes is an important tool especially for its precocity in relation to methods of assessment of renal function considered late as the installation of injury precedes the function change.

In the southeast, beef cattle are raised predominantly on forages that may be limiting in nutrients for optimal health, especially trace minerals such as Cu, Zn, and Se. Clinical deficiencies of these nutrients produce classic symptoms that are common to several nutrient deficiencies (e.g., slow growth and unthrifty appearance); however, subclinical deficiencies are more widespread and more difficult to detect, yet may result in broader economic losses. Dietary mineral concentrations often considered adequate for maximum growth, reproductive performance, or optimal immune function have been found to be insufficient at times of physiological stress (weaning, transport, comingling, etc.), when feed intake is reduced. The impacts of these deficiencies on beef cattle health are not apparent until calves have been subjected to these stressors. Health problems that are exacerbated by mineral or vitamin deficiencies include bovine respiratory disease, footrot, retained placenta, metritis, and mastitis. Many micronutrients have antioxidant properties through being components of enzymes and proteins that benefit animal health. In dairy cattle, high levels of supplemental Zn are generally associated with reduced somatic cell counts and improved foot health, possibly reflecting the importance of Zn in maintaining effective epithelial barriers. Neutrophils isolated from ruminants deficient in Cu or Se have reduced ability to kill ingested bacteria in vitro. Supplemental vitamin E, in its role as an intracellular antioxidant has been shown to decrease morbidity in stressed calves. There is more understanding of the important biological role that these nutrients play in the functioning of the complex and multifaceted immune system. However, there is still much to be learned about determining the micronutrient status of herds (and hence when supplementation will be beneficial), requirements for different genetic and environmental conditions, understanding the bioavailability of these nutrients from feedstuffs and forages, quantifying the bioavailability of different supplemental sources of these nutrients, and identifying the impact of dietary antagonists on these nutrients.","output":"BILL E.

Minimal access nephrectomy has now become the standard of care in many units. We have adopted the hand-assisted laparoscopic live donor (HALLDN) technique, and present our initial experience with the first 24 cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS HALLDNs were performed trans-peritoneally. Primary outcomes included total operative time, warm ischaemic time, time to discharge, and post-operative complications. Warm ischaemic time was measured from the time of clamping the renal artery to the time of perfusing the kidney on the back table. RESULTS Mean total operative time was 143 minutes and mean warm ischaemic time was 188 seconds. A downward trend was displayed for operative times. Mean time to discharge was 60 hours. A right nephrectomy was performed in 2 cases. No surgical morbidity is reported. We describe 1 donor mortality. DISCUSSION Our results compare favourably with those documented in the literature.

PwID are at higher risk of mental illness and receive psychotropic prescribing off licence' also, to manage distress behaviour. The lockdown and reduction of multidisciplinary face-to-face appointments had an impact on care delivery, the recourse possibly being psychotropic prescribing. It is imperative to comprehend the influence the pandemic had on psychotropic prescribing patterns to enable future planning. AIMS: The aim was to understand the impact of the pandemic by comparing psychotropic prescribing patterns during the England lockdown with the prescribing patterns before lockdown in specialist urban and rural psychiatric services for PwID. METHOD: Data was collected from Cornwall (rural) and London (urban) intellectual disability services in England as a service evaluation project to rationalise psychotropic prescribing. PwID in both services open across January 2020 to January 2021 were included. Baseline patient demographics including age, gender, ethnicity, intellectual disability level and neurodevelopmental and psychological comorbidities were collected. Baseline psychotropic prescribing and subsequent % change for each psychotropic group for the two services was compared using Pearson's chi-square and z-statistic (two tailed) with significance taken at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The two centres London (n = 113) and Cornwall (n = 97) were largely comparable but for baseline differences in terms of presence of severe mental illness (37 v. 86, P < 0.001), challenging behaviour (44 v. 57, P < 0.05) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (37 v. 3, P < 0.001).

The peptide segments RERRRKKR  G and SIQSR  G from the high pathogenic H5N1 H5 and the low pathogenic H1N1 H1 cleavage sites were docking to the trypsin and furin active pockets, respectively. It was observed through the docking studies that trypsin was able to recognize and cleave both the high pathogenic and low pathogenic hemagglutinin, while furin could only cleave the high pathogenic hemagglutinin. An analysis of binding energies indicated that furin got most of its selectivity due to the interactions with P(1), P(4), and P(6), while having less interaction with P(2) and little interactions with P(3), P(5), P(7), and P(8). Some mutations of H5N1 H5 cleavage sequence fitted less well into furin and would reduce high pathogenicity of the virus.

However, limited information is available about the risk of HAIs in naturally ventilated wards (NVWs) and mechanically ventilated intensive care units (MVICUs) of public hospitals in the Philippines. We aimed to assess the association between HAIs and type of ventilation in an urban tertiary care hospital in the Philippines. METHODOLOGY A cross-sectional point-prevalence survey of infections was done in NVWs and MVICUs of a tertiary care hospital in December 2013. Multivariate analyses were done to examine the associations between HAIs and type of ventilation and other risk factors. RESULTS Of the 224 patients surveyed, 63 (28%) patients had 69 HAIs. Pneumonia was the most common HAI (35%). Wards near areas with high vehicular activity had more respiratory HAI cases. Being immunocompromised is a risk factor for HAI for pediatric and adult patients. Among pediatric patients, staying in MVICUs had a lower risk for HAIs (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10-1.08) compared to staying in NVWs. For adult patients, a higher risk for HAIs (AOR: 2.41; 95% CI: 0.29-18.20) was observed in MVICUs compared to NVWs. CONCLUSIONS Type of ventilation is not a risk factor for HAIs. Patients who are immunocompromised may be at a higher risk for HAI.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Patients major challenges included: (1) Persistent migrating while seeking substance use treatment services with limited or no support from their sending and hosting communities; (2) Intersectional stigmas; (3) Untreated trauma; (4) Language and cultural barriers. Clnica Bienestars service model included ten strategies to retain patients in care (e.g., Case management to identify cases with high social isolation), six emerged as central to addressing transnational challenges.","output":"En la Lucha: Strategies to Improve HIV Care for Puerto Ricans with Opioids Use Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wearable devices digitally measuring vital signs have been used for monitoring health and illness onset and have high potential for real-time monitoring and disease detection. As such they are potentially useful during public health crises, such as the current COVID-19 global pandemic. Using smartwatch data from 31 infected individuals identified from a cohort of over 5000 participants, we investigated the use of wearables for early, presymptomatic detection of COVID-19. From physiological and activity data, we first demonstrate that COVID-19 infections are associated with alterations in heart rate, steps and sleep in 80% of COVID-19 infection cases. Failure to detect these changes in the remaining patients often occurred in those with chronic respiratory/lung disease. Importantly the physiological alterations were detected prior to, or at, symptom onset in over 85% of the positive cases (21/24), in some cases nine or more days before symptoms. Through daily surveys we can track physiological changes with symptom onset and severity. Finally, we develop a method to detect onset of COVID-19 infection in real-time which detects 67% of infection cases at or before symptom onset. Our study provides a roadmap to a rapid and universal diagnostic method for the large-scale detection of respiratory viral infections in advance of symptoms, highlighting a useful approach for managing epidemics using digital tracking and health monitoring.","output":"Early Detection Of COVID-19 Using A Smartwatch"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In a pandemic, it is important for clinicians to stratify patients and decide who receives limited medical resources. In this study, we used automated machine learning (autoML) to develop and compare between multiple machine learning (ML) models that predict the chance of patient survival from COVID-19 infection and identified the best-performing model. In addition, we investigated which biomarkers are the most influential in generating an accurate model. We believe an ML model such as this could be a useful tool for clinicians stratifying hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients. Methods: The data was retrospectively collected from Clinical Looking Glass (CLG) on all patients testing positive for COVID-19 through a nasopharyngeal specimen by real-time RT-PCR and admitted between 3/1/2020-7/3/2020 (4376 patients) at our institution. We collected 47 biomarkers from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time: RT-PCR positivity, and tracked whether a patient survived or not for one month following this time. We utilized the autoML from H2O.ai, an open source package for R language. The autoML generated 20 ML models and ranked them by area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR) on the test set. We selected the best model (model_var_47) and chose a threshold probability that maximized F2 score to make a binary classifier: dead or alive. Subsequently, we ranked the relative importance of variables that generated model_var_47 and chose the 10 most influential variables. Next, we reran the autoML with these 10 variables and likewise selected the model with the best AUCPR on the test set (model_var_10). Again, threshold probability that maximized F2 score for model_var_10 was chosen to make a binary classifier. We calculated and compared the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predicate value (PPV) for model_var_10 and model_var_47. Results: The best model that autoML generated using all 47 variables was the stacked ensemble model of all models (AUCPR = 0.836). The most influential variables were: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimer, troponin, and glucose. When the autoML was retrained with these 10 most important variables, it did not significantly affect the performance (AUCPR= 0.828). For the binary classifiers, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of model_var_47 was 83.6%, 87.7%, and 69.8% respectively, while for model_var_10 they were 90.9%, 71.1%, and 51.8% respectively. Conclusions: By using autoML, we developed high-performing models that predict patient mortality from COVID-19 infection. In addition, we identified the most important biomarkers correlated with mortality. This ML model can be used as a decision supporting tool for medical practitioners to efficiently triage COVID-19 infected patients. From our literature review, this will be the largest COVID-19 patient cohort to train ML models and the first to utilize autoML.

Inhibition of ACE has been shown to improve pathology in cardiovascular disease, whilst ACE2 is cardioprotective in the failing heart. However, the mechanisms by which ACE2 mediates its cardioprotective functions have yet to be fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that both ACE and ACE2 bind integrin subunits, in an RGD-independent manner, and that they can act as cell adhesion substrates. We show that cellular expression of ACE2 enhanced cell adhesion. Furthermore, we present evidence that soluble ACE2 (sACE2) is capable of suppressing integrin signalling mediated by FAK. In addition, sACE2 increases the expression of Akt, thereby lowering the proportion of the signalling molecule phosphorylated Akt. These results suggest that ACE2 plays a role in cell-cell interactions, possibly acting to fine-tune integrin signalling. Hence the expression and cleavage of ACE2 at the plasma membrane may influence cell-extracellular matrix interactions and the signalling that mediates cell survival and proliferation. As such, ectodomain shedding of ACE2 may play a role in the process of pathological cardiac remodelling.","output":"Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 Bind Integrins and ACE2 Regulates Integrin Signalling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fenomena kasus penyebaran COVID-19 di Indonesia begitu pesat hal ini tentu sangat berdampak negatif terhadap ketenagakerjaan dan melemahnya perekonomian negara Indonesia sehingga menimbulkan implikasi nyata yang harus dihadapi banyak perusahaan untuk melakukan pemutusan hubungan kerja kepada pekerja/buruh di Indonesia secara masal.

Despite it being highly preventable, hypertension is responsible for a significant proportion of global morbidity and mortality. Common methods for controlling hypertension include prescribing anti-hypertensive medication, a pharmacological approach, and increasing physical activity, a behavioural approach. In general, little is known about the comparative effectiveness of pharmacological and behavioural approaches for reducing blood pressure in hypertension. A previous network meta-analysis suggested that physical activity interventions may be just as effective as many anti-hypertensive medications in preventing mortality; however, this analysis did not provide the comparative effectiveness of these disparate modes of intervention on blood pressure reduction. The primary objective of this study is to use network meta-analysis to compare the relative effectiveness, for blood pressure reduction, of different approaches to increasing physical activity and different first-line anti-hypertensive therapies in people with hypertension. METHODS A systematic review will be conducted to identify studies involving randomised controlled trials which compare different types of physical activity interventions and first-line anti-hypertensive therapy interventions to each other or to other comparators (e.g. placebo, usual care) where blood pressure reduction is the primary outcome. We will search the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and PsycInfo. For studies which meet our inclusion criteria, two reviewers will extract data independently and assess the quality of the literature using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Network meta-analyses will be conducted to generate estimates of comparative effectiveness of each intervention class and rankings of their effectiveness, in terms of reduction of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. DISCUSSION This study will provide evidence regarding the comparability of two common first-line treatment options for people with hypertension. It will also describe the extent to which there is direct evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of increasing physical activity and initiating anti-hypertensive therapy.

Recently, the Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination has been regarded as a potential candidate to explain this difference. Herein, we hypothesised that the past epidemic of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) may act as a latent explanatory factor for the worldwide differences seen in COVID-19 impact on mortality and incidence. We compared two indicators of past epidemic of M. tuberculosis, specifically, incidence (90 countries in 1990) and mortality (28 countries in 1950), with the mortality and incidence of COVID-19. We determined that an inverse relationship existed between the past epidemic indicators of M. tuberculosis and current COVID-19 impact. The rate ratio of the cumulative COVID-19 mortality per 1 million was 2.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09C6.68) per 1 unit decrease in the incidence rate of tuberculosis (per 100,000 people). The rate ratio of the cumulative COVID-19 incidence per 1 million was 2.07 (95% CI: 1.30C3.30). This association existed even after adjusting for potential confounders (rate of people aged 65 over, diabetes prevalence, the mortality rate from cardiovascular disease, and gross domestic product per capita), leading to an adjusted rate ratio of COVID-19 mortality of 2.44, (95% CI: 1.32C4.52) and a COVID-19 incidence of 1.31 (95% CI: 0.97C1.78).

Home lateral flow immune-antibody testing devices offer a very convenient way of doing this, but relatively little is known about how measurement and antibody variability will affect consistency in results over time. We examined consistency by looking at the outcome of two tests three months apart while COVID-19 infection rates were low (summer 2020 in the UK). MethodsThe KCL-Coronavirus Health and Experiences in Colleagues at Kings is an occupational cohort of staff and postgraduate research students. Lateral flow immune-antibody testing kits were sent to participants homes in late June 2020 and late September 2020. Participants also completed regular surveys that included asking about COVID-19 symptoms and whether they thought they had been infected. ResultsWe studied 1489 participants returned valid results in both June and September (59% of those sent kits). Lateral flow immune-antibody test was positive for 7.2% in June and 5.9% in September, with 3.9% positive in both. Being more symptomatic or suspecting infection increased the probability of ever being positive. Of those positive in June, 46% (49/107) were negative in September (seroreversion), and this was similar regardless of symptom characteristics, suspicion, and timing of possible infection. A possible outlier was those aged over 55 years, where only 3 of 13 (23%) had seroreversion. DiscussionThese results do not follow the pattern reported from studies specifically designed to monitor seropositivity, which have found greater consistency over time and the influence of presence, timing and severity of symptoms on seroreversion. We suggest several factors that may have contributed to this difference: our low bar in defining initial seropositivity (single test); a non-quantitative test known to have relatively low sensitivity; participants carrying out testing. We would encourage other studies to use these real-world performance characteristics alongside those from laboratory studies to plan and analyse any antibody testing.","output":"Unexplained longitudinal variability in COVID-19 antibody status by Lateral Flow Immuno-Antibody testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present with different grades of severity from mild to critical. Evaluation of biomarkers predicting severity is crucial to identify patients at high risk of disease progression and poor prognosis.

In this study, we investigated SAA levels at admission (T1) and after 15 days (T2) of hospitalization in two groups of patients: survivors and non-survivors. At T1, the non-survivors showed higher SAA level than survivors (74 mg/dL vs 48.75 mg/dL). At T2, the survivor group value decreased to 6.55 mg/dL, the non-survivor group still showed high levels (51.1 mg/dL). The SAA level in control group was 0.35 mg/dL. Furthermore, a cut-off value of 63 mg/dL able to discriminate survivors from non-survivors was established by ROC curve analysis at T1. At T2, the cut-off decreased to 30.9 mg/dL. A similar decreasing trend was observed for D-Dimer, hsCRP, IL-6 and procalcitonin levels.

Objectives The primary objective was to determine whether MCI differentially impacts QOL in young-onset PD (YOPD) and typical-onset PD (TOPD). Methods YOPD patients (n = 77) were diagnosed at age 50 or younger, TOPD (n = 77) were diagnosed after age 50, and the groups were matched for cognitive status, education, and disease duration. Patients' cognitive status was classified as MCI or cognitively normal (CN) based on MDS Level II criteria. QOL was assessed using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). ANCOVAs were conducted for each PDQ-39 subscale, with age of onset and cognitive status as between-subjects factors and several covariates included. Results An interaction for the Cognition domain revealed that in TOPD, PD-MCI patients reported poorer QOL than CN patients, whereas there was no effect of MCI on cognitive satisfaction in YOPD. There was a main effect of age on Emotional Well-Being, as YOPD reported poorer QOL than TOPD in this domain. There were main effects of cognitive status, with PD-MCI patients reporting worse QOL than CN patients in the domains of Social Support, Communication, ADLs, and Mobility. Conclusions The interaction revealed that PD-MCI has a greater impact on degree of cognitive concerns (\\"cognitive QOL\\") in TOPD versus YOPD.

Our data display excellent IgG/IgM specificities for all the immunocromatographic card tests (100% IgG and 100% IgM) and for the chemiluminescence-automated assay (100% IgG and 94% IgM); IgG/IgM sensitivities are moderately lower for all methods, probably due to the assay viral antigen's nature and/or to the detection time of nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, with respect to symptoms onset. Given that sensitivities (around 94% and 84% for IgG and IgM, respectively) implicate false-negative cases and given the lack of effective vaccines or treatments, the only currently available procedure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission is to identify and isolate persons who are contagious. For this reason, we would like to submit a flowchart in which serological tests, integrated with nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, are included to help social and work activities implementation after the pandemic acute phase and to overcome lockdown.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection serology: a useful tool to overcome lockdown?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research, low-cost detection equipment intended to carry out a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) through a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction is presented We designed the internal structure with SolidWorks and AutoCAD The equipment comprised a Raspberry Pi development board, a temperature control module, and a fluorescent optical detection module The main program, temperature control, florescent signal processing, signal analysis, and screen display were programmed with Java We applied the digital temperature controller module to obtain precise temperature control of the equipment The experimental results showed that the heating rate of the testing equipment could reach 65C within 4 minutes and could be accurately controlled to within 1C The duration of the LAMP PCR experiment was found to be significantly shorter than that of the conventional PCR The results also revealed that with LAMP PCR, the temperature could be accurately controlled within a specific range, and the designed heating tasks could be completed within 15 minutes to one hour, depending on the specimen The equipment could also correctly read both the positive and negative reactions with fluorescent signals Thus, the proposed LAMP PCR detection equipment is more sensitive, more stable, and more cost-effective than other conventional alternatives and can be used in numerous clinical applications","output":"Development of Detection Equipment for a Polymerase Chain Reaction with a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Reaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is an ongoing public health challenge, also for the dentistry community The main objective of this paper was to determine the economic and health-care impact of COVID-19 on dentists in the Autonomous Region of Galicia (Spain) Methods: This was a descriptive observational study in which the data was collected by means of a self-administered survey (from 1 April 2020 to 30 April 2020) Results: A total of 400 dentists from Galicia responded to the survey Only 12 3% of the participants could obtain personal protective equipment (PPE) including FFP2 masks Of the male respondents, 33 1% suffered losses &gt;&euro;15,000 compared to 19 4% of female respondents (OR = 3 121, p &lt;0 001) Economic losses seem to have contributed to the applications for economic help as 29 5% of the respondents who applied for this measure recorded losses in excess of &euro;15,000 (p = 0 03) Patients complained more about the fact that only emergency care was available during the State of Alarm, in dental surgeries that do not work with insurance companies or franchises Only 4 professionals tested positive, 50% of whom worked exclusively in private practice and the other 50% who practised in both private and public surgeries Dentists who practise in the public sector saw more urgent patients per week than those practising in private surgeries (p = 0 013) Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has had economic repercussions in dentistry as only urgent treatment was available during the State of Alarm These repercussions seem to be higher in male participants, as the majority of the participants have revealed higher economic losses than females The level of assistance has also been affected, reducing the number of treated patients, although this quantity has been different in private and public surgeries By presenting these findings we look to highlight the role that dentists play in society in treating dental emergencies in our surgeries, and this must be recognised and addressed by the relevant authorities, who must provide PPEs as a priority to this group as well as providing special economic aid in accordance with the losses incurred by the sector","output":"Assessment of the Economic and Health-Care Impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on Public and Private Dental Surgeries in Spain: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, adherence to suggested precautionary measures has been emphasized as important in preventing and curtailing its spread. However, strict adherence to precautionary measures can be demanding. METHODS: This cluster randomised controlled trial done among 1517 undergraduate dental students tested the effectiveness of 'dissonance induction' (DI) and 'assessment reactivity' (AR) in improving adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) measures as compared to a control group. At baseline, participants in the DI group were tested for their knowledge of precautionary measures, immediately followed by assessment of their adherence to them. This methodology was adapted to systematically reveal the poor adherence of the participants in their self-held cognitions, should there be any. The magnitude of dissonance was measured as the proportion of such dissonant cognitions held by an individual. In the AR group, at baseline, participants were asked about their attitudes alone toward measures. The control group was neither assessed for knowledge and adherence nor for attitudes toward the measures at baseline. Two weeks after the administration of these interventions in the DI and AR groups, the 3 study groups were assessed for adherence. RESULTS: The follow-up adherence scores in the DI group were found to be significantly higher (15.11  4.1) compared to the AR (13.13  2.01) and control (12.87  2.97) groups as analysed by Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (Ha?=a?243.5; P < .001). Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that the adherence scores significantly improved in the DI group from baseline to follow-up (za?=a?-8.84; P < .001). Magnitude of dissonance at baseline was found to be a significant predictor of follow-up adherence scores (R2a?=a?0.255).

The aim of this study was the characterization of COVID-19 cases detected during this period. METHODS: We analyzed certain variables of interest coming from the epidemiological surveys carried out in an area of Madrid during May 2020, and stratified the results depending on its temporal relation with the deescalation. Prevalence for each category of response and average duration in minutes of the telephonic call were calculated. Confidence intervals were estimated at 95%. RESULTS: We included 167 cases, being 30.5% of them incident and 49.1% prevalent. The main source of infection was home (38.0%;CI 95% 31.4-46.2). Regarding healthcare and social care workers, the main source of infection was workplace (93.0%;85.4-100). Average number of close contacts per case was 2.0 (1.8-2.2), being 1.5 (1.0-2.0) among pre-deescalation incident cases and 2.4 (1.8-3.0) among those post-deescalation. Average duration of each survey was 35.9 minutes (32.2-38.9), being 32.1 (24.4-39.8) among pre-deescalation incident cases and 37.0 (29.6-44.4) among those post-deescalation. Most of the contacts were household, both before and after beginning of deescalation. CONCLUSIONS: Home is the most prevalent place for the acquisition of the infection among general population, while workplace is the most prevalent among healthcare and social care workers. The initial phase of deescalation do not represents a change regarding sources of infection, but it may increase the number of close contacts.

We investigated the safety and tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of MHAA4549A in outpatients with acute, uncomplicated influenza A infection. METHODS: This was a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of single intravenous (IV) doses of 3600 mg or 8400 mg of MHAA4549A or IV placebo in adult outpatients testing positive for influenza A. Patients were enrolled across 35 sites in 6 countries. Randomization and dosing occurred within 72 hours of symptom onset; the study duration was 14 weeks. The primary end point was the nature and frequency of adverse events (AEs). Secondary end points included median time to alleviation of all influenza symptoms, effects on nasopharyngeal viral load and duration of viral shedding, and MHAA4549A serum pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Of 125 randomized patients, 124 received study treatment, with 99 confirmed positive for influenza A by central testing. The frequency of AEs between the MHAA4549A and placebo groups was similar; nausea was most common (8 patients; 6.5%). MHAA4549A serum exposure was confirmed in all MHAA4549A-treated patients and was dose-proportional. No hospitalizations or deaths occurred. Between the MHAA4549A and placebo groups, no statistically significant differences occurred in the median time to alleviation of all symptoms, nasopharyngeal viral load, or duration of viral shedding. CONCLUSIONS: While MHAA4549A was safe and well tolerated with confirmed exposure, the antibody did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with acute uncomplicated influenza A infection.","output":"A Phase 2 Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of the Monoclonal Antibody MHAA4549A in Patients With Acute Uncomplicated Influenza A Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our findings illustrate the widespread collateral impact of implementing measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in people with, or being investigated for diabetes mellitus (DM).

Its use has shown outperformance of amplitude-based estimators such as the root mean square (RMS) in the evaluation of respiratory EMG signals with cardiac noise and a high correlation with respiratory signals, allowing changes in respiratory muscle activity to be tracked. However, the relationship between the fSampEn response to a given muscle activation has not been investigated.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study exploring the eight week time course of specific cellular (interferon- release assay and flow cytometry) or/and humoral immune responses (ELISA) to SARS-CoV-2 boost vaccination in more than 3100 participants including medical personnel, dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients using mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-vaccination induced seroconversion efficacy in dialysis patients was similar to medical personnel (> 95%), but markedly impaired in kidney transplant recipients (42%). T-cellular immunity largely mimicked humoral results. Major risk factors of seroconversion failure were immunosuppressive drug number and type (belatacept, MMF-MPA, calcineurin-inhibitors) as well as vaccine type (BNT162b2 mRNA). Seroconversion rates induced by mRNA-1273 compared to BNT162b2 vaccine were 97% to 88% (p < 0.001) in dialysis and 49% to 26% in transplant patients, respectively. Specific IgG directed against the new binding domain of the spike protein (RDB) were significantly higher in dialysis patients vaccinated by mRNA-1273 (95%) compared to BNT162b2 (85%, p < 0.001). Vaccination appeared safe and highly effective demonstrating an almost complete lack of symptomatic COVID-19 disease after boost vaccination as well as ceased disease incidences during third pandemic wave in dialysis patients. CONCLUSION: Dialysis patients exhibit a remarkably high seroconversion rate of 95% after boost vaccination, while humoral response is impaired in the majority of transplant recipients. Immunosuppressive drug number and type as well as vaccine type (BNT162b2) are major determinants of seroconversion failure in both dialysis and transplant patients suggesting immune monitoring and adaption of vaccination protocols.","output":"Humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in renal transplant versus dialysis patients: A prospective, multicenter observational study using mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the lockdowns are being observed all over the globe and the national level pharmacy professionals are performing frontline roles, this editorial highlights the role of pharmacists in the COVID ? 19 pandemic.

However, over time, antimicrobial resistance has accelerated and is now a significant global public health concern. Understanding societal preferences for the use of antibiotics as well as eliciting the willingness to pay for future research is crucial. OBJECTIVE: To investigate preferences for different strategies to optimize antibiotic use and to understand the willingness to pay for future research in antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial drug development. METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment was administered to a sample of the UK general population. Respondents were asked to make nine choices, each offering three optionstwo hypothetical doctor and antibiotics and one no doctorno antibioticsdefined by five attributes: treatment, days needed to recover, risk of bacterial infection that needs antibiotics, risk of common side effects, and risk of antimicrobial resistance by 2050. Data were analyzed using random parameters logit models. A double-bounded contingent valuation was also included in the survey to explore the willingness to pay for policies to contain antimicrobial resistance. RESULTS: Among the 2579 respondents who completed the survey, 1151 always selected no doctorno antibiotics and 57 never varied their choices; therefore, 1371 responses were used in the analysis. Risk of antimicrobial resistance by 2050 was the most important attribute and the treatment was the least important attribute, although this was sensitive to a higher risk of bacterial infection. The aggregate annual willingness to pay for containing antimicrobial resistance was approximately 8.35 billion (~5C10 billion). CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial resistance risk is relevant and important to the general public. The high willingness to pay suggests that large investments in policies or interventions to combat antimicrobial resistance are justified.

Results: There were statistically significant differences between the studied cases and control group with regard to the presence of comorbidities, total leucocytic count, lymphocytic count, CRP, serum LDH, ferritin and D-dimer (p < 0.01). The CC genotype of rs12979860 cytokine, the AA genotype of TLL1 rs17047200 and the AA genotype of the rs4618569 variant of DDR1 showed a higher incidence of COVID-19 compared to the others.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no mathematical models that study the impact of chemotherapy treatments on the osteosarcoma microenvironment. In this study, we developed a data driven mathematical model to analyze the dynamics of the important players in three groups of osteosarcoma tumors with distinct immune patterns in the presence of the most common chemotherapy drugs. The results indicate that the treatments start times and optimal dosages depend on the unique growth rate of the tumor, which implies the necessity of personalized medicine. Furthermore, the developed model can be extended by others to build models that can recommend individual-specific optimal dosages. ABSTRACT: Since all tumors are unique, they may respond differently to the same treatments. Therefore, it is necessary to study their characteristics individually to find their best treatment options. We built a mathematical model for the interactions between the most common chemotherapy drugs and the osteosarcoma microenvironments of three clusters of tumors with unique immune profiles. We then investigated the effects of chemotherapy with different treatment regimens and various treatment start times on the behaviors of immune and cancer cells in each cluster. Saliently, we suggest the optimal drug dosages for the tumors in each cluster. The results show that abundances of dendritic cells and HMGB1 increase when drugs are given and decrease when drugs are absent. Populations of helper T cells, cytotoxic cells, and IFN- [Formula: see text] grow, and populations of cancer cells and other immune cells shrink during treatment. According to the model, the MAP regimen does a good job at killing cancer, and is more effective than doxorubicin and cisplatin combined or methotrexate alone. The results also indicate that it is important to consider the tumors unique growth rate when deciding the treatment details, as fast growing tumors need early treatment start times and high dosages.","output":"Investigating Optimal Chemotherapy Options for Osteosarcoma Patients through a Mathematical Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Describe the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general surgery residency training nationwide. DESIGN: A thirty-one question electronic survey was distributed to general surgery program directors. Qualitative data underwent iterative coding analysis. Quantitative data was evaluated with summary statistics and bivariate analyses. PARTICIPANTS: 84 residency programs (33.6% response rate) with representation across US geographic regions, program affiliations, and sizes RESULTS: Widespread changes were observed in the surgical training environment. 100% of programs reduced the number of residents on rounds and 95.2% reduced the size of their in-hospital resident workforce; on average, daytime staffing decreased by nearly half. With telehealth clinics(90.5%) and remote inpatient consults(26.2%), both clinical care and resident didactics(86.9%) were increasingly virtual, with similar impact across all program demographics. Conversely, availability of some wellness initiatives was significantly higher among university programs than independent programs, including childcare(51.2% vs 6.7%), housing(41.9% vs 13.3%), and virtual mental health services(83.7% vs 53.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in clinical care delivery dramatically reduced in face-to-face learning opportunities for surgical trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this effect had equal impact across all program types, sizes, and geographies, the same cannot be said for wellness initiatives.

We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of human cells in culture and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for some of the positive PCR tests seen in patients. In support of this hypothesis, we found that DNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be integrated into the genome of infected human cells. We found target site duplications flanking the viral sequences and consensus LINE1 endonuclease recognition sequences at the integration sites, consistent with a LINE1 retrotransposon-mediated, target-primed reverse transcription and retroposition mechanism. We also found, in some patient-derived tissues, evidence suggesting that a large fraction of the viral sequences is transcribed from integrated DNA copies of viral sequences, generating viralChost chimeric transcripts. The integration and transcription of viral sequences may thus contribute to the detection of viral RNA by PCR in patients after infection and clinical recovery. Because we have detected only subgenomic sequences derived mainly from the 3 end of the viral genome integrated into the DNA of the host cell, infectious virus cannot be produced from the integrated subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 sequences.","output":"Reverse-transcribed SARS-CoV-2 RNA can integrate into the genome of cultured human cells and can be expressed in patient-derived tissues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Heart failure (HF) has become a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

It is a synthetic cysteine derivative that has been used in a wide variety of clinical applications for decades and a wealth of information exists on its safety and protective properties against a broad range of toxicants and disease states. Its primary mechanism of action is as a pro-drug for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), particularly in those circumstances where oxidative stress has exhausted intracellular GSH stores. It impacts a number of pathways either directly or through its GSH-related antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which make it a prime candidate as a potential treatment for the wide range of deleterious cellular effects that H is acknowledged to cause in exposed individuals. This report reviews the available literature on the protection afforded by NAC against the toxicity of H in a variety of model systems, including its efficacy in treating the long-term chronic lung effects of H that have been demonstrated in Iranian veterans exposed during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988).

The primary known function of OPG is to bind to the receptor activator of NF-B ligand (RANKL), and by doing so, it inhibits the binding between RANKL and its receptor (RANK). TLR4 signaling in macrophages involves TRAF6 recruitment and contributes to low-grade chronic inflammation in adipose tissue. LPS is a classical activator of the TLR4 pathway and induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. We have previously observed that in the presence of RANKL, there is no LPS-induced activation of TLR4 in macrophages. In this study, we investigated the crosstalk between RANK and TLR4 pathways in macrophages stimulated with both RANKL and LPS to unveil the role of OPG in inflammatory processes. We found that RANKL inhibits TLR4 activation by binding to RANK, promoting the binding between TRAF6 and RANK, lowering TLR4 activation and the expression of proinflammatory mediators. Furthermore, high OPG levels aggravate inflammation by inhibiting RANKL.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 613 patients hospitalized (integrated health system involving three hospitals) for RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection between March 1, 2020 and April 25, 2020. Intervention was treatment with HCQ-AZM in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Outcomes of interest were in-hospital all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, non-lethal arrhythmias, and length of hospital stay. Secondary measures included in-hospital corrected QT (QTc) interval parameters and serum biomarkers levels. RESULTS: Propensity-matched groups were composed of 173 patients given HCQ-AZM and 173 matched patients who did not receive treatment. There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80C2.89; p = 0.2), PEA arrest (OR 1.68, CI 0.68C4.15; p = 0.27), or incidence of non-lethal arrhythmias (10.4% vs. 6.8%; p = 0.28). Length of hospital stay (10.5  7.4 vs. 5.8  6.1; p < 0.001), peak CRP levels (252  136 vs. 166  124; p < 0.0001), and degree of QTc interval prolongation was higher for the HCQ-AZM group (28  32 vs. 9  32; p < 0.0001), but there was no significant difference in incidence of sustained ventricular arrhythmias (2.8% vs. 1.7%; p = 0.52).

The aim of this study was to characterize COVID-19 survivors of critical illness and to evaluate health-related quality of life and disability following hospital discharge. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective case-series study that included COVID-19 survivors admitted to the Intensive Care Medicine Department of a University Hospital. Follow-up evaluation was performed between the 30th and the 90th day after discharge. Quality of life was explored using the five-level version of the EQ-5D instrument (EQ-5D-5L) and functionality using the 12-question World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0). RESULTS: Forty-five survivors were enrolled, 28 (62.2%) men, median age 63.0 years. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire showed moderate to extreme problems in some dimension in 29 patients (64.4%): mobility in six (13.3%), self-care in seven (13.3%), usual activities in 23 (51.1%), pain/discomfort in 14 (31.1%) and anxiety/depression in 17 (37.8%).

This study seeks to investigate whether a telemedicine system reduces physical contact in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigates nurses distress and depression. METHODS: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in four hospitals and one designated accommodation measured and uploaded their vital signs to secure cloud storage for remote monitoring. Additionally, a mat-type sensor placed under the bed monitored the patients respiratory rates. Using the pre-post prospective design, visit counts and health care providers mental health were assessed before and after the system was introduced. RESULTS: A total of 100 nurses participated in the study. We counted the daily visits for 48 and 69 patients with and without using the telemedicine system. The average patient visits were significantly less with the system (16.3 [5.5C20.3] vs. 7.5 [4.5C17.5] times/day, p = 0.009). Specifically, the visit count for each vital sign assessment was about half with the telemedicine system (all p < 0.0001). Most nurses responded that the system was easy to use (87.1%), reduced work burden (75.2%), made them feel relieved (74.3%), and was effective in reducing the infection risk in hospitals (79.1%) and nursing accommodations (95.0%). Distress assessed by IES-R and depression by PHQ-9 were at their minimum even without the system and did not show any significant difference with the system (p = 0.72 and 0.57, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine-based self-assessment of vital signs reduces nurses physical contact with COVID-19 patients. Most nurses responded that the system is easy and effective in reducing healthcare providers infection risk. LAY SUMMARY: In this multicenter pre-post prospective study, we investigated whether a telemedicine system reduces physical contact in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and mitigates nurses mental stress. We counted the daily patient visits before and after using a telemedicine system, with which patients uploaded their vital signs for remote monitoring. Simultaneously, a mat-type sensor for monitoring respiratory rates was also introduced. The average patient visits were less for 69 patients treated with the system than 48 treated without it (16.3 vs. 7.5 times/day, p = 0.009). Specifically, the visit count for each vital sign assessment was about half (all p < 0.0001). A total of 100 nurses answered to a questionnaire and many responded that the system was easy to use (87.1%), reduced work burden (75.2%), made them feel relieved (74.3%), and was effective in reducing the infection risk in hospitals (79.1%) and nursing accommodations (95.0%). Distress assessed by IES-R and depression by PHQ-9 were at their minimum even without the system and did not change with the system (p = 0.72 and 0.57, respectively). Thus, the telemedicine system reduced physical contacts and nurses had favorable impression to the system despite no significant improvement in mental stress scores.","output":"Impact of a Telemedicine System on Work Burden and Mental Health of Healthcare Providers Working with COVID-19: A Multicenter Pre-Post Prospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the rapidly spreading pandemic COVID-19 in the world.

Multiple professionals and agencies are involved and processes and procedures are not standardized, often resulting in communication delays and co-ordination failures. Early and appropriate discharge planning and standardization of procedures could make inpatient care safer. Aim: To inform the development of a multi-component best practice guidance for discharge planning (including the 6 component SAFER patient flow bundle) to support safer patient transition from mental health hospitals to the community. Methods: Using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness method, a panel of 10 professional stakeholders (psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, pharmacists, academics, and policy makers) rated evidence-based statements. Six hundred and sixty-eight statements corresponding to 10 potential components of discharge planning best practice were rated on a 9-point integer scale for clarity, appropriateness and feasibility (median  7C9) using an online questionnaire then remote online face-to-face meetings. Results: Five of the six SAFER patient flow bundle components were appropriate and feasible for inpatient mental health. One component, Early Flow, was rated inappropriate as mental health settings require more flexibility. Overall, 285 statements were rated as appropriate and feasible. Forty-four statements were considered appropriate but not feasible to implement. Discussion: This consensus study has identified components of a best practice guidance/intervention for discharge planning for UK mental health settings. Although some components describe processes that already happen in everyday clinical interactions (i.e., review by a senior clinician), standardizing such processes could have important safety benefits alongside a tailored and timely approach to post-discharge care.","output":"Developing Best Practice Guidance for Discharge Planning Using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lombardy was severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic since February 2020 and the Health System underwent rapid reorganization Outpatient clinics were stopped for non-urgent patients: it became a priority to manage hundreds of fragile neurological patients who suddenly had less reference points In Italy, before the pandemic, Televisits were neither recognized nor priced METHODS: At the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico C Besta, we reorganized outpatient clinics to deliver Neuro-telemedicine services, including Televisits and Teleneurorehabilitation, since March 2020 A dedicated Working Group prepared the procedure, tested the system, and designed satisfaction questionnaires for adults and children RESULTS: After a pilot phase, we prepared a procedure for Telemedicine outpatient clinics which was approved by hospital directions It included prescription, booking, consenting, privacy and data protection, secure connection with patients (Teams Microsoft 365), electronic report preparation and delivery, reporting, and accountability of the services During the March-September 2020 period, we delivered 3167 Telemedicine services, including 1618 Televisits, to 1694 patients (972 adults, 722 children) with a wide range of chronic neurological disorders We successfully administered different clinical assessment and scales Satisfaction among patients and caregivers was very high CONCLUSIONS: During the dramatic emergency, we were able to take care of more than 1600 patients by organizing Neuro-telehealth in a few weeks, lessening the impact of the pandemic on fragile patients with chronic neurological disorders;this strategy is now stably embedded in our care pathways In Italy, Telehealth is at present recognized and priced and is becoming a stable pillar of the health system","output":"Neuro-telehealth for fragile patients in a tertiary referral neurological institute during the COVID-19 pandemic in Milan, Lombardy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As microplastic studies grow, environmental concerns of all kinds of fibers are currently investigated.

The protocols to be tested were selected based on the literature: 10% KOH at 40 C for 24 h; 10% KOH at 60 C for 24 h; diluted NaClO at room temperature (~20 C) for 15 h; 30% H2O2 at 40 C for 48 h; Fenton's reagent with 30% H2O2 for 2 h at room temperature (~20 C). The fibers were characterized before and after digestion. The effects of those protocols on fibers integrity have been assessed using several of their performance parameters. High degradations were observed for PET with 10% KOH 60 C whereas almost no impact was observed at 40 C. H2O2 digestion affects mechanical properties of different fibers, particularly PA 6.6. Both protocols should be avoided for synthetic fibers analyses. NaClO digestion mainly affected flax and viscose.

The URTIs are quite common in several sport activities among athletes who undergo heavy training. Causes of URTI are still poorly understood, because can be related with innate and genetic susceptibility and with several environmental factors connected with training load and nutrition. The time course of the inflammation process affecting URTI after training, has been also reviewed. After a survey of the possible physiological and psychological causes (stressors), including a survey of the main markers of inflammation currently found in scientific literature (mainly catecholamines), we provided evidence of the ingestion of carbohydrates, C, D, and E vitamins, probiotics and even certain fat, in reducing URTI in athletes. Possible countermeasures to URTI can be a correct nutrition, sleep hygiene, a proper organization of training loads, and the use of technique to reduce stress in professional athletes. There is a lack of studies investigating social factors (isolation) albeit with Covid 19 this gap has been partially fill. The results can be useful also for non-athletes. Immunity is the consequence of a complex interaction between organs and the environment. It is mediated the interaction of several genes, receptors, molecules, hormones, cytokines, antibodies, antigens, and inflammatory mediators which in turn relate and influence the psychological health. The immune system response of heavily trained athletes resembles an even more complex conditions being theorized to follow a J or S shape dynamics at times. High training loads modify the immune response elevating the biological markers of immunity and the body susceptibility to infections. Heavy training and/or training in a cold environment increase the athletes' risk to develop Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTIs). Therefore, athletes, who are considered healthier than the normal population, are in fact more prone to infections of the respiratory tract, due to lowering of the immune system in the time frames subsequent heavy training sessions. In this revision we will review the behavioral intervention, including nutritional approaches, useful to minimize the \\"open window\\" effect on infection and how to cope with stressors and boost the immune system in athletes.

The activity is associated with the cell membrane and able to accelerate cOA clearance at a high cOA level. Further, we show that a metal-dependent and membrane-associated DHH-DHHA1 family nuclease (MAD) rapidly cleaves cOA and deactivates Csx1 ribonuclease. The cOA degradation efficiency of MAD is much higher than the cellular ring nuclease. However, the subcellular organization may prevent it from degrading nascent cOA.

During COVID-19 pandemic where companies are facing not only health crises but also economic and social crises the issue of turnover rate becomes more critical. This paper attempts to examine factors that can influence employee retention during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular the research will focus on millennial employees in one state-owned company in Indonesia that, unlike other companies, has had a low turnover rate since before until during the pandemic. This study is exploratory in nature using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to 13 employees from different positions. This research aims to find out what factors that make the millennial employees choose to stay even when the company is in a difficult situation. The findings suggest both extrinsic and intrinsic factors that have influenced the employees to stay. Extrinsic utilitarian factors found were job security compensation, work environment promotion training, limited opportunities to work in other companies and chances to own a house at a young age. Whereas intrinsic factors were job challenges, work-life balance, job satisfaction recognition as well as gratitude and pride. This research contributes to building a better understanding on how to retain millennial employees particularly in the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Faktor yang mempengaruhi retensi karyawan milenial pada saat pandemi COVID-19: Kasus pada sebuah perusahaan BUMN di Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In France, the entire population was put under a total lockdown from March 17 to May 11, 2020 during the peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Whether the lockdown had consequences on the management of medical emergencies such as stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) has yet to be fully evaluated. This article describes hospitalization rates for acute stroke in 2 French regions that experienced contrasting rates of COVID-19 infection, before, during, and after the nationwide lockdown (January to June 2020). METHODS All patients admitted for acute stroke/TIA into all public and private hospitals of the 2 study regions were included. Data were retrieved from the National Hospitalization Database (PMSI). In the most affected region (Grand-Est), the hospitalization rates observed in April 2020 were compared with the rates in the same period in the least affected region (Occitanie) and in the 3 prior years (2017-2019). RESULTS There was a significant decline in hospitalization rates for stroke/TIA within the region most affected by COVID-19 during the month of April 2020 compared with previous years, while no significant change was seen in the least affected region. After lockdown, we observed a fast rebound in the rate of hospitalization for stroke/TIA in the most affected region, contrasting with a slower rebound in the least affected region. In both regions, patients with COVID-19 stroke more frequently had ischemic stroke, a nonsignificant greater prevalence of diabetes, they were less frequently admitted to stroke units, and mortality was higher than in patients without COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrates a significant drop in stroke/TIA hospitalizations and a fast recovery after the end of the French lockdown in the most affected region, while the least affected region saw a nonsignificant drop in stroke/TIA hospitalizations and a slow recovery. These results and recommendations could be used by the health authorities to prepare for future challenges.","output":"Hospitalizations for Stroke in France During the COVID-19 Pandemic Before, During, and After the National Lockdown."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article will summarize the arguments developed in a more complete study, already published online (at SSRN: a href=\\"https://ssrn com/abstract=","output":"Is It Possible to Hold China Responsible in the Case of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Literature suggests that urban regeneration policies might contribute towards improving mental health of residents, but to date there is a lack of empirical research on how these policies and downward social mobility can interact and influence health outcomes.

However, the formal utility of CVP measurement in preventing mortality in septic patients has never been proven. METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database was searched to identify septic patients with and without CVP measurements. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Multivariate regression was used to elucidate the relationship between CVP measurement and 28-day mortality, and propensity score matching (PSM) and an inverse probability of treatment weighing (IPTW) were employed to validate our findings. RESULTS: A total of 10,275 patients were included in our study, of which 4516 patients (44%) underwent CVP measurement within 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The risk of 28-day mortality was reduced in the CVP group (OR 0.60 (95% CI 0.51C0.70; p < 0.001)). Patients in the CVP group received more fluid on day 1 and had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use, and the reduction in serum lactate was greater than that in the no CVP group. The mediating effect of serum lactate reduction was significant for the whole cohort (p = 0.04 for the average causal mediation effect (ACME)) and patients in the CVP group with an initial CVP level below 8 mmHg (p = 0.04 for the ACME).

Hence it is important to mention that King Abdulaziz University (KAU) has been using elearning/blended learning for more than a decade under the umbrella of the deanship of distance learning of KAU, however, in a different scenario. Data was collected from teachers and students through two questionnaires (adapted). The results reported that the majority of the participants had positive attitudes towards E-learning. It was also found that students were prepared to shift to online mode to avoid any academic loss.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 on Education in Saudi Arabia and E-Learning Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The femoral nerve block (FNB) may be used for analgesia in hip fracture surgery. The pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block is a novel regional technique and may provide better pain reduction while preserving motor function, but these blocks have not been directly compared. METHODS: In a single-center double-blinded randomized comparative trial, patients presenting for hip fracture surgery received analgesia with either FNB or PENG block. The primary outcome measure was pain scores (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 0 to 10). Secondary outcomes were postoperative quadriceps strength, opiate use, complications, length of hospital stay, and patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS: Sixty patients were randomized and equally allocated between groups. Baseline demographics were similar. Postoperatively in recovery (day 0), the PENG group experienced less pain compared with the FNB group. (In the PENG group, 63% experienced no pain, 27% mild pain, and 10% moderate to severe pain. In comparison, 30% of the FNB group reported no pain, 27% mild pain, and 36% moderate to severe pain; p=0.04). This was assessed using an 11-point Likert NRS. Quadriceps strength was better preserved in the PENG group in the recovery unit (assessed using Oxford muscle strength grading, 60% intact in the PENG group vs none intact in the FNB group; p<0.001) and on day 1 (90% intact vs 50%, respectively; p=0.004). There was no difference in other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving a PENG block for intraoperative and postoperative analgesia during hip fracture surgery experience less postoperative pain in the recovery room with no difference detected by postoperative day 1. Quadriceps strength was better preserved with the PENG block. Despite the short-term analgesic benefit and improved quadriceps strength, there were no differences detected in the quality of recovery.","output":"Pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block provides improved short-term analgesia compared with the femoral nerve block in hip fracture surgery: a single-center double-blinded randomized comparative trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This position paper describes the results of our meetings with terminologists aimed at capturing missing functionalities concerning term extraction These experts lack an online tool to allow them the evaluation, modification and creation of terminologies from corpora in different languages The result is an open-access online website where terminologists can extract automatically terminologies and can upload terminologies created by third parties The tool also allows them to polish collaboratively the terminologies Additionally, this tool provides a quality metrics based on the changes made to the terminology, as well as a way to compare two terminologies for the same corpus but created with different methods We have tested the tool with terminologies in English and Spanish, with corpora from several domains: bio (covid19), legal and scientific papers Our preliminary results point out the utility of this tool for terminologists ? 2021 IEEE","output":"TermInteract: An online tool for terminologists aimed at providing terminology quality metrics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we investigated the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on various sectors of the Australian stock market Market capitalization and equally weighted indices were formed for eleven Australian sectors to examine the influence of the pandemic on them First, we examined the financial contagion between the Chinese stock market and Australian sector indices through the dynamic conditional correlation fractionally integrated generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (DCC-FIGARCH) model We found high time-varying correlations between the Chinese stock market and most of the Australian sector indices, with the financial, health care, information technology, and utility sectors displaying a decrease in co-movements during the pandemic The Modified Iterative Cumulative Sum of Squares (MICSS) analysis results indicated the presence of structural breaks in the volatilities of most of the sector indices around the end of February 2020, but consumer staples, industry, information technology and real estate indices did not display any break Markov regime-switching regression analysis depicted that the pandemic has mainly affected three sectors: consumer staples, industry, and real estate When we considered the firm size, we found that smaller companies in the energy sector exhibited gradual deterioration, whereas small firms in the consumer staples sector experienced the largest positive impact from the pandemic","output":"The Australian Stock Markets Reaction to the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Black Summer Bushfires: A Sectoral Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A key unknown for SARS-CoV-2 is how asymptomatic infections contribute to transmission.

During the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, VAERS got more attention as its important role in monitoring the safety of the vaccines. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate VAERS patterns, reported AEFIs, adverse events of special interest (AESIs), impact of different pandemics since its inception, and surveillance rate of serious vs nonserious AEFIs. Methods: This was an observational study using VARES data from 2/7/1990 to 12/11/2021. Patterns of reports over years were first described, followed by a comparison of reports statistics per year. Furthermore, a comparison of incidents (death, ER visits, etc.) statistics over years, in addition to statistics of each vaccine were calculated. Moreover, each incident's statistics for each vaccine were calculated and top vaccines were reported. Finally, survival analysis utilizing cox regression was done, in addition to AESIs distribution stratified by age groups and gender. All analyses were conducted using R (Version 1.4.1717) and Excel for Microsoft 365. Results: There were 1,396,280 domestic and 346,210 non-domestic reports during 1990-2021, including 228 vaccines. For both domestic and non-domestic reports, year of 2021 had the highest reporting rate (48.52% and 70.33%), in addition a notable changes in AEFIs patterns were recorded during 1991, 1998, 2000, 2006, 2009, 2011, and 2017. AEFIs were as follow: deaths (1.00% and 4.08%), ER or doctor visits (13.37% and 2.27%), hospitalizations (5.84% and 27.78%), lethal threat (1.42% and 4.38%), and disabilities (1.4% and 7.96%). Pyrexia was the top reported symptom during the past 31 years, except for 2021 where headache was the top one. COVID-19 vaccines namely Moderna, Pfizer-Biontech, and Janssen were the top 3 reported vaccines with headache, pyrexia, and fatigue as the top associated AEFIs. Followed by Zoster, Seasonal Influenza, Pneumococcal, and Human papillomavirus vaccines. Myocarditis or Pericarditis were the top reported AESIs (26.95% and 25.84%). Male (HR:1.15, 1.14 - 1.16) for domestic (HR:1.23, 1.22 -1.25) for nondomestic have a higher probability of having serious AEFIs. In addition, age group [] 5 years old in domestic and >84 years old in nondomestic have a higher probability of having AEFIs compared to other age groups. Conclusions: The large data available in VARES make it a useful tool for detecting and monitoring vaccine AEFIs. However, its usability relies on understating the limitations of this surveillance system, the impact of governmental regulations, availability of vaccines, and public health recommendations on the reporting rate.","output":"Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): Evaluation of 31 Years of Reports and Pandemics' Impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic sets a precedent in modern history and is a threat to almost all countries in the world while challenging all existing systems Efforts to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus among the younger and adult populations has prompted the widespread closing of schools, colleges, universities, and other educational institutions in many countries The aim of this study is to establish the influence and interrelations between the psychological aspects of perceived stress, post-traumatic stress symptoms and wellbeing in university lecturers in the field of sports education with distance teaching during COVID-19 This online study was undertaken at the end of May 2020 Participants were 67 university lecturers in the field of sports education, between the ages of 25 - 70 years, divided into groups according to their gender, age, professional working experience, and academic positions The research methods included: The Perceived Stress Scale (PS-1);Method for psychological assessment of post-traumatic stress symptoms;WHO-5, Wellbeing Index There are significant differences depending on gender, age, professional working experience Women experience stress stronger, have lower levels of well-being, and show more post traumatic symptoms, compared to men during the quarantine period A statistically significant decrease of the level of well-being, and increase in the levels of perceived stress with age is found None of the studied parameters showed statistically significant differences in the groups that were differentiated by academic positions The experiencing of post-traumatic stress symptoms increased when there was an increase of the perceived stress The well-being decreases when the levels of perceived stress are higher and the participants have experienced post-traumatic stress symptoms These results may be seen as a starting point for future studies, examining personal and academic factors and the impacts of well-being on university lecturers","output":"The Psychological Impact of Covid-19 on University Lecturers in the Field of Sports Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Workforce is a fundamental health systems building block, with unprecedented measures taken to meet extra demand and facilitate surge capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic, following a prolonged period of austerity. This case study examines trends in Irelands publicly funded health service workforce, from the global financial crisis, through the Recovery period and into the COVID-19 pandemic, to understand resource allocation across community and acute settings. Specifically, this paper aims to uncover whether skill-mix and staff capacity are aligned with policy intent and the broader reform agenda to achieve universal access to integrated healthcare, in part, by shifting free care into primary and community settings. METHODS: Secondary analysis of anonymised aggregated national human resources data was conducted over a period of almost 14 years, from December 31st 2008 to August 31st 2021. Comparative analysis was conducted, by professional cadre, across three keys periods: Recession period December 31st 2008CDecember 31st 2014; Recovery period December 31st 2014CDecember 31st 2019; and the COVID-19 period December 31st 2019CAugust 31st 2021. RESULTS: During the Recession period there was an overall decrease of 8.1% (n = 9333) between December 31st 2008 and December 31st 2014, while the Recovery period saw the overall staff levels rebound and increase by 15.2% (n = 16,789) between December 31st 2014 and December 31st 2019. These figures continued to grow, at an accelerated rate during the most recent COVID-19 period, increasing by a further 8.9% (n = 10,716) in under 2 years. However, a notable shift occurred in 2013, when the number of staff in acute services surpassed those employed in community services (n = 50,038 and 49,857, respectively). This gap accelerated during the Recovery and COVID-19 phase. By August 2021, there were 13,645 more whole-time equivalents in acute settings compared to community, a complete reverse of the 2008 situation. This was consistent across all cadres. Workforce absence trends indicate short-term spikes resulting from shocks while COVID-19 redeployment disproportionately impacted negatively on primary care and community services. CONCLUSIONS: This paper clearly demonstrates the prioritisation of staff recruitment within acute servicesincreasing needed capacity, without the same commitment to support government policy to shift care into primary and community settings. Concerted action including the permanent redistribution of personnel is required to ensure progressive and sustainable responses are learned from recent shocks.","output":"Implications for health system reform, workforce recovery and rebuilding in the context of the Great Recession and COVID-19: a case study of workforce trends in Ireland 2008C2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tocilizumab is FDA-indicated for the adult treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and giant cell arteritis, and pediatric treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

A ROC curve analysis was used to evaluate the abilities of the three scoring scales to predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Age, low blood oxygen saturation level and decreased lymphocyte count were the high risk factors for COVID-19-related mortality. The analysis of the abilities of the three scales to predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients: The AUC of 0.641 for the RAPS (p = .065). The MEWS (AUC = 0.705, p = .007), compared with RAPS, the NRI was 0.371(p = .03), and the IDI = 0.092 (p = .046); The REMS (AUC = 0.841, p < .001), compared with MEWS, the NRI was 0.227(p = .12), and the IDI=0.09(p = .047); The Combining Predictor (AUC = 0.878, p < .001), compared with REMS, the NRI was 0.25(p = .113), and the IDI=0.02(p = .598).

Participants: Adults 25-65 years of age between 2015 and 2019 with a minimum of 12 consecutive thrombosis-free months of continuous enrollment beginning 2014 were selected. Main Outcomes: Age (10 year intervals) and sex stratum specific incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were determined for: venous thromboembolism (VTE), cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), and any major thrombosis. Incidence also was estimated for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Results: Among approximately 15 million enrollees per year (half female/male), incidence of any thrombotic event (DVT, PE, CVT, or other thrombosis) was 247.89 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 245.96, 249.84). Incidence of VTE was 213.79 with ICD codes alone (95% CI: 211.99, 215.59) and 127.18 (95% CI: 125.80, 128.58) when also requiring a filled anticoagulation prescription. Incidence rates were 6.37 for CVT (95% CI: 6.07, 6.69), 26.06 for ITP (95% CI: 25.44, 26.78), 0.94 for HUS (95% CI: 0.82, 1.06), and 4.82 for HIT (95% CI: 4.56, 5.10). The co-occurrence of CVT with either ITP or HIT (diagnoses within 14 days of one another) was 0.090 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.13). Incidence tended to increase with age and was higher for women under 55. Incidence for CVT, HUS, and CVT with ITP or HIT was higher for women in all age groups. Conclusions: These results are the first US estimates for incidence of thrombotic and rare events in a large, commercially-insured US population.

Repurposed niclosamide could be a safe and efficacious COVID-19 therapy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether niclosamide decreased SARS-CoV-2 shedding and duration of symptoms among patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolled individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID. All trial participants, investigators, staff, and laboratory personnel were kept blind to participant assignments. Enrollment was among individuals reporting at Tufts Medical Center and Wellforce Network in Massachusetts for outpatient COVID-19 testing. The trial opened to accrual on October 1, 2020; the last participant enrolled on April 20, 2021. Trial exclusion criteria included hospitalization at time of enrollment or use of any experimental treatment for COVID-19, including vaccination. Enrollment was stopped before attaining the planned sample size when COVID-19 diagnoses decreased precipitously in Massachusetts. Data were analyzed from July through September 2021. INTERVENTIONS: In addition to receiving current standard of care, participants were randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis to receive niclosamide 2 g by mouth daily for 7 days or identically labeled placebo at the same dosing schedule. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Oropharyngeal and fecal samples were self-collected for viral shedding measured by reverse-transcriptaseCpolymerase-chain-reaction on days 3, 7, 10, and 14, and an additional fecal sample was collected on day 21. A telehealth platform was developed to conduct remote study visits, monitor symptoms, and coordinate sample collection via couriers. The primary end point was the proportion of participants with viral clearance in respiratory samples at day 3 based on the intention-to-treat sample. Mean times to viral clearance and symptom resolution were calculated as restricted mean survival times and accounted for censored observations. RESULTS: Among 73 participants, 36 individuals were enrolled and randomized to niclosamide and 37 individuals to placebo. Participant characteristics were similar across treatment groups; among 34 patients receiving placebo and 33 patients receiving niclosamide in the intention-to-treat sample, mean (SD) age was 36.0 (13.3) years vs 36.8 (12.9) years and there were 21 (61.8%) men vs 20 (60.6%) men. The overall mean (SD) age was 36.4 (13.0) years. For the primary end point, 66.67% (95% CI, 50.74% to 81.81%) of participants receiving niclosamide and 55.88% (95% CI, 40.27% to 72.73%) of participants receiving placebo had oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 clearance at day 3 (P = .37). Among 63 participants with symptoms, niclosamide did not significantly shorten symptom duration, which was 12.01 (95% CI, 8.82 to 15.2) days in the niclosamide group vs 14.61 (95% CI, 11.25 to 17.96) days in the placebo group (mean difference, ?2.6 [95% CI, ?7.23 to 2.03] days). Niclosamide was well-tolerated; the most commonly reported adverse events in the placebo and niclosamide groups were headaches (11 patients [32.4%] vs 7 patients [21.2%]; P = .31) and cough (8 patients [23.5%] vs 7 patients [21.2%]; P = .82). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, there was no significant difference in oropharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2 at day 3 between placebo and niclosamide groups.

By October 2020, more than 44 million people were infected, and more than 1,000,000 deaths were reported. Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used as an alternative to the time-consuming RT-PCR test, to detect COVID-19. In this work we propose a segmentation framework to detect chest regions in CT images, which are infected by COVID-19. An architecture similar to a Unet model was employed to detect ground glass regions on a voxel level. As the infected regions tend to form connected components (rather than randomly distributed voxels), a suitable regularization term based on 2D-anisotropic total-variation was developed and added to the loss function. The proposed model is therefore called TV-Unet. Experimental results obtained on a relatively large-scale CT segmentation dataset of around 900 images, incorporating this new regularization term leads to a 2% gain on overall segmentation performance compared to the Unet trained from scratch. Our experimental analysis, ranging from visual evaluation of the predicted segmentation results to quantitative assessment of segmentation performance (precision, recall, Dice score, and mIoU) demonstrated great ability to identify COVID-19 associated regions of the lungs, achieving a mIoU rate of over 99%, and a Dice score of around 86%.","output":"COVID TV-Unet: Segmenting COVID-19 Chest CT Images Using Connectivity Imposed Unet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"a?I investigate the stock market's reaction to coronavirus news in the top six most affected countries by the pandemic.a?The fake news exerts a negative nonlinear influence on the inferior and the middle quantiles throughout the distribution of returns.a?The media coverage leads to a decrease in returns across middle and superior quantiles and has no effects on the inferior ones.a?During COVID19 turmoil superior quantiles of returns distribution exhibit negative dependence on past performances, while inferior and middle quantiles are not affected by this phenomenon.a?The gold return has a positive correlation with the stock markets, which amplifies during extreme bearish and bullish periods indicating that it does not behave as a \\"Safe Havens\\" asset.","output":"Asymmetric dependence between stock market returns and news during COVID-19 financial turmoil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In times of pandemic, case management and tracking people with contact can be differential elements for controlling the spread The objective of this review was to evaluate the digital tools used to track contacts of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 METHODS: A systematic exploratory review was conducted in the electronic databases Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science on May 29, 2020 through the descriptors: coronavirus, digital surveillance and contact tracing A total of 11 studies were finally selected RESULTS: The results showed that some countries are implementing digital tools for contact tracking through mobile apps that allow user data to be shared via the device's GPS and/or Bluetooth The terms on the privacy and confidentiality of the population data are, in some cases, questionable CONCLUSIONS: The use of digital surveillance tools to track contacts of people infected with an infectious disease, such as SARS-CoV-2, can be key to reducing the number of people infected and reducing the spread of the virus","output":"[Digital surveillance tools for contact tracking of infected persons by SARS-CoV-2.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has strongly impacted on healthcare services organization and healthcare workers mental health, increasing the risk of psychological symptoms and burnout.

We wanted to verify the psychological outcomes of health workers operating in a context where the impact of the pandemic appeared to be relatively mild. Methods: Through an online survey, we investigated perceived difficulties at work and in daily life, perceived loneliness and social support, coping strategies, and level of psychological distress (sample size: 749; mean age = 48.04 years, SD = 10.66). The questionnaire had both open- (2) and close-ended questions (5 single-choice and 13 multiple-choice). We verified possible associations between sex, age group, work department and percentage of responses with chi-square tests of independence on each question. Data cleaning excluded all contradictory answers from the multiple-choice questions from the analyses (final sample size: 640). Results: Frontliners and non-frontliners reported a similar experience of the COVID-19 pandemic (without significant differences in perceived difficulties, coping strategies and sources of support). Nevertheless, they still reported various forms of negative emotions (e.g., helplessness40.94%; sadness36.56%; frustration32.66%) and lack of support from the health organization (especially frontliners28.72%). However, psychological help was scarcely requested.

MCI is a heterogenous clinical syndrome reflecting a change in cognitive function and deficits on neuropsychological testing but relatively intact activities of daily living. MCI is a risk state for further cognitive and functional decline with 5C15% of people developing dementia per year. However, ~50% remain stable at 5 years and in a minority, symptoms resolve over time. There is considerable debate about whether MCI is a useful clinical diagnosis, or whether the use of the term prevents proper inquiry (by history, examination and investigations) into underlying causes of cognitive symptoms, which can include prodromal neurodegenerative disease, other physical or psychiatric illness, or combinations thereof. Cognitive testing, neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers can improve the sensitivity and specificity of aetiological diagnosis, with growing evidence that these may also help guide prognosis. Diagnostic criteria allow for a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease to be made where MCI is accompanied by appropriate biomarker changes, but in practice, such biomarkers are not available in routine clinical practice in the UK. This would change if disease-modifying therapies became available and required a definitive diagnosis but would present major challenges to the National Health Service and similar health systems. Significantly increased investment would be required in training, infrastructure and provision of fluid biomarkers and neuroimaging. Statistical techniques combining markers may provide greater sensitivity and specificity than any single disease marker but their practical usefulness will depend on large-scale studies to ensure ecological validity and that multiple measures, e.g. both cognitive tests and biomarkers, are widely available for clinical use. To perform such large studies, we must increase research participation amongst those with MCI.","output":"Mild Cognitive Impairment: the Manchester consensus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Less than 2% of overweight children and adolescents in Switzerland can participate in multi-component behaviour changing interventions (BCI), due to costs and lack of time. Stress often hinders positive health outcomes in youth with obesity. Digital health interventions, with fewer on-site visits, promise health care access in remote regions; however, evidence for their effectiveness is scarce. METHODS: This randomized controlled not blinded trial (1:1) was conducted in a childhood obesity center in Switzerland. Forty-one youth aged 10C18 years with body mass index (BMI) > P.90 with risk factors or co-morbidities or BMI > P.97 were recruited. During 5.5 months, the PathMate2 group (PM) received daily conversational agent counselling via mobile app, combined with standardized counselling (4 on-site visits). Controls (CON) participated in a BCI (7 on-site visits). We compared the outcomes of both groups after 5.5 (T1) and 12 (T2) months. Primary outcome was reduction in BMI-SDS (BMI standard deviation score: BMI adjusted for age and sex). Secondary outcomes were changes in body fat and muscle mass (bioelectrical impedance analysis), waist-to-height ratio, physical capacities (modified Dordel-Koch-Test), blood pressure and pulse. Additionally, we hypothesized that less stressed children would lose more weight. Thus, children performed biofeedback relaxation exercises while stress parameters (plasma cortisol, stress questionnaires) were evaluated. RESULTS: At intervention start median BMI-SDS of all patients (18 PM, 13 CON) was 2.61 (obesity > + 2SD). BMI-SDS decreased significantly in CON at T1, but not at T2, and did not decrease in PM during the study. Muscle mass, strength and agility improved significantly in both groups at T2; only PM reduced significantly their body fat at T1 and T2. Average daily PM app usage rate was 71.5%. Cortisol serum levels decreased significantly after biofeedback but with no association between stress parameters and BMI-SDS. No side effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Equally to BCI, PathMate2 intervention resulted in significant and lasting improvements of physical capacities and body composition, but not in sustained BMI-SDS decrease. This youth-appealing mobile health intervention provides an interesting approach for youth with obesity who have limited access to health care. Biofeedback reduces acute stress and could be an innovative adjunct to usual care.

Conventional rehabilitation approaches focus on motor practice of the affected limb and aim to suppress brain activity in the contralesional hemisphere to facilitate ipsilesional hemispheric neuroplasticity subserving motor recovery. Previous research has also demonstrated that exercise of the less-affected limb can promote motor recovery of the affected limb through the interlimb transfer of the trained motor task, termed cross-education. One of the leading theories for cross-education proposes that the interlimb transfer manifests from ipsilateral cortical activity during unimanual motor tasks, and that this ipsilateral cortical activity results in motor related neuroplasticity giving rise to contralateral improvements in motor performance. Conversely, exercise of the less-affected limb promotes contralesional brain activity which is typically viewed as contraindicated in stroke recovery due to the interhemispheric inhibitory influence onto the ipsilesional hemisphere. High-force unimanual handgrip contractions are known to increase ipsilateral brain activation in control participants, but it remains to be determined if this would be observed in participants with stroke. Therefore, this study aimed to determine how parametric increases in handgrip force during repeated contractions with the less-affected limb impacts brain activity bilaterally in participants with stroke and in a cohort of neurologically intact controls. In this study, higher force contractions were found to increase brain activation in the ipsilesional/ipsilateral hemisphere in both groups (p = .002), but no between group differences were observed. These data suggest that high-force exercise with the less-affected limb may promote ipsilesional cortical plasticity to promote motor recovery of the affected-limb in participants with stroke.","output":"Ipsilesional motor cortex activation with high-force unimanual handgrip contractions of the less-affected limb in participants with stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has become a global pandemic in a very short time span. Currently, there is no specific treatment or vaccine to counter this highly contagious disease. There is an urgent need to find a specific cure for the disease and global efforts are directed at developing SARS-CoV-2 specific antivirals and immunomodulators. Ayurvedic Rasayana therapy has been traditionally used in India for its immunomodulatory and adaptogenic effects, and more recently has been included as therapeutic adjuvant for several maladies. Amongst several others, Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha), Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi) and Asparagus racemosus (Shatavari) play an important role in Rasayana therapy. The objective of this study was to explore the immunomodulatory and anti SARS-CoV2 potential of phytoconstituents from Ashwagandha, Guduchi and Shatavari using network pharmacology and docking. The plant extracts were prepared as per ayurvedic procedures and a total of 31 phytoconstituents were identified using UHPLC-PDA and mass spectrometry studies. To assess the immunomodulatory potential of these phytoconstituents an in-silico network pharmacology model was constructed. The model predicts that the phytoconstituents possess the potential to modulate several targets in immune pathways potentially providing a protective role. To explore if these phytoconstituents also possess antiviral activity, docking was performed with the Spike protein, Main Protease and RNA dependent RNA polymerase of the virus. Interestingly, several phytoconstituents are predicted to possess good affinity for the three targets, suggesting their application for the termination of viral life cycle. Further, predictive tools indicate that there would not be adverse herb-drug pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions with concomitantly administered drug therapy. We thus make a compelling case to evaluate the potential of these Rasayana botanicals as therapeutic adjuvants in the management of COVID-19 following rigorous experimental validation.","output":"Ayurveda botanicals in COVID-19 management: An in silico multi-target approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Humans are able to discern the health status of others using olfactory and visual cues, and subsequently shift behavior to make infection less likely. However, little is known about how this process occurs. The present study examined the neural regions involved in differentiating healthy from sick individuals using visual cues. METHODS: While undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, participants (N = 42) viewed facial photos of 30 individuals (targets) who had been injected with an inflammatory challenge--low-dose endotoxin (i.e., sick) or placebo (i.e., healthy), and rated how much they liked each face. We examined regions implicated in processing either threat (amygdala, anterior insula) or cues that signal safety (ventromedial prefrontal cortex [VMPFC]), and how this activity related to their liking of targets and cytokine levels (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-) exhibited by the targets. RESULTS: Photos of sick faces were rated as less likeable compared to healthy faces, and the least liked faces were those individuals with the greatest inflammatory response. While threat-related regions were not significantly active in response to viewing sick faces, the VMPFC was more active in response to viewing healthy (vs. sick) faces. Follow-up analyses revealed that participants tended to have lower VMPFC activity when viewing the least liked faces and the faces of those with the greatest inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: This work builds on prior work implicating the VMPFC in signaling the presence of safe, non-threatening visual stimuli, and suggests the VMPFC may be sensitive to cues signaling relative safety in the context of pathogen threats.","output":"Ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity differentiates sick from healthy faces: Associations with inflammatory responses and disease avoidance motivation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seismic ambient noise with frequencies > 1 Hz includes noise related to human activities. A reduction in seismic noise during the COVID-19 pandemic has been observed worldwide, as restrictions were imposed to control outbreaks of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this context, we studied the effect of changes in anthropogenic activities during COVID-19 on the seismic noise levels in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan, considering time of day, day of the week, and seasonal changes. The results showed the largest reduction in noise levels during the first state of emergency under most conditions. After the first state of emergency was lifted, the daytime noise reverted to previous levels immediately on weekdays and gradually on Sundays. This was likely because economic activities instantly resumed, while non-essential outings on Sundays were still mostly avoided. Furthermore, the daytime noise level on Sundays was strongly reduced regardless of changes on weekdays after the second state of emergency, which restricted activities mainly at night. Sunday noise levels gradually increased from the middle of the second state of emergency, suggesting a gradual reduction in public concern about COVID-19 following a decrease in the number of infections. Our findings demonstrate that seismic noise can be used to monitor social activities.","output":"Temporal changes in anthropogenic seismic noise levels associated with economic and leisure activities during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research into medical artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advances in recent years, including surgical applications.

Numerous early-stage senior cohousing projects are registered each year. However, only a few of them are actually built, and when they are, the construction process takes an average of 10 years. Would-be cohousing residents have to put their tenacity and other competencies to the test to overcome the obstacles in their path before their residential complex is completed. The model proposed here analyzes senior cohousing initiatives as entrepreneurial undertakings. To this end, it draws upon a comprehensive review of the literature on entrepreneurship to identify the personal characteristics, behaviors, and competencies typical of entrepreneurs. In this model, participants in senior cohousing projects make use of these entrepreneurial competencies to help them overcome the obstacles to completing their housing development. However, for the would-be cohousing residents, the objective is not simply to build the residential complex but to enjoy the satisfaction and well-being this housing typology offers.

We recently observed patients with documented COVID-19 develop de novo severe genitourinary symptoms, most notably urinary frequency of  13 episodes/24 hours and nocturia  4 episodes/night. We call these associated urinary symptoms COVID-19 associate cystitis (CAC). COVID-19 severity is associated with inflammation. We collected urine samples from COVID-19 patients, including patients with CAC, and found elevation of proinflammatory cytokines also in the urine. It has been previously shown that patients with urinary incontinence and ulcerative interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome have elevated urinary inflammatory cytokines compared to normal controls. We therefore hypothesize that CAC, with presentation of de novo severe urinary symptoms, can occur in COVID-19 and is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines that are released into the urine and/or expressed in the bladder. The most important implications of our hypothesis are: 1) Physician caring for COVID-19 patients should be aware of COVID-19 associate cystitis (CAC); 2) De novo urinary symptoms should be included in the symptom complex associated with COVID-19; and 3) COVID-19 inflammation may result in bladder dysfunction.","output":"COVID-19 Inflammation Results in Urine Cytokine Elevation and Causes COVID-19 Associated Cystitis (CAC)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Childhood fever is a frequent reason for health care visits.

Studying collaborative capacity in the battle against pandemics facilitate our understanding of multisectoral collaboration in technical, political, and institutional dimensions, and greatly advances the richness of capacity vocabulary in pandemic response and preparedness.","output":"Organizational collaborative capacity in fighting pandemic crises: a literature review from the public management perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), is an enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes a highly fatal acute diarrhea in newborn pigs. It's typically clinical manifestations consist of omitting, severe diarrhea, loss water and highly infectious disease. All kinds and ages of pigs can be infected. Particular, the mortality piglets under 3 weeks may reach 100% . The effective protection against TGEV requires the development of vaccines that are able to induce local mucosal immunization. Lactococcus lactis was selected as a bacterial carrier for the expression of TGEV spike glycoprotein. The gene of S glycoprotein was cloned into the Lactococcus lactis vectors pNZ8112. An approximately 2000 bps fragments of TGEV gene S that encompasses all the four major antigenic domains critical for neutralization was transformed into Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 by electroporation, resulting in the recombinant strain pNZ8112-Sa/NZ9000. The recombinant glycoprotein S was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot after induced by 1ng/mL nisin. The result indicated that the expressed product maintain the antigenicity of TGEV as expected. In order to detect the location of expressed protein, the yellow and green fluorescence of the recombinant strain pNZ8112-Sa/NZ9000 was detected by the IFA experiments, which indicated that the expressed recombinant protein was secreted and located on the surface of the bacterium cell. Oral immunization of BALB/c mice with recombinant strain that constitutively express the 66kDa fragment of the glycoprotein S, Specific anti-TGEV glycoprotein S secret immunoglobulin A (sIgA) antibodies were detected by indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the feces after immunization. It was showed that the mice immunized with pNZ8112-Sa/NZ9000 recombinant strain had produced clear antibody level anti TGEV, and which had provided important substance foundation and explored the feasibility of Lactobacillus as oral vaccine.","output":"[Construction of recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing porcine transmissible gastroenteritis spike glycoprotein and analysis of immunogenicity]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia in elderly people remains uncertain. We compared the number of elderly patients admitted to our hospital for community-acquired pneumonia from January to June 2020 to the numbers from the same period in each of the last three years. The number of patients began decreasing in February 2020, and by April 2020 the number was significantly lower than those from the same period in the three years prior. There is no evidence regarding the impact of general infection control measures, such as wearing a face mask or washing one's hands, on the development of community-acquired pneumonia, because causative bacteria are not believed to be transmitted from human to human. However, these measures might have indirectly contributed to a decreased number of cases through the prevention of common viral infections which could be a trigger of community-acquired pneumonia.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic and the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia in elderly people"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT COVID vaccination has begun in most of the countries. Older population and high-risk groups are prioritized for vaccination. Postvaccination imaging in cancer patients may show effects of the immune response to the vaccine. As such, it is important to know the timing and laterality of the vaccination as the reactive lymph nodes in the ipsilateral axilla can be seen on the imaging. We present a case of DOTATATE-avid nonpathologically enlarged lymph nodes in ipsilateral axilla and linear tracer uptake in the deltoid muscle on a patient imaged for a recent diagnosis of rectal neuroendocrine neoplasm.","output":"COVID Lessons Continue: Postvaccination Somatostatin Receptor-Positive Axillary Nodes on DOTATATE Imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This future-oriented study examines the opportunities and challenges offered by social robots and communication technology when aiming to decrease emotional and social loneliness in older people residing in assisted living (AL). The paper draws on prior literature on loneliness, elder care and social robots. The aim is to scan the futures regarding technology support for the frail older people in future AL. The analytical frame was built on Robert Weiss division of relational functions: attachment, social integration, opportunity for nurturance, reassurance of worth, sense of reliable alliance, and guidance in stressful situations, and on a distinction between direct and indirect social robots. Our examinations show that social robots could tackle both emotional and social loneliness in assisted living by empowering people to engage in different forms of social interaction inside and outside the facility. However, ethical concerns of objectification, lack of human contact, and deception need to be thoroughly considered when implementing social robots in care for frail older people.","output":"Can robots tackle late-life loneliness?

METHODS: Data on 24,034 patients screened for COVID-19 as of July 2020 were extracted from the Froedtert/Medical College of Wisconsin Epic medical record. COVID-19 outcomes were defined as positive screens, proportion hospitalized among positive screens, and proportion that died among positive and hospitalized population. The primary independent variable was a 3-category variable: physical health diagnosis alone, mental health diagnosis alone, and combined mental and physical health diagnoses. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the independent relationship between separate and combined diagnoses and COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: Compared to physical health diagnosis alone, mental health diagnosis alone had lower odds of screening positive (OR=0.68, CI=0.51;0.92) and was not associated with hospitalization or mortality among positive screens. Combined had lower odds of screening positive (OR=0.78, CI=0.69;0.88) and higher odds of hospitalization among positive screens after adjusting for demographics (OR=1.58, CI=1.20;2.08) but lost significance in the fully adjusted model. No category of diagnoses was associated with mortality. LIMITATIONS: Analysis is cross-sectional and cannot speak to any causal relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, compared to physical health diagnosis alone, mental health diagnosis and combined had lower odds of positive screens. However, individuals with combined were more likely to be hospitalized, after adjusting for demographics only. These findings add new evidence for risk of COVID-19 and related hospitalization in individuals who have a physical and mental health diagnosis.","output":"Relationship between physical and mental health comorbidities and COVID-19 positivity, hospitalization, and mortality"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/38.md","filePath":"doctor/38.md"}'),V={name:"doctor/38.md"},E=Object.assign(V,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(R)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
