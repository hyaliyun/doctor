The VIGILANCE (VItal siGns monItoring with continuous puLse oximetry And wireless cliNiCian notification aftEr surgery) study was a randomized controlled trial (n=2049) designed to assess the impact of continuous vital sign monitoring with alerts sent to nursing staff when respiratory resuscitations with naloxone, code blues, and intensive care unit transfers occurred in a cohort of postsurgical patients in a ward setting. This report identifies and evaluates key issues and challenges associated with introducing wireless monitoring systems into complex hospital infrastructure during the VIGILANCE eHealth intervention implementation. Potential solutions and suggestions for future implementation research are presented. OBJECTIVE The goals of this study were to: (1) identify issues related to the deployment of the eHealth intervention system of the VIGILANCE study; and (2) evaluate the influence of these issues on intervention adoption. METHODS During the VIGILANCE study, issues affecting the implementation of the eHealth intervention were documented on case report forms, alarm event forms, and a nursing user feedback questionnaire. These data were collated by the research and nursing personnel and submitted to the research coordinator. In this evaluation report, the clinical adoption framework was used as a guide to organize the identified issues and evaluate their impact. RESULTS Using the clinical adoption framework, we identified issues within the framework dimensions of people, organization, and implementation at the meso level, as well as standards and funding issues at the macro level. Key issues included: nursing workflow changes with blank alarm forms (24/1030, 2.33%) and missing alarm forms (236/1030, 22.91%), patient withdrawal (110/1030, 10.68%), wireless network connectivity, false alarms (318/1030, 30.87%), monitor malfunction (36/1030, 3.49%), probe issues (16/1030, 1.55%), and wireless network standards. At the micro level, these issues affected the quality of the service in terms of support provided, the quality of the information yielded by the monitors, and the functionality, reliability, and performance of the monitoring system. As a result, these issues impacted access through the decreased ability of nurses to make complete use of the monitors, impacted care quality of the trial intervention through decreased effectiveness, and impacted productivity through interference in the coordination of care, thus decreasing clinical adoption of the monitoring system. CONCLUSIONS Patient monitoring with eHealth technology in surgical wards has the potential to improve patient outcomes. However, proper planning that includes engagement of front-line nurses, installation of appropriate wireless network infrastructure, and use of comfortable cableless devices is required to maximize the potential of eHealth monitoring.

To this effect, we employed three sets of primers specifically designed for amplification of nucleic acids under isothermal conditions. After optimization of reaction conditions, M. hyopneumoniae could be successfully detected at 63C in 45 min through use of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. A positive reaction was identified visually as white precipitate and confirmed by gel electrophoresis. The detection limit for this assay was 10 copies/L, as observed by electrophoretic analysis. The accuracy of the LAMP reaction was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion as well as by direct sequencing of the amplified product. This method can specifically detect M. hyopneumoniae; other species with high homology and other bacterial and virus strains gave negative results. To test the utility of this procedure, the LAMP assay was applied to 40 clinical samples collected from swine lung tissues experimentally challenged with M. hyopneumoniae isolates, and compared to the results from a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A concordance of 100% was observed between the two assays. In conclusion, the results from our study demonstrated that the LAMP assay provided a rapid reaction and was inexpensive to perform, with no need of complex instruments or systems such as Geneamp PCR. The LAMP assay may therefore be applied in routine diagnosis in the clinical laboratory and for in-field detection of M. hyopneumoniae infection.","output":"A rapid and sensitive loop-mediated isothermal amplification procedure (LAMP) for Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae detection based on the p36 gene."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Globe pandemic of COVID-19 endangers the frontline healthcare workers in 2020 To our knowledge, no studies about the HCWs in a field hospital speci","output":"The Health Status of the Healthcare Workers from a Field Hospital (Leishenshan Hospital) During the Pandemic of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the absence of a vaccine or cure, prevention remains the most effective strategy against HIV.

Four SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins, three (S1CS2CRBD) belonging to the spike glycoprotein (S) and one corresponding to the nucleoprotein (N), were prepared and analysed with nLC-UHRTOF by injecting decreasing amounts to establish the limit of detection (LOD) of the method. This was determined as 10 pg for all the components of the S protein and for N (71 amol and 213 amol, respectively). Various viral inactivation strategies plus deglycosylation and digestion approaches were then tested in saliva and plasma spiked with different quantities of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins. The limit of characterisation (LOC) in saliva for the N and S proteins was observed at 100 pg (coverage of 20% and 3%, respectively);instead, in plasma, it was 33 pg for N and 330 pg for the S protein, with a coverage of 4% for both. About 300 and 800 human proteins were identified in plasma and saliva, respectively, including several key effectors and pathways that are known to be altered in COVID-19 patients.

After selective catheterization of the left hepatic artery under x-ray fluoroscopy, we acquired pre- and post-RF ablation 4D TRIP MR images using 3 mL of 2.5% intraarterial gadopentetate dimeglumine. Two regions-of-interest were drawn upon each tumor to generate signal-intensity time curves. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to provide semiquantitative perfusion measurements that were compared using a paired t-test ( = 0.05). Ablated tissue was visually confirmed on pathology using Evans blue dye. RESULTS Mean AUC perfusion of VX2 tumors for the true ablation group decreased by 92.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83.3%-100%), from 1913 (95% CI: 1557, 2269) before RF ablation to 76.6 (95% CI: 18.4, 134.8) after RF ablation (a.u., P < 0.001).

Objective: To estimate the monthly relevant excess mortality for all causes and non-related with violent and COVID-19 causes between January and May 2020 in Peru and nine areas with the highest absolute numbers of deaths by COVID-19. Material: and Methods: To estimate relevant excess mortality, we calculated the monthly upper and lower limits of historical mortality (95% confidence interval) and the average for the last 3 years (2017-2019). REM was considered when observed values exceed the estimated upper limit plus corresponding 2 standard deviations. We also determined REM excluding non-related with violent and COVID-19 causes. Findings: Relevant excess mortality of 35 deaths per 100 000 population from all causes during April and May 2020 were found in Peru with no difference when we excluded violent deaths.

Critical questions for predicting disease emergence are: (1) what determines when and where a disease will first cross from one species to another, and (2) which factors facilitate emergence after a successful host shift. In wild primates, infectious diseases most often are shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographic region. Therefore, humans may be most vulnerable to diseases from the great apes, which include chimpanzees and gorillas, because these species represent our closest relatives. Geographic overlap may provide the opportunity for cross-species transmission, but successful infection and establishment will be determined by the biology of both the host and pathogen. We extrapolate the evolutionary relationship between pathogen sharing and divergence time between primate species to generate hotspot maps, highlighting regions where the risk of disease transfer between wild primates and from wild primates to humans is greatest. We find that central Africa and Amazonia are hotspots for cross-species transmission events between wild primates, due to a high diversity of closely related primate species. Hotspots of host shifts to humans will be most likely in the forests of central and west Africa, where humans come into frequent contact with their wild primate relatives.

Our objective was to analyze the evolution of the information in Spanish online about the prevention of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods. On 1 March and 13 July 2020, two searches were conducted on Google with the terms \\"Prevencion COVID-19\\" and \\"Prevencion Coronavirus\\". In each stage, a univariate analysis was performed to study the association of the authorship and country of origin with the basic recommendations to avoid COVID-19 provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). Results. A total of 120 weblinks were evaluated. The recommendation found most frequently in both stages was \\"wash your hands frequently\\" (93.3% in March vs. 90.0% in July). There was a significant increase in the detection of the following recommendations: \\"avoid touching your face\\" (56.7% vs. 80.0%) and \\"stay at home if you feel unwell\\" (28.3% vs. 63.3%). Weblinks of official public health organizations more frequently provided the advice to \\"seek medical advice if you develop a fever/cough or have difficulty breathing\\". Furthermore, in July, such weblinks provided recommendations to \\"avoid touching your face\\" and \\"maintain a distance of one meter\\" more frequently than the mass media (OR = 11.5 and 10.5, respectively). In March, the recommendation to \\"maintain a distance of at least 1 m\\" was associated with the weblinks from countries with local transmission/imported cases (OR = 8.1). Different/ambiguous information regarding the WHO recommendations was detected in four weblinks. Conclusion. The availability of information in Spanish online on basic prevention measures has improved over time, although there is still room for improvement. It is necessary to promote the use of the websites of official public health organizations among Spanish-speaking users.","output":"Information in Spanish on the Internet about the Prevention of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The moment we are living in has demanded changes in the lives and routines of people all over the world.

Psychotic manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 attributable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection are seldom reported. We report a case of coronavirus disease 2019 in a young West African male who had no known risk factors of psychiatric illness or past history of psychiatric disease presenting with acute psychosis. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient, who was a young West African male, presented without the typical respiratory symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 and also without a background history of psychiatric illness or any other significant stressors in his past or present social history. He had acute onset of psychotic symptoms consisting of visual and auditory hallucinations, delusions of persecution, and lack of insight. He was admitted and managed with antipsychotic medication and mood stabilizer. His laboratory workup was normal except for positive coronavirus disease 2019 polymerase chain reaction and his liver enzymes, which showed elevated gamma glutamyl transferase, a finding consistent with coronavirus disease 2019. His head computed tomography scan was also normal. The patient made a gradual recovery from his psychotic symptoms, with gain of insight 7 weeks after onset of symptoms, at which time his coronavirus disease 2019 test came back negative along with other laboratory parameters. He returned to work 12 weeks after his presentation and has been performing well.

People with severe mental ill health (SMI, e.g., bipolar or psychosis spectrum disorders) are at greater risk for digital exclusion and it is unknown to what extent they are able to adapt to online service delivery. This study explored use of the Internet and digital devices during the pandemic restrictions and its association with physical and mental health changes. Methods: 367 adults with an SMI diagnosis completed a survey (online or offline) and provided information on access to Internet connection and devices, internet skills, online activities, and barriers to using the Internet. They also self-reported changes in mental and physical health. Results: During the pandemic restrictions 61.6% were limited or non-users of the Internet. The majority had access to the Internet and digital devices but around half reported knowledge deficits. Most common activities were accessing information and entertainment (88.9%), staying in touch with friends and families (84.8%), and purchasing goods (other than food) (84.3%). Most common barriers were finding the Internet 'not interesting' (28.3%) or 'too difficult' (27.9%), as well as 'security concerns' (22.1% to 24.3%). Using the Internet 'a lot' (vs 'just a bit or not at all') during the pandemic was associated with younger age (Adj ORs = 4.76 and 6.39, Ps < .001), having a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (compared to psychosis; Adj OR = 3.88, P < .001), or reporting a decline in mental health (compared to no decline; Adj OR = 1.92, P = .01). Conclusion: Most people with SMI were limited or non-users of the Internet during the pandemic, which seems to be mainly attributable to lack of interest and skills, rather than lack of devices or connectivity.

If infected, AI patients require prompt replacement tailoring. We assessed, in a cohort of AI patients: prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19; prevalence of AC and association with intercurrent COVID-19 or pandemic-related psychophysical stress; lockdown-induced emotional burden, and health-related QoL. METHODS: In this monocentric (Ancona University Hospital, Italy), cross-sectional study covering February-April 2020, 121 (40 primary, 81 secondary) AI patients (59 males, 55  17 years) completed telematically three questionnaires: the purpose-built CORTI-COVID, assessing medical history and concern for COVID-19-related global health, AI-specific personal health, occupational, economic, and social consequences; the AddiQoL-30; the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey. RESULTS: COVID-19 occurred in one (08% prevalence) 48-year-old woman with primary AI, who promptly tailored her replacement. Dyspnea lasted three days, without requiring hospitalization. Secondary AI patients were not involved. No AC were experienced, but pandemic-related stress accounted for 6/14 glucocorticoid up-titrations. Mean CORTI-COVID was similar between groups, mainly depending on personal health in primary AI ( = 0.888, p < 0.0001) and economy in secondary AI ( = 0.854, p < 0.0001). Working restrictions increased occupational concern. CORTI-COVID correlated inversely with QoL. AddiQoL-30 and SF-36 correlated strongly. Comorbidities worsened patients QoL. CONCLUSION: If educational efforts are made in preventing acute events, AI patients seem not particularly susceptible to COVID-19. The novel CORTI-COVID questionnaire reliably assesses the pandemic-related emotional burden in AI. Even under unconventional stress, educated AI patients preserve a good QoL.

Findings: People affected by disasters sometimes receive multiple requests for study participation by separate teams who may not necessarily be coordinating their work. Not keeping participants informed of the research process or outcomes can lead to disillusionment. Being overburdened with too many research requests and failing to see any subsequent changes following participation may cause individuals to experience research fatigue. Originality/value: Guidelines for researchers wishing to reduce the occurrence of research fatigue include ensuring greater transparency within research; sharing of results and using oversight or gatekeeper bodies to aid coordination. Failure to restrict the number of times that people are asked to participate in studies risks poor participation rates.

A study carried out in China (Guan WJ et al. N Engl J Med. 2020) reported that in more than 21% of cases there was an elevation of liver enzymes (ELE), with only 2.1% of them having previous liver disease. ELE is frequent in anticoagulated patients and is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk and bleeding complications2,3. It is necessary to evaluate the impact of ELE in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and COVID-19 Methods: Multicenter, retrospective and observational study that consecutively included patients admitted with COVID-19 during the months of March and April 2020. The patients were followed were followed up until 30 days after discharge or death. termino en ingls Anticoagulation was chosen at the clinical discretion. The main variables investigated were the value of liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT) at admission, during the first week (peak value) and at hospital discharge. Patients who achieved a 3-fold higher level of ELE(> 120UI) were described as high-risk transaminasemia (HRT). The number of bleedings, thromboembolic events, as well as all-cause mortality were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Results: A total of 235 patients were included. The mean age was 79 years [standard deviation (SD) 7.9. years]. The demographic characteristics of the patients with and without HRT are summarized in Table 1. The median follow-up was 59 days (SD 29 days). In AF patients, ELE values rose significantly on admission with respect to discharge p <0.05. No significant difference in the value of ELE was found between those who received LMWH versus ACODS. In patients with AF, there were 30 admissions to intensive care, these had higher ELE values at admission and at discharge, awith ALT at admission and ALT, AST and GGT at discharge being significant, p <0.05. They also presented 24 (10%) bleeding events, which had a significantly higher AST level in the first week (42-60UI). There were 45 (19.1%) patients who died during de follow-up, ELE values were significantly higher on admission. Finally, if we analyze the events in the 48 HRTpatients (21%) compared to the non-TAR 187 patients (79%), they had significantly more hemorrhagic events, and death from all causes, p <0.05, events was resume in Table 2.

Karyopherins comprise a family of soluble transport factors facilitating the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of proteins through the NPC. In this study, we found that karyopherin 6 (KPNA6; also known as importin 7) was required for the optimal replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), which are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses replicating in the cytoplasm. The KPNA6 protein level in virus-infected cells was much higher than that in mock-infected controls, whereas the KPNA6 transcript remains stable. Viral infection blocked the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of KPNA6, which led to an extension of the KPNA6 half-life and the elevation of the KPNA6 level in comparison to mock-infected cells. PRRSV nsp12 protein induced KPNA6 stabilization. KPNA6 silencing was detrimental to the replication of PRRSV, and KPNA6 knockout impaired ZIKV replication. Moreover, KPNA6 knockout blocked the nuclear translocation of PRRSV nsp1 but had a minimal effect on two other PRRSV proteins with nuclear localization. Exogenous restitution of KPNA6 expression in the KPNA6-knockout cells results in restoration of the nuclear translocation of PRRSV nsp1 and the replication of ZIKV. These results indicate that KPNA6 is an important cellular factor for the replication of PRRSV and ZIKV.IMPORTANCE Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The roles of transport factors in the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking system for the replication of +ssRNA viruses are not known. In this study, we discovered that PRRSV and ZIKV viruses needed karyopherin 6 (KPNA6), one of the transport factors, to enhance the virus replication. Our data showed that viral infection induced an elevation of the KPNA6 protein level due to an extension of the KPNA6 half-life via viral interference of the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of KPNA6. Notably, KPNA6 silencing or knockout dramatically reduced the replication of PRRSV and ZIKV. PRRSV nsp1 depended on KPNA6 to translocate into the nucleus. In addition, exogenous restitution of KPNA6 expression in KPNA6-knockout cells led to the restoration of nsp1 nuclear translocation and ZIKV replication. These results reveal a new aspect in the virus-cell interaction and may facilitate the development of novel antiviral therapeutics.","output":"Karyopherin Alpha 6 Is Required for Replication of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus and Zika Virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronary artery disease (CAD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) constitute two of the leading causes of death in Europe, USA and the rest of the world. According to the latest reports of the Iranian National Health Ministry, CAD is the main cause of death in Iranian patients with an age over 35 years despite a significant reduction in mortality due to early interventional treatments in the context of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Inflammation plays a fundamental role in coronary atherogenesis, atherosclerotic plaque formation, acute coronary thrombosis and CAD establishment. Chemokines are well-recognized mediators of inflammation involved in several bio-functions such as leucocyte migration in response to inflammatory signals and oxidative vascular injury. Different chemokines serve as chemo-attractants for a wide variety of cell types including immune cells. CXC motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), also known as interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10/CXLC10), is a chemokine with inflammatory features whereas CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) serves as a shared receptor for CXCL9, 10 and 11.

The calculated hourly global solar irradiance agrees well with measurements at the ground in 2008C2011 (the model development period) and at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). This model is applied to compute global solar irradiance at the ground and its extinction in the atmosphere caused by absorbing and scattering substances during the 2006C2016 period. A sensitivity study shows that the responses of global solar irradiance to changes in water vapor and scattering factors (expressed by water vapor pressure and S/G, respectively; S and G are diffuse and global solar irradiance, respectively) are nonlinear and negative, and that global solar irradiance is more sensitive to changes in scattering than to changes in water vapor. Applying this empirical model, the albedos at the TOA and the surface in 2006C2016 are estimated and found to agree with the satellite-based retrievals. During 2006C2016, the annual mean observed and estimated global solar exposures decreased by 0.05% and 0.09%, respectively, and the diffuse exposure increased by 0.68% per year, associated with the yearly increase of the S/G ratio by 0.57% and the water vapor pressure by 1.46%.

The annual mean losses of solar exposure due to absorbing and scattering substances and the total loss were 4.02, 0.19 and 4.21 MJ m(?2), respectively. The annual mean absorbing loss was much larger than the scattering loss; their contributions to the total loss were 95.49% and 4.51%, respectively, indicating that absorbing substances are dominant and play essential roles. The annual absorbing, scattering and total losses increased by 0.01%, 0.39% and 0.28% per year, respectively. The estimated and satellite-retrieved annual albedos increased at the surface.

Further, the study also examines the impact of COVID-19 cases on the stock market returns of each GCC country and the continuous dynamics of correlation between COVID-19 cases and GCC stock markets. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an exponential generalized auto regressive conditional heteroskedasticity model and continuous wavelet coherence to estimate the stock market volatility and co-movement between COVID-19 cases and stock returns. Findings: Empirical findings indicate an adverse reaction (negative returns and high volatility) during the period examined, with the stimulus package resulting in a positive transformation of returns in each country-level stock market as well as the regional stock index. Further, no evidence of an adverse effect of the oil price plunge is identified. All findings are identical between both conventional and Islamic stock indices. Originality/value: While ample research has been conducted on the impact and dynamics of the pandemic on stock markets, little has addressed the areas of financial stimulus packages and the oil price plunge. The findings of this study show that further research needs to be conducted to elucidate the ways in which effective financial stimulus packages can be formulated in the GCC region to mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19 for economies without causing major financial deficits, as well as to find strategies to diversify economies away from the oil curse. ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"COVID-19 and GCC stock market performance: an analysis of the boon (financial stimulus package) and curse (oil price plunge) effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Viruses are the main cause of respiratory tract infections. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) enables the unbiased detection of all potential pathogens in a clinical sample, including variants and even unknown pathogens. To apply mNGS in viral diagnostics, there is a need for sensitive and simultaneous detection of RNA and DNA viruses. In this study, the performance of an in-house mNGS protocol for routine diagnostics of viral respiratory infections, with single tube DNA and RNA sample-pre-treatment and potential for automated pan-pathogen detection was studied. Materials and Methods The sequencing protocol and bioinformatics analysis was designed and optimized including the optimal concentration of the spike-in internal controls equine arteritis virus (EAV) and phocine-herpes virus-1 (PhHV-1).The whole genome of PhHV-1 was sequenced and added to the NCBI database. Subsequently, the protocol was retrospectively validated using a selection of 25 respiratory samples with in total 29 positive and 346 negative PCR results, previously sent to the lab for routine diagnostics. Results The results demonstrated that our protocol using Illumina Nextseq 500 sequencing with 10 million reads showed high repeatability. The NCBI RefSeq database as opposed to the NCBI nucleotide database led to enhanced specificity of virus classification. A correlation was established between read counts and PCR cycle threshold value, demonstrating the semi-quantitative nature of viral detection by mNGS. The results as obtained by mNGS appeared condordant with PCR based diagnostics in 25 out of the 29 (86%) respiratory viruses positive by PCR and in 315 of 346 (91%) PCR-negative results. Viral pathogens only detected by mNGS, not present in the routine diagnostic workflow were influenza C, KI polyomavirus, and cytomegalovirus. Conclusions Sensitivity and analytical specificity of this mNGS protocol was comparable with PCR and higher when considering off-PCR target viral pathogens. All potential viral pathogens were detected in one single test, while it simultaneously obtained detailed information on detected viruses.","output":"Metagenomic Sequencing for Combined Detection of RNA and DNA Viruses in Respiratory Samples from Paediatric Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is common during SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection.

Workplace health promotion programs have been shown to be an efficient way of improving employee health. These can also benefit employers by improving retention, reducing worker turnover, and lowering healthcare costs. In Slovenia, a workplace health promotion program called STAR-VITALJoint Measures for the Vitality of Older Workers targeting small- and medium-sized enterprises has been ongoing since September 2017. We hypothesize that this workplace health promotion program will yield long-term health changes for the included employees and employers. Methods/Design: The manuscript presents a workplace health promotion program design that introduces some novel approaches and solutions to workplace health promotion program implementation. It also introduces a measurement of their effects that address the problem of low participation rates and the effectiveness of workplace health promotion programs, as follows: (1) the multifaceted and individualised approach to implementation, (2) customer relationship management (CRM) -based interaction management with program participants, and (3) impact evaluation based on employee health and labour market data observing both intermediate outcomes and the final outcomes based on national micro administrative data. Discussion: Although the novel approaches introduced with the STAR-VITAL program proved to be effective during the COVID-19 pandemic, they deserve the attention of scholars and practitioners. Further research is called for to further explore the potential of CRM in health promotion contexts, the effectiveness of multifaceted and individualised workplace health promotion program interventions, and micro administrative data-based impact evaluations. Conclusions: The STAR-VITAL program introduces several new approaches addressing the problem of low participation rates and the effectiveness of WHPPs.

DESIGN: This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items Statement for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyzes (PRISMA). DATA SOURCES: The review was performed in two main databases, PubMed and EconLit, and was completed with the gray literature search. STUDY SELECTION: The basic criterion for the inclusion of studies was that they present at least one measure of indirect costs specific to TTH. DATA EXTRACTION: 12 studies were finally selected for information extraction. Of all the selected articles, the characteristics of the study design, the types of costs included, as well as the measurement instrument, and the main results were synthesized. RESULTS: The search yielded a total of 568 studies. Heterogeneity was found in the designs and samples/populations of the included studies. Only two studies estimated direct and indirect costs for TTH. Among the most notable results, we find an estimated moderate impact of disability due to TTH (between 0.037 and 0.15 per person, 0.06C0.09% for the population). Productivity and efficiency losses were observed and were very heterogeneous. The willingness to pay for effective treatment would range from $1.32 to $9.20 per month. Quality of life is low, between 28.2 and 28.4 points out of 100, and health-related quality of life seems to improve significantly with treatment.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients at the Royal Hospital, Muscat, Oman, from March to April 2020. Radiographic and clinical data were collected from the hospital and radiology information systems and compared between two groups based on intubation status. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients confirmed to have COVID-19 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test were included in the study; 15/26 were non-intubated, and 11/26 were intubated. Overall, 88.5% were males in the intubated group. Respiratory symptoms were the most common presentation (84.6%) followed by fever (76.9%), with no statistical difference between the two groups. There was a statistically significant difference in having diabetes mellitus (p = 0.020) in which 8/11 and 4/15 were recorded to have diabetes mellitus in the intubated and non-intubated groups, respectively. Other comorbidities showed no statistically significant difference. The radiographic analysis redemonstrates the peripheral lower zone distribution but no statistically significant difference among the two groups. There were no differences between the intubated and non-intubated chest radiography in laterality involvement, central and peripheral distribution, and lesions type. However, upper zones involvement was more noted in the intubated group with 10/11 (90.9%) compared to 7/15 (46.7%) in non-intubated cases (p = 0.036). There were higher numbers of zone involvement in intubated cases than non-intubated cases: 9/11 (81.8%) of intubated patients had 10C12 areas of involvement on chest radiographs compared to 3/15 (20.0%) in the non-intubated group. Half of the cases were discharged home; 3/11 from the intubated group and 10/15 from the non-intubated group. Five patients died from the intubated group (5/11) versus 3/15 from the non-intubated group. Five patients are still hospitalized (three from the intubated group and two from the non-intubated group). CONCLUSIONS: The radiographic findings among intubated and non-intubated hospitalized COVID-19 patients demonstrate differences in the number of zones involved.

Such description might be valid in highlighting how pharmacy is practiced and the conditions within and beyond community pharmacy organizations. Therefore, it is not surprising that the concept of integrating community pharmacy into the primary care system may not be considered in the contemporary discourse despite the fact that community pharmacy has been operating within communities for years. However, in the case of Indonesia, we argue that changes in the health care system within the past decade particularly with the introduction of the universal health coverage (UHC) in 2014, may have significantly amplified the role of pharmacists. There is good evidence which highlights the contribution of pharmacist as a substantial health care element in primary care practice. The initiative for employing pharmacist, identified in this article as primary care pharmacist, in the setting of community health center [puskesmas] and the introduction of affiliated or contracted community pharmacy under the UHC have enabled pharmacist to work together with other primary care providers.

However, very few studies explore the susceptibility of animals to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Viral attachment as a crucial step for cross-species infection requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor and depends on TMPRSS2 protease activity. Here, we searched the genomes of metazoans from different classes using an extensive BLASTP survey and found ACE2 and TMPRSS2 occur in vertebrates, but some vertebrates lack Tmprss2. We identified 6 amino acids among 25 known human ACE2 residues are highly associated with the binding of ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 (p value < .01) by Fisher exact test, and following this, calculated the probability of viral attachment within each species by the randomForest function from R randomForest library. Furthermore, we observed that Ace2 selected from seven animals based on the above analysis lack the hydrophobic contacts identified on human ACE2, indicating less affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to Ace2 in animals than humans. Finally, the alignment of 3D structure between human ACE2 and other animals by I-TASSER and TM-align displayed a reasonable structure for viral attachment within these species. Taken together, our data may shed light on the human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Comparative analyses of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene: Implications for the risk to which vertebrate animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Cardiovascular comorbidities confer worse outcomes for patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the impact of heart failure (HF) with preserved (HFpEF) and reduced (HFrEF) ejection fraction has not been well characterized. The aim herein is to examine outcomes in COVID-19 patients with and without HF. Methods Patients (n = 437) consecutively admitted with COVID-19 were categorized according to the presence vs. absence of HF and subcategorized according to HFpEF and HFrEF (EF <50%). The primary outcome was inpatient mortality with independent correlates were identified with logistic regression. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and need for mechanical ventilation. Results The median cohort patient age was 68 (56-76) years, 43% (n = 189) were female, and 41% (n = 179) were Caucasian. HF was present in 29.7% (n = 130) of patients of which 43.8% (n = 57) had HFrEF and 56.2% (N = 73) had HFpEF. Patients with HF were more likely to be of older age and have more comorbidities. Overall inpatient mortality in the cohort was 12.3%. Compared to patients without HF (7.6%), patients with HFpEF (39.1%) and HFrEF (23.5%) had higher inpatient mortality (p<0.05) and were more likely to develop AKI, require mechanical ventilation, and have worse ARDS (figure 1). ACE/ARB and/or hydroxychloroquine were not associated with mortality (p >0.05) and there were no differences in inflammatory markers (ferritin, D-dimer, CRP, LDH). Independent predictors of inpatient mortality included: HFpEF (adjOR 2.55 (1.37-4.76)), age > 65 years (adjOR 3.00 (1.66-5.43), African American race (adjOR 1.82 (1.00-3.30)), Other race (adjOR 2.34 (1.02-5.37), p = 0.043), cerebrovascular disease (adjOR 3.07 (1.54-6.10), p = 0.001), and chronic hypoxic respiratory failure [adjOR 3.02 (1.19-7.62], p = 0.019)], whereas HFrEF was not (adjOR 1.58 (0.77-3.23). Discussion HF is prevalent in patients admitted with COVID-19. Patients with HFpEF had 2.6-fold higher mortality than those without HF and greater burdens of inpatient complications. Patients with HFpEF with COVID19 may warrant closer outpatient monitoring and a lower threshold for admission.","output":"Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients with Heart Failure Admitted with Covid-19 in a Cohort Study from Southeast Michigan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Timber industry generates large amounts of residues such as sawdust. Softwoods have a significant economic value for timber production and the Pinus genus is widely utilized. Thus, the aim of this work was to study the hemicellulose extraction and lignin recovery from pine (Pinus spp.) residual sawdust (PRS) by sequential acid-alkaline treatment, generating a cellulose-rich solid fraction. The hemicellulose removed was 87.11% (wtwt-1) after dilute acid treatment at 130 C, 4.5% (wtwt-1) of H2SO4 for 20 min at 120 rpm. Three temperatures were evaluated for recovering the lignin and the highest yield, 93.97% (wtwt-1), was achieved at 170 C, 10% (wtwt-1) of NaOH for 90 min at 120 rpm. Lignin was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and thermogravimetry. The resulting cellulose-rich fraction exhibited polymorphic transformation.

This pandemic requires the execution of planned control strategies, incorporating quarantine, self-isolation, and tracing of asymptomatic cases. Mathematical modeling is one of the prominent techniques for predicting and controlling the spread of COVID-19. The predictions of earlier proposed epidemiological models (e.g. SIR, SEIR, SIRD, SEIRD, etc.) are not much accurate due to lack of consideration for transmission of the epidemic during the latent period. Moreover, it is important to classify infected individuals to control this pandemic. Therefore, a new mathematical model is proposed to incorporate infected individuals based on whether they have symptoms or not. This model forecasts the number of cases more accurately, which may help in better planning of control strategies. The model consists of eight compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), asymptomatic (A), quarantined (Q), recovered (R), deaths (D), and insusceptible (T), accumulatively named as SEIAQRDT. This model is employed to predict the pandemic results for India and its majorly affected states. The estimated number of cases using the SEIAQRDT model is compared with SIRD, SEIR, and LSTM models. The relative error square analysis is used to verify the accuracy of the proposed model. The simulation is done on real datasets and results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) framework conceptualizes psychological flexibility as an important way to reduce the impact of painful and even catastrophic events on psychological suffering. The current study examines psychological flexibility as a potential moderator of the prevailing interpersonal model of suicide risk. METHODS: A sample of 1003 parents (73% female, 82% Caucasian 86% in romantic relationships) were recruited as part of a larger study on the COVID-19 pandemic and family functioning from Mach 27th to the end of April 2020, the height of the United States' \\"first wave.\\" Participants completed measures of psychological flexibility (the Multidimensional Psychological Flexibility inventory; MPFI), interpersonal constructs (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness), desire for death, COVID-19 related stressors (resource strain and loss due to COVID-19). RESULTS: Moderated-mediation path models highlighted a significant indirect association between COVID-19 stressors and desire for death mediated by perceived burdensomeness to others. This indirect pathway was moderated by psychological inflexibility such that links were strongest at high levels of inflexibility and weak or non-significant at low levels of inflexibility. Results were generally consistent across five of the six facets of inflexibility. DISCUSSION: The findings highlight the value of targeting psychological inflexibility as an important strategy to reduce suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite being in a time of vibrant cultural revitalization, Native Hawaiians have a shorter life expectancy than other racial and ethnic groups in Hawaii. The primary aim of this paper was to share data from the first year of a 5-year study with Native Hawaiian kpuna (elders) on their experiences with healthcare, along with barriers to accessing healthcare. Ten kpuna living in rural areas of Hawaii participated in three interviews each, which were held in an informal, talk-story style. The first interview focused on establishing rapport. The second interview focused on the kpuna's strengths, resiliencies, and what they would like to pass to the next generation. The third interview focused on the elders' experiences with healthcare, which is the focus of this paper. All ten kpuna reported growing up with limited access to Western healthcare;rather, their families successfully treated many illnesses and injuries with lau lapaau (Hawaiian herbal medicine) and other traditional healing practices, as they had done for generations. As Western medicine became more prevalent and accessible, they used both, but many preferred holistic treatments such as prayer, a return to the traditional diet, and lau lapaau. As a group, the kpuna rated their health as fair to good;two had diabetes, two had cardiovascular disease, four had neuropathies, and five were cancer survivors. The kpuna reported high turnover among providers in rural communities. Limited access to specialists often required them to travel to Honolulu for care, which was costly and especially difficult during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Regardless of provider ethnicity, the kpuna appreciated those who took the time to get to know them as people and respected Hawaiian cultural practices.

We aimed to assess whether preadmission treatment with SSRIs in patients with acute ischemic stroke is associated with post-thrombolysis symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) and functional outcome. METHODS A multicenter retrospective analysis was conducted in prospective registries of patients treated by thrombolysis within 4.5 hours of stroke onset. The association between preadmission treatment with SSRIs and sICH (ECASS II definition [European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study]) or unfavorable 3-month outcome (modified Rankin Scale >2) was assessed by logistic regression, taking into account potential interaction with concomitant use of antithrombotics. RESULTS Six thousand two hundred forty-two patients were included (mean age, 70.114.0 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 9 [5-16]). Preadmission treatment with SSRIs was present in 4.3% (n=266) of patients. Overall, SICH rate was 3.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5%-4.4%; n=244), and SSRI use was not significantly associated with sICH in unadjusted (odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 95% CI, 0.72-2.27) or adjusted (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.71-2.40) analysis. However, there was a significant interaction of concomitant use of OACs (international normalized ratio <1.7) and SSRI for occurrence of sICH (P=0.01). SICH was significantly more frequent in patients taking both OAC and SSRI (23.1%; 95% CI, 8.2%-50.3%) than in patients taking OAC but not SSRI (adjusted OR, 9.04; 95% CI, 1.95-41.89). Preadmission use of SSRI was associated with unfavorable 3-month outcome (unadjusted OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.48-2.46; adjusted OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.15-2.19). CONCLUSIONS Preadmission treatment with SSRIs was not significantly associated with an increased risk of post-thrombolysis sICH in this cohort study. However, subgroup analysis suggested an increased risk of sICH in patients taking both SSRI and OAC. Preadmission treatment with SSRIs was associated with unfavorable outcome, which may reflect the prognostic significance of prestroke depression.","output":"Intracerebral Hemorrhage and Outcome After Thrombolysis in Stroke Patients Using Selective Serotonin-Reuptake Inhibitors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To measure the nursing workload in the Burn Intensive Care Units and evaluate its association with clinical variables, length of stay, and outcome of hospitalization.

There is a need for an easy and accessible home device in predicting sleep apnea. The objective of the study is to determine the predictive performance of the overnight pulse oximetry in predicting OSA in at-risk surgical patients. METHODS: This was a planned post-hoc analysis of multicenter prospective cohort study involving 1,218 at-risk surgical patients without prior diagnosis of sleep apnea. All patients underwent home sleep apnea testing (ApneaLink Plus, ResMed) simultaneously with pulse oximetry (PULSOX-300i, Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc). The predictive performance of the 4% oxygen desaturation index (ODI) versus apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were determined. RESULTS: Of 1,218 patients, the mean age was 67.2  9.2 years and body mass index (BMI) was 27.0  5.3 kg/m(2). The optimal cut-off for predicting moderate-to-severe and severe OSA was ODI 15 events/hour. For predicting moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI 15), the sensitivity and specificity of ODI  15 events per hour were 88.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.7C90.6) and 95.4% (95% CI, 94.2C96.4).

Both traditional Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression analysis and Random Forest machine learning algorithms are applied to quantify contributing factors for county-level vaccination hesitancy. With the machine learning model, joint effects of multiple variables (race/ethnicity, partisanship, age etc.) are considered simultaneously to capture the unique combination of what factors affect the vaccination rate. By implementing a state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence Explanations (AIX) algorithm, it is possible to solve the black box problem with machine learning models and provide answers to the \\"how much\\" question for each measured impact factor in every county. For most counties a higher percentage vote for Republicans, a greater African American population share, and a higher poverty rate lower the vaccination rate. While a higher Asian population share increases the predicted vaccination rate. The impact on the vaccination rate from the Hispanic population proportion is positive in the OLS model, but only positive for counties with very high Hispanic population (65% and more) in the Random Forest model. Both the proportion of seniors and the one for young people in a county have a significant impact in the OLS model - positive and negative, respectively. In contrast, the impacts are ambiguous in the Random Forest model. Because results vary between geographies and since the AIX algorithm is able to quantify vaccine impacts individually for each county, this research can be tailored to local communities. This way it is a helpful tool for local health officials and other policymakers to improve vaccination rates.

METHODS: This controlled cross-sectional study was based on phone interviews of patients discharged from hospital after COVID-19 compared to the control group composed of individuals hospitalized during the same period due to non-COVID-19 causes. Patients were classified as having previous CP based on the ICD-11/IASP criteria, de novo pain (i.e. any new type of pain, irrespective of the pain status before hospital stay), and de novo CP (i.e. persistent or recurring de novo pain, lasting more than 3 months) after COVID-19. We assessed pain prevalence and its characteristics, including headache profile, pain location, intensity, interference, and its relationship with fatigue, and persistent anosmia. Forty-six COVID-19 and 73 control patients were included. Both groups had similar sociodemographic characteristics and past medical history. RESULTS: Length of in-hospital-stay and ICU admission rates were significantly higher amongst COVID-19 survivours, while mechanical ventilation requirement was similar between groups. Pre-hospitalisation pain was lower in COVID-19 compared to control group (10.9% vs. 42.5%; p = 0.001). However, the COVID-19 group had a significantly higher prevalence of de novo pain (65.2% vs. 11.0%, p = 0.001), as well as more de novo headache (39.1%) compared to controls (2.7%, p = 0.001). New-onset CP was 19.6% in COVID-19 patients and 1.4% (p = 0.002) in controls. These differences remained significant (p = 0.001) even after analysing exclusively (COVID: n = 40; controls: n = 34) patients who did not report previous pain before the hospital stay. No statistically significant differences were found for mean new-onset pain intensity and interference with daily activities between both groups. COVID-19 pain was more frequently located in the head/neck and lower limbs (p < 0.05). New-onset fatigue was more common in COVID-19 survivours necessitating inpatient hospital care (66.8%) compared to controls (2.5%, p = 0.001). COVID-19 patients who reported anosmia had more new-onset pain (83.3%) compared to those who did not (48.0%, p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of de novo CP, chronic daily headache, and new-onset pain in general, which was associated with persistent anosmia.

Several theories about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been proposed. Although Betacoronavirus found in Rhinolophus bats from China have been broadly implicated, their genetic dissimilarity to SARS-CoV-2 is so high that they are highly unlikely to be its direct ancestors. Thus, an intermediary host is suspected to link bat to human coronaviruses. Based on genomic CpG dinucleotide patterns in different coronaviruses from different hosts, it was suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might have evolved in a canid gastrointestinal tract prior to transmission to humans. However, similar CpG patterns are now reported in coronaviruses from other hosts, including bats themselves and pangolins. Therefore, reduced genomic CpG alone is not a highly predictive biomarker, suggesting a need for additional biomarkers to reveal intermediate hosts or tissues.

METHODS: The sample consisted of 1325 Finnish adults who filled out an online survey marketed on Facebook. Structural regression analysis was used to investigate whether: 1) conspiracy beliefs, a distrust in information sources, and endorsement of CAM predict people's response to the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented by the government during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) conspiracy beliefs, a distrust in information sources, and endorsement of CAM are related to people's willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Individuals with more conspiracy beliefs and a lower trust in information sources were less likely to have a positive response to the NPIs. Individuals with less trust in information sources and more endorsement of CAM were more unwilling to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Distrust in information sources was the strongest and most consistent predictor in all models. Our analyses also revealed that some of the people who respond negatively to the NPIs also have a lower likelihood to take the vaccine. This association was partly related to a lower trust in information sources. CONCLUSIONS: Distrusting the establishment to provide accurate information, believing in conspiracy theories, and endorsing treatments and substances that are not part of conventional medicine, are all associated with a more negative response to the official guidelines during COVID-19. How people respond to the guidelines, however, is more strongly and consistently related to the degree of trust they feel in the information sources, than to their tendency to hold conspiracy beliefs or endorse CAM.

The generation of human pathogenic coronaviruses is a result of genetic adaptation in bats and/or intermediate hosts, leading to spillover events. Therefore, we propose that specifically reducing or disrupting persistent coronavirus infection in bats may consequently decrease the frequency of human coronavirus diseases. We suggest several strategies to achieve the aforementioned goal in bats, including vaccination and targeted delivery of molecular inhibitors, such as monoclonal antibodies, aptamers, antisense oligonucleotides, and siRNA by use of viral nanoparticles.

METHODS We combined data from 3 large cohorts of consecutive patients diagnosed with CeAD (i.e., Cervical Artery Dissection and Ischemic Stroke Patients-Plus consortium). We dichotomized cases into 2 groups, age 60 and <60 years, and compared clinical characteristics, risk factors, vascular features, and 3-month outcome between the groups. First, we performed a combined analysis of pooled individual patient data. Secondary analyses were done within each cohort and across cohorts. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR [95% confidence interval]) were calculated. RESULTS Among 2,391 patients diagnosed with CeAD, we identified 177 patients (7.4%) aged 60 years. In this age group, cervical pain (ORadjusted 0.47 [0.33-0.66]), headache (ORadjusted 0.58 [0.42-0.79]), mechanical trigger events (ORadjusted 0.53 [0.36-0.77]), and migraine (ORadjusted 0.58 [0.39-0.85]) were less frequent than in younger patients. In turn, hypercholesterolemia (ORadjusted 1.52 [1.1-2.10]) and hypertension (ORadjusted 3.08 [2.25-4.22]) were more frequent in older patients. Key differences between age groups were confirmed in secondary analyses. In multivariable, adjusted analyses, favorable outcome (i.e., modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) was less frequent in the older age group (ORadjusted 0.45 [0.25, 0.83]). CONCLUSION In our study population of patients diagnosed with CeAD, 1 in 14 was aged 60 years. In these patients, pain and mechanical triggers might be missing, rendering the diagnosis more challenging and increasing the risk of missed CeAD diagnosis in older patients.","output":"Cervical artery dissection in patients 60 years: Often painless, few mechanical triggers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has directly and indirectly caused high mortality worldwide. AIM: To explore patterns of mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic and implications for palliative care, service planning and research. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis and population-based modelling of routine data. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: All deaths registered in England and Wales between 7 March and 15 May 2020. We described the following mortality categories by age, gender and place of death: (1) baseline deaths (deaths that would typically occur in a given period); (2) COVID-19 deaths and (3) additional deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19. We estimated the proportion of people who died from COVID-19 who might have been in their last year of life in the absence of the pandemic using simple modelling with explicit assumptions. RESULTS: During the first 10 weeks of the pandemic, there were 101,614 baseline deaths, 41,105 COVID-19 deaths and 14,520 additional deaths. Deaths in care homes increased by 220%, while home and hospital deaths increased by 77% and 90%, respectively. Hospice deaths fell by 20%. Additional deaths were among older people (86% aged a?? 75 years), and most occurred in care homes (56%) and at home (43%). We estimate that 22% (13%-31%) of COVID-19 deaths occurred among people who might have been in their last year of life in the absence of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in palliative care needs.

METHODS: A 6MWT was performed in 26 discharge-ready COVID-19 patients without chronic pulmonary disease or cardiac failure. Heart rate, oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate, and subjective dyspnea measured on the Borg CR-10 scale were measured before and immediately after the 6MWT, with continuous monitoring of SpO2 and heart rate during the 6MWT. The 6MWT was terminated if SpO2 dropped below 90%. A historical cohort of 204 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was used for comparison. RESULTS: 13 (50%) of the COVID-19 patients developed exercise-induced hypoxia (SpO2 < 90%) during the 6MWT, of which one third had pulmonary embolism. COVID-19 patients experienced less hypoxia-related dyspnea during the 6MWT compared with patients with IPF.

We propose a very simple hybrid statistical framework for analyzing the case series of patients treated with such new protocols, that enables a comparison with our prior knowledge of expected outcomes, in the absence of treatment. The goal of the proposed methodology is not to provide a precise measurement of treatment efficacy, but to establish the existence of treatment efficacy, in order to facilitate the binary decision of whether the treatment protocol should be adopted on an emergency basis. The methodology consists of a frequentist component that compares a treatment group against the probability of an adverse outcome in the absence of treatment, and calculates an efficacy threshold that has to be exceeded by this probability, in order to control the corresponding $p$-value, and reject the null hypothesis. The efficacy threshold is further adjusted with a Bayesian technique, in order to also control the false positive rate. A selection bias threshold is then calculated from the efficacy threshold to control for random selection bias. Exceeding the efficacy threshold establishes efficacy by the preponderance of evidence, and exceeding the more demanding selection bias threshold establishes efficacy by the clear and convincing evidentiary standard. The combined techniques are applied to case series of high-risk COVID-19 outpatients, that were treated using the early Zelenko protocol and the more enhanced McCullough protocol. The resulting efficacy thresholds are then compared against our prior knowledge of mortality and hospitalization rates of untreated high-risk COVID-19 patients, as reported in the research literature.","output":"Frequentist and Bayesian analysis methods for case series data and application to early outpatient COVID-19 treatment case series of high risk patients (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A causative agent, provisionally designated as CARS, was isolated from the enlarged submaxillary gland of rat which was characterized as a sialoadenitis, using mouse-derived Balb/c3T3 clone A31 (3T3) cell culture.

Selection for cattle with reduced susceptibility to respiratory disease would provide a permanent tool for reducing the prevalence of BRDC. The objective of this study was to identify BRDC susceptibility loci in pre-weaned Holstein calves as a prerequisite to using genetic improvement as a tool for decreasing the prevalence of BRDC. High density SNP genotyping with the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip was conducted on 1257 male and 757 female Holstein calves from California (CA), and 767 calves identified as female from New Mexico (NM). Of these, 1382 were classified as BRDC cases, and 1396 were classified as controls, with all phenotypes assigned using the McGuirk health scoring system. During the acquisition of blood for DNA isolation, two deep pharyngeal and one mid-nasal diagnostic swab were obtained from each calf for the identification of bacterial and viral pathogens. Genome-wide association analyses were conducted using four analytical approaches (EIGENSTRAT, EMMAX-GRM, GBLUP and FvR). The most strongly associated SNPs from each individual analysis were ranked and evaluated for concordance. The heritability of susceptibility to BRDC in pre-weaned Holstein calves was estimated. RESULTS: The four statistical approaches produced highly concordant results for 373 top ranked SNPs that defined 126 chromosomal regions for the CA population. Similarly, in NM, 370 SNPs defined 138 genomic regions that were identified by all four approaches. When the two populations were combined (i.e., CA + NM) and analyzed, 324 SNPs defined 116 genomic regions that were associated with BRDC across all analytical methods. Heritability estimates for BRDC were 21% for both CA and NM as individual populations, but declined to 13% when the populations were combined. CONCLUSIONS: Four analytical approaches utilizing both single and multi-marker association methods revealed common genomic regions associated with BRDC susceptibility that can be further characterized and used for genomic selection. Moderate heritability estimates were observed for BRDC susceptibility in pre-weaned Holstein calves, thereby supporting the application of genomic selection to reduce the prevalence of BRDC in U.S. Holsteins.

Near-infrared spectroscopy commonly measures tissue oxygen saturation, but does not reflect the time-dependent variability of microvascular hemoglobin content (MHC) that attempts to match oxygen supply with demand. The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of MHC monitoring in critically ill patients using high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy to assess perfusion in the peripheral microcirculation. Methods: Prospective observational cohort of 36 patients admitted within 48 h at a tertiary intensive care unit. Perfusion was measured on the quadriceps, biceps, and/or deltoid, using the temporal change in optical density at the isosbestic wavelength of hemoglobin (798 nm). Continuous wavelet transform was applied to the hemoglobin signal to delineate frequency ranges corresponding to physiological oscillations in the cardiovascular system. Results: 31/36 patients had adequate signal quality for analysis, most commonly affected by motion artifacts. MHC signal demonstrates inter-subject heterogeneity in the cohort, indicated by different patterns of variability and frequency composition. Signal characteristics were concordant between muscle groups in the same patient, and correlated with systemic hemoglobin levels and oxygen saturation. Signal power was lower for patients receiving vasopressors, but not correlated with mean arterial pressure. Mechanical ventilation directly impacts MHC in peripheral tissue. Conclusion: MHC can be measured continuously in the ICU with high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy, and reflects the dynamic variability of hemoglobin distribution in the microcirculation.

To assist in clinician decision-making, several clinical laboratories have developed and validated measurement procedures in-house based on HPLC or HPLC-MS/MS to measure the mass concentration of hydroxychloroquine in different biological fluids. In these cases, laboratories produce their calibration materials but rarely estimate the measurement uncertainty of their assigned values. Thus, we aimed to show how this uncertainty can be calculated, using the preparation of hydroxychloroquine calibrators in blood-hemolysate-based matrix as an example. METHODS: A bottom-up approach was used to estimate the uncertainty related to the values assigned to end-user calibration materials prepared in-house. First, a specification of the measurand and a measurement equation were proposed. Then, different sources of uncertainty related to the preparation of hydroxychloroquine calibration materials were identified and quantified. Afterwards, the combined uncertainty was calculated using the law for the propagation of uncertainty resulting in the final expanded uncertainty. RESULTS: In this study, the most significant source of uncertainty was that associated with the hydroxychloroquines reference material mass obtained via balance, while the smallest contribution was from the uncertainty associated with the hydroxychloroquine reference material purity. CONCLUSIONS: A simple procedure to estimate the measurement uncertainty of values assigned to calibration materials is presented here, which would be easy to implement in clinical laboratories. Also, it could be put into practice for other pharmacological quantities measured by in-house HPLC or HPLC-MS/MS procedures commonly used in clinical laboratories.","output":"Estimation of the uncertainty of values assigned to calibration materials prepared in-house: An example for hydroxychloroquine calibrators in blood-hemolysate-based matrix"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic due to the outbreak of COVID-19 ravages the whole world for more than two years in which all the countries are suffering a lot since December 2019. In order to control this ongoing waves of epidemiological infections, attempts have been made to understand the dynamics of this pandemic in deterministic approach with the help of several mathematical models. In this article characteristics of a multi-wave SIR model have been studied which successfully explains the features of this pandemic waves in India. Stability of this model has been studied by identifying the equilibrium points as well as by finding the eigen values of the corresponding Jacobian matrices. Complex eigen values are found which ultimately give rise to the oscillatory solutions for the three categories of populations, say, susceptible, infected and removed. In this model, a finite probability of the recovered people for becoming susceptible again is introduced which eventually lead to the oscillatory solution in other words. The set of differential equations has been solved numerically in order to obtain the variation for numbers of susceptible, infected and removed people with time. In this phenomenological study, finally an additional modification is made in order to explain the aperiodic oscillation which is found necessary to capture the feature of epidemiological waves particularly in India.","output":"Study of COVID-19 epidemiological evolution in India with a multi-wave SIR model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We attempted to assess the role of enteroviruses in the etiology of myocarditis (MC), pericarditis (PC) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) among 15 in-patients at a public hospital in Belm, Brazil, from November 1992 to December 1993.

They can rarely form in the pelvis or abdomen, however, and may cause symptoms secondary to mass effect. This case highlights management of an anterectal epidermal inclusion cyst connected to the perineal cyst, mimicking a dumbbell-shaped lesion, found in a male. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a unique case of a 21-year-old Caucasian male with a palpable perineal mass, lower extremity hypoesthesia, and constipation who was found to have a complex-shaped cyst on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. This was ultimately managed with a two-stage perineal and transabdominal resection. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: This case highlights that perineal epidermal inclusion cysts may have pelvic extension, especially in patients with additional new-onset neurologic, gastrointestinal, or urologic symptoms. These symptoms should completely resolve after resection. Additionally, resection is recommended to prevent complications including malignant degeneration and fistulization. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of an anterectal, epidermal inclusion cyst connected to a perineal cyst found in a male. Perineal and pelvic cysts may be synchronous and may be connected through the pudendal canal. These masses can be safely removed via a combined perineal and transabdominal resection. The connecting portion of lesions that have both pelvic and perineal components should be meticulously identified and dissected because even a thin, patent segment - if left unresected - may result in lesion recurrence.","output":"Surgical management of large, connected perineal and pelvic epidermal inclusion cysts mimicking a dumbbell-shaped lesion in an adult male"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: The COVID-19 disease, which is caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has affected the world by increasing the mortality rate in 2020. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 patients. Several clinical trials have been proposed to overcome this disease and many are still under investigation. In this review, we will be focusing on the potency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived secretome for treating COVID-19 patients. Fever, cough, headache, dizziness, and fatigue are the common clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients. In mild and severe cases, cytokines are released hyper-actively which causes a cytokine storm leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In order to maintain the lung microenvironment in COVID-19 patients, MSCs are used as cell-based therapy approaches as they can act as cell managers which accelerate the immune system to prevent the cytokine storm and promote endogenous repair. Besides, MSCs have shown minimal expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2, and hence, MSCs are free from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous clinical studies have started worldwide and demonstrated that MSCs have great potential for ARDS treatment in COVID-19 patients. Preliminary data have shown that MSCs and MSC-derived secretome appear to be promising in the treatment of COVID-19. Lay Summary: The COVID-19 disease is an infection disease which affects the world in 2020. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 patients. However, several clinical trials have been proposed to overcome this disease and one of them is using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived secretome for treating COVID-19 patients. During the infection, cytokines are released hyper-actively which causes a cytokine storm. MSCs play an important role in maintaining the lung microenvironment in COVID-19 patients. They can act as cell managers which accelerate the immune system to prevent the cytokine storm and promote the endogenous repair.

Cytokines, and especially IL-6, were found to be elevated in depressed patients with normal renal function. The objective of this pilot study was to examine the relationship between depression and cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10) in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). METHODS We studied 44 stable patients with ESKD for 71 +/- 66 months (32 males; 64 +/- 13 years; 27 on hemodialysis and 17 on peritoneal dialysis). The control group included 20 healthy age- and gender-matched individuals (12 males; 60 +/- 12 years). Depression was assessed by the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZS). Nephelometry for high-sensitivity CRP and ELISA kits for IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha were used. RESULTS Compared to controls, patients with ESKD had higher ZS scores (56.8 +/- 16.8 vs. 44 +/- 12.7, p < 0.01), WBC (7,987 +/- 2,347 vs. 6,413 +/- 870/mm(3), p < 0.01), ESR (36.3 +/- 15.8 vs. 9.4 +/- 3.3 mm, p < 0.001), TNF-alpha (52 +/- 18.4 vs. 10.7 +/- 2.8 pg/ml, p < 0.001) and IL-6 (6.3 +/- 4 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.4 pg/ml, p < 0.001). No differences in high-sensitivity CRP and IL-10 were noted between the ESKD and control groups. Serum IL-6 levels were the only parameter positively correlated with the values of the ZS score in ESKD patients (r = 0.34, p < 0.02).

In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to explore the role of the mutations in the interaction of the virus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with the host receptor ACE2. We find that the hydrogen bond networks are rearranged in the variants and also that new hydrogen bonds are established between the RBD and ACE2 as a result of mutations. We investigated three variants: the wild-type (WT), B.1.1.7, and B.1.351. We find that the B.1.351 variant (also known as 501Y.V2) shows larger flexibility in the RBD loop segment involving residue K484, yet the RBDCACE2 complex shows higher stability. Mutations that allow a more flexible interface that can result in a more stable complex may be a factor contributing to the increased infectivity of the mutated variants.","output":"Structural and Dynamical Differences in the Spike Protein RBD in the SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on previous results in digital topology, this paper focuses on algorithms related to topological invariants of objects in 2D and 3D Digital Spaces.

By using a computational methodology, we aimed to explain the molecular paths of COVID-19 associated neuropsychiatric symptoms, based on the mimicry of the human protein interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Methods: Available 11 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins structures have been extracted from Protein Data Bank. HMI-PRED (Host-Microbe Interaction PREDiction), a recently developed web server for structural PREDiction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between host and any microbial species, was used to find the interface mimicry through which the microbial proteins hijack host binding surfaces. Classification of the found interactions was conducted using the PANTHER Classification System. Results: Predicted Human-SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions have been extensively compared with the literature. Based on the analysis of the molecular functions, cellular localizations and pathways related to human proteins, SARS-CoV-2 proteins are found to possibly interact with human proteins linked to synaptic vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, axonal transport, neurotransmission, growth factors, mitochondrial and blood-brain barrier elements, in addition to its peripheral interactions with proteins linked to thrombosis, inflammation and metabolic control. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions may lead to the development of delirium, psychosis, seizures, encephalitis, stroke, sensory impairments, peripheral nerve diseases, and autoimmune disorders. Our findings are also supported by the previous in vivo and in vitro studies from other viruses.

Information on participants' socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of clinical features of COVID-19, risk assessment and infection control measures for preventing disease transmission, and attitude towards treating patients with COVID-19 were collected. Results A total of 132 ophthalmologists (mean age 40.5 years) responded, 23 (17.6%) had received training on infection control in ophthalmology. Most ophthalmologists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways to identify patients at risk of having the disease, correctly reported modes of transmission and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in the ophthalmic setup. Social media was the commonest source of information on COVID-19 (75%), and 38.2% were not provided with instructions on infection control plan to reduce transmission of COVID-19.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of malnutrition and its phenotypic characteristics among lung transplantation (LTx) candidates comparing GLIM to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) criteria. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of all adult patients assessed for LTx in a one-year period. Phenotypic criteria included body mass index (BMI), unintentional loss of weight (LOW) over a 12-month period and fat-free mass index (FFMI) using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Systemic inflammation associated with severe end-stage lung disease met GLIM's etiological criterion. Diagnosis of malnutrition, and its severity, were classified according to each of GLIM and ICD-10. RESULTS: Of 130 patients, 112 (86%) had all data to classify malnutrition. Malnutrition prevalence according to GLIM was 59%, which was markedly greater than using ICD-10 criteria (26%). Half of the LTx patients were moderately malnourished using GLIM, compared to 19% using ICD-10. A similar proportion were severely malnourished using GLIM (9%) and ICD-10 (7%). Fat-free mass (FFM) depletion (47% of all patients) was a major contributor to GLIM-malnutrition. Over 60% of LTx patients with GLIM-malnutrition were not detected as malnourished using ICD-10 criteria. CONCLUSION: Malnutrition diagnosis using GLIM was higher than using ICD-10 in LTx patients, primarily attributable to the incorporation of quantitative evaluation of FFM depletion.

Then, after separating the bit-plane, the compressed data are executed by data reorganization and data encryption respectively on the high-plane and the low-plane. Finally, two authentication bits are extracted by 8-bit pixel of two planes to be inserted into the pixel itself, and then the 10-bit pixel is converted into an 8-bit POB value to produce two shares of ShareH and ShareL, respectively. In the lossless recovery stage, data of placing repeatedly can restore the original image. At the same time, three attacks are carried in the two shares, which contain content cropping, content exchange, and text addition.

The recent discovery that eating patterns regulate circadian rhythmicity in metabolic organs has raised the hypothesis that maintaining a consistent daily cycle of eating and fasting can support circadian rhythms and reduce disease risks. Preclinical animal studies and preliminary clinical trials have shown promising effects of time-restricted eating (TRE) to reduce disease risk without compromising physical performance. However, there is a lack of research on TRE in shift workers including firefighters. This study aims to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of 10-hour TRE on health parameters that contribute to cardiometabolic disease risks among career firefighters who work on a 24-hour shift schedule. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The Healthy Heroes Study is a randomised controlled parallel open-label clinical trial with 150 firefighters over 1 year. Firefighters are randomised with a 1:1 ratio to either the control or intervention group. The control group receives Mediterranean diet nutritional counselling (standard of care, SOC). The intervention group receives the same SOC and a self-selected 10-hour TRE window. After the 2-week baseline, participants enter a 3-month monitored intervention, followed by a 9-month self-guided period with follow-up assessments. The impact of TRE on blood glucose, body weight, body composition, biomarkers (neuroendocrine, inflammatory and metabolic), sleep and mood is evaluated. These assessments occur at baseline, at the end of intervention and at 6, 9 and 12-month follow-ups. Temporal calorie intake is monitored with the smartphone application myCircadianClock throughout the study. Continuous glucose monitors, wrist-worn actigraphy device and questionnaires are used to monitor glucose levels, activity, sleep and light exposure. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of California San Diego and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed manuscripts, reports and presentations.

We examined the predominance of different ethical issues in news articles and grey literature, and triangulated this using stakeholder interview data. Findings illustrate how news articles exceptionalised ethical debate around the app compared to the way they portrayed ethical issues relating to manual contact tracing. They also narrowed the debate around specific privacy concerns. This was reflected in the grey literature, and interviewees perceived this to have emerged from a privacy lobby.

The virus is rapidly evolving, characterized by the emergence of several major variants. Stable prefusion spike protein (Pre) is the immunogen in current vaccines but is limited in protecting against different variants. Here, the immune responses induced by the relatively conserved stem subunit (S2) of spike protein versus Pre are investigated. Pre generates the most robust neutralization responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants in vesicular stomatitis virus pseudovirus-based assessment but elicits less antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity than S2. By contrast, S2 induces the most balanced immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies with potent and broad ADCC activity although produces weaker neutralization. The immunogenicity of S2 and Pre improves by incorporating the two proteins into double-layered protein nanoparticles. The resulting protein nanoparticles Pre/S2 elicit higher neutralizing antibodies than Pre alone, and stronger ADCC than S2 alone. Moreover, nanoparticles produce more potent and balanced serum IgG antibodies than the corresponding soluble protein mixture, and the immune responses are sustained for at least four months after the immunization. Thus, the double-layered protein nanoparticles have the potential to be developed into broader SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with excellent safety profiles.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Stem Protein Nanoparticles Elicited Broad ADCC and Robust Neutralization against Variants in Mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several coronaviruses (CoVs) have been associated with serious health hazards in recent decades, resulting in the deaths of thousands around the globe.

This systematic review aims to assess the association of mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW) and platelet-large cell ratio (P-LCR) with disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. MethodsEnglish and Chinese databases were searched electronically to identify studies reporting data on MPV, PDW or P-LCR in COVID-19 patients. Included articles underwent a quality rating. A meta-analysis was performed using the standard mean difference and interpreted as the common language effect size (CLES). ResultsTwenty-two studies (11,906 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Of these, 14 were rated poor and eight were fair. The MPV and P-LCR was significantly higher at hospital admission in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. The MPV, PDW and P-LCR were significantly higher at hospital admission in non-survivors compared to survivors. There was a marked increase in the probability of a severe COVID-19 patient presenting with higher P-LCR at hospital admission than a non-severe patient (CLES: 68.7% [95% CI: 59.8%, 76.5%]), when compared with MPV and PDW ((CLES: 59.2% [95% CI: 53.1%, 65.1%]) and (CLES: 55.9% [95% CI: 50.6%, 62.2%]), respectively). ConclusionSevere COVID-19 disease is associated with the increased production of larger, younger platelets.

Therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Besides, it investigates the likelihood of vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from pregnant women to their neonates. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted in three medical centers during the period from March to November 2020. Data were collected from the available medical records in the respective hospitals using a standardized questionnaire on maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes. All pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection across the three hospitals and their neonates were eligible to participate in this study. Descriptive statistics were presented as a median and interquartile range (IQR) or frequencies and percentages as appropriate using SPSS 24.0 software. RESULTS: This study has identified a total of 288 pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection over the study period of a median age of 30 years and median GA at diagnosis 38 weeks (IQR: 39 -33) as well as 27% of them were obese (n=78). The majority of pregnant women were symptomatic with cough (n=92, 31.9%) being the most frequent COVID-19 symptom followed by fever and dyspnea (n=36, 12.5%). Two-hundred and four pregnant delivered (70.84%) and caesarean sections were prevalent among 35.8% of them. The most common adverse pregnancy outcome was premature (n=31, 15.5%), followed by fetal distress (n=13, 6.5%), preeclampsia (n=4, 2.0%), and one pregnant woman died. The laboratory results exhibit that temperature higher than 38 (n=27), leukopenia (n=19), neutropenia (n=54), ALT (n=12), AST (n=31), and thrombocytopenia (n=35) were less frequent among pregnant women while lymphopenia (n=126), hemoglobin levels lower than 13.0 (n=218), deceased albumin levels (n=195) were most frequent among them. However, a small proportion of pregnant women were admitted to the ICU (3.8%). The most frequent maternal treatments were antibiotics (n=81), antiviral (n=49), and corticosteroid (n=24). Of 204 neonates, four had died and all the remaining neonates were alive. The median gestational age at delivery was 39 weeks (IQR: 35-40). Most neonates had normal laboratory results. However, 14 had lymphopenia (7.0%), 22 had neutropenia (11.0%), and 11 had thrombocytopenia (5.5%). Four infants had low hemoglobin levels of less than 13.0 (2.0%) and 81 had hyperbilirubinemia (e.g., total bilirubin of higher than 23; 40.5%). Approximately less than one-half of neonates required admission to the NICU (n=86, 43%), 7% of them required respiratory support of mechanical ventilation, and none of them get infected with COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSION: This multicenter study suggests that the majority of pregnant women had mild or moderate disease symptoms. Nevertheless, this study did not find any evidence of possible vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from mothers to their babies.

Soon after, increasing numbers of cases were detected in other parts of China, eventually leading to a disease outbreak in China. As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus, such as its pathogenesis, spread, prevention, and containment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect media reports on COVID-19 and investigate the patterns of media-directed health communications as well as the role of the media in this ongoing COVID-19 crisis in China. METHODS: We adopted the WiseSearch database to extract related news articles about the coronavirus from major press media between January 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. We then sorted and analyzed the data using Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number with evidence of the coherence number. We operated latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling with a suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We then divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling. RESULTS: After removing duplications and irrelevant reports, our search identified 7791 relevant news reports. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as the number of topics and generated the topics themes and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine main primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three most popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, and global or local social and economic influences, accounting for 32.57% (n=2538), 16.08% (n=1258), and 11.79% (n=919) of the collected reports, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Topic modeling of news articles can produce useful information about the significance of mass media for early health communication. Comparing the number of articles for each day and the outbreak development, we noted that mass media news reports in China lagged behind the development of COVID-19. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society rather than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a worldwide issue, and society has become concerned about donations and support as well as mental health among others.

Accumulating epidemiological and genetic evidence indicates that circadian rhythms' disruption may be linked to cancer. The integration of circadian biology into cancer research may offer new options for increasing cancer treatment effectiveness and would encompass the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of this disease. RECENT FINDINGS In recent years, there has been a significant development and use of multi-modal sensors to monitor physical activity, sleep, and circadian rhythms, allowing, for the very first time, scaling accurate sleep monitoring to epidemiological research linking sleep patterns to disease, and wellness applications providing new potential applications. This review highlights the role of circadian clock in tumorigenesis, cancer hallmarks and introduces the state-of-the-art in sleep-monitoring technologies, discussing the eventual application of insights in clinical settings and cancer research.","output":"Chronodisruption and Ambulatory Circadian Monitoring in Cancer Patients: Beyond the Body Clock."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 vaccines give rise to positive externalities on population health, society and the economy in addition to protecting the health of vaccinated individuals. Hence, the social value of such a vaccine exceeds its market value. This paper estimates the willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in four countries, namely the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), Spain and Italy during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic when no specific vaccine had been approved nor subsidised. WTP estimates are elicited using a payment card method to avoid 'yea saying' biases, and we study the effect of protest responses, sample selection bias, as well as the influence of trust in government and risk exposure when estimating the WTP. Our estimates suggest evidence of an average value of a hypothetical vaccine of 100-200 US dollars once adjusted by purchasing power parity (PPP).

We propose a definition of essential oral health care that includes urgent and basic oral health care to initiate a broader debate and stakeholder alignment. We argue that oral health care must be part of essential health care provided by any health system. Essential oral health care covers the most prevalent oral health problems through an agreed-on set of safe, quality, and cost-effective interventions at the individual and community level to promote and protect oral health, as well as prevent and treat common oral diseases, including appropriate rehabilitative services, thereby maintaining health, productivity, and quality of life. By default, essential oral health care does not include the full spectrum of possible interventions that contemporary dentistry can provide. On the basis of this definition, we conceptualize a layered model of essential oral health care that integrates urgent and basic oral health care, as well as advanced/specialist oral health care. Finally, we present 3 key reflections on the essentiality of oral health care. First, oral health care must be an integral component of a health care system's essential services, and by implication, oral health care personnel are part of the essential health care workforce. Second, not all dental care is essential oral health care, and not all essential care is also urgent, particularly under the specific risk conditions of the pandemic. Third, there is a need for criteria, evidence, and consensus-building processes to define which dental interventions are to be included in which category of essential oral health care. All stakeholders, including the research, academic, and clinical communities, as well as professional organizations and civil society, need to tackle this aspect in a concerted effort. Such consensus will be crucial for dentistry in view of the Sustainable Development Goal's push for universal health coverage, which must cover essential oral health care.","output":"Pandemic Considerations on Essential Oral Health Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated perceptions and behavioral patterns related to urban green space (UGS) in Italian cities, during the period of national lockdown imposed due to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the spring of 2020 A survey was used to examine the responses of population groups in different municipal areas, comparing those in government-defined red zones, mostly in the northern regions of the country, with non-red zones in the rest of the country, where the rate of infection was much lower A total of 2100 respondents participated in the survey The majority of respondents declared themselves to be habitual users of UGS, especially of parks or green areas outside the town C mainly visiting for relaxation and physical exercise, but also for observing nature In the northern regions people more commonly reported the adoption of sustainable practices, in terms of the utilization of tools for \\"green mobility\\" During the lockdown, habits changed significantly: only one third of respondents reported visiting UGS, with frequent visits made mainly for the purpose of walking the dog Other motivations included the need for relaxing, mostly in the red zones, and for physical exercise in non-red zones The reduction in travel to urban parks was accompanied by increased visitation of gardens and other green spaces in close proximity, as social distancing and other regulations imposed restrictions on movement In all regions, respondents who could not physically access UGS expressed a feeling of deprivation which was exacerbated by living in towns located in red zones, being a usual visitor of UGS and having no green view from the window The extent to which these visitors missed UGS depended on the frequency of visitation before the pandemic and the UGS distance, as well as the type of previous activity In fact, those activities that were most common before the pandemic were missed the most, reinforcing the importance of green areas for social gathering, sports, and observing nature C but simply spending time outdoors was also mentioned, even by those who visited UGS during the lockdown, as the time outdoors was not enough or not fully enjoyed The feeling of missing UGS was only partially alleviated by the green view from the window C only a more open view to a natural landscape or adaptation to a view with little greenery reduced such feeling","output":"Usage of urban green space and related feelings of deprivation during the COVID-19 lockdown: Lessons learned from an Italian case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Catastrophic natural disasters and epidemics claim thousands of lives and have severe and lasting consequences, accompanied by human suffering. The Ebola epidemic of 2014C2016 and the current COVID-19 pandemic have revealed some of the practical and ethical complexities relating to the management of dead bodies. While frontline staff are tasked with saving lives, managing the bodies of those who die remains an under-resourced and overlooked issue, with numerous ethical and practical problems globally. METHODS: This scoping review of literature examines the management of dead bodies during epidemics and natural disasters. 82 articles were reviewed, of which only a small number were empirical studies focusing on ethical or sociocultural issues that emerge in the management of dead bodies. RESULTS: We have identified a wide range of ethical and sociocultural challenges, such as ensuring dignity for the deceased while protecting the living, honouring the cultural and religious rituals surrounding death, alleviating the suffering that accompanies grieving for the survivors and mitigating inequalities of resource allocation. It was revealed that several ethical and sociocultural issues arise at all stages of body management: notification, retrieving, identification, storage and burial of dead bodies. CONCLUSION: While practical issues with managing dead bodies have been discussed in the global health literature and the ethical and sociocultural facets of handling the dead have been recognised, they are nonetheless not given adequate attention. Further research is needed to ensure care for the dead in epidemics and that natural disasters are informed by ethical best practice.","output":"Ethical and sociocultural challenges in managing dead bodies during epidemics and natural disasters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anticoagulant drugs have been used to prevent and treat thrombosis. However, they are associated with risk of hemorrhage. Therefore, prior to their clinical use, it is important to assess the risk of bleeding and thrombosis. In case of older anticoagulant drugs like heparin and warfarin, dose adjustment is required owing to narrow therapeutic ranges. The established monitoring methods for heparin and warfarin are activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)/anti-Xa assay and prothrombin time - international normalized ratio (PT-INR), respectively. Since 2008, new generation anticoagulant drugs, called direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), have been widely prescribed to prevent and treat several thromboembolic diseases. Although the use of DOACs without routine monitoring and frequent dose adjustment has been shown to be safe and effective, there may be clinical circumstances in specific patients when measurement of the anticoagulant effects of DOACs is required. Recently, anticoagulation therapy has received attention when treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of anticoagulant drugs-heparin, warfarin, and DOACs and describe the methods used for the measurement of their effects.

The reasons for this are likely to be multifactorial including improved survival of preterm infants. AIM: To assess the severity of viral bronchiolitis in preterm compared to term infants admitted at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt, based on the outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted throughout a 3-year period from September 2011 to October 2014. It included 153 infants, 74 healthy preterm, and 79 healthy term infants admitted with clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt. Bronchiolitis severity score (BSS) was recorded, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from each patient at the time of presentation. Viruses were identified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The clinical course and patients outcome were recorded. RESULTS: This study recorded a significantly more severe BSS for preterm compared to term infants. The preterm group had an increased mean length of hospital stay and oxygen therapy and was more likely to need intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation (MV) compared to the term group. The mean ( SD) BSS for infections with h-MPV, RSV, and para-influenza 3 was more significantly severe in preterm compared to term infants. Bacterial co-infection was significantly correlated with severity scoring in both groups. CONCLUSION: Prematurity significantly affects the severity of bronchiolitis, and this underscores the importance of early categorization as a high-risk group on their first visit.

OBJECTIVE: We herein report a case of subacute onset, progressive cerebellar ataxia in a 37-year-old female, who on evaluation was found to have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and experienced good clinical response to treatment. DISCUSSION: As compared to solid tumours, chances of association of PNS with Lymphomas is quite low and there are only few case reports in the literature showing association of PCD with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. As PCD is one of the classical PNS, it is very important to identify subtle cerebellar manifestations in an otherwise apparently normal individual, as early diagnosis and aggressive treatment can immensely improve the mortality and morbidity associated with this syndrome. CONCLUSION: This case signifies the importance of suspecting PNS as an important differential diagnosis in a young patient presenting with subacute onset progressive cerebellar ataxia and evaluating her extensively for malignancy in spite of no paraneoplastic antibody been detected as early diagnosis and treatment can lead to gratifying response.

The outcome was the occurrence of clinical failure, defined as hospitalization (for outpatients), transfer to the intensive-care unit (inpatients), and death (all). RESULTS: 254 patients were infected with clade 20A (20AS), 85 with Marseille-1 (M1V), 190 with Marseille-4 (M4V) and 211 with N501Y (N501YV) variants. 20AS presented a bell-shaped epidemiological curve and nearly disappeared around May 2020. M1V reached a very weak peak, then disappeared after a month-and-a-half. M4V appeared in July presented an atypical wave form during seven months. N501YV has only recently appeared. As compared to 20AS, patients infected with M1V were less likely to report dyspnoea (aOR=0.50, p=0.04), rhinitis (aOR=0.57, p=0.04) and to be hospitalised (aOR=0.22, p=0.002). Patients infected with M4V were more likely to report fever than those with 20AS and M1V (aOR=2.49, p<0.0001 and aOR=2.30, p=0.007, respectively) and to be hospitalised than those with M1V (aOR=4.81, p=0.003).

Rare manifestations of AdV infections include hemorrhagic cystitis, hepatitis, hemorrhagic colitis, pancreatitis, nephritis, or meningoencephalitis. AdV infections are more common in young children, due to lack of humoral immunity. Epidemics of AdV infection may occur in healthy children or adults in closed or crowded settings (particularly military recruits). The disease is more severe and dissemination is more likely in patients with impaired immunity (e.g., organ transplant recipients, human immunodeficiency virus infection). Fatality rates for untreated severe AdV pneumonia or disseminated disease may exceed 50%. More than 50 serotypes of AdV have been identified. Different serotypes display different tissue tropisms that correlate with clinical manifestations of infection. The predominant serotypes circulating at a given time differ among countries or regions, and change over time. Transmission of novel strains between countries or across continents and replacement of dominant viruses by new strains may occur. Treatment of AdV infections is controversial, as prospective, randomized therapeutic trials have not been conducted.

While large scale disasters may have an impact on substance use and addictions, the use of some substances is also likely to modify the risk of COVID-19 infection or course. Many countries have imposed lockdowns. Whether this quarantine or the end of lockdown measures will have an impact on substance use is discussed. The aim of this review is to gather knowledge for clinicians and to guide public health policies during/after lockdown. METHODS: PubMed was reviewed in August 6th (2020), to determine the current evidences and observations concerning the addictions and SARS-CoV2. We used all the names of the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2 previously 2019 nCoV), the name of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and common substances of abuse. For the physiopathological parts, searches were conducted using key words such as \\"infection\\" or \\"pneumonia\\". For the lockdown effects, key words such as \\"quarantine\\", \\"disaster\\" or \\"outbreak\\" were used. RESULTS: Overall, pathophysiological data showed an increased risk of infections for individuals with Substance Use Disorders (SUD) and a possible protective role of nicotine. During lockdown, there is a substantial risk of increasing SUDs. Individuals with opioid use disorder are particularly at risk of relapse or of involuntary withdrawal.

Here we describe our experience in H1N1-induced ARDS using both ventilation strategy and ECMO assistance. METHODS: Following Italian Ministry of Health instructions, an Emergency Service was established at the Careggi Teaching Hospital (Florence, Italy) for the novel pandemic influenza. From Sept 09 to Jan 10, all patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Emergency Department with ARDS due to H1N1 infection were studied. All ECMO treatments were veno-venous. H1N1 infection was confirmed by PCR assayed on pharyngeal swab, subglottic aspiration and bronchoalveolar lavage. Lung pathology was evaluated daily by lung ultrasound (LUS) examination. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients were studied: 7 underwent ECMO treatment, and 5 responded to protective mechanical ventilation. Two patients had co-infection by Legionella Pneumophila. One woman was pregnant. In our series, PCR from bronchoalveolar lavage had a 100% sensitivity compared to 75% from pharyngeal swab samples. The routine use of LUS limited the number of chest X-ray examinations and decreased transportation to radiology for CT-scan, increasing patient safety and avoiding the transitory disconnection from ventilator. No major complications occurred during ECMO treatments. In three cases, bleeding from vascular access sites due to heparin infusion required blood transfusions. Overall mortality rate was 8.3%. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, early ECMO assistance resulted safe and feasible, considering the life threatening condition, in H1N1-induced ARDS.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the revision of two National Institutes of Health funded community-based palliative-focused clinical trials serving underserved populations to accommodate remote subject enrollment and examine its impact. METHODS: Transitioning to remote processes required multiple protocol and procedural changes including: altering informed consent processes; reducing the number of surveys administered; adding internet access as an inclusion criterion. To understand technological challenges, a screening tool was developed for one study to identify potentially eligible subjects' technology abilities and accessibility. RESULTS: Subjects' limited access to the internet and internet-enabled devices and discomfort with technology led to changes in recruitment patterns. Lack of familiarity with technology increased the amount of time it took research team members and subjects to connect remotely. Patients with significant cognitive and/or sensory deficits were at higher risk of experiencing fatigue during remote study visits leading to streamlining of data collection. A researcher-developed technology screening tool found that potential subjects were not comfortable with videoconferencing through Zoom expressing a preference for phone visits. Reduced travel time made scheduling remote study visits more efficient. CONCLUSION: Future community- and home-based palliative care trials must consider the best way to utilize remote recruitment, enrollment, and data collection processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Researchers should consider technology accessibility and train staff to ensure the greatest possible opportunity to recruit underserved populations who have traditionally been underrepresented in research studies.","output":"Transitioning to Remote Recruitment and Intervention: A Tale of Two Palliative Care Research Studies Enrolling Underserved Populations During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the infection of SARS-CoV?2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) are becoming increasingly clear as the pandemic spreads.

We analyzed and compared the clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics between survivors and non-survivors and identify risk factors for mortality. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory variables, radiological features, treatment approach, and complications were retrospectively collected in two centers of Hubei province, China. Cox regression analysis was conducted to identify the risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: A total of 432 patients were enrolled, and the median patient age was 54 years. The overall mortality rate was 5.09% (22/432). As compared with the survivor group (n = 410), those in the non-survivor group (n = 22) were older, and they had a higher frequency of comorbidities and were more prone to suffer from dyspnea. Several abnormal laboratory variables indicated that acute cardiac injury, hepatic damage, and acute renal insufficiency were detected in the non-survivor group. Non-surviving patients also had a high computed tomography (CT) score and higher rate of consolidation. The most common complication causing death was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (18/22, 81.8%). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that hemoglobin (Hb) <90 g/L (hazard ratio, 10.776; 95% confidence interval, 3.075C37.766; p<0.0001), creatine kinase (CK-MB) >8 U/L (9.155; 2.424C34.584; p = 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >245 U/L (5.963; 2.029C17.529; p = 0.001), procalcitonin (PCT) >0.5 ng/ml (7.080; 1.671C29.992; p = 0.008), and CT score >10 (39.503; 12.430C125.539; p<0.0001) were independent risk factors for the mortality of COVID-19.

The French College of Obstetrics and Gynecology mandated a multidisciplinary panel of experts to perform a reassessment of the screening program in accordance with international good practice. In France, about 70% of pregnant women are not immune to T. gondii, and 0.2-0.25% become infected during pregnancy. The risk of maternal-fetal transmission of infection is on average 25-29% and depends greatly on the gestational age at seroconversion. In case of fetal transmission, the outcome is livebirth in 95% of cases, with latent congenital toxoplasmosis in 90% of cases and symptomatic forms in 10% of cases, of which 1/3 are severe and 2/3 moderate. Biological techniques have satisfactory performance regarding serologies for the diagnosis of maternal infections and PCR on amniotic fluid for the prenatal diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis. Primary prevention of toxoplasmosis is based on hygiene measures that are relatively simple, but poorly implemented. In case of maternal seroconversion, there is a strong case for prenatal prophylactic treatment as soon as possible (ideally within 3 weeks of seroconversion), spiramycin before 14 weeks of gestation (WG), and with a tendency to superiority of the pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine association over spiramycin beyond 14 W G, in order to reduce the risk of symptomatic congenital toxoplasmosis. In case of congenital toxoplasmosis, prompt initiation of treatment reduces the occurrence of cerebral signs and symptoms, as well as retinal lesions. Several medico-economic evaluations of the French toxoplasmosis screening program have been conducted including an individual cost-effectiveness approach with decision analysis which concluded on the profitability of prenatal screening as carried out in France (monthly surveillance of seronegative women, prenatal treatment in case of seroconversion, termination of pregnancy in severe forms). Though most international societies do not recommend systematic screening for mainly financial reasons, if congenital toxoplasmosis appears benign in France today, it is probably thanks to screening and the possibility of early treatment of fetuses and/or newborns.

The incidence of TE hospitalised increased during the COVID-19 pandemic from 1090 to 1590 per 100,000 (absolute risk change 45.9% [95% CI 45.1-46.6%], adjusted relative risk [ARR] 1.43 [95% CI 1.41-1.44]) driven particularly by pulmonary embolism; 1.49, 95% CI 1.46-1.52. TE were more frequent among those with COVID-19; 1.9% vs. 1.6%, absolute risk change 21.7%, 95% CI 21.0-22.4%, ARR 1.20, 95% CI 1.18-1.22. There was an increase in the overall mortality from TE during the pandemic (617, 6.7% proportional increase compared with the historical baseline), with more TE deaths occurring in the community compared with the historical rate (44% vs. 33%). INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in the incidence of hospitalised TE. There were more deaths from TE in the community highlighting a number of mechanisms including the hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 infection and potential impact of delays in seeking help. RESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Evidence before this study We searched PubMed on 16 November 2020 for articles that documented the incidence and mortality of thrombo-embolic events (TE) during the COVID-19 pandemic using the search terms \\"COVID-19\\" OR \\"Coronavirus*\\" OR \\"2019-nCOV\\" OR \\"SARS-CoV\\" AND (\\"Thromboembolism\\" OR \\"Venous Thromboembolism\\" OR \\"thromboembol*\\") with no language or time restrictions. The majority of data on TE in COVID-19 pertains to hospitalised patients from retrospective cohort studies. One study found that TE in hospitalised patients was associated with an increased mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratio 1.82; 95% CI 1.54-2.15). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies in 9249 hospitalised patients calculated an overall pooled incidence of TE of 17.8% (95% CI: 9.9-27.4%), rising to 22.9% (95% CI: 14.5-32.4%) in patients admitted to intensive care (ICU). The most contemporary data are from a cohort of 1114 patients (715 outpatient, 399 hospitalised, 170 admitted to ICU). With robust COVID-19-specific therapies and widespread thromboprophylaxis the prevalence of venous TE in ICU patients was reported as 7% (n = 12) when catheter-/device-related events were excluded, and among the outpatients there was no TE reported. No published studies have used nationwide data to investigate TE during the pandemic or the effect of the pandemic on outcomes of patients with TE but without Covid-19. Added value of this study This retrospective multi-sourced nationwide unlinked cohort study compares the overall incidence and mortality of TE prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found an increased incidence of TE despite only a small proportion having a diagnosis of COVID-19. This may highlight the lack of testing, particularly in the community during the initial phase of the pandemic, and the possibility of other factors contributing to TE risk, such as decreased daily activity mandated by home quarantine and alterations in medication concordance. Mortality from TE was higher in the community during the pandemic and this highlights that adverse societal effects of the pandemic, such as aversion to seeking medical assessment, may precipitate worse outcomes related to TE. Implications of all the available evidence Evidence suggests that COVID-19 produces a hypercoagulable state and thromboprophylaxis is recommended in hospitalised patients to prevent excess mortality from TE. Whether to anticoagulate non-hospitalised ambulatory patients with COVID-19 will be answered by ongoing trials. Clinicians should consider the risks posed by decreased daily activity and fear of medical contact, and provide appropriate advice to patients.","output":"Incidence and mortality due to thromboembolic events during the COVID-19 pandemic: Multi-sourced population-based health records cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: In the fight against COVID-19, vaccination is vital in achieving herd immunity. Many Asian countries are starting to vaccinate frontline workers; however, expedited vaccine development has led to hesitancy among the general population. We evaluated the willingness of healthcare workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: From 12 to 21 December 2020, we recruited 1720 healthcare workers from 6 countries: China, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and Bhutan. The self-administrated survey collected information on willingness to vaccinate, perception of COVID-19, vaccine concerns, COVID-19 risk profile, stigma, pro-socialness scale, and trust in health authorities. RESULTS: More than 95% of the healthcare workers surveyed were willing to vaccinate. These respondents were more likely to perceive the pandemic as severe, consider the vaccine safe, have less financial concerns, less stigmatization regarding the vaccine, higher pro-socialness mindset and trust in health authorities. A high perceived pandemic risk index, low vaccine harm index and high pro-socialness index were independent predictors in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of healthcare workers in Asia are willing to receive COVID-19 vaccination. Perceived COVID-19 susceptibility, low potential risk of vaccine harm and pro-socialness are the main drivers. These findings may help formulate vaccination strategies in other countries.","output":"An Asia-Pacific study on healthcare workers' perceptions of, and willingness to receive, the COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), developed to predict fibrosis in liver disease, was used to identify patients with COVID-19 who will require ventilator support as well as associated with 30-day mortality.

METHODS: We collected daily data of COVID-19 incidence, 8 ambient air pollutants (particulate matter of 2.5 m [PM(2.5)], particulate matter 10 m [PM(10)], sulfur dioxide [SO(2)], carbon monoxide [CO], nitrogen dioxide [NO(2)], and maximum 8-h moving average concentrations for ozone [O(3)-8h]) and 3 meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity, and wind) in Chinas 3 worst COVID-19Cstricken cities during the study period. The multivariate Poisson regression was performed to understand their correlation. RESULTS: Daily COVID-19 incidence was positively associated with PM(2.5) and humidity in all cities. Specifically, the relative risk (RR) of PM(2.5) for daily COVID-19 incidences were 1.036 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.032C1.039) in Wuhan, 1.059 (95% CI, 1.046C1.072) in Xiaogan, and 1.144 (95% CI, 1.12C1.169) in Huanggang. The RR of humidity for daily COVID-19 incidence was consistently lower than that of PM(2.5), and this difference ranged from 0.027 to 0.111. Moreover, PM(10) and temperature also exhibited a notable correlation with daily COVID-19 incidence, but in a negative pattern The RR of PM(10) for daily COVID-19 incidence ranged from 0.915 (95% CI, 0.896C0.934) to 0.961 (95% CI, 0.95C0.972, while that of temperature ranged from 0.738 (95% CI, 0.717C0.759) to 0.969 (95% CI, 0.966C0.973).

Objective: To develop a predictive model to classify heart failure (HF) patients according to their left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), by using available data from Electronic Health Records (EHR). Subjects and methods: 2854 subjects over 25 years old with a diagnosis of HF and LVEF, measured by echocardiography, were selected to develop an algorithm to predict patients with reduced EF using supervised analysis. The performance of the developed algorithm was tested in heart failure patients from Primary Care. To select the most influentual variables, the LASSO algorithm setting was used, and to tackle the issue of one class exceeding the other one by a large amount, we used the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Finally, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost models were constructed. Results: The full XGBoost model obtained the maximum accuracy, a high negative predictive value, and the highest positive predictive value. Gender, age, unstable angina, atrial fibrillation and acute myocardial infarct are the variables that most influence EF value. Applied in the EHR dataset, with a total of 25,594 patients with an ICD-code of HF and no regular follow-up in cardiology clinics, 6170 (21.1%) were identified as pertaining to the reduced EF group. Conclusion: The obtained algorithm was able to identify a number of HF patients with reduced ejection fraction, who could benefit from a protocol with a strong possibility of success.

All of the samples were analyzed using ELISA technique. AFB1 was below detection limit in all of the childrens food brands samples. Out of 42 IPF samples 9.5% were AFM1-positive in the range of 29.54C140.16 ng/L and exceeded the maximum tolerable limit (MTL) set by the European commission (25 ng/kg). The overall average contamination level was 5.72  0.014 ng/L. The EDI of AMF1 for male was in the range of 0.37C0.78 ng/kg/b.w./day and 0.40C0.87 ng/kg/b.w./day for females.

METHODS We included prospective and retrospective studies from RWS documenting effectiveness of ocriplasmin in patients with VMT with or without MH, and RCTs of ocriplasmin versus control. Key end-points were vitreomacular adhesion resolution (VMAR), nonsurgical MH closure, need for vitrectomy and safety. We conducted meta-regression on pooled results to evaluate effects of baseline covariates and study design on outcomes. RESULTS Thirty RWS (2402 patients) and 5 RCTs (737 patients) were included epiretinal membrane (ERM) and broad VMA were more prevalent in RCTs. Primary VMAR, vitrectomy and MH closure rates were comparable between RWS and RCTs. Rates of nsVMAR were significantly higher in RWS than RCTs (odds ratio 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-2.34). nsVMAR rates were inversely associated with ERM prevalence (odds ratio 0.20; 95% CI: 0.08-0.51).

Wing loading, that is, the ratio of body mass to total wing area, has been demonstrated to reflect flight maneuverability. High maneuverability is an important survival trait, allowing insects to escape natural enemies and to compete for mates. In some ecological field experiments, there is a need to calculate the wing area of insects without killing them. However, fast, nondestructive estimation of wing area for insects is not available based on past work. The Montgomery equation (ME), which assumes a proportional relationship between leaf area and the product of leaf length and width, is frequently used to calculate leaf area of plants, in crops with entire linear, lanceolate leaves. Recently, the ME was proved to apply to leaves with more complex shapes from plants that do not have any needle leaves. Given that the wings of insects are similar in shape to broad leaves, we tested the validity of the ME approach in calculating the wing area of insects using three species of cicadas common in eastern China. We compared the actual area of the cicadas' wings with the estimates provided by six potential models used for wing area calculation, and we found that the ME performed best, based on the trade-off between model structure and goodness of fit. At the species level, the estimates for the proportionality coefficients of ME for three cicada species were 0.686, 0.693, and 0.715, respectively. There was a significant difference in the proportionality coefficients between any two species.

Previous studies have shown that virus-infected fixed cells or viral suspensions were able to induce an early and strong IFN-alpha synthesis by naive lymphocytes. Two monoclonal antibodies directed against the viral membrane glycoprotein M (29,000; formerly E1) were found to markedly inhibit virus-induced IFN production, thus assigning to M protein a potential effector role in this phenomenon (B. Charley and H. Laude, J. Virol. 62:8-11, 1988). The present report describes the selection and characterization of a collection of 125 mutant viruses which escaped complement-mediated neutralization by two IFN induction-blocking anti-M protein monoclonal antibodies. Two of these mutants, designated H92 and dm49-4, were found to exhibit a markedly reduced interferogenic activity. IFN synthesis by lymphocytes incubated with purified suspensions of these mutants was 30- to 300-fold lower than that of the parental virus. The transcription of IFN-alpha genes following induction by each mutant was decreased proportionally, as evidenced by Northern (RNA) blot analysis. The sequence of the M gene of 20 complement-mediated neutralization-resistant mutants, including the 2 defective mutants, was determined by direct sequencing of genome RNA. Thirteen distinct amino acid changes were predicted, all located at positions 6 to 22 from the N terminus of the mature M protein and within the putative ectodomain of the molecule. Two substitutions, Thr-17 to Ile and Ser-19 to Pro, were assumed to generate the defective phenotypes of mutants dm49-4 and H92, respectively. The alteration of an Asn-Ser-Thr sequence in dm49-4 virus led to the synthesis of an M protein devoid of a glycan side chain, which suggests a possible involvement of this structure in IFN induction. Overall, these data supported the view that an interferogenic determinant resides in the N-terminal, exposed part of the molecule and provided further evidence for the direct role of M protein in the induction of IFN-alpha by transmissible gastroenteritis virus. The acronym VIP (viral interferogenic protein) is proposed as a designation for this particular class of proteins.","output":"Single amino acid changes in the viral glycoprotein M affect induction of alpha interferon by the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Illnesses with aerosol mode of transmission dominate in the structure of infectious diseases.

Six drugs including anti-HIV drug (raltegravir), antibacterial drugs (cefonicid, cefoperazone, minocycline), and antidiabetic drugs (canaglifozin, glyburide) showed high binding affinities ( -8.5 kcal/mol) and interesting binding conformations compared with the designed co-crystal ligand N3 (-7.7 kcal/mol). In which the antibiotic minocycline, an inhibitor of bacterial ribosomal rRNA, showed the highest binding affinity (-9.6 kcal/mol). Valuable hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were found between minocycline and M pro active site. Beside the hydrogen bond with Cys145, minocycline formed a Pi-Cation with His41, which strongly supported minocycline as a Michael Addition acceptor to bind with the catalytic site of M pro . The structure-affinity relationship was studied based on molecular docking of minocycline analogues. Literature review found that minocycline had both in vitro and in vivo broad-spectrum antiviral as well as anti-inflammatory activities, and the levels of a broad-spectrum of biological markers during minocycline administration were opposed to those of COVID-19 condition (both severe and non-severe). Minocycline deserves in vitro and in vivo evaluations as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor as well as a randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy for COVID-19.

Influenza viruses can have frequent antigenic variation and changes, which can result in rapid and widespread transmission resulting in annual epidemics and outbreaks in places of public gathering such as schools, kindergartens and nursing homes. According to WHO estimation, seasonal influenza epidemics have caused an annually 3 to 5 million severe cases and 290 000 to 650 000 deaths globally. Pregnant women, young children, the elderly, and persons with chronic illnesses are at high risk for severe illness and death associated with influenza virus infection. Especially, COVID-19 pandemic might co-circulate with other respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza in the coming winter-spring season. Seasonal influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza virus infection and complications from infection. Currently, China has licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) which includes split-virus influenza vaccine and subunit vaccine, quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) which is split, and trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3) which was newly licensed. Except for a few major cities, influenza vaccine is a category  vaccine, which means influenza vaccination is voluntary, and recipients must pay for it. In 2018 and 2019, the China CDC issued the \\"Technical Guidelines for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination in China\\" . In the past year, new research evidences home and abroad have been published, and new seasonal influenza vaccine has been licensed in China. To strengthen the technical guidance for prevention and control of influenza and operational research on influenza vaccination in China, the National Immunization Advisory Committee (NIAC) Influenza Vaccination Technical Working Group (TWG), updated the 2019-2020 technical guidelines and compiled the \\"Technical guidelines for seasonal influenza vaccination in China (2020-2021)\\" . The main updates in this version include the following: First, new research evidences especially studies of China, including disease burden, effectiveness, Vaccine-avoidable disease burden, vaccine safety monitoring, and cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit. Second, policies and measures for influenza prevention and control issued by National Health Commission (PRC) in the past year. Thirdly, new type seasonal influenza vaccine licensed and issued in 2020-2021 in China. Fourth, northern hemisphere influenza vaccination composition for the 2020-2021 season which included trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccine. Fifth, Influenza vaccination recommendations for 2020-2021 influenza season. The recommendations described in this report include the following: Points of Vaccination clinics (PoVs) should provide influenza vaccination to all persons aged 6 months and above who are willing to be vaccinated and do not have contraindications. No preferential recommendation is made for one influenza vaccine product over another for persons for whom more than one licensed, recommended, and appropriate product is available. Considering the situation of globally pandemic of COVID-19, to decrease the risk of influenza virus infection and minimize the impact on COVID-19 prevention and control, we recommend the following priority for seasonal influenza vaccination: healthcare workers, including clinical doctors and nurses, public health professionals, quarantine professionals; vulnerable groups living in nursing homes or welfare homes and staffs who take care those vulnerable groups; people work or stay in high population density places, such as teachers and students in kindergartens, primary and secondary school, prisoners and staffs of prisons; other high risk group of influenza, including adults 60 years of age, children aged 6-59 months, persons with specific chronic diseases, the family members and caregivers of infants <6 months of age, and pregnant women or women who plan to become pregnant during the influenza season. Children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine administered a minimum of 4 weeks apart during their first season of vaccination for optimal protection. People whoever get IIV or LAIV all apply to the principle. If they were vaccinated in 2019-2020 influenza season or a prior season, 1 dose is recommended. People more than 8 years old require 1 dose of influenza vaccine. It is recommended that people receive their influenza vaccination by the end of October. Influenza vaccination should be offered as soon as the vaccination is available. For the people unable to be vaccinated before the end of October, influenza vaccination will continue to be offered for the whole season. Influenza vaccine is also recommended for use in pregnant women during any trimester. These guidelines are intended for use by staff members of the CDCs at all levels who work on influenza control and prevention, PoVs staff members, healthcare workers from the departments of pediatrics, internal medicine, and infectious diseases, and staff members of maternity and child care institutions at all levels. These guidelines will be updated periodically as new evidence becomes available.","output":"[Technical guidelines for seasonal influenza vaccination in China (2020-2021)]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide. In Indonesia, the first case was reported in early March 2020, and the numbers of confirmed infections have been increasing until now. Efforts to contain the virus globally and in Indonesia are ongoing. This is the very first manuscript using a spatial-temporal model to describe the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Indonesia, as well as providing a patient profile for all confirmed COVID-19 cases. METHOD: Data was collected from the official website of the Indonesia National Task Force for the Acceleration of COVID-19, from the period of 02 March 2020-02 August 2020. The data from RT-PCR confirmed, SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was categorized according to demographics, symptoms and comorbidities based on case categorization (confirmed, recovered, dead). The data collected provides granular and thorough information on time and geographical location for all 34 Provinces across Indonesia. RESULTS: A cumulative total of 111,450 confirmed cases of were reported in Indonesia during the study period. Of those confirmed cases 67.79% (75,551/111,450) were shown as recovered and 4.83% (5,382/111,450) of them as died. Patients were mostly male (50.52%; 56,300/111,450) and adults aged 31 to 45 years old (29.73%; 33,132/111,450). Overall patient presentation symptoms of cough and fever, as well as chronic disease comorbidities were in line with previously published data from elsewhere in South-East Asia. The data reported here, shows that from the detection of the first confirmed case and within a short time period of 40 days, all the provinces of Indonesia were affected by COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to provide detailed characteristics of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients in Indonesia, including their demographic profile and COVID-19 presentation history. It used a spatial-temporal analysis to present the epidemic spread from the very beginning of the outbreak throughout all provinces in the country. The increase of new confirmed cases has been consistent during this time period for all provinces, with some demonstrating a sharp increase, in part due to the surge in national diagnostic capacity. This information delivers a ready resource that can be used for prediction modelling, and is utilized continuously by the current Indonesian Task Force in order to advise on potential implementation or removal of public distancing measures, and on potential availability of healthcare capacity in their efforts to ultimately manage the outbreak.","output":"A spatial-temporal description of the SARS-CoV-2 infections in Indonesia during the first six months of outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario, healthcare workers, in particular nurses, face prolonged exposure to stress. This intense duress takes a toll on their health overtime, affects their quality of life, and in turn impacts the quality of care provided to the patients. Hence, real-time detection and monitoring of stress is extremely important for early detection of stress patterns, prevention of burnouts and chronic conditions in healthcare workers as well as facilitate improved patient-care outcomes. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept case study using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based stress detection model that determines a personalized assessment of stress level using heart rate, heart rate variability, and physical activity of the users. We used wearable electrocardiogram and inertial sensor to record heart activity and physical activity of nurses during their shifts.

However, most of the studies that have established this largely emanate from outside sub-Saharan Africa. The pandemic nature of the infection makes it instructive to evaluate its pattern among children across different climes, including ours. This study was set out to describe the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19 in Bauchi State, North-East Nigeria. Methods: this was a cross sectional study that involved 53 children between the ages of 0 and 18 years, who had RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection between March and June 2020 in Bauchi State, Nigeria. Data on epidemiological and clinical characteristics was analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics V 21.? Relationship between categorical variables was established using the chi square test. The level of statistical significance was set at < 0.05, at a confidence interval (CI) of 95%. Results: the mean age was 12.63  4.31 years with a slight preponderance of males (1.1: 1). Majority were asymptomatic (60.4%), while 32.1% and 7.5% had mild and moderate diseases respectively. The most common symptoms were cough (20.8%), fever (17%), and sneezing (15.1%). Five children (9.4%) complained of loss of taste while anosmia was documented in one child (1.9%). We observed a significant relationship between age category and the presence of symptoms. In fact, children younger than 10 years (pre-adolescents) were five times more likely to be symptomatic when compared to those above this age (p = 0.029, C I 1.08-21.56). Conclusion: our findings have shown a mild pattern of disease and good outcome among infected children.

Together, these papers draw key theoretical and political insights for critical organization studies from the pandemic along three main lines. First, they examine how COVID-19 has denaturalized global capitalism, leading to a broad interrogation of the organization of the economy and our societies. Second, they point to how COVID-19 has unveiled the close relation between capital and the state in producing inequalities old and new, a relation that neoliberalism tends to hide from view. Third, they leverage COVID-19 to give voice to the largely female disposable workforce in the Global South on whose work global commodity flows, consumption and capital accumulation rest. We conclude by pointing to the need to address constitutive interdependencies, such as those between wage work and reproductive work, the global North and the global South, the market and the state, to name only a few.

Using high-parameter spectral flow cytometry, we analyzed the phenotype of memory B cells with reactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) in recovered individuals who had been hospitalized with non-severe (n = 8) or severe (n = 5) COVID-19.

In individuals who experienced non-severe disease, spike-specific IgG(+) B cells showed increased expression of markers associated with durable B cell memory, including T-bet and FcRL5, as compared to individuals who experienced severe disease. While the frequency of T-bet(+) spike-specific IgG(+) B cells differed between the two groups, these cells predominantly showed an activated switched memory B cell phenotype in both groups. Five months post-symptom onset, the majority of spike-specific memory B cells had a resting phenotype and the percentage of spike-specific T-bet(+) IgG(+) memory B cells decreased to baseline levels.

Then, a linear event-triggering condition is constructed based on the state and error signal. Under the event-triggering condition, an interval estimate approach is presented to reach the positivity and stability of the systems. The saturation part in the controller is technically transformed into a non-saturation part. Thus, a linear programming approach is proposed to compute the event-triggered controller gain and the corresponding gain of attraction domain.

In this context, supporting students in self-regulated learning (SRL) in an optimal way becomes an important factor for their academic success. The present study attempts through a systematic review of 38 studies to provide an overview of the interventions identified as supporting all areas of SRL (metacognitive, cognitive, motivational and emotional), in its three phases (preparatory, performance, appraisal) in distance education environments at the higher education level. As the study results show, there are a number of SRL support interventions available with proven positive effect on SRL. However, their distribution has been found to be uneven. Whereas metacognition regulation and the performance phase of learning is vastly investigated, the emotion regulation, and the preparatory and appraisal phases of the SRL cycle are somewhat underexplored. As complex and multi-component as the process of SRL is, the combination of various interventions, and specific features, for more comprehensive support has also been found beneficial. Additionally, it has been revealed that the emotion regulation, in most cases, is closely related to motivation regulation, and similar interventions support these two. Future studies can further explore the efficiency and relevance of the identified interventions, taking closer look at the effects of various digital media, learner characteristics as well as different levels of education on learners self-regulation needs.","output":"Supporting Self-Regulated Learning in Distance Learning Contexts at Higher Education Level: Systematic Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Overall, the spatial arrangement of land uses comprises strong retail activity corridors with a diverse retail offering, framed by single dwelling residential areas, which have all but disappeared by 2016.

The aim of this study was to compare short- and mid-term results between laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and LSG. METHODS Observational retrospective study from a prospective database of patients undergoing LRYGB and LSG between 2004 and 2011, where 249 patients (mean age 44.7 years) were included. Patients were followed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, and annually thereafter. Short- and mid-term weight loss, comorbidity improvement or resolution, postoperative complications, re-interventions, and mortality were evaluated. RESULTS One hundred thirty-five LRYGB and 114 LSG were included. Significant statistical differences between LRYGB and LSG were found in operative time (153 vs. 93 min. p < 0.001), minor postoperative complications (21.5 % vs. 4.4 %, p = 0.005), blood transfusions (8.8 % vs. 1.7 %, p = 0.015), and length of hospital stay (4 vs. 3 days, p < 0.001). There were no differences regarding major complications and re-interventions. There was no surgery-related mortality. The percentage of excess weight loss up to 4 years was similar in both groups (66  13.7 vs. 65  14.9 %). Both techniques showed similar results in comorbidities improvement or resolution at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS There is a similar short- and mid-term weight loss and 1-year comorbidity improvement or resolution between LRYGB and LSG, although minor complication rate is higher for LRYGB.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is expressed in human vascular endothelium, respiratory epithelium, and other cell types, and is thought to be a primary mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection. In physiological condition, ACE2 via its carboxypeptidase activity generates angiotensin fragments (Ang 1C9 and Ang 1C7), and plays an essential role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is a critical regulator of cardiovascular homeostasis. SARS-CoV-2 via its surface spike glycoprotein interacts with ACE2 and invades the host cells. Once inside the host cells, SARS-CoV-2 induces acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), stimulates immune response (i.e., cytokine storm) and vascular damage. SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial cell injury could exacerbate endothelial dysfunction, which is a hallmark of aging, hypertension, and obesity, leading to further complications. The pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction and injury offers insights into COVID-19 associated mortality. Here we reviewed the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the roles of ACE2, RAS signaling, and a possible link between the pre-existing endothelial dysfunction and SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial injury in COVID-19 associated mortality.

Abstract Introduction An evidence gap persists concerning the impact of extreme socio-structural disadvantage, such as homelessness, on the nature and effectiveness of coping with severe mental illness (SMI). While existing reviews of qualitative research into homelessness have focused on processes such as escaping homelessness and managing concurrent problem substance use, as well as on the experiences of specific vulnerable groups such as women and youth, no analogical review has been dedicated to understanding the management of SMI during an episode of homelessness. Aim/Question A qualitative metasynthesis of first-person accounts was conducted to understand how individuals cope with SMI when experiencing homelessness. Method The systematic search strategy yielded 481 potentially eligible sources. Following the team-based full-text screening and the two-tiered quality appraisal, 14 studies involving 377 participants with lived experience were synthesized following Noblit and Hare's metaethnographic method. Results Seven third-order concepts were derived capturing the complex nature and processual character of coping, as well as the web of contextual influences upon coping strategies. The resultant line-of-argument synthesis reveals the dialectical relationship between the two higher-order constructs-\\"the continuum of coping\\" and \\"the assemblage of disadvantage.\\" Discussion Despite the profoundly adverse impacts of biographical and socio-structural conditions, many individuals mobilized internal and external resources to enable various coping processes. Coping in the context of multiple disadvantage is not a monolith but rather a multidimensional, contingent and fluid phenomenon. Implications for practice Nursing practice should espouse a humanizing, structurally competent, and strength- and meaning-oriented approach in order to meet the complex and multifaceted needs of such multiply disadvantaged persons.","output":"Coping amidst an assemblage of disadvantage: A qualitative metasynthesis of first-person accounts of managing severe mental illness while homeless."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has a worldwide distribution; however, there is no effective diagnosis marker, especially for the mild-type COVID-19.

RESULTS For the full 7-category modified Rankin Scale, thrombectomy added to IV tPA (intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator) alone had number needed to treat to benefit 2.9 (95% confidence interval, 2.6-3.3) and number needed to harm 68.9 (95% confidence interval, 40-250); thrombectomy for patients ineligible for IV tPA had number needed to treat to benefit 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 2.1-2.5) and number needed to harm 100 (95% confidence interval, 62.5-250). Visual displays of treatment effects on 100 patients showed: with thrombectomy added to IV tPA alone, 34 patients have better disability outcome, including 14 more normal or near normal (modified Rankin Scale, 0-1); with thrombectomy for patients ineligible for IV tPA, 44 patients have a better disability outcome, including 16 more normal or nearly normal.

Also, the transition of combustion modes during the combustion process, which affects the growth rate of the oxide cap, needs to be explored. Therefore, a detailed combustion model of a single micron-sized aluminum particle is developed to predict the transition of combustion modes and the effect of the oxide cap. This combustion model consists of a vapor-phase kinetic model and a particle model coupled by the Strang splitting algorithm. The predicted ignition delay and combustion times are compared with experimental data to validate the combustion model. Three combustion modes including vapor-phase, transitional, and surface combustions are considered in this combustion model. We find that the two modes coexist for particles between 100 and 200 m when the ambient temperature and pressure are 2500 K and 1 atm, respectively. A higher ambient temperature extends the transition of combustion mode toward smaller sizes. An oxide cap model considering surface free energy is proposed to study the growth and effect of the oxide cap on the combustion process of micron-sized aluminum particles. We find that the formation of oxide cap limits the evaporation rate of aluminum directly due to the reduced active surface area. The oxide cap stabilizes the evolution of particle temperature and determines the burning time. The predicted burning time is reduced by a factor of 2 at least considering the growth of oxide cap.","output":"On Modeling the Combustion of a Single Micron-Sized Aluminum Particle with the Effect of Oxide Cap"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unknown","output":"Appendix 2 Acronyms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this manuscript is to describe how modern advances in our knowledge of viruses and viral evolution can be applied to the fields of disease ecology and conservation.

Review of literature of existing VEXAS syndrome cases showed a high thrombotic burden, with the reported incidence of VTE (36.4%) being markedly higher than arterial thrombosis (1.6%), with deep vein thrombosis being more common than pulmonary embolism. Somatic mutation in the UBA1 gene results in decreased ubiquitylation which is a key driver in the development of thrombosis in VEXAS syndrome, due to chronic inflammation and cytokine release from abnormal crosstalk between the intrinsic effector mechanism of innate immune cells, platelets and endothelium resulting in dysregulated haemostasis and endothelial dysfunction.

Using German COVID-19 surveillance data and age-group specific IFR estimates from multiple international studies, this work investigates time-dependent variations in effective IFR over the course of the pandemic. Three different methods for estimating (effective) IFRs are presented: (a) population-averaged IFRs based on the assumption that the infection risk is independent of age and time, (b) effective IFRs based on the assumption that the age distribution of confirmed cases approximately reflects the age distribution of infected individuals, and (c) effective IFRs accounting for age- and time-dependent dark figures of infections. Results show that effective IFRs in Germany are estimated to vary over time, as the age distributions of confirmed cases and estimated infections are changing during the course of the pandemic. In particular during the first and second waves of infections in spring and autumn/winter 2020, there has been a pronounced shift in the age distribution of confirmed cases towards older age groups, resulting in larger effective IFR estimates. The temporary increase in effective IFR during the first wave is estimated to be smaller but still remains when adjusting for age- and time-dependent dark figures. A comparison of effective IFRs with observed CFRs indicates that a substantial fraction of the time-dependent variability in observed mortality can be explained by changes in the age distribution of infections. Furthermore, a vanishing gap between effective IFRs and observed CFRs is apparent after the first infection wave, while a moderately increasing gap can be observed during the second wave.

Results It was found that 50 videos examined in this study were uploaded between the years 2014 and 2020, with an average of 492.252  710.768 and a total of 24.612.595 views. The mean DISCERN score given to 50 videos analyzed by two researchers was 2.81  1.3 and the mean GQS score was 2.88  1.4. When we divided the scores given to the videos by two researchers into three groups, it was determined that 27 (54%) of the 50 videos were in the misleading/poor quality group, nine (18%) were in the medium quality group, and 14 (28%) were in the useful/quality group. Conclusion It has been determined that the videos with \\"ovarian cyst\\" content on YouTube are generally of poor quality.

As with all respiratory viruses, public health measures are focused on contact tracing, isolation, and treatment of affected individuals, who have respiratory symptoms. However, it is spreading efficiently, and it can be explained from its stealth transmission from presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Droplet and contact precautions are followed universally. Healthcare workers are at higher risk of acquiring infection and they are additionally required to follow airborne and eye protection. Recent studies indicate viral particles can be isolated from many body fluids including feces, saliva, semen, and tears, suggesting transmission could be possibly occurring through some of these routes as well. We have done an evidence-based review of all potential modes of transmission and discussed preventive measures to stop the spread. There is an urgent need for educating the healthcare professionals, governments, and public regarding other potential modes of transmission.

On 29th April 2020, Malaysia reported more than 5,000 COVID-19 cases; the second highest in the Southeast Asian region after Singapore. Recently, a forecasting model was developed to measure and predict COVID-19 cases in Malaysia on daily basis for the next 10 days using previously-confirmed cases. A Recurrent Forecasting-Singular Spectrum Analysis (RF-SSA) is proposed by establishing L and ET parameters via several tests. The advantage of using this forecasting model is it would discriminate noise in a time series trend and produce significant forecasting results. The RF-SSA model assessment was based on the official COVID-19 data released by the World Health Organization (WHO) to predict daily confirmed cases between 30th April and 31st May, 2020. These results revealed that parameter L = 5 (T/20) for the RF-SSA model was indeed suitable for short-time series outbreak data, while the appropriate number of eigentriples was integral as it influenced the forecasting results. Evidently, the RF-SSA had over-forecasted the cases by 0.36%. This signifies the competence of RF-SSA in predicting the impending number of COVID-19 cases. Nonetheless, an enhanced RF-SSA algorithm should be developed for higher effectivity of capturing any extreme data changes.","output":"Short-Term Forecasting of Daily Confirmed COVID-19 Cases in Malaysia Using RF-SSA Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 pandemic, antibody responses and antibody effector functions targeting SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2\\\\infected cells have been understudied.

Following studies over the last few decades, the concept of senescence has evolved from an antiproliferative mechanism in cancer (oncogene-induced senescence) to a critical component of physiological processes associated with embryonic development, tissue regeneration, ageing and its associated diseases. In somatic cells, oncogenic mutations in RAS-MAPK pathway genes are associated with oncogene-induced senescence and cancer, while germline mutations in the same pathway are linked to a group of monogenic developmental disorders generally termed RASopathies. Here, we consider that in these disorders, senescence induction may result in opposing outcomes, a tumour protective effect and a possible contributor to a premature ageing phenotype identified in Costello syndrome, which belongs to the RASopathy group. In this review, we will highlight the role of senescence in organismal homeostasis and we will describe the current knowledge about senescence in RASopathies. Additionally, we provide a perspective on examples of experimentally characterised RASopathy mutations that, alone or in combination with various stressors, may also trigger an age-dependent chronic senescence, possibly contributing to the age-dependent worsening of RASopathy pathophenotype and the reduction of lifespan.","output":"Senescence in RASopathies, a possible novel contributor to a complex pathophenoype."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), a newly discovered enteric coronavirus, is the aetiological agent that causes severe clinical diarrhea and intestinal pathological damage in piglets. To understand the effect of SADS-CoV on host cells, we characterized the apoptotic pathways and elucidated mechanisms underlying the process of apoptotic cell death after SADS-CoV infection. SADS-CoV-infected cells showed evidence of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. The use of a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis and reduction in SADS-CoV replication, suggestive of the association of a caspase-dependent pathway. Furthermore, SADS-CoV infection activated the initiators caspase-8 and -9 and upregulated FasL and Bid cleavage, demonstrating a crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. However, the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Cytochrome c (Cyt c) relocalized to the mitochondria and cytoplasm, respectively, after infection by SADS-CoV. Moreover, Vero E6 and IPI-2I cells treated with cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, were completely protected from SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis and viral replication, suggesting the involvement of cyclophilin D (CypD) in these processes. Altogether, our results indicate that caspase-dependent FasL (extrinsic)- and mitochondria (intrinsic)- mediated apoptotic pathways play a central role in SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis that facilitates viral replication.

PARTICIPANTS: Studies having biomarkers, including lymphocyte, platelets, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, procalcitonin (PCT) and creatine kinase (CK), and describing outcomes were selected with the consensus of three independent reviewers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Composite poor outcomes include intensive care unit admission, oxygen saturation <90%, invasive mechanical ventilation utilisation, severe disease, in-hospital admission and mortality. The OR and 95% CI were obtained and forest plots were created using random-effects models. Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed by sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: 32 studies with 10 491 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. We found that lymphopenia (pooled-OR: 3.33 (95% CI: 2.51-4.41); p<0.00001), thrombocytopenia (2.36 (1.64-3.40); p<0.00001), elevated D-dimer (3.39 (2.66-4.33); p<0.00001), elevated CRP (4.37 (3.37-5.68); p<0.00001), elevated PCT (6.33 (4.24-9.45); p<0.00001), elevated CK (2.42 (1.35-4.32); p=0.003), elevated AST (2.75 (2.30-3.29); p<0.00001), elevated ALT (1.71 (1.32-2.20); p<0.00001), elevated creatinine (2.84 (1.80-4.46); p<0.00001) and LDH (5.48 (3.89-7.71); p<0.00001) were independently associated with higher risk of poor outcomes.

The data analysed in this study were collected with the aid of a questionnaire. Findings The result revealed that use intention was influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value and UB. Also, facilitating conditions, habit and use intention did not influence use behaviour. Overall, six constructs, which include price value (R-i - C-j value = 0.1284), use behaviour (R-i - C-j value = 0.0666), social influence (R-i - C-j value = 0.0583), facilitating conditions (R-i - C-j value = 0.0323), performance expectancy (R-i - C-j value = 0.0196) and effort expectancy (R-i - C-j value = 0.0116), were significant predictors of the factors influencing the decision of REFs to adopt VR.

In addition to the abundance of evidence supporting the ergogenic benefits of creatine supplementation, recent evidence suggests a far broader application for creatine within various myopathies, neurodegenerative diseases, and other pathologies. Furthermore, creatine has been found to exhibit non-energy related properties, contributing as a possible direct and in-direct antioxidant and eliciting anti-inflammatory effects. In spite of the new clinical success of supplemental creatine, there is little scientific insight into the potential effects of creatine on cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality.

Recently, there has been a surge in TMS studies evaluating lower-limb fatigue. TMS intensity of 120-130% resting motor threshold (RMT) and 120% active motor threshold (AMT) and TMS intensity determined using stimulus-response curves during muscular contraction have been used in these studies. With the expansion of fatigue research in locomotion, the quadriceps femoris is increasingly of interest. It is important to select a stimulus intensity appropriate to evaluate the variables, including voluntary activation, being measured in this functionally important muscle group. This study assessed whether selected quadriceps TMS stimulus intensity determined by frequently employed methods is similar between methods and muscles. METHODS Stimulus intensity in vastus lateralis, rectus femoris and vastus medialis muscles was determined by RMT, AMT (i.e. during brief voluntary contractions at 10% maximal voluntary force, MVC) and maximal motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude from stimulus-response curves during brief voluntary contractions at 10, 20 and 50% MVC at different stimulus intensities. RESULTS Stimulus intensity determined from a 10% MVC stimulus-response curve and at 120 and 130% RMT was higher than stimulus intensity at 120% AMT (lowest) and from a 50% MVC stimulus-response curve (p < 0.05). Stimulus intensity from a 20% MVC stimulus-response curve was similar to 120% RMT and 50% MVC stimulus-response curve. Mean stimulus intensity for stimulus-response curves at 10, 20 and 50% MVC corresponded to approximately 135, 115 and 100% RMT and 180, 155 and 130% AMT, respectively. Selected stimulus intensity was similar between muscles for all methods (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Similar optimal stimulus intensity and maximal MEP amplitudes at 20 and 50% MVC and the minimal risk of residual fatigue at 20% MVC suggest that a 20% MVC stimulus-response curve is appropriate for determining TMS stimulus intensity in the quadriceps femoris. The higher selected stimulus intensities at 120-130% RMT have the potential to cause increased coactivation and discomfort and the lower stimulus intensity at 120% AMT may underestimate evoked responses. One muscle may also act as a surrogate in determining optimal quadriceps femoris stimulation intensity.","output":"Resting and active motor thresholds versus stimulus-response curves to determine transcranial magnetic stimulation intensity in quadriceps femoris."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reliable quantification of the antibody response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly relevant, e.g., for identifying possible vaccine failure and estimating the time of protection.

Results were further compared to the percent inhibition calculated from a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). Individual values were distributed over several orders of magnitude for all assays. Although the assays were in good overall agreement ( = 0.80 to 0.94), Passing-Bablok regression revealed systematic constant and proportional differences, which could not be eliminated by converting the results to binding antibody units (BAU) per milliliter, as suggested by the manufacturers. Seven (10%) individuals had negative sVNT results (i.e., <30% inhibition). These samples were identified by most assays and yielded significantly lower binding antibody levels.

The National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS-EED) filter and the McMaster sensitive therapy filter were combined with a bespoke search strategy for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). We extracted unit cost estimates, assessed variability and methodology, and determined transferability. RESULTS We included 37 studies in this review. Four hundred and eighty-two cost estimates from 13 countries worldwide were extracted. Descriptive analysis shows that hospital stay in gynecology ranged between 82 and 1,292 per day. Costs of gynecological consultation range from 30 in France to 158 in Sweden. In the UK, costs are estimated at 228 per hour. Costs of a tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) device range from 431 in Finland to 994 in Canada. TVT surgery per minute costs 25 in France and 82 in Sweden.

We found two drugs, the clinically approved anti-fungi drug Caspofungin Acetate (Cancidas) and the oncolytic peptide LTX-315, can bind SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 protein to block the polymerase activity in vitro . Further live virus assay revealed that both Caspofungin Acetate and LTX-315 can effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vero cells. These findings present promising drug candidates for treatment of related diseases and would also stimulate the development of pan- coronavirus antiviral agents.Authors Min Wang, Fei Ye, Jiaqi Su, Jingru Zhao, and Bin Yuan contributed equally to this work.","output":"Caspofungin and LTX-315 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by targeting the nsp12 polymerase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJETIVOS: Describir la organizacin de un hospital durante la pandemia por COVID-19, prestando atencin a aspectos tanto organizativos como de liderazgo, y considerando todas las reas hospitalarias, incluido el quirfano MATERIAL Y MTODOS: Revisin de la literatura en relacin con los consejos organizativos para la gestin hospitalaria dentro de la pandemia Adems, se han tenido en consideracin las recomendaciones de sociedades, de instituciones como la OMS, el CDC, el ECDC, Ministerio de Sanidad y Consejera de Sanidad de Madrid y la propia experiencia del centro RESULTADOS: Descripcin de los elementos claves para la organizacin, as como de los diferentes mbitos de actuacin dentro de un hospital: urgencias, consultas,hospitalizacin y quirfanos CONCLUSIONES: La gestin durante una pandemia requiere un alto grado de agilidad en la respuesta y plasticidad en las personas Todas las estructuras hospitalarias deben adecuarse a una situacin para la que no han sido concebidas y todo el personal debe ponerse al servicio de una enfermedad que condiciona todas las decisiones Ser capaz de adaptarse y de intentar adelantarse a lo que va a ocurrir son las claves del xito OBJECTIVES: To describe the organization of a hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, paying attention to both organizational and leadership aspects, and considering all hospital areas, including the operating room MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of the literature regarding the organizational councils for hospital management within the pandemic In addition, the recommendations of societies, institutions such as the WHO, the CDC, the ECDC, the National Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Health of Madrid and the center?s own experience have been taken into account RESULTS: Description of the key elements for the organization, as well as the different areas of action within a hospital: emergencies, consultations, hospitalization and operating rooms CONCLUSIONS: Management during a pandemic requires a high degree of agility in response and plasticity in people All hospital structures must adapt to a situation for which they have not been conceived and all staff must place themselves at the service of a disease that conditions all decisions Being able to adapt and try to anticipate what is going to happen are the keys to success","output":"Gestin hospitalaria en la pandemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Containment, the key strategy in quickly halting an epidemic, requires rapid identification and quarantine of the infected individuals, determination of whom they have had close contact with in the previous days and weeks, and decontamination of locations the infected individual has visited.

Transport ventilators may provide mandatory ventilation with predetermined tidal volumes and without the risk of hyperventilation. Nonetheless, interactions between chest compressions and ventilations are likely to occur. We investigated whether transport ventilators can provide adequate alveolar ventilation during continuous chest compression in adult CPR. METHODS: A three-period crossover study with three common transport ventilators in a cadaver model of CPR was carried out. The three ventilators MEDUMAT Standard2, Oxylog 3000 plus, and Monnal T60 represent three different interventions, providing volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation (VC-CMV) via an endotracheal tube with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight. Proximal airflow was measured, and the net tidal volume was derived for each respiratory cycle. The deviation from the predetermined tidal volume was calculated and analysed. Several mixed linear models were calculated with the cadaver as a random factor and ventilator, height, sex, crossover period and incremental number of each ventilation within the period as covariates to evaluate differences between ventilators. RESULTS: Overall median deviation of net tidal volume from predetermined tidal volume was ? 21.2 % (IQR: 19.6, range: [? 87.9 %; 25.8 %]) corresponding to a tidal volume of 4.75 mL/kg predicted body weight (IQR: 1.2, range: [0.7; 7.6]). In a mixed linear model, the ventilator model, the crossover period, and the cadavers height were significant factors for decreased tidal volume. The estimated effects of tidal volume deviation for each ventilator were ? 14.5 % [95 %-CI: ?22.5; ?6.5] (p = 0.0004) for Monnal T60, ? 30.6 % [95 %-CI: ?38.6; ?22.6] (p < 0.0001) for Oxylog 3000 plus and ? 31.0 % [95 %-CI: ?38.9; ?23.0] (p < 0.0001) for MEDUMAT Standard2. CONCLUSIONS: All investigated transport ventilators were able to provide alveolar ventilation even though chest compressions considerably decreased tidal volumes. Our results support the concept of using ventilators to avoid excessive ventilatory rates in CPR. This experimental study suggests that healthcare professionals should carefully monitor actual tidal volumes to recognise the occurrence of hypoventilation during continuous chest compressions.

Method: A review was undertaken of the English\\\\speaking literature on the potential for emerging viral threats to human health in Australia, the future implications of virus ecology, climate change and population movement and the implications for blood transfusion. Results: Published data confirm that Australia's blood supply is among the safest in the world for currently screened viral pathogens as a result of rigorous surveillance, donor selection and state\\\\of\\\\the\\\\art processing and laboratory testing. However, Australia has a number of other viral pathogens with the potential to threaten the safety of the blood supply such as the Ross River, Barmah Forrest, Kunjin, Japanese Encephalitis, Murray Valley Encephalitis and dengue viruses. Of these, dengue is currently of most concern to blood safety because; it can cause fatalities, there are regular seasonal outbreaks in Northern Australia and, in contrast to other viruses mentioned above an overseas case of transfusion transmission has already been documented. Notably, despite the lack of a suitable dengue screening test the ARCBS already implements supplementary measures to protect the blood supply during outbreaks. Conclusion: Current interventions have proven extremely effective in minimising transfusion transmission in Australia of recognised viral pathogens. The threat posed by emerging viral pathogens to the safety of blood transfusion emphasises the need for global collaboration and consideration of further intervention strategies on a country by country basis including options such as nucleic acid testing and pathogen reduction technologies.","output":"Emerging viral threats to the Australian blood supply"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the multiple diagnostic and therapeutic strategies implemented in clinical practice, the mortality rate of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains high.

The genes were validated in a monocrotaline-induced PAH rat model. Three clinically relevant modules were identified through average linkage hierarchical clustering. The genes in the clinically relevant modules were related to endothelial cell differentiation, inflammation, and autoimmunity. Seven genes were screened as key genes significantly associated with PAH. Interferon-induced protein 44-like (IFI44L) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) were expressed at higher levels in the lung tissues of the PAH rat model than in those of the controls.

Meanwhile, previous studies have shown the possibility of using CNF as biomarkers of polyneuropathy (PNP). PURPOSE To study clinical and diagnostic features of post-COVID PNP. MATERIAL AND METHODS We examined 9 female patients aged 32 to 51 years who had suffered an infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 of varying severity. The patients were divided into two groups: the first consisted of 6 patients with clinical manifestations of PNP in the form of neuropathic pain, the second - 3 patients without clinical manifestations. Patients of group 1 underwent comprehensive examination including neurological examination, confocal microscopy of the cornea (in vivo CM), electroneuromyography (ENMG) of the nerves of the upper and lower extremities, quantitative sensory testing in the zone of painful sensations, while patients of group 2 only underwent in vivo CM. RESULTS All patients of the first group, within 5-40 days after the onset of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, exhibited symptoms of damage to various parts of the nervous system (peripheral nerves, thoracic spinal roots, trigeminal nerve). The main - and in most cases the only - symptom of the disease was neuropathic pain syndrome. In Guillain-Barr syndrome, for the first time using in vivo CM, the following changes were revealed: enlargement of in Langerhans cells, shortening of CNF and their processes, presence of neuromas.

In this context, the present study adopted a strategy to explore the lead compounds from Azadirachta indica against ZIKV via concurrent inhibition of the NS2B-NS3 protease (ZIKV(pro)) and NS5 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (ZIKV(RdRp)) proteins using molecular simulations. Initially, structure-based virtual screening of 44 bioflavonoids reported in Azadirachta indica against the crystal structures of targeted ZIKV proteins resulted in the identification of the top four common bioflavonoids, viz. Rutin, Nicotiflorin, Isoquercitrin, and Hyperoside. These compounds showed substantial docking energy (?7.9 to ?11.01 kcal/mol) and intermolecular interactions with essential residues of ZIKV(pro) (B:His(51), B:Asp(75), and B:Ser(135)) and ZIKV(RdRp) (Asp(540), Ile(799), and Asp(665)) by comparison to the reference compounds, O7N inhibitor (ZIKV(pro)) and Sofosbuvir inhibitor (ZIKV(RdRp)). Besides, long interval molecular dynamics simulation (500 ns) on the selected docked poses reveals stability of the respective docked poses contributed by intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The predicted complex stability was further supported by calculated end-point binding free energy using molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) method.

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein promotes entry into host cells and is considered a key therapeutic target by many researchers. Here we describe the identification of several monoclonal antibodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. One human antibody, CA521 LALA , demonstrated neutralization potential by immunizing human antibody transgenic mice. CA521 LALA showed potent SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro . The LALA mutation introduced to CA521 abrogates the binding with Fc receptors or complement receptors reducing antibody-dependent enhancement seen with anti-SARS-CoV antibodies. CA521 LALA also demonstrated having a long half-life of 9.5 days in mice and 9.3 days in rhesus monkeys. CA521 LALA inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in SARS-CoV-2 susceptible mice at a therapeutic setting with the virus titer of the lung reduced by 4.5 logs. Structural analysis by cryo-EM revealed that CA521 LALA recognizes an epitope overlapping with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) in the Spike protein. CA521 LALA blocks the interaction by binding all three RBDs of one SARS CoV-2 spike trimer simultaneously.

The incidence of this phenomenon in patients with COVID-19 infection is unknown and likely under-recognized. CASE SUMMARY : During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, a 70-year-old Hispanic female presented with syncope due to a saddle PE further complicated by a highly mobile CIT. Polymerase chain reaction was positive for COVID-19 infection, however, there was no evidence of lung parenchymal involvement or hyper-inflammation. Based on consensus from a multidisciplinary team, aspiration thrombectomy was attempted to treat this extreme case of VTE, however, the patient died during the procedure. DISCUSSION : This case raises awareness to the most catastrophic form of VTE, presenting in an early phase of COVID-19 infection without the typical hyper-inflammation and severe lung injury associated with development of COVID-related coagulopathy. It also serves to inform on the critical role echocardiography has in the comprehensive evaluation and re-evaluation of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the importance of a multidisciplinary organized approach in clinical decision-making for this complex and poorly understood disease and its sequelae.","output":"Saddle pulmonary embolism and clot in transit in COVID-19 infection: a case report of catastrophic venous thromboembolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mortality and the burden of diseases worldwide continue to reach substantial numbers with societal development and urbanization. In the face of decline in human health, early detection of complex diseases is indispensable, albeit challenging. In this review, we document the research carried out thus far on the appearance of complex diseases marked by a critical transition or a sudden shift from a healthy state to a disease state. The theory of resilience and critical slowing down can provide practical tools to forecast the onset of various fatal and perpetuating diseases. However, critical transitions in diseases across diverse temporal and spatial scales may not always be preceded by critical slowing down. In this backdrop, an in-depth study of the underlying molecular mechanisms provides dynamic network biomarkers that can forecast potential critical transitions. We have put together the theory of complex diseases and resilience, and have discussed the need for advanced research in developing early warning signals in the field of medicine and health care. We conclude the review with a few open questions and prospects for research in this emerging field.","output":"Identifying critical transitions in complex diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Facing the COVID-19 challenge on a global level, dental care professionals are encouraged to optimize universal precautions and adopt measures that ensure protection against infection by contaminated aerosols and droplets. Although aerosol transmission is possible, direct contact through large droplets is probably responsible for the vast majority of transmissions.[1, 2] This paper is the 2nd of a series of three on the management of COVID-19 in clinical dental care settings and aims to describe PPE selection and use by DCP, with consideration of the level of risk associated with the planned procedures. PPE selection depends directly on the local epidemiological setting, the patient's characteristics, and the level of risk of the planned procedures. The procedures performed in the office environment are classified as low-, moderate-, or high-risk. Moderate risk includes two further sublevels associated with the cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of materials for clinical procedures that do not generate aerosols. The training of DCP on how to properly don (put on) and doff (remove) PPE is as important as choosing the appropriate PPE since it can be associated with a risk of infection. When there is limited availability of PPE, measures should be adjusted to the risk associated with the intervention. Assuming that an effective vaccine will be developed, once it becomes available for DCP, PPE requirements will likely be different. The proper use of PPE, together with the adoption of other operational procedures, can provide effective protection against microorganisms being transmitted via body fluids or in the air","output":"COVID-19 Management in Clinical Dental Care Part II: Personal Protective Equipment for the Dental Care Professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As impressive as the accomplishments of modern molecular biologists have been in finding genetic alterations that lengthen life in short-lived model organisms, they pale in comparison to the remarkable diversity of lifespans produced by evolution. Some animal species are now firmly documented to live for more than four centuries and even some mammals, like the bowhead whale, appear to survive 200 years or more. Another group of species may not be as absolutely long-lived, but they are remarkably long-lived for their body size and metabolic rate. These species include a number of bats, some of which live for at least 40 years in the wild, as well as the naked mole-rat, which is the same size, but lives nearly 10 times as long as the laboratory mouse. Together these exceptionally long-lived organisms have important roles to play in our future understanding of the causal mechanisms and modulation of ageing. Bats and naked mole-rats in particular have already contributed in the following ways: (1) they have contributed to the abandonment of the rate-of-living theory and weakened enthusiasm for the oxidative stress hypothesis of ageing, (2) they have helped evaluate how the tumour-suppressing role of cellular senescence is affected by the evolution of diverse body sizes as well as diverse longevities, (3) they have shed light on the relationship between specific types of DNA repair and ageing and (4) they have yielded insight into new processes, specifically the maintenance of the proteome and hypotheses concerning how evolution shapes ageing. The continuing acceleration of progress in genome sequencing and development of more and more cross-species investigatory techniques will facilitate even more contributions of these species in the near future.","output":"Methusaleh's Zoo: how nature provides us with clues for extending human health span."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the epidemic spread rapidly and frightening.

The animal model of ARS is based on clinical grade dosimetry precision and bioluminescence imaging. We found that allogeneic MSCs exhibit lower persistence in na?ve compared to irradiated animals, and that intraperitoneal infusion of IFN prelicensed allogeneic MSCs protected animals from radiation induced lethality by day 30. In direct comparison, we also investigated the effect of IFN prelicensed allogeneic MSCs in modulating acute GvHD in an animal model of MHC major mismatched bone marrow transplantation. Infusion of IFN prelicensed allogeneic MSCs failed to mitigate acute GvHD. Altogether our results demonstrate that infused IFN prelicensed allogeneic MSCs protect against lethality from ARS, but not GvHD, thus providing important insights on the dichotomy of IFN prelicensed allogenic MSCs in well characterized and robust animal models of acute tissue injury.","output":"Dichotomic Potency of IFN Licensed Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in Animal Models of Acute Radiation Syndrome and Graft Versus Host Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses efficiently inhibit interferon (IFN) induction in nonhematopoietic cells and conventional dendritic cells (cDC).

As expected, BMM but not BMDC expressed type I IFN. IFN production in infected BMM was nearly completely dependent on signaling through the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-/) receptor (IFNAR). Several IFN-dependent cytokines and chemokines showed the same expression pattern, with enhanced production in BMM compared to BMDC and dependence upon signaling through the IFNAR. Exogenous IFN enhanced IFN-dependent gene expression in BMM at early times after infection and in BMDC at all times after infection but did not stimulate expression of molecules that signal through myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Collectively, our results show that IFN is produced at early times postinfection (p.i.) in MHV-infected BMM, but not in BMDC, and primes expression of IFN and IFN-responsive genes. Further, our results also show that BMM are generally more responsive to MHV infection, since MyD88-dependent pathways are also activated to a greater extent in these cells than in BMDC.","output":"Autocrine Interferon Priming in Macrophages but Not Dendritic Cells Results in Enhanced Cytokine and Chemokine Production after Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to summarize the experience of neurosurgery in The Third People's Hospital of Hubei Province after the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019, 28 patients were admitted from January 5, 2020 to February 17, 2020.

Many studies showed that the prevalence of back pain after spinal anesthesia is high and its magnitude is considerable in developing countries. It is highly related to reduced quality of life, loss of work productivity, burden of health care costs, and satisfaction regarding health care service; therefore, measures should be taken to reduce or prevented postspinal back. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the prevalence and factors associated with back pain among patients undergoing spinal anesthesia at the University of Gondar Comprehensive and Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. Methodology. An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to May 2020. A total of 215 participants were enrolled in this study. A convenience sampling technique was used to get the study participants. Both univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with postspinal back pain. Variables with a p value less than <0.2 in the bivariable analysis were fitted into the multivariable analysis. In the multivariable analysis, a variable with a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of postspinal back pain was 40.5% (95% CI: 34.0, 47.4). Being overweight (AOR = 3.8; 95% CI: 1.47, 9.96) and obese (AOR = 4.9; 95% CI: 1.19, 20.4), using big spinal needles (AOR = 5.9; 95% CI: 1.04, 33.4), two attempts of lumbar puncture (AOR = 5.5; 95% CI: 1.74, 17.59), more than three attempts of lumbar puncture (AOR = 4.9; 95% CI: 1.63, 15.2), and the number of bone contacts during spinal anesthesia procedure (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.14, 8.45) were positively associated with postspinal back pain. Conclusion and Recommendation. The overall incidence of back pain is high. Body mass index, size of spinal needle, number of attempts, and number of bone contacts are significantly associated with the incidence of back pain following spinal anesthesia. Thus, it is better to minimize the number of lumbar puncture attempts and bone contacts during spinal anesthesia to reduce postspinal back pain. In addition, using smaller size spinal needle is a good choice.","output":"Prevalence and Factors Associated with Back Pain among Patients Undergoing Spinal Anesthesia at the University of Gondar Comprehensive and Specialized Hospital, North West Ethiopia: An Institutional Based Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Official statistics tend to rely on a headcount approach to poverty measurement, distinguishing 'the poor' from the 'non-poor' on the basis of an anchored threshold Invariably, this does little to engage with the gradations of material hardship affecting those living, to varying degrees, below the poverty line In response, this paper interrogates an apparent flatlining in UK poverty to establish the changing profile of poverty, as well as those most affected by it Drawing on the Family Resources survey, this paper reveals an increasing depth of poverty in the UK since 2010, with bifurcation observable in the living standards of different percentile groups below the poverty line In addition, this paper demonstrates substantial compositional changes in the socio-demographic profile of (deep) poverty Since 2010, the likelihood of falling into deep poverty has increased for women, children, larger families, Black people and those in full-time work Within the context of COVID-19, I argue there is a need to re-think how we currently conceptualise poverty by better attending to internal heterogeneity within the broader analytical and methodological category of 'the poor' Doing so raises pressing questions about the prevailing modes of poverty measurement that tend to frame and delimit the social scientific analysis of poverty, as well as the policies deemed appropriate in tackling it ?

Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed the existence of eleven GISAID clades with GR (variant of the spike protein S-D614G and nucleocapsid protein N-G204R), GH (variant of the ORF3a coding protein ORF3a-Q57H) and GK (variant S-T478K) being the most common with 25.9%, 19.9%, and 19.6%, respectively, followed by their parent clade G (variant S-D614G) (10.3%). Lower prevalence was noted for GRY (variant S-N501Y) (5.1%), S (variant ORF8-L84S) (3.1%) and GV (variant of the ORF3a coding protein NS3-G251V) (2.0%). Interestingly, 1.5% of total genomes were assigned as GRA (Omicron), the newly emerged clade. Across the North African countries, 108 SARS-CoV-2 lineages using the Pangolin assignment were identified, whereby most genomes fell within six major lineages and variants of concern (VOC) including B.1, the Delta variants (AY.X, B.1.617.2), C.36, B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.

Until effective vaccines are developed to curb the pandemic, it is paramount to define the mechanisms and develop protective therapies to prevent organ dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. Individuals that develop severe manifestations have signs of dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses. Emerging evidence implicates neutrophils and the disbalance between neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and degradation plays a central role in the pathophysiology of inflammation, coagulopathy, organ damage, and immunothrombosis that characterize severe cases of COVID-19. Here, we discuss the evidence supporting a role for NETs in COVID-19 manifestations and present putative mechanisms, by which NETs promote tissue injury and immunothrombosis.

AIM To evaluate whether an electronic frailty index based on routine primary care data can be used as a measure for daily functioning in research with community-dwelling older persons (aged 75 years). DESIGN AND SETTING Cohort study among participants of the Integrated Systemic Care for Older People (ISCOPE) trial (11 476 eligible; 7285 in observational cohort; 3141 in trial; over-representation of frail people). METHOD At baseline (T0) and after 12 months (T12), daily functioning was measured with the Groningen Activities Restriction Scale (GARS, range 18-72). Electronic frailty index scores (range 0-1) at T0 and T12 were computed from the EHRs. The electronic frailty index (electronic Frailty Index - Utrecht) was tested for responsiveness and compared with the GARS as a gold standard for daily functioning. RESULTS In total, 1390 participants with complete EHR and follow-up data were selected (31.4% male; median age = 81 years, interquartile range = 78-85). The electronic frailty index increased with age, was higher for females, and lower for participants living with a partner. It was responsive after an acute major medical event; however, the correlation between the electronic frailty index and GARS at T0 and over time was limited. CONCLUSION Because the electronic frailty index does not reflect daily functioning, further research on new methods to measure daily functioning with routine care data (for example, other proxies) is needed before EHRs can be a useful data source for research with older persons.","output":"Measuring daily functioning in older persons using a frailty index: a cohort study based on routine primary care data."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poverty and infectious diseases interact in complex ways.

It is largely committed by male against their female intimate partner. This is often associated with the region's unique social and cultural norms which subordinate women throughout their lives. IPV is an ongoing concern in Bhutan. The country's age-old traditions and customs are closely related to culture of silence among women experiencing IPV. This study examined women's responses to intimate partner violence (IPV) in Bhutan. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore sensitising concepts such as how and when women recognised IPV and how they responded to it. Fifteen women who had sought supportive services at the institution \`RENEW' (Respect, Educate, Nurture, Empower Women) as a result of IPV participated in the interview. The Trans-theoretical model of behaviour change (TTM) was used as a theoretical framework to understand women's cognitive, affective and behavioural change processes. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to identify the patterns of women's responses. From the analysis, women's experiences of IPV and their responses were located within the four stages of change, including contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance. Women used nine traditional processes of change among which consciousness raising and helping relationships were critical and appeared across all four stages of change. This study provides important insights of Bhutanese women's cognitive and behavioural responses to IPV. The appearance of consciousness raising and helping relationships across all the stages of change represents a potential opportunity for intervention to initiate and promote changes in women's response to IPV in the early stages.","output":"Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in Bhutan: Understanding Women's Responses to IPV Using the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathogens frequently use multivalent binding to sialic acid to infect cells or to modulate immunity through interactions with human sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins (Siglecs).

Recent evidence has highlighted how both pandemics are strongly associated: obese and diabetic patients are at increased risk of COVID 19 infection and have a worse prognosis when infected due to the impairment of the immune response to infections and due to the mechanical limits that make the management of these patients more difficult. There is also evidence that both pandemics are the cause and effect of climate change. Indeed, population growth, urbanization, motorized transportation and agricultural productivity increase greenhouse gas emission and consequently global warming. These factors are also incriminated in the diabesity pandemic by the promotion of the nutrition transition and physical inactivity. It has also been suggested that the emergence and dissemination of the COVID 19 outbreak, as well as other zoonosis, could be linked to this population and urban growth, encroaching into wildlife habitats leading to an increased interaction between humans and animals, providing opportunities for inter species infection. Telehealth interventions have proven to be effective in tackling both pandemics, by providing care to both patients with COVID-19 infections and for those with obesity and diabetes, without increasing the risk of potential exposure for patients, clinicians, and staff. Furthermore, these tools have shown to be a potent carbon reduction strategy in the health sector which can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, several barriers still need to be overcome for a widespread use of eHealth solutions.

Randomly administered surveys were completed from December 2019CMarch 2020 before community lockdown (n = 474) and repeated in April 2020 during lockdown (n = 194). Nearly universal (95%) income decline occurred during the lockdown and led to 88% of households reporting food insecurity. During lockdown, a quarter of households (n = 17) using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), a cleaner cooking fuel typically available in pre-set quantities (e.g. 6 kg cylinders), switched to polluting cooking fuels (kerosene, wood), which could be purchased in smaller amounts or gathered for free. Household size increases during lockdown also led to participants altering their cooking fuel, and changing their cooking behaviors and foods consumed. Further, households more likely to switch away from LPG had lower consumption prior to lockdown and had suffered greater income loss, compared with households that continued to use LPG. Thus, inequities in clean cooking fuel access may have been exacerbated by COVID-19 lockdown. These findings demonstrate the complex relationship between household demographics, financial strain, diet and cooking patterns, and present the opportunity for a food-energy nexus approach to address multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): achieving zero hunger (SDG 2) and universal affordable, modern and clean energy access (SDG 7) by 2030.

Obesity is associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that human adipose tissue from multiple depots is permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and that infection elicits an inflammatory response, including the secretion of known inflammatory mediators of severe COVID-19. We identify two cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adipose tissue: mature adipocytes and adipose tissue macrophages. Adipose tissue macrophage infection is largely restricted to a highly inflammatory subpopulation of macrophages, present at baseline, that is further activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Preadipocytes, while not infected, adopt a proinflammatory phenotype. We further demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detectable in adipocytes in COVID-19 autopsy cases and is associated with an inflammatory infiltrate. Collectively, our findings indicate that adipose tissue supports SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenic inflammation and may explain the link between obesity and severe COVID-19.

Using a qualitative methodology, this study aims to explore why people in Germany and Switzerland were motivated to comply with policy measures during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and what factors hindered or limited their motivation. While quantitative surveys can measure the level of compliance, or broadly ask what motives people had for compliance, we here strive to explain why and how these motives lead to compliance. METHODS: This publication has been made possible by the joint work of the members of the \\"Solidarity in times of pandemics\\" (SolPan) research commons. Seventy-seven semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with members of the general public in Germany (n = 46) and the German-speaking part of Switzerland (n = 31) in April 2020. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed following a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Three themes were identified that summarize factors contributing to compliant or noncompliant behavior. (1) Social cohesion was, on the one hand, an important motivator for compliance, but at the same time related to conflicting needs, illustrating the limits of compliance. (2) Consequences were considered on both the individual level (eg, consequences of individual infection) and societal level (eg, the societal and economic consequences of restrictions). (3) While for some participants following the rules was perceived as a matter of principle, others stressed the importance of making their own risk assessment, which was often associated with with a need for evidence on the effectiveness and reasons behind measures.

Using high-frequency electricity monitoring from 491 houses and per-circuit monitoring and in-depth interviews with 17 households, the paper (1) compares changes in energy use before and during COVID-19 lockdown, (2) quantifies the key drivers of changes in energy use experienced by households during lockdown, and (3) tracks households interactions with energy use feedback. The findings identify significant increases in certain aspects of household electricity use directly related to COVID-19, including increased cooking and digital device use. Yet despite the government mandate requiring a large proportion of the population to remain at home, overall energy use among the majority of Queensland households monitored actually decreased during lockdown versus prior, driven primarily by a reduction in air conditioner use during lockdown as the weather cooled. Further, despite significant quantified and self-reported changes in energy use, users who had energy use feedback installed accessed their dashboards less during lockdown than they did prior.

METHODS This retrospective study involved 90 patients with anterior compartment prolapse who underwent pelvic organ prolapse surgery between January 2018 and October 2020. A TVM was used to treat 53 patients and 37 underwent NTR. All patients underwent a standardized interview, clinical examination, and four-dimensional pelvic floor ultrasound (PFUS) before and after the surgery. The primary outcome was anatomic recurrence evaluated by ultrasonic parameters. The secondary outcomes were subjective recurrence and complications. RESULTS Subjective recurrence was 9.43% (5/53) for TVM and 16.22% (6/37) for NTR (P = .522). Significant recurrence of prolapse on ultrasound occurred in five patients (9.43%) after TVM and 12 (32.43%) after NTR; there was a significant difference between the TVM and NTR groups (P = .006). In the TVM group, the mesh was visible on ultrasound in each patient. The mesh exposure rate was 1.89% (1/53). The postoperative hiatal area reduction in the TVM group, compared with the NTR group, was statistically significant (5.55  4.71 cm2 vs 3.09  5.61 cm2 , P = .027). The incidence of de novo stress urinary incontinence was higher in the TVM group (20.75% vs 2.70%, P = .03).

Electrical impedance values of emulsions obtained at different emulsification speeds were estimated according to the frequency response data with frequencies ranging from 1 MHz to 1 Hz. The equivalent circuit model of toluene-in-water emulsion was established by the resistor (RO/W) and capacitor (CO/W) in parallel connection. Nyquist diagrams for the emulsions prepared by toluene and water were characterized by the formation of one semi-circle. The droplet size distribution is one of the important factors that affect the stability of the emulsion, except for the volume fraction of water and oil, the size of stabilizing particles, etc. The average particle size of the emulsion droplets decreased as the emulsification speed increased, indicating the higher stability of the emulsion. It was found that the fitted impedance value RO/W of the emulsion decreased with decreasing particle size prepared at different emulsification speeds and storage time by performing real-time EIS detection techniques. The results suggested that EIS could be used to characterize the stability of a toluene-in-water emulsion stabilized by FcA modified silica nanoparticles.

These measures induced long confinement period that may have had an unintended negative impact on children's life behaviors and health. This study aimed to investigate the impact of behaviors related to COVID-19 confinement on body weight/BMI changes in children from Constantine, Algeria. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey based on children aged 5 to 12 years dwelling in any province of Constantine. Parents of children completed an online-distributed questionnaire at two time points (between April and May and anther time between 11th July and 10th august 2020). The questionnaire assessed sociodemographic information, anthropometric data, physical activity, dietary, eating habits, and other factors related to childrens lifestyle before and during lockdown. Paired before and during lockdown comparison for each lifestyle multiple statistic tests were performed to assess associations among before and during lockdown data. RESULTS: 275 questionnaires were completed (59.7%). Mean self-reported weight and BMI significantly increased by 1.43 kg and 0.84 kg/meter 2, respectively. Among the examined variables, increased unhealthy food consumption, snacks, number of daily meals taken, low physical activity and increased sedentary behaviors were significantly correlated with higher body weight gain (P < 0.005). These behaviors may not only have a significant impact on the development of childhood obesity but also on the deterioration of the mental state of the children surveyed. CONCLUSION: Restrictive measures during the COVID-19 lockdown, and home confinement, school closure makes children more vulnerable to environmental risks. Results from this study highlight the risk associated with a shift in eating habits, increased dietary intake, decreased physical activity, increased sedentary behaviors, and their impact in exacerbating the gain in body weight and BMI.

With the help of the proposed application, the user will be able to monitor his home through his mobile phone/tablet/PC. This method involves facial recognition by taking a real-time feed of the person at the door and then analysis of the live feed is carried out where the face recognised is authenticated with the data of owners in the database which matches the face to a name. Speech recognition has been used to doubly check the output of facial authentication. The entire process is carried out with the help of neural networks. If there's an unauthorized person at the door, an alert will be triggered and the owner will get a notification of this unauthorized access and would get to choose whether they want to add the person to their database or not. The overall accuracy of the proposed model is 82.71% with an accuracy of 87.5 % for Facial Authentication and 84.62 % for Speaker Authentication. Along with this, the main novelty for the research is to identify faces through masks which will help to properly verify the identity of the person and would prove to be beneficial not only in the current COVID-19 scenario but also in cases of thefts and burglaries by alerting the owner about the anomaly.

During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ease of access and transmission of information via social media has led to ambiguity, misinformation and uncertainty. This research studies the aforementioned behaviours of information sharing and verification related to COVID-19, in the context of social media. Design/methodology/approach: Two studies have been carried out. Study 1, with Indian social media users, is a two-factor between-subjects experimental design that investigated the effect of message polarity (positive versus negative) and message type (news versus rumour) on the dissemination and verification behaviour of COVID-19-related messages. The study also investigated the mediation of perceived message importance and health anxiety. Study 2 is a replica study conducted with US users. Findings: The study finding revealed significantly higher message sharing for news than rumour. Further, for the Indian users, message with positive polarity led to higher message sharing and message with negative polarity led to higher verification behaviour. On the contrary, for the US users, message with negative polarity led to higher message sharing and message with positive polarity led to higher verification behaviour. Finally, the study revealed message importance mediates the relationship of message type and message sharing behaviour for Indian and US users;however, health anxiety mediation was significant only for Indian users. Practical implications: The findings offer important implications related to information regulation during a health crisis. Unverified information sharing is harmful during a pandemic. The study sheds light on this behaviour such that stakeholders get insights and better manage the information being disseminated. Originality/value: The study investigates the behaviour of sharing and verification of social media messages between users containing health information (news and rumour) related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and CXR who were admitted at the university hospital was performed between March 25 and 30 April 2020. Baseline and serial CXRs were reviewed, along with onset and disease time courses. Correlations between CXR scores and CT scores, durations of symptoms and disease severity were evaluated;and also between regression times and disease severity. Results: Of 208 total patients, there were 33 mild (15.9%), 103 moderate (49.5%), and 72 severe-critical (34.6%) cases. The most frequent symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea. Dyspnea was more frequent in patients with severe and critical disease (p < 0.001). The duration of symptoms experienced prior to admission was longer in patients with severe and critical disease than in moderate cases (p < 0.05). Abnormalities on CXR were present on admission in 83.2% patients, with reticulations being the most common finding. CXR scores correlated with duration of symptoms prior to admission and CT scores (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). The median radiographic score of the severe-critical-type group was significantly higher than the moderate type (p < 0.001) and regression time correlated with disease severity (p < 0.001).

While the influenza virus is a known contributor to human morbidity and mortality, the question of how a coinfection between COVID-19 and influenza might manifest is of utmost concern. The aim of this study was to review the limited cases of COVID-19/influenza coinfection currently available in the literature, along with cases in the community of El Paso, TX, to determine whether any patterns of clinical presentation and morbidity emerged. An international review of the literature was conducted. Six published articles describing COVID-19/influenza coinfection were identified, with a total of 13 patients described therein. Three additional patients were identified from the El Paso, TX data. The most common presenting symptoms were fever and cough. The most common laboratory findings were elevated C-reactive protein and lymphocytopenia. Thirteen patients presented with viral pneumonia findings on CT, and nine had findings of ground-glass opacity. Finally, complications were reported in six patients, with most common complication being acute respiratory distress syndrome. The results of the review indicate that, due to the similarity in presentation between COVID-19 and influenza, further analysis will be required to understand the effects of coinfection on morbidity and mortality. However, the limited number of coinfection cases in the literature indicates that the implementation of COVID-19 control measures may continue to play a role in limiting the spread of these human respiratory pathogens.","output":"Are coinfections with COVID-19 and influenza low or underreported?

Fluvoxamine may prevent clinical deterioration by stimulating the &#963;-1 receptor, which regulates cytokine production. Objective: To determine whether fluvoxamine, given during mild COVID-19 illness, prevents clinical deterioration and decreases the severity of disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: Double-blind, randomized, fully remote (contactless) clinical trial of fluvoxamine vs placebo. Participants were community-living, nonhospitalized adults with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, with COVID-19 symptom onset within 7 days and oxygen saturation of 92% or greater. One hundred fifty-two participants were enrolled from the St Louis metropolitan area (Missouri and Illinois) from April 10, 2020, to August 5, 2020. The final date of follow-up was September 19, 2020. Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of fluvoxamine (n = 80) or placebo (n = 72) 3 times daily for 15 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was clinical deterioration within 15 days of randomization defined by meeting both criteria of (1) shortness of breath or hospitalization for shortness of breath or pneumonia and (2) oxygen saturation less than 92% on room air or need for supplemental oxygen to achieve oxygen saturation of 92% or greater. Results: Of 152 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 46 [13] years; 109 [72%] women), 115 (76%) completed the trial. Clinical deterioration occurred in 0 of 80 patients in the fluvoxamine group and in 6 of 72 patients in the placebo group (absolute difference, 8.7% [95% CI, 1.8%-16.4%] from survival analysis; log-rank P = .009).

Our models recapitulate this observation but suggest that vaccination with the updated-vaccine generates qualitatively different humoral immunity, a small fraction of which is specific for unique epitopes to the new variant.

Varicella zoster infection is almost universally prevalent, making prevention of acute herpes zoster (AHZ) infection and prompt diagnosis and aggressive management of PHN of critical importance. Despite the recent development of a herpes zoster vaccine, prevention of AHZ is not yet widespread or discussed in PHN treatment guidelines. Diagnosis of PHN requires consideration of recognized PHN signs and known risk factors, including advanced age, severe prodromal pain, severe rash, and AHZ location on the trigeminal dermatomes or brachial plexus. PHN pain is typically localized, unilateral and chronic, but may be constant, intermittent, spontaneous and/or evoked. PHN is likely to interfere with sleep and daily activities. First-line therapies for PHN include tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin and pregabalin, and the lidocaine 5 % patch. Second-line therapies include strong and weak opioids and topical capsaicin cream or 8 % patch. Tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentinoids and strong opioids are effective but are also associated with systemic adverse events that may limit their use in many patients, most notably those with significant medical comorbidities or advanced age. Of the topical therapies, the topical lidocaine 5 % patch has proven more effective than capsaicin cream or 8 % patch and has a more rapid onset of action than the other first-line therapies or capsaicin. Given the low systemic drug exposure, adverse events with topical therapies are generally limited to application-site reactions, which are typically mild and transient with lidocaine 5 % patch, but may involve treatment-limiting discomfort with capsaicin cream or 8 % patch. Based on available clinical data, clinicians should consider administering the herpes zoster vaccine to all patients aged 60 years and older. Clinicians treating patients with PHN may consider a trial of lidocaine 5 % patch monotherapy before resorting to a systemic therapy, or alternatively, may consider administering the lidocaine 5 % patch in combination with a tricyclic antidepressant or a gabapentinoid to provide more rapid analgesic response and lower the dose requirement of systemic therapies.","output":"Diagnosing and managing postherpetic neuralgia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim and Objectives: The current study was undertaken to assess the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on cochlear implant rehabilitation of children with congenital nonsyndromic bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).

We estimate the effectiveness this travel ban using a customized agent-based simulation (ABS). Methods: We built an individual-level ABS to simulate the movements and behaviors of every member of the NL population, including arriving and departing travellers. The model considers individual properties (spatial location, age, comorbidities) and movements between environments, as well as age-based disease transmission with pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic transmission rates. We examine low, medium, and high travel volume, traveller infection rates, and traveller quarantine compliance rates to determine the effect of travellers on COVID spread, and the ability of contact tracing to contain outbreaks. Results: Infected travellers increased COVID cases by 4-74x times and peak hospitalizations by 4-96x, without contact tracing. Although contact tracing was highly effective at reducing spread, it was insufficient to stop outbreaks caused by travellers in even the best-case scenario, and the likelihood of exceeding contact tracing capacity was a concern in most scenarios. Quarantine compliance had only a small impact on COVID spread; travel volume and infection rate drove spread. Interpretation: NL's travel ban was likely a critically important intervention to prevent COVID spread. Even a small number of infected travellers can play a significant role in introducing new chains of transmission, resulting in exponential community spread and significant increases in hospitalizations, while outpacing contact tracing capabilities.

For many aspects of global health there is a dearth of research, yet evidence is urgently needed to address major challenges. Obtaining such data within a meaningful timeframe requires a fundamental change in the planning and setting up of research studies. Typically, protocols are developed in closed groups and often never shared. However, many operational processes in research are generic, irrespective of the disease or design. Thus, removal of duplication and sharing methods could speed up research. This research methodology project investigates whether researchers can be persuaded to share methods and if this will streamline research. Methods The theory of communities of practice (in which distinct specialists working on a problem collaborate to solve it) guided this project. The Global Health Network was created to enable communities of practice to form to develop protocols, exchange research instruments, and share skills. We measured uptake, effect, and benefit of the Network through surveys, questionnaires, interviews with target audiences (research teams in low-income and middle-income countries), and analysis of digital access. Findings Since 2011, more than 60 000 researchers, nurses, technicians, and scientists from almost all low-income and middle-income countries have used the project to share research methods, knowledge, and processes. 21 specialised communities of practice have formed collaborations that are actively exchanging methods. More than 250 research guidance notes have been shared that provide specific guidance for various research methodseg, an international respiratory disease network has released three open-access novel coronavirus protocols and groups working in maternal health are listing the samples they have stored with the invitation for others to collaborate. These qualitative and quantitative data show that these exchanges are highly beneficial for guiding and improving research operations, and that there is a willingness to share. Interpretation Scientists compete for funding and publication and therefore sharing methods and knowledge can be perceived as disadvantageous. However, if use of protocols and methods developed by wide and open consensus can help to quickly gain high quality data, then better progress could be made for all and disease research could be changed to improve health.

Data were obtained from medical records regarding age, gender, clinical presentation, and management. RESULTS: Out of 67 cases of pediatric stridor, 28.3% were infants, 50.7% were between 1 to 5 y, while 20.9% were between 5 to 18 y. Foreign body trachea (FB) was the most common (38.8%) cause of stridor. The commonest cause of stridor among infants was laryngomalacia (47.4%) while FB trachea (55.9%) was the commonest cause among 1 to 5 y age group. In age group between 5 to 18 y, peritonsillar abscess and bacterial tracheitis (21.4% each) were found to be the most common. Primary management with securing of airways were done in all cases. Curative treatment was provided according to the underlying pathology. Eight patients (11.9%) required tracheostomy to bypass airway obstruction. There was no mortality in the present study population. CONCLUSION: Pediatric stridor management is a teamwork between ENT surgeons, pediatricians, and anaesthetists.

Triage protocols have been proposed incorporating the exclusion of specified subgroups of patients from critical care. There have been no studies that explore the theoretical underpinning of triage at referral, and it is not clear under what circumstances triage would confer the intended benefits. We sought to explore the mechanisms whereby triage could lead to fewer deaths across a critical care population in the context of a pandemic. DESIGN We constructed a mathematical model based on queuing theory to compare the estimated short-term survival achieved by using a critical care service with and without triage at referral. Illustrative scenarios concerning a hypothetical critical care population were constructed to explore the roles of length of stay and critical care survival in determining the impact of triage and to identify \\"tipping points\\" of demand at which triage would result in more survivors. SETTING Not applicable as this was a data-free mathematical modeling exercise. MAIN RESULTS We identified circumstances in which triage would be expected to result in more survivors and circumstances in which it would not. In some scenarios, excluding patient groups solely on the basis of anticipated length of stay could be effective due to a more efficient use of critical care bed days. CONCLUSIONS The impact of triage is dependent on the level of demand and on the scale of achievable differences between included and excluded groups in terms of anticipated length of stay and critical care survival. It cannot be assumed that triage can or will result in fewer deaths. It should be remembered that there are considerations other than population-level short-term survival when determining the objectives of triage and its ethical implementation.","output":"Does triage to critical care during a pandemic necessarily result in more survivors?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prostate cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death among men.

Considering recent reports indicating an increase in alcohol use particularly in females, it is vital to understand how alcohol history impacts behavior. Animal model research on withdrawal-associated affective states tends to focus on males, forced alcohol paradigms, and a few traditional anxiety/stress tests. While this has been essential, heavy alcohol use triggers adverse withdrawal-related affective states that can influence how people respond to a large variety of life events and stressors. To this end, we show that behaviors in the home-cage, open field, looming disc, and robogator predator threat task, which vary in task demand and intensity, are altered in mice with a history of voluntary alcohol consumption. In alcohol-exposed males, behaviors in the home cage, a low anxiety baseline environment, suggest increased vigilance/exploration. However, in the open field and robogator task, which induce heightened arousal and task demands, a more hesitant/avoidant phenotype is seen. Female alcohol mice show no behavioral alterations in the home cage and open field test, however, in the looming disc task, which mimics an overhead advancing predator and forces a behavioral choice, we see greater escape responses compared to water controls, indicative of active stress coping behaviors. This suggests females may begin to show alcohol-induced alterations as task demands increase. To date, few drugs have advanced past clinical trials for the treatment of AUD, and those that have are predominately used in life-threatening situations only. No treatments exist for ameliorating negative withdrawal related states, which could aid in harm reduction related to heavy alcohol use.

Here, we established an in silico pipeline to analyze high-throughput methylome datasets to identify specific methylation fingerprints in three pathological entities of major burden, i.e., breast cancer (BrCa), osteoarthritis (OA) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Differential methylation analysis was conducted to compare tissues/cells related to the pathology and different types of healthy tissues, revealing Differentially Methylated Genes (DMGs). Highly performing and low feature number biosignatures were built with automated machine learning, including: (1) a five-gene biosignature discriminating BrCa tissue from healthy tissues (AUC 0.987 and precision 0.987), (2) three equivalent OA cartilage-specific biosignatures containing four genes each (AUC 0.978 and precision 0.986) and (3) a four-gene pancreatic -cell-specific biosignature (AUC 0.984 and precision 0.995). Next, the BrCa biosignature was validated using an independent ccfDNA dataset showing an AUC and precision of 1.000, verifying the biosignatures applicability in liquid biopsy. Functional and protein interaction prediction analysis revealed that most DMGs identified are involved in pathways known to be related to the studied diseases or pointed to new ones.

Seventy-three eyes with axial length (AL)  29.0 mm and underwent phacoemulsification cataract surgery with Rayner (Hove, UK) 920H IOL implantation from January 2018 to March 2020 were included. Prediction errors (PE) were calculated and compared between different formulas to evaluate the accuracy of formulas. Multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate factors associated with the PE. RESULTS: The Kane formula had mean prediction error close to zero (C 0.01  0.51 D, P = 0.841), whereas the EVO 2.0, SRK/T, Barrett Universal II, Haigis and Olsen formulas produced hyperopic outcomes (all P < 0.001).

The enhancement of SOT efficiency and reduction of power consumption are key points for the implementation of high-performance SOT devices, which strongly rely on the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength and magnetic properties of ferromagnetic/non-magnetic heterostructures. Recently, van der Waals-layered materials have shown appealing properties for use in efficient SOT applications. On the one hand, transition-metal dichalcogenides, topological insulators, and graphene-based heterostructures possess appreciable SOC strength. This feature can efficiently converse the charge current into spin current and result in large SOT. On the other hand, the newly discovered layered magnetic materials provide ultra-thin and gate-tunable ferromagnetic candidates for high-performance SOT devices. In this review, the latest advancements of SOT research in various layered materials are summarized. First, a brief introduction of SOT is given. Second, SOT studies of various layered materials and heterostructures are summarized. Subsequently, progresses on SOT-induced magnetization switching are presented. Finally, current challenges and prospects for future development are suggested.","output":"Spin-Orbit Torque in Van der Waals-Layered Materials and Heterostructures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Globally, one in four children lives in a country affected by armed conflict or disaster often accompanied by exposure to a range of adversities including violent trauma and loss. Children involved with armed groups (often referred to as child soldiers) typically exhibit high levels of mental health needs linked to their experiences. The Longitudinal Study of War-Affected Youth (LSWAY) in Sierra Leone is a seventeen-year prospective longitudinal study of the long-term effects of childrens experiences in the countrys eleven-year (1991C2002) civil war on their adult mental health and functioning in addition to exploring the potential mechanisms by which intergenerational transmission of emotional and behavioral disruptions due to war trauma may operate. LSWAY illuminates how war-related and post-conflict experiences shape long-term adult functioning, family dynamics, and developmental outcomes in offspring. DISCUSSION: The LSWAY study utilizes mixed methodologies that incorporate qualitative and quantitative data to unpack risk and protective factors involved in social reintegration, psychosocial adjustment, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. To date, study findings demonstrate striking levels of persistent mental health problems among former child soldiers as adults with consequences for their families, but also risk and protective patterns that involve family- and community-level factors. This case study examines the course of LSWAY from inception through implementation and dissemination, including building on the study results to design and evaluate several intervention models. CONCLUSION: The case study offers a unique perspective on challenges and field realities of health research in a fragile, post-conflict setting common in the context of humanitarian emergencies. LSWAY findings along with lessons learned from the field can inform future research as well as intervention research and implementation science to address the mental health and development of war-affected young people. With four waves of data collection and a planned fifth wave, LSWAY also provides rare insights into the intergenerational effects of humanitarian crises on children, youth, and families across generations.","output":"The intergenerational impact of war on mental health and psychosocial wellbeing: lessons from the longitudinal study of war-affected youth in Sierra Leone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biointerfaces are regions where biomolecules, cells, and organic materials are exposed to environmental media or come in contact with other biomaterials, cells, and inorganic/organic materials. In this review article, six research topics on biointerfaces are described to show examples of state-of-art research approaches. First, biointerface design of nanoparticles for molecular detection is described. Functionalized gold nanoparticles can be used for sensitive detection of various target molecules, including chemical compounds and biomolecules, such as DNA, proteins, cells, and viruses. Second, the interaction between bacterial cell surfaces and material surfaces, including the introduction of advances in analytical methods and theoretical calculations, are explained as well as their applications to bioprocesses. Third, bioconjugation technologies for localizing functional proteins at biointerfaces are introduced, in particular, by focusing the potential of enzymes as a catalytic tool for designing different types of bioconjugates that function at biointerfaces. Forth topics is focusing on lipid-protein interaction in cell membranes as natural biointerfaces. Examples of membrane lipid engineering are introduced, and it is mentioned how their compositional profiles affect membrane protein functions. Fifth topic is the physical method for molecular delivery across the biointerface being developed currently, such as highly efficient nanoinjection, electroporation, and nanoneedle devices, in which the key is how to perforate the cell membrane. Final topic is the chemical design of lipid- or polymer-based RNA delivery carriers and their behavior on the cell interface, which are currently attracting attention as RNA vaccine technologies targeting COVID-19.

So far COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and modes of death under state of the art care have not been systematically studied. METHODS: This retrospective observational monocenter cohort study was performed after implementation of a non-restricted, dynamic tertiary care model at the University Medical Center Freiburg, an experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation (ECMO) referral center. All hospitalised patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, secondary endpoints included major complications and modes of death. A multistate analysis and a Cox regression analysis for competing risk models were performed. Modes of death were determined by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Between February 25, and May 8, 213 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 65 years, 129 patients (61%) were male. 70 patients (33%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 57 patients (81%) received mechanical ventilation and 23 patients (33%) ECMO support. Using multistate methodology, the estimated probability to die within 90 days after COVID-19 onset was 24% in the whole cohort. If the levels of care at time of study entry were accounted for, the probabilities to die were 16% if the patient was initially on a regular ward, 47% if in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 57% if mechanical ventilation was required at study entry. Age &#8805;65 years and male sex were predictors for in-hospital death. Predominant complications-as judged by two independent reviewers-determining modes of death were multi-organ failure, septic shock and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications. CONCLUSION: In a dynamic care model COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality remained very high. In the absence of potent antiviral agents, strategies to alleviate or prevent the identified complications should be investigated. In this context, multistate analyses enable comparison of models-of-care and treatment strategies and allow estimation and allocation of health care resources.","output":"COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and mode of death in a dynamic and non-restricted tertiary care model in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although chilblain\\\\like lesions (CLL) or pseudoperniosis (PP) in association with acute COVID\\\\19 infection is a well\\\\described phenomenon, frequently lasting 12\\\\15 days and usually resolving with no long\\\\term sequelae, a number of patients with delayed or late\\\\onset, protracted, Covid\\\\related PP of varying severity have recently been encountered.

The sequence of each of the 17 satRNAs was unique and was between 334 and 340 nucleotides in length; 57 positions were polymorphic. There was much genetic divergence, ranging from 0.006 to 0.141 nucleotide substitutions per site for pairwise comparisons, and averaging 0.074 for any pair. When the polymorphic positions were analyzed relative to a secondary structure model proposed for CMV-satRNAs, it was found that there were significantly different numbers of changes in base-paired and nonCbase-paired positions, and that mutations that did not disrupt base pairing were preferred at the putatively paired sites. This supports the concept that the need to maintain a functional structure may limit genetic divergence of CMV-satRNA. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the 17 CMV-satRNA variants clustered into two subgroups, I and II, and evolutionary lines proceeding by the sequential accumulation of mutations were apparent. Three satRNA variants were outliers for these two phylogenetic groups. They were shown to be recombinants of subgroup I and II satRNAs by calculating phylogenies for different molecular regions and by using Sawyer's test for gene conversion. At least two recombination events were required to produce these three recombinant satRNAs. Thus, recombinants were found to be frequent (17%) in natural populations of CMV-satRNA, and recombination may make an important contribution to the generation of new variants. To our knowledge this is the first report of data allowing the frequency of recombinant isolates in natural populations of an RNA replicon to be estimated.","output":"Contribution of Mutation and RNA Recombination to the Evolution of a Plant Pathogenic RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the first COVID-19 epidemic wave raised concerns about its safety. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS All the adverse reactions (ADR) suspected to be induced by HCQ and submitted to the Spanish Pharmacovigilance Database were studied. A disproportionality analysis was performed to determine adverse effects reported with non-Covid and Covid patients. To explore potential drug-drug interactions, Omega () statistics was calculated. RESULTS More severe cases were reported when used in COVID-19. Main differences in frequency were observed in hepatobiliary, skin, gastrointestinal, eye, nervous system and heart ADRs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, high disproportionality in reports was found for Torsade de Pointes/QT prolongation with a ROR (-ROR) of 132.8 (76.7); severe hepatotoxicity, 18.7 (14.7); dyslipidaemias, 12.1 (6.1); shock, 9.5 (6.9) and ischaemic colitis, 8.9 (2.6). Myopathies, haemolytic disorders and suicidal behaviour increased their disproportionality during the pandemic. Disproportionality was observed for neoplasms, haematopoietic cytopaenias and interstitial lung disease in the pre-COVID-19 period. Potential interactions were showed between HCQ and azithromycin, ceftriaxone, lopinavir and tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS The way in which HCQ has been used during the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a change in the profile of spontaneous reporting HCQ-related ADR in Spain. Of particular concern during the pandemic were arrhythmias, hepatotoxicity, severe skin reactions and suicide risk, but not ocular disorders.

In February and March 2020, we explored the somatic symptoms and concerns regarding COVID-19 of 399 college and primary school students in Sichuan Province using the Somatic Self-rating Scale (SSS) and a novel questionnaire, respectively. Logistic regression analysis and non-parametric tests were used to analyze the data. The incidence of somatic symptoms among college students was 34.85 (mild, 26.26%; moderate, 8.59%). The incidence of somatic symptoms in primary school students was 2.39% (all mild). Among the entire cohort, concern regarding COVID-19 was positively correlated with the occurrence of somatic symptoms. Somatic symptoms were more likely among college students expressing greater concern regarding the threat to life and health posed by COVID-19, and the efficacy of prevention and control measures. Among primary school students, only the concern for life and health was associated with a higher likelihood of somatic symptoms.

To test this, we integrated 4,780 blood transcriptome profiles from patients aged 0 to 90 years infected with one of 16 viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, chikungunya, and influenza, across 34 cohorts from 18 countries, and single-cell RNA sequencing profiles of 702,970 immune cells from 289 samples across three cohorts. Severe viral infection was associated with increased hematopoiesis, myelopoiesis, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. We identified protective and detrimental gene modules that defined distinct trajectories associated with mild versus severe outcomes. The interferon response was decoupled from the protective host response in patients with severe outcomes. These findings were consistent, irrespective of age and virus, and provide insights to accelerate the development of diagnostics and host-directed therapies to improve global pandemic preparedness.","output":"Multi-cohort analysis of host immune response identifies conserved protective and detrimental modules associated with severity across viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveWorldwide countries are experiencing viral load in their population, leading to potential infectivity of asymptomatic COVID-19.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with COVID-19 discharged from two EDs. Return hospital admission was defined as an unscheduled return ED visit within 14 days after initial ED evaluation and discharge. We compared the group of patients who had a return hospital admission to those who did not. We also evaluated selected clinical characteristics (age, neutrophilia, SOFA, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein and D-dimer) associated with return hospital admission. RESULTS: Of 283 patients included in the study, 65 (22.9%) had a return ED visit within 14 days. 32 of those patients (11%) were then hospitalized, while the remaining 33 were again discharged. Patients requiring a return hospital admission was significantly older, had higher pro-calcitonin and D-dimer levels. Major predictors of return hospital admission were cognitive impairment (OR 17.3 [CI 4.7-63.2]), P/F < 300 mmHg (OR 8.6 [CI 1.6-44.3]), being resident in geriatric care facility (OR 7.6 [CI 2.1-26.4]) and neutrophilia (OR 5.8 [CI 1.6-22.0]).

Online therapy and tele-consultation have its strengths as well as challenges including flexibility in scheduling, convenience, saving time from commuting to and from appointments, enhancing vulnerability and disclosure. However, it has its own set of challenges and ethical concerns, particularly revolving around privacy and confidentiality in the digital space. This symposium will highlight the strengths and challenges of telemental health based on empirical researches and personal experiences of psychotherapists and psychiatrists. With increasing onus over the providers, it becomes important to discuss and address the new demands. It will enable the mental health practitioners to be more equipped and competent to continue offering telehealth as demand for mental health services grows, particularly services offered virtually. Finally, the symposium glances at the future of tele mental healthcare in the light of the recent guidelines and what it possibly holds for service providers.","output":"Tele-mental Healthcare as the New Normal: Revisiting the Nuances"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The digital revolution is rapidly transforming health care and clinical teaching and learning. Relative to other medical fields, the interdisciplinary fields of speech-language pathology (SLP), phoniatrics, and otolaryngology have been slower to take up digital tools for therapeutic, teaching, and learning purposesa process that was recently expedited by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many current teaching and learning tools have restricted or institution-only access, there are many openly accessible tools that have gone largely unexplored. To find, use, and evaluate such resources, it is important to be familiar with the structures, concepts, and formats of existing digital tools. OBJECTIVE: This descriptive study aims to investigate digital learning tools and resources in SLP, phoniatrics, and otolaryngology. Differences in content, learning goals, and digital formats between academic-level learners and clinical-professional learners are explored. METHODS: A systematic search of generic and academic search engines (eg, Google and PubMed); the App Store; Google Play Store; and websites of established SLP, phoniatrics, and otolaryngology organizations was conducted. By using specific search terms and detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria, relevant digital resources were identified. These were organized and analyzed according to learner groups, content matter, learning goals and architectures, and digital formats. RESULTS: Within- and between-learner group differences among 125 identified tools were investigated. In terms of content, the largest proportion of tools for academic-level learners pertained to anatomy and physiology (60/214, 28%), and that for clinical-professional learners pertained to diagnostic evaluation (47/185, 25.4%). Between groups, the largest differences were observed for anatomy and physiology (academic-level learners: 60/86, 70%; clinical-professional learners: 26/86, 30%) and professional issues (8/28, 29% vs 20/28, 71%). With regard to learning goals, most tools for academic-level learners targeted the performance of procedural skills (50/98, 51%), and those for clinical-professional learners targeted receptive information acquisition (44/62, 71%). Academic-level learners had more tools for supporting higher-level learning goals than clinical-professional learners, specifically tools for performing procedural skills (50/66, 76% vs 16/66, 24%) and strategic skills (8/10, 80% vs 2/10, 20%). Visual formats (eg, pictures or diagrams) were dominant across both learner groups. The greatest between-group differences were observed for interactive formats (45/66, 68% vs 21/66, 32%). CONCLUSIONS: This investigation provides initial insights into openly accessible tools across SLP, phoniatrics, and otolaryngology and their organizing structures. Digital tools in these fields addressed diverse content, although the tools for academic-level learners were greater in number, targeted higher-level learning goals, and had more interactive formats than those for clinical-professional learners. The crucial next steps include investigating the actual use of such tools in practice and students and professionals attitudes to better improve upon such tools and incorporate them into current and future learning milieus.","output":"Digital Learning in Speech-Language Pathology, Phoniatrics, and Otolaryngology: Interdisciplinary and Exploratory Analysis of Content, Organizing Structures, and Formats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The second wave of the coronavirus pandemic is now established, occurring at a time of winter pressure on acute care in the NHS. This is likely to be more challenging then the first wave for the diagnosis of COVID-19 because of the similar symptomology with other respiratory conditions highly prevalent in winter. This study sought to understand the care pathways in place in UK NHS hospitals during the first wave (March-July 2020) for identification of patients with COVID-19 and to learn lessons to inform optimal testing strategies within the COVID-19 National Diagnostic Research and Evaluation Platform (CONDOR). DESIGN, SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen hospital-based clinicians from 12 UK NHS Trusts covering 10 different specialties were interviewed following a semi-structured topic guide. Data were coded soon after the interviews and analysed thematically. RESULTS: We developed a diagrammatic, high-level visualisation of the care pathway describing the main clinical decisions associated with the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected COVID-19. COVID-19 testing influenced infection control considerations more so than treatment decisions. Two main features of service provision influenced the patient management significantly: access to rapid laboratory testing and the number of single occupancy rooms. If time to return of result was greater than 24 h, patients with a presumptive diagnosis would often be cohorted based on clinical suspicion alone. Undetected COVID-19 during this time could therefore lead to an increased risk of viral transmission. CONCLUSIONS: During the winter months, priority for provision of rapid testing at admission should be given to hospitals with limited access to laboratory services and single room availability. Access to rapid testing is essential for urgent decisions related to emergency surgery, maternity services and organ transplant. The pathway and prioritization of need will inform the economic modelling, clinical evaluations, and implementation of new clinical tests in UK.","output":"Care pathway and prioritization of rapid testing for COVID-19 in UK hospitals: a qualitative evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relevant energy questions have arisen because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic shock leads to emissions reductions consistent with the rates of decrease required to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. Those unforeseen drastic reductions in emissions are temporary as long as they do not involve structural changes. However, the COVID-19 consequences and the subsequent policy response will affect the economy for decades. Focusing on the EU, this discussion article argues how recovery plans are an opportunity to deepen the way towards a low-carbon economy, improving at the same time employment, health, and equity and the role of modelling tools. Long-term alignment with the low-carbon path and the development of a resilient transition towards renewable sources should guide instruments and policies, conditioning aid to energy-intensive sectors such as transport, tourism, and the automotive industry. However, the potential dangers of short-termism and carbon leakage persist. The current energy-socio-economic-environmental modelling tools are precious to widen the scope and deal with these complex problems. The scientific community has to assess disparate, non-equilibrium, and non-ordinary scenarios, such as sectors and countries lockdowns, drastic changes in consumption patterns, significant investments in renewable energies, and disruptive technologies and incorporate uncertainty analysis. All these instruments will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of decarbonization options and potential consequences on employment, income distribution, and vulnerability.","output":"Energy-socio-economic-environmental modelling for the EU energy and post-COVID-19 transitions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present in silico viral genetics study, a mathematical method was developed for the comparison of RNA sequences The mathematical method used was to explore component similarities and patch them together with a modern geometric statistical projection method called multidimensional scaling (MDS) The comparison looked into similarities between 300 nucleotides (NT) of 7SL RNA and size 300 NT sub-sequences of SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA RN7SL2 and RN7SL3 were also compared with SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA In the component comparison, use was made of a He Hamiltonian model for the approximation of the density distribution of the outer two electrons This was considered a basic ingredient of similarity Improvements can be implemented later on With MDS it is possible to blend theoretical with experimentally obtained characteristics of components Furthermore, complementarity was employed to derive a numerical representation of the formation of RNA knots With the use of crystallographic and electron microscopic coordinate data sets, we aimed to study a more geometric structure of comparing RNA with RNA and RNA with SRP9/14 protein We found reason to believe that subsequences of the S2 SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA around position NT = 3620, can possibly behave similar to 7SLRNA The latter can form parasitic Alu DNA The hypothesis is drawn that under conditions where e g broken DNA occurs and RNA dependent DNA polymerase is present these RNA subsequences can, because of similar affinity to SRP9/14, be transformed into transposons and become a DNA parasite","output":"Approximative He Hamiltonian in descriptive multidimensional scaling statistics of RNA contained information with application to SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA and 7SLRNA, RN7SL2 and RN7SL3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Initial studies from Wuhan, China reported patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have uncontrolled coagulopathy and an increased risk for thrombotic complications, including pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and arterial thrombosis.1 The incidence of thrombosis attributed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranged from 9.5% in all hospital-admitted patients to 31% in the critically ill.2,3 COVID-19 has had a major impact on the Chicago metropolitan area with over 121,000 confirmed cases as of August 2020, Cook county being the 4th highest affected county after Maricopa, Miami-Dade and Los Angeles counties.4 The primary goal of this study is to describe the rate of thrombotic events in the Chicago metropolitan area, highlighting an ethnically diverse population, and identify new risk factors for thrombosis between three university health systems. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis between three university health systems in the Chicago metropolitan area: Loyola University Health System (LUHS): comprised of one tertiary and two community hospitals, Rush University System for Health (RUSH): comprised of one tertiary and two community hospitals, and University of Illinois-Chicago (UIC): a tertiary hospital. All patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 testing and were hospitalized for COVID-19. PE, DVT or arterial thrombosis were confirmed by supportive imaging modalities. Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to test the associations of continuous variables; Chi-square test or Fishers exact test were used to test the associations of categorical variables. All analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 and two-sided p-value < .05 were deemed statistically significant. Results: Between March and May 2020, 2,180 patients from LUHS, RUSH and UIC were hospitalized for COVID-19 and were included in our analysis. Baseline patient demographics are described in Table 1. Race/ethnicity demographics are as follows: Hispanics (H)/ African Americans (AA) represented 47%/17% of LUHS patients, 32%/42% of RUSH patients, and 36%/51% of UIC patients, respectively (Figure 1). Intensive care admissions were needed in 33% of all patients. Documented total thrombotic events are as follows: LUHS = 5.4% (41 VTE/PE, 10 arterial and 5 with both venous and arterial); RUSH = 9.7% (70 VTE/PE, 7 arterial and 4 with both venous/arterial); UIC = 6% (14 VTE/PE, 4 arterial and 0 with both venous/arterial). Patients that developed a thrombotic event were similar by age, sex, and BMI to those without a thrombotic event. Anticoagulation prophylaxis was given to 82% of pts at LUHS and UIC at time of admission. Collectively, those with thrombotic events (N=156) had higher incidence of intensive care admission, elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and a d-dimer >5X upper limit normal (ULN) at presentation. Furthermore, a higher proportion of pts that had a thrombotic event were diabetic at LUHS and RUSH (Table 2). Mortality in COVID-19 patients was 13-16% and patients that had a thrombotic event had a higher risk of death in the RUSH and UIC cohorts. Conclusions: In a racially diverse, multi-institutional cohort of patients, we demonstrate that 7.2% of COVID-19 patients had a thrombotic event. Consistent risk factors for thrombosis across the different centers included an initial d-dimer levels >5X ULN, elevated initial WBC count, diabetes, and being critically ill. Mortality differences and anticoagulation practices between the institutions as well as race/ethnicity differences regarding thrombosis will be explored in future combined multivariate analyses. Finally, based off these risk factors, identification of patients at most risk for thrombosis is needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality when diagnosed with COVID-19. References -Tang et. al.

The ongoing debate highlights the challenges of the adoption of data-driven innovation. We reflect on how to ensure an appropriate level of protection of individual data and how to maximize public health benefits that can be derived from the collected data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze available COVID-19 contact tracing apps and verify to what extent public health interests and data privacy standards can be fulfilled simultaneously in the process of the adoption of digital health technologies. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed and MEDLINE databases, as well as grey literature, was performed to identify available contact tracing apps. Two checklists were developed to evaluate (1) the apps' compliance with data privacy standards and (2) their fulfillment of public health interests. Based on both checklists, a scorecard with a selected set of minimum requirements was created with the goal of estimating whether the balance between the objective of data privacy and public health interests can be achieved in order to ensure the broad adoption of digital technologies. RESULTS: Overall, 21 contact tracing apps were reviewed. In total, 11 criteria were defined to assess the usefulness of each digital technology for public health interests. The most frequently installed features related to contact alerting and governmental accountability. The least frequently installed feature was the availability of a system of medical or organizational support. Only 1 app out of 21 (5%) provided a threshold for the population coverage needed for the digital solution to be effective. In total, 12 criteria were used to assess the compliance of contact tracing apps with data privacy regulations. Explicit user consent, voluntary use, and anonymization techniques were among the most frequently fulfilled criteria. The least often implemented criteria were provisions of information about personal data breaches and data gathered from children. The balance between standards of data protection and public health benefits was achieved best by the COVIDSafe app and worst by the Alipay Health Code app. CONCLUSIONS: Contact tracing apps with high levels of compliance with standards of data privacy tend to fulfill public health interests to a limited extent. Simultaneously, digital technologies with a lower level of data privacy protection allow for the collection of more data. Overall, this review shows that a consistent number of apps appear to comply with standards of data privacy, while their usefulness from a public health perspective can still be maximized.","output":"State of the Art in Adoption of Contact Tracing Apps and Recommendations Regarding Privacy Protection and Public Health: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children have reduced severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rates and a substantially lower risk for developing severe coronavirus disease 2019 compared with adults.

Pulmonary embolism as well as microembolization of vital organs may in these individuals be direct causes of death. The identification of patients at high risk of developing thrombosis may lead to targeted, more effective prophylactic treatment. The primary aim of this study was to test whether rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) at admission indicates hypercoagulopathy and predicts the disease severity, assessed as care level, in COVID-19 patients. The study was designed as a prospective, observational study where COVID-19 patients over 18 years admitted to hospital were eligible for inclusion. Patients were divided into two groups depending on care level: (1) regular wards or (2) wards with specialized ventilation support. Conventional coagulation tests, blood type and ROTEM were taken at admission. 60 patients were included; age 61 (median), 67% men, many with comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, diabetes). The ROTEM variables Maximum Clot Firmness (EXTEM-/FIBTEM-MCF) were higher in COVID-19 patients compared with in healthy controls (p < 0.001) and higher in severely ill patients compared with in patients at regular wards (p < 0.05).

Before the LSG and 6 and 12 months after the LSG, we evaluated the aggregation index (AI), amplitude (AMP) and aggregation half-time (t1/2), plasma viscosity, fibrinogen, glucose and lipids patterns in 15 non-diabetic obese subjects. RESULTS The static and kinetic parameters of aggregation in obese patients at each time point after bariatric weight loss surgery were calculated and significant differences were observed at 12 months after surgery. AI and AMP decreased from 69.815.12% and 27.432.9 a.u. at baseline to 64.915.94% and 22.154.3 a.u. 12 months after surgery, respectively. The t1/2 increased from 1.7 (1.32-2.24) s at baseline compared with 2.02 (1.68-2.42) s at 12 months after the surgery. Plasma viscosity and fibrinogen decreased from 1.500.093 mPa s and 3.00.41 g l(-1) at baseline to 1.4070.062 mPa s and to 2.660.25 g l(-1) 12 months after surgery, respectively.

Additionally, developments such as climate change, settlement expansion into flood-prone areas, and modification of rivers are expected to increase flood risk in the future. Policy documents have issued calls for conducting local risk assessments and understanding disaster risk in diverse aspects, leading to an increase in such research. Similarly, in a shift from flood protection to flood risk management, the consideration of various dimensions of flood risk, the necessity of addressing flood risk through an integrated strategy containing structural and non-structural measures, and the presence of residual risk are critical perspectives raised. However, the notion of residual risk remains yet to be taken up in flood risk management-related academic literature. This systematic review seeks to approach the notion of residual risk by reviewing information on flood impacts, common measures, and recommendations in academic literature. The review reveals various dimensions of impacts from residual flood risk aside from material damage, in particular, health impacts and economic losses. Infrastructural measures were a dominant category of measures before and after flood events and in recommendations, despite their shortcomings. Also, spatial planning interventions, a more participatory and inclusive governance approach, including local knowledge, sensitisation, and early warning systems, were deemed critical.

The purpose of this study was to determine the number and topics of systematic overviews on the effectiveness of orthopaedic interventions. Methods We performed a review of PubMed, Ovid Embase, Scopus, OrthoEvidence, and the Cochrane Library for dates of publication from January 1, 2006, to February 3, 2017, to identify systematic overviews of randomized clinical trials for the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions involving orthopaedic surgeons. Abstracts were excluded based on the following sequentially applied criteria: (1) the systematic review did not include an intervention for an orthopaedic condition; the intervention was not therapeutic; the intervention was not likely to be applied or influenced by an orthopaedic surgeon; (2) the study was not a systematic review or the study was a single randomized controlled trial, and/or it included nonhuman studies; (3) the systematic review included nonrandomized studies; and (4) the systematic review did not state moderate or strong evidence in support of the study conclusion(s). Results Of the 6,864 abstracts found in the searches, 6,145 were excluded yielding 719 systematic overviews. Contrary to conventional wisdom, this study identified 719 reviews of randomized controlled trials of therapeutic orthopaedic interventions. The interventions were classified as surgical in 383 (55%), medication in 245 (34%), and rehabilitation in 42 (6%), and other nonsurgical interventions in 39 (5%). Discussion This study identified many systematic overviews of orthopaedic interventions.

An effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is still unavailable. Therefore, in this study, we have tried to predict a list of potential inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) using a combination of molecular docking and fast pulling of ligand (FPL) simulations. The approaches were initially validated over a set of eleven available inhibitors. Both Autodock Vina and FPL calculations produced consistent results with the experiments with correlation coefficients of R(Dock) = 0.72  0.14 and R(W) = ?0.76  0.10, respectively. The combined approaches were then utilized to predict possible inhibitors that were selected from a ZINC15 sub-database for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Twenty compounds were suggested to be able to bind well to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Among them, five top-leads are periandrin V, penimocycline, cis-p-Coumaroylcorosolic acid, glycyrrhizin, and uralsaponin B.

They are considered major players in preserving children's health. However, concerns about vaccines' ingredients and safety became hot topics globally. With doubt, some parents became hesitant to vaccinate their children. A recent study documented high prevalence of vaccine hesitancy among Saudi parents. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore preparedness of current and future pediatricians to face vaccine hesitancy, a growing public health issue in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This study adopted non-interventional cross-sectional online questionnaire specifically designed to encompass general vaccine hesitancy related questions including Covid-19's vaccines. RESULTS: The study recruited 119 participants form three main tertiary centers in Riyadh. Trainees were the majority with pediatric consultants representing 22%. Females were more than half of total participants (53%). Although familiarity with the term vaccine hesitancy was common, it was affected by training level. Among participants, 66% heard about it from social media. Furthermore, only 32% received designated training. Knowledge was suboptimal among all levels except for those who received formal training. Despite 80% encountered vaccine hesitancy, only 55% consider it a common public health issue. Attitude toward vaccine hesitant parents was negative among male physicians (odds ratio of 2.3, P value 0.045). Additionally, majority consider it a form of child neglect (95%). In regard to COVID19's vaccine, 31% were reluctant to get vaccinated themselves. CONCLUSION: Pediatric workforce in Saudi Arabia commonly encounters vaccine hesitancy. The strong stand against vaccine hesitant parents might affect rapport with families. Sub-optimal knowledge, negative attitude and emerging COVID19 vaccine hesitancy might negatively impact future efforts.

With infection and death rates on rise, COVID-19 poses a serious threat to social functioning, human health, economies, and geopolitics. Geographic information systems and big geospatial technologies have come to the forefront in this fight against COVID-19 by playing an important role by integrating multisourced data, enhanced and rapid analytics of mapping services, location analytics, and spatial tracking of confirmed, forecasting transmission trajectories, spatial clustering of risk on epidemiologic levels, public awareness on the elimination of panic spread and decision-making support for the government and research institutions for effective prevention and control of COVID-19 cases. Big geospatial data has turned itself as the major support system for governments in dealing with this global healthcare crisis because of its advanced and innovative technological capabilities from preparation of data to modeling the results with quick and large accessibility to every spatial scale. This robust data-driven system using the accurate and prediction geoanalysis is being widely used by governments and public health institutions interfaced with both health and nonhealth digital data repositories for mining the individual and regional datasets for breaking the transmission chain. Profiling of confirmed cases on the basis of location and temporality and then visualizing them effectively coupled with behavioral and critical geographic variables such as mobility patterns, demographic data, and population density enhance the predictive analytics of big geospatial data. With the intersection of artificial intelligence, geospatial data enables real-time visualization and syndromic surveillance of epidemic data based on spatiotemporal dynamics and the data are then accurately geopositioned.

Females represent a unique subset of patients with PAD, who differ from males in important ways: they have smaller diameter vessels, undergo lower extremity bypass less frequently and experience higher rates of graft occlusion, amputation and mortality than males. Females also trend towards higher rates of major coronary events and cardiovascular mortality. Current guidelines recommend monoantiplatelet therapy (MAPT) for secondary prevention in patients with symptomatic PAD. However, indications for more intensive antithrombotic therapy in this cohort-especially among females who are frequently under-represented in randomised controlled trials (RCTs)-remain unclear. As newer antithrombotic therapies emerge, some RCTs have demonstrated differential effects in females versus males. A systematic review is needed to quantify the rates of arterial thromboembolic and bleeding events with different antithrombotic regimens in females with symptomatic PAD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials for published RCTs that include females with symptomatic PAD and compare full dose anticoagulationantiplatelet therapy, dual pathway inhibition or dual antiplatelet therapy with MAPT.

Recently, several efforts have been initiated to track individuals, their movements, and interactions using technologies, e.g., Bluetooth beacons, cellular data records, and smartphone applications. Such solutions are often intrusive, potentially violating individual privacy rights and are often subject to regulations (e.g., GDPR and CCPR) that mandate the need for opt-in policies to gather and use personal information. In this paper, we introduce Quest, a system that empowers organizations to observe individuals and spaces to implement policies for social distancing and contact tracing using WiFi connectivity data in a passive and privacy-preserving manner. The goal is to ensure the safety of employees and occupants at an organization, while protecting the privacy of all parties. Quest incorporates computationally- and information-theoretically-secure protocols that prevent adversaries from gaining knowledge of an individual's location history (based on WiFi data); it includes support for accurately identifying users who were in the vicinity of a confirmed patient, and then informing them via opt-in mechanisms. Quest supports a range of privacy-enabled applications to ensure adherence to social distancing, monitor the flow of people through spaces, identify potentially impacted regions, and raise exposure alerts. We describe the architecture, design choices, and implementation of the proposed security/privacy techniques in Quest.

Here, spoken arithmetical and non-mathematical statements were employed to investigate neural processing of arithmetic, compared to general language processing, in an attention-modulated cocktail party paradigm. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were recorded from 22 human subjects listening to audio mixtures of spoken sentences and arithmetic equations while selectively attending to one of the two speech streams. Short sentences and simple equations were presented diotically at fixed and distinct word/symbol and sentence/equation rates. Critically, this allowed neural responses to acoustics, words, and symbols to be dissociated from responses to sentences and equations. Indeed, the simultaneous neural processing of the acoustics of words and symbols was observed in auditory cortex for both streams. Neural responses to sentences and equations, however, were predominantly to the attended stream, originating primarily from left temporal, and parietal areas, respectively. Additionally, these neural responses were correlated with behavioral performance in a deviant detection task. Source-localized Temporal Response Functions revealed distinct cortical dynamics of responses to sentences in left temporal areas and equations in bilateral temporal, parietal, and motor areas. Finally, the target of attention could be decoded from MEG responses, especially in left superior parietal areas. In short, the neural responses to arithmetic and language are especially well segregated during the cocktail party paradigm, and the correlation with behavior suggests that they may be linked to successful comprehension or calculation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNeural processing of arithmetic relies on dedicated, modality independent cortical networks that are distinct from those underlying language processing. Using a simultaneous cocktail party listening paradigm, we found that these separate networks segregate naturally when listeners selectively attend to one type over the other. Neural responses in the left temporal lobe were observed for both spoken sentences and equations, but the latter additionally showed bilateral parietal activity consistent with arithmetic processing. Critically, these responses were modulated by selective attention and correlated with task behavior, consistent with reflecting high-level processing for speech comprehension or correct calculations. The response dynamics show task-related differences that were used to reliably decode the attentional target of sentences or equations.","output":"Cortical Processing of Arithmetic and Simple Sentences in an Auditory Attention Task"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic disease coronavirus (COVID-19) has not only become a worldwide health emergency, but also devoured the global economy. Despite appreciable research, identification of targeted populations for testing and tracking the spread of COVID-19 at a larger scale is an intimidating challenge. There is a need to quickly identify the infected individual or community to check the spread. The diagnostic testing done at large-scale for individuals has limitations as it cannot provide information at a swift pace in large populations, which is pivotal to contain the spread at the early stage of its breakouts. Recently, scientists are exploring the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the faeces discharged in municipal wastewater. Wastewater sampling could be a potential tool to expedite the early identification of infected communities by detecting the biomarkers from the virus. However, it needs a targeted approach to choose optimized locations for wastewater sampling. The present study proposes a novel fuzzy based Bayesian model to identify targeted populations and optimized locations with a maximum probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater networks. Consequently, real time monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater using autosamplers or biosensors could be deployed efficiently. Fourteen criteria such as population density, patients with comorbidity, quarantine and hospital facilities, etc. are analysed using the data of 14 lac individuals infected by COVID-19 in the USA. The uniqueness of the proposed model is its ability to deal with the uncertainty associated with the data and decision maker's opinions using fuzzy logic, which is fused with Bayesian approach. The evidence-based virus detection in wastewater not only facilitates focused testing, but also provides potential communities for vaccine distribution. Consequently, governments can reduce lockdown periods, thereby relieving human stress and boosting economic growth.","output":"Detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA prone clusters in a municipal wastewater network using fuzzy-Bayesian optimization model to facilitate wastewater-based epidemiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are considered to be at a high risk of contracting COVID-19 infection. Besides, control of nosocomial infections transmitted from HCWs to the patients is also a cause of concern. This study was undertaken to investigate the seroprevalence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus among the hospital staff of a tertiary care health facility in north India. METHODS: The HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology (IgG+IgM) using chemiluminescence immunoassay between June 22 and July 24, 2020. Venous blood (2 ml) was collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies. RESULTS: Of the 3739 HCWs tested, 487 (13%) were positive for total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The highest seroprevalence was observed in administrative staff (19.6%) and least in physicians (5.4%). The staff who used public (20%) and hospital transportation (16.9%) showed higher seroprevalence compared to staff using personal transportation (12.4%). No difference was observed between HCWs posted in COVID versus non-COVID areas. All seropositive symptomatic HCWs in our study (53.6%) had mild symptoms, and the remaining 46.4 per cent were asymptomatic.

He presented an ARDS, a multiple organ failure and a refractory septic shock that eventually resulted in his death. DISCUSSION: Multiple studies reported a lower incidence of SARS-Cov-2 infection in HT recipients compared to the general population, probably due to their prior knowledge and use of protective and barrier measures; but when infected they tend to have poorer outcomes and higher fatality; on account of their pre-existing comorbidities and immunodeficiency. Therefore, the management of the immunosuppressive therapy raises a challenge, in the absence of trials. Physicians rely on experts recommendations, to maintain the immunosuppressors in case of mild COVID-19, lower to the bare minimum or even discontinue them in case of critical COVID-19 or systemic complications.

In this study, we report our unique experience with AKI in COVID-19 patients in a low socioeconomic and predominantly ethnic minority group and provide its incidence, risk factors, and prognosis to expand the current understanding of this complication. METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, we analyzed the data of 469 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Brookdale University Hospital in Brooklyn, NY, from March 18 through April 23, 2020. Information regarding demographics, comorbidities, medications, clinical and laboratory data, and outcomes was collected from the electronic medical records. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association of AKI with in-hospital mortality.

The Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, hemodynamic status, and PF ratio (arterial oxygen partial pressure [PaO2]/fractional inspired oxygen [FiO2]) determined that on admission, an elevated blood urea nitrogen (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-2.48), a low eGFR (HR 1.43; CI 1.1-2.03), AKI stage 1 (HR 1.14; CI 0.64-2.03), AKI stage 2 (HR 1.86; CI 1.03-3.56), and AKI stage 3 (HR 2.1; CI 1.3-2.81) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) did not improve survival in stage III AKI. CONCLUSION: AKI in our hospitalized COVID-19 patients was common and carried a high mortality, especially in patients with AKI stage 3. RRT did not improve survival. Policy changes and planning for this high incidence of AKI in COVID-19 patients and its associated high mortality are necessary at the local and national levels.","output":"Acute Kidney Injury in COVID-19 Patients: An Inner City Hospital Experience and Policy Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein nuclear transport is an integral process to many cellular pathways and often plays a critical role during viral infection. To overcome the barrier presented by the nuclear membrane and gain access to the nucleus, virally encoded proteins have evolved ways to appropriate components of the nuclear transport machinery. By binding karyopherins, or the nuclear pore complex, viral proteins influence their own transport as well as the transport of key cellular regulatory proteins. This review covers how viral proteins can interact with different components of the nuclear import machinery and how this influences viral replicative cycles. We also highlight the effects that viral perturbation of nuclear transport has on the infected host and how we can exploit viruses as tools to study novel mechanisms of protein nuclear import. Finally, we discuss the possibility that drugs targeting these transport pathways could be repurposed for treating viral infections.","output":"Viral Appropriation: Laying Claim to Host Nuclear Transport Machinery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected patients, receiving background anti-CD20 therapy, were treated with convalescent plasma or plasma-based products.

Having to live with the employers by law, FDHs working environment might affect their well-being during COVID-19 (e.g., household crowdedness/size, insufficiency of protective equipment against COVID-19, increased workload). Research has suggested that coping resources (e.g., social support, COVID-19-related information literacy) and COVID-19-specific worries are associated with peoples well-being during COVID-19. This study examined the psychosocial correlates of probable anxiety among FDHs in Hong Kong amid the COVID-19 pandemic. By purposive sampling, FDHs (n = 295) were recruited and invited to complete a cross-sectional survey. Participants working environment (crowdedness, household size), COVID-19 job arrangements (workload, provision of protective equipment), coping resources (social support, COVID-19 information literacy), COVID-19-specific worries (contracting COVID-19, getting fired if contracting COVID-19), and anxiety symptoms were measured.

Main outcome measuresThe proportion of the sample who were vaccinated and who were vaccine hesitant, for the whole sample and for vaccine priority groups, disaggregated by age group and gender. ResultsCOVID-19 vaccine coverage was estimated to be 8.2% overall, higher for people with severe long term health conditions (13.4%) and lower for people with severe mental health conditions (4.3%). Vaccine hesitancy was high overall (35.6%) and was found to be lower for people with disability (30.3%), with severe long term health conditions (27.7%), with frequent need for assistance (24.2%) and carers (30.7%), but similar for those with severe mental health conditions (36.1%). ConclusionsLow vaccination coverage and high hesitancy for people in the priority groups leaves many people at significant risk of serious disease or death if infected with COVID-19.

A three-phase study of INFOSAN was launched in 2019 to characterize and examine the network as a functional community of practice and determine its value systematically and rigorously from its members' perspectives. The first two phases of the study involved analyzing the INFOSAN Community Website and surveying of all of its members. The main objective of this third and final phase of the study was to understand the experiences of a small group of INFOSAN members as they relate to various dimensions of membership. A qualitative methodology was used to provide a deeper understanding of members' experiences and supplement the results from the first two quantitative study phases. Interviews were conducted with 10 INFOSAN members from 10 geographic regions, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The results offer an understanding of INFOSAN members' experiences in the context of what participation in this global network means to them and relate to five themes concerning trust, learning, health protection, sense of community, and future potential. The findings suggest that focusing on outreach to sustain personal interest, training to improve technical capacity, and advocacy to obtain political buy-in are ways in which the INFOSAN Secretariat could enable participation and create value at the individual, organizational, and national level, respectively.

In this study, we assessed the association between changes in dietary and lifestyle habits and body weight, and the benefits of receiving weight management care remotely through telemedicine during lockdown. Compared to patients not receiving obesity care via telemedicine, patients receiving this care were more likely to lose weight (OR, 2.79; p = 0.042) and also to increase participation in exercise (OR, 2.4; p = 0.022). While 40% of respondents reported consuming more sweet or salty processed snacks and 33% reported less vegetables and fruits, 65% reported more homemade foods. At the same time, 40% of respondents reported a reduction in exercise and 52% reported a decline in mood. Alterations in these eating patterns, as well as in exercise habits and mood, were significantly associated with weight changes.

METHODS Between April 22 and May 1, 2003, 120 clinically compatible SARS patients were admitted to a special hospital for infectious diseases in Beijing. All patients' records were reviewed. The outcome variables of NPPV therapy were analyzed. RESULTS At 6 weeks of SARS onset, 25% (30/120) patients had respiratory failure with ALI/ARDS. 16 (53%) had hypercapnia (PaCO(2) > 45 mm Hg) during the course of SARS. 28 of them received NPPV therapy. One was intolerable to NPPV treatment. In the remaining 27 patients, NPPV was initiated 1.2 +/- 1.6 (0 - 10) days after onset of respiratory failure. One hour of NPPV therapy led to significant increases in PaO(2), SpO(2) and PaO(2)/FiO(2), and decrease in respiratory rate (all P < 0.01). 18 of the 27 patients were weaned successfully from NPPV. The mean duration of NPPV use was 10 +/- 6 (5 - 30) days. In addition to one patient who was intolerable to NPPV treatment, intubation was required in other 9 patients who initially had a favorable response to NPPV. Remarkable pulmonary barotrauma was noted in 7 of the 120 (5.8%) patients with SARS, among which 1 developed 2 days after intubation, and 6 occurred while the patients were on NPPV, the incidence being 22% (6/27) in patients using NPPV. The fatality rate at 13 weeks of SARS onset was 6.7% (8/120) in the patient cohort, and 26.7% (8/30) in the ALI/ARDS patients. No SARS occurred in medical staff taking care of NPPV patients. CONCLUSIONS Some of the SARS patients with ALI/ARDS could experience CO(2) retention, which might be related to the impairment of respiratory muscles. It is proved to be feasible and appropriate for NPPV treatment of respiratory failure in SARS patients who were at high risk of intubation related complications. As there was a high incidence of remarkable barotrauma, a careful lung protective strategy is necessary during the administration of NPPV as well as invasive mechanical ventilation.","output":"[Acute respiratory failure and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation treatment in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Inhaled epoprostenol (iEpo) is a pulmonary vasodilator used to treat refractory respiratory failure, including that caused by Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.

METHODS: Fifteen patients were included who received iEpo, had confirmed COVID-19 and had an arterial blood gas measurement in the 12 hours before and 24 hours after iEpo initiation. RESULTS: Eleven patients received prone ventilation before iEpo (73.3%), and six (40%) were paralyzed. The partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F ratio) improved from 95.7 mmHg to 118.9 mmHg (p=0.279) following iEpo initiation. In the nine patients with severe ARDS, the mean P/F ratio improved from 66.1 mmHg to 95.7 mmHg (p=0.317).

OBJECTIVE: To support real-time COVID-19 situational awareness, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene used nowcasting to account for testing and reporting delays. We conducted an evaluation to determine which implementation details would yield the most accurate estimated case counts. METHODS: A time-correlated Bayesian approach called Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing (NobBS) was applied in real time to line lists of reportable disease surveillance data, accounting for the delay from diagnosis to reporting and the shape of the epidemic curve. We retrospectively evaluated nowcasting performance for confirmed case counts among residents diagnosed during the period from March to May 2020, a period when the median reporting delay was 2 days. RESULTS: Nowcasts with a 2-week moving window and a negative binomial distribution had lower mean absolute error, lower relative root mean square error, and higher 95% prediction interval coverage than nowcasts conducted with a 3-week moving window or with a Poisson distribution. Nowcasts conducted toward the end of the week outperformed nowcasts performed earlier in the week, given fewer patients diagnosed on weekends and lack of day-of-week adjustments. When estimating case counts for weekdays only, metrics were similar across days when the nowcasts were conducted, with Mondays having the lowest mean absolute error of 183 cases in the context of an average daily weekday case count of 2914. CONCLUSIONS: Nowcasting using NobBS can effectively support COVID-19 trend monitoring. Accounting for overdispersion, shortening the moving window, and suppressing diagnoses on weekends-when fewer patients submitted specimens for testing-improved the accuracy of estimated case counts. Nowcasting ensured that recent decreases in observed case counts were not overinterpreted as true declines and supported officials in anticipating the magnitude and timing of hospitalizations and deaths and allocating resources geographically.","output":"Nowcasting for Real-Time COVID-19 Tracking in New York City: An Evaluation Using Reportable Disease Data From Early in the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to pose an unprecedented threat and challenge to public health around the world.

It is far from over and yet, it has affected every aspect of human life. The Department of Urology at King's College Hospital London provides all types of urology care ranging from benign to cancer treatments to the community. However, this service was badly affected by COVID-19. Policies were made by the experts in the field to reduce patient traffic in the hospital and at the same time, attempting to ensure appropriate and timely treatment was provided to patients suffering from urological conditions requiring urgent attention. In this article, we discuss the triage guidelines set up at our centre. Treatments for benign conditions such as kidney stones were delayed for 3-6 months. For the first time, telephone and video clinics were setup to follow-up patients with benign conditions. Urological emergencies such as acute urinary retention and priapism were discharged from accidental and emergency department after treatment. Small T1 renal cancers were put on surveillance, whereas T2 and T3 renal cancers were offered nephrectomy at a COVID-free specialized center. Transurethral removal of bladder tumor was offered only for solid or actively bleeding tumor. High risk prostate cancer patients were started on hormonal therapy and radiotherapy was only offered for spinal cord compression secondary to metastasis. Low and intermediate non-metastatic prostate cancers were placed on active surveillance. Patients with testicular tumor continued to have immediate inguinal orchidectomy. The multi-disciplinary meetings were done remotely using blue jeans software?. These steps not only strive to provide adequate and timely urology care to patients but also protect health care workers and prevent the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Triage of urology service to cope with COVID-19 pandemic: A single institution study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global concern. Iran is one of the countries affected most by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. As a result, the use of information technology (IT) has a variety of applications for pandemic management. The purpose of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic via IT management, based on extensive literature review and expert knowledge. METHODS: The conceptual framework is developed in three stages: (1) a literature review to gather practical experience with IT applications for managing the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) a study of Iranian documents and papers that present Irans practical experience with COVID-19, and (3) developing a conceptual framework based on the previous steps and validating it through a Delphi approach in two rounds, and by 13 experts. RESULTS: The proposed conceptual framework demonstrates that during pandemics, 22 different types of technologies were used for various purposes, including virtual education, early warning, rapid screening and diagnosis of infected individuals, and data management. These objectives were classified into six categories, with the following applications highlighted: (1) Prevention (M-health, Internet search queries, telehealth, robotics, Internet of things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data, Virtual Reality (VR), social media); (2) Diagnosis (M-health, drones, telehealth, IoT, Robotics, AI, Decision Support System (DSS), Electronic Health Record (EHR)); (3) Treatment (Telehealth, M-health, AI, Robotic, VR, IoT); (4) Follow-up (Telehealth, M-health, VR), (5) Management & planning (Geographic information system, M-health, IoT, blockchain), and (6) Protection (IoT, AI, Robotic and automatic vehicles, Augmented Reality (AR)). In Iran, the use of IT for prevention has been emphasized through M-health, internet search queries, social media, video conferencing, management and planning objectives using databases, health information systems, dashboards, surveillance systems, and vaccine coverage. CONCLUSIONS: IT capabilities were critical during the COVID-19 outbreak. Practical experience demonstrates that various aspects of information technologies were overlooked. To combat this pandemic, the government and decision-makers of this country should consider strategic planning that incorporates successful experiences against COVID-19 and the most advanced IT capabilities.","output":"A framework for information technology-based management against COVID-19 in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2 or COVID-19 was first discovered in Wuhan, China in late December 2019 and soon became a global pandemic The virus causes flu-like symptoms and is potentially lethal The rapid spread of the virus leaves the world in total paralysis and has devastating effects on the health, economic, and social levels of most countries No treatment has been approved yet and the world really needs a precise and urgent medication Certainly, the developing of a new specific drug for COVID-19 would take a longer time than expected but it is hoped that this task will be completed sooner than later;therefore recent studies have prioritized testing previously FDA-approved drugs for other indications and whether they have significant effects on COVID-19 or not In this study, we discuss recent applications, protocols, and the outcomes of these drugs as advised by healthcare institutions and providers, as well as to conduct a literature review","output":"Therapeutic approaches for covid 19: Challenges and successes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Leukocyte adhesion to vascular and matrix Metalloproteinase-8 (MMP8) expression is increased in sepsis and associated with poor prognosis in sepsis patients. This study aimed to investigate the role of MMP8 in sepsis serum mediated leukocyte adhesion. METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis of GSE64457 and GSE65682 was performed to evaluate the role of MMP8 in the progression of sepsis. Expression of MMP8 in blood samples from patients with sepsis was detected by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with sepsis serum, control serum, and MMP8 inhibitor. Expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were detected by qRT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. The protein expression of total p38, phosphorylated-p38, ERK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 was detected by Western blotting. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were incubated with the treated HUVECs to calculate leukocyte adhesion. RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-nine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and seven hub genes between sepsis patients and healthy controls were identified. GO function analysis of DEGs and hub genes indicated that the DEGs and hub genes were mainly enriched in neutrophil activation. MMP8 was selected as a key gene with an unfavorable prognosis in sepsis patients. The mRNA and protein expression of MMP8 in blood from sepsis patients were significantly higher than controls. Leukocyte adhesion and mRNA and protein expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were significantly increased in the sepsis serum group compared to that in the control group, as was the protein expression of p-p38 and p-ERK1/2. However, the MMP8 inhibitor suppressed the leukocyte adhesion promoted by sepsis serum by decreasing the expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, p-p38, and p-ERK1/2. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that MMP8 acts as a key gene in the development of sepsis, and sepsis serum promotes leukocyte adhesion to HUVECs via MMP8, which suggest that MMP8 might be a potential therapeutic target for sepsis.","output":"Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinase-8 Protects Against Sepsis Serum Mediated Leukocyte Adhesion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leveraging the COVID-19 India-wide lockdown situation, the present study attempts to quantify the reduction in the ambient fine particulate matter concentrations during the lockdown (compared with that of the pre-lockdown period), owing to the highly reduced specific anthropogenic activities and thereby pollutant emissions. The study was conducted over Bengaluru (India), using PM(2.5) (mass concentration of particulate matter having size less than or equal to 2.5 m) and Black Carbon mass concentration (BC) data. Open-access datasets from pollution control board (PCB) were also utilised to understand the spatial variability and region-specific reduction in PM(2.5) across the city. The highest percentage reduction was observed in BC(ff) (black carbon attributable to fossil fuel combustion), followed by total BC and PM(2.5). No decrease in BC(bb) (black carbon attributable to wood/biomass burning) was observed, suggesting unaltered wood-based cooking activities and biomass-burning (local/regional) throughout the study period. Results support the general understanding of multi-source (natural and anthropogenic) nature of PM(2.5) in contrast to limited-source (combustion based) nature of BC. The diurnal amplitudes in BC and BC(ff) were reduced, while they remained almost the same for PM(2.5) and BC(bb). Analysis of PCB data reveal the highest reduction in PM(2.5) in an industrial cluster area. The current lockdown situation acted as a natural model to understand the role of a few major anthropogenic activities (viz., traffic, construction, industries related to non-essential goods, etc.) in enhancing the background fine particulate matter levels.

An accurate diagnosis of this disease in the clinic is very important. This study aims to improve the differential ability of computed tomography (CT) to diagnose COVID-19 and other community-acquired pneumonias (CAPs) and evaluate the short-term prognosis of these patients. METHODS: The clinical and imaging data of 165 COVID-19 and 118 CAP patients diagnosed in seven hospitals in Anhui Province, China from January 21 to February 28, 2020 were retrospectively analysed. The CT manifestations of the two groups were recorded and compared. A correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between COVID-19 and age, size of lung lesions, number of involved lobes, and CT findings of patients. The factors that were helpful in diagnosing the two groups of patients were identified based on specificity and sensitivity. RESULTS: The typical CT findings of COVID-19 are simple ground-glass opacities (GGO), GGO with consolidation or grid-like changes. The sensitivity and specificity of the combination of age, white blood cell count, and ground-glass opacity in the diagnosis of COVID-19 were 92.7 and 66.1%, respectively. Pulmonary consolidation, fibrous cords, and bronchial wall thickening were used as indicators to exclude COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of the combination of these findings were 78.0 and 63.6%, respectively. The follow-up results showed that 67.8% (112/165) of COVID-19 patients had abnormal changes in their lung parameters, and the severity of the pulmonary sequelae of patients over 60 years of age worsened with age. CONCLUSIONS: Age, white blood cell count and ground-glass opacity have high accuracy in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 and the differential diagnosis from CAP. Patients aged over 60 years with COVID-19 have a poor prognosis. This result provides certain significant guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia.","output":"Differential diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 from community-acquired-pneumonia by computed tomography scan and follow-up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and deaths caused by it all over the world have imposed great concern on the scientific community to develop potential drugs to combat Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). In this regard, lichen metabolites may offer a vast reservoir for the discovery of antiviral drug candidates. Therefore, to find novel compounds against COVID-19, we created a library of 412 lichen compounds and subjected to virtual screening against the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease (Mpro). All the ligands were virtually screened, and 27 compounds were found to have high affinity with Mpro. These compounds were assessed for drug-likeness analysis where two compounds were found to fit well for redocking studies. Molecular docking, drug-likeness, X-Score, and toxicity analysis resulting in two lichen compounds, Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid with Mpro-inhibiting activity. These compounds were finally subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to compare the dynamics behavior and stability of the Mpro after ligand binding. The binding energy was calculated by MM-PBSA method to determine the intermolecular proteinCligand interactions. Our results showed that two compounds; Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid had the binding free energy of ? 42.42 kJ mol/1 and ? 57.85 kJ mol/1 respectively as compared to reference X77 (? 91.78 kJ mol/1). We concluded that Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid show considerable structural and pharmacological properties and they can be used as hit compounds to develop potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2.

Two phenomena observed so far in the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic deserve further attention. First, the relative absence of clinical signs of infections in children, second, the early appearance of IgG in certain patients. From the point of view of immune system physiology, such an early rise of specific IgG is expected in secondary immune responses when memory to a cross-reactive antigen is present, usually from an earlier infection with a coronavirus. It is actually typical for the immune system to respond, to what it already knows, a phenomenon that has been observed in many infections with closely related viruses and has been termed \\"original antigenic sin.\\" The question then arises whether such cross-reactive antibodies are protective or not against the new virus. The worst scenario would be when such cross-reactive memory antibodies to related coronaviruses would not only be non-protective but even enhance infection and the clinical course. Such a phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) has already been described in several viral infections. Thus, the development of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in the course of COVID-19 might not be a simple sign of viral clearance and developing protection against the virus. On the contrary, due to cross-reaction to related coronavirus strains from earlier infections, in certain patients IgG might enhance clinical progression due to ADE. The patient's viral history of coronavirus infection might be crucial to the development of the current infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, it poses a note of caution when treating COVID-19 patients with convalescent sera.","output":"Antibody Dependent Enhancement Due to Original Antigenic Sin and the Development of SARS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Community participation and implementing interventions based on the community are key strategies to eliminate leprosy. Health professionals have an essential role as they are a necessary source of information because of their knowledge and experience, as well as their comprehensive perspective of contexts included in the programmes. This study has the aim of analysing the perceptions on the development of programmes with people affected by leprosy from the perspective of professionals that work at different organisations in endemic contexts. METHODOLOGY: A qualitative study was carried out with the written response to an open question questionnaire which was sent by email. The script content was related to positive aspects and difficulties in daily work, participation from the community in activities, contribution to gender equality and programme sustainability. 27 health professionals were interviewed, 14 women and 13 men, all of which belonged to 16 organisations in India and Brazil. Once the content of the interviews was analysed, two main topics emerged: barriers perceived by professionals and proposals to improve the sustainability of the programmes. PRINCIPAL FINDING: Professionals identify barriers related to social stigma, inequalities, gender inequalities, difficulty managing the disease, limited services, lack of resources and lack of community participation. Furthermore, some necessary recommendations were taken into account to improve programme development related to: Eliminating stigma, reaching gender equality, developing adequate and effective services, guaranteeing adequate and quality resources and achieving compassion among professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Although introducing community programmes with people affected by leprosy has a long history in countries such as India and Brazil, there are still several barriers that can hinder their development. Based on the specific needs of the contexts, recommendations are suggested that, with the involvement of all parties and with sensitive approaches towards human rights and gender, they could help to guarantee universal health coverage and the sustainability of said programmes.","output":"Community intervention programmes with people affected by leprosy: Listening to the voice of professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Although rare, uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common cancer that develops inside adult eyes. The prognosis is poor, since 50% of patients will develop lethal metastases in the first decade, especially to the liver. Once metastases are detected, life expectancy is limited, given that the available treatments are mostly unsuccessful. Thus, there is a need to find methods that can accurately predict UM prognosis and also effective therapeutic strategies to treat this cancer. In this manuscript, we initially compile the current knowledge on epidemiological, clinical, pathological and molecular features of UM. Then, we cover the most relevant prognostic factors currently used for the evaluation and follow-up of UM patients. Afterwards, we highlight emerging molecular markers in UM published over the last three years. Finally, we discuss the problems preventing meaningful advances in the treatment and prognostication of UM patients, as well as forecast new roadblocks and paths of UM-related research. ABSTRACT: Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common malignant intraocular tumour in the adult population. It is a rare cancer with an incidence of nearly five cases per million inhabitants per year, which develops from the uncontrolled proliferation of melanocytes in the choroid (90%), ciliary body (6%) or iris (4%). Patients initially present either with symptoms like blurred vision or photopsia, or without symptoms, with the tumour being detected in routine eye exams. Over the course of the disease, metastases, which are initially dormant, develop in nearly 50% of patients, preferentially in the liver. Despite decades of intensive research, the only approach proven to mildly control disease spread are early treatments directed to ablate liver metastases, such as surgical excision or chemoembolization. However, most patients have a limited life expectancy once metastases are detected, since there are limited therapeutic approaches for the metastatic disease, including immunotherapy, which unlike in cutaneous melanoma, has been mostly ineffective for UM patients. Therefore, in order to offer the best care possible to these patients, there is an urgent need to find robust models that can accurately predict the prognosis of UM, as well as therapeutic strategies that effectively block and/or limit the spread of the metastatic disease. Here, we initially summarized the current knowledge about UM by compiling the most relevant epidemiological, clinical, pathological and molecular data. Then, we revisited the most important prognostic factors currently used for the evaluation and follow-up of primary UM cases. Afterwards, we addressed emerging prognostic biomarkers in UM, by comprehensively reviewing gene signatures, immunohistochemistry-based markers and proteomic markers resulting from research studies conducted over the past three years. Finally, we discussed the current hurdles in the field and anticipated the future challenges and novel avenues of research in UM.","output":"Prognostic Biomarkers in Uveal Melanoma: The Status Quo, Recent Advances and Future Directions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND To study the effect of intravenous alteplase on development of post-stroke depression (PSD) in acute stroke patients, and to identify predictors of PSD. METHODS This post-hoc analysis included patients with unknown onset stroke randomized to treatment with alteplase or placebo in the WAKE-UP trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01525290), in whom a composite endpoint of PSD was defined as a Beck Depression Inventory BDI 10, medication with an antidepressant, or depression recorded as an adverse event. We used multiple logistic regression to identify predictors of PSD at 90 days. Structural equation modelling was applied to assess the indirect effect of thrombolysis on PSD mediated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS Information on the composite endpoint was available for 438 of 503 randomized patients. PSD was present in 96 of 224 (42.9%) patients in the alteplase group and 115 of 214 (53.7%) in the placebo group (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.43-0.94; p=0.022; adjusted for age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] at baseline). Prognostic factors associated with PSD included baseline medication with antidepressants, higher lesion volume, history of depression and assignment to placebo. While 65% of the effect of thrombolysis on PSD was caused directly, while 35% where mediated by an improvement of the mRS. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with alteplase in patients with acute stroke resulted in lower rates of depression at 90 days, which was only partially explained by reduced functional disability.

Performance on trunk stability tasks, such as the Trunk Stability Push Up (TSPU), is less than optimal in females. Current corrective programs include few females, and clinically, improvements for females have been minimal. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the effectiveness of a novel trunk stability intervention program in improving TSPU performance in a cohort of active female participants. It was hypothesized that 60% of participants would improve their TSPU scores to 2 via Functional Movement Screen? (FMS?) criteria following a novel six-week intervention program. STUDY DESIGN: Pilot Cohort Study METHODS: Participants were screened for pain with lumbar and shoulder clearing tests and hypermobility was assessed using Beighton scores. Additional testing included a breathing screen, the FMS?, Y-Balance Test-Lower Quarter and Y-Balance Test-Upper Quarter. Participants who scored a 1 on the TSPU received a home exercise program instructed by student physical therapists. Exercises focused on improving awareness of lumbar spine position and thoracic spine mobility. Participants returned for follow-ups after two and four weeks for instruction in exercise progression, which increased postural demand on the lumbar spine and upper extremities, and utilized closed-chain, multiplanar stability strategies. RESULTS: Nine of 20 participants (45%) scored 2 on the TSPU at posttest. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only 12 participants were able to complete all posttest outcome measures. No significant differences were noted in the remaining outcome measures.

The development of relative adaptations in the work setting (as chairs, devices, flexible schedule) were considered as favorite factors easing the work by 85%. 17% reported an employer's knowledge on RD related working legislation, 43% the contrary and another 38.7% wished for a future employer's awareness. Most of the participants (58.9%) had no personal information on this field but were eager to get it. The uneventful impact of RD on finding or keeping a job was registered by 77.4% and 66.9%, respectively. During COVID, most of the participants (53%) have not asked for an RD-related leave and only 24.2% chose to telework, a policy that raised mutual satisfaction in 19%. Of note, the working conditions have not mainly been altered (67%) after the end of the 1st quarantine. Conclusion: This study highlighted that although RD predominate in females, women are more willing to participate in such projects (F 90%). The financial income was mainly based on a personal or a family member work reimbursement (83%), while 11% depended on a state pension or subsidy. The majority has notified the RD to their work environment (85%) while another 85% considered as favorite factors easing the work, several adaptations in the work setting such as chairs, devices, flexible schedule etc. Interestingly, 60% of the participants were unaware of the beneficial legal work rights and nearly 70% of them believe that RD is an obstacle for employment or working maintenance.

IBD and COVID-19 are marked by gut inflammation, intestinal barrier breakdown, resulting in mucosal hyperpermeability, gut bacterial overgrowth, and dysbiosis together with perturbations in microbial and human metabolic pathways originating changes in the blood and fecal metabolome. This review compared the most relevant metabolic and microbial alterations reported from the literature in patients with IBD with those in patients with COVID-19. In both diseases, gut dysbiosis is marked by the prevalence of pro-inflammatory bacterial species and the shortfall of anti-inflammatory species; most studies reported the decrease in Firmicutes, with a specific decrease in obligately anaerobic producers short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. In addition, Escherichia coli overgrowth has been observed in IBD and COVID-19, while Akkermansia muciniphila is depleted in IBD and overexpressed in COVID-19. In patients with COVID-19, gut dysbiosis continues after the clearance of the viral RNA from the upper respiratory tract and the resolution of clinical symptoms. Finally, we presented and discussed the impact of gut dysbiosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and increased energy demand on metabolic pathways involving key metabolites, such as tryptophan, phenylalanine, histidine, glutamine, succinate, citrate, and lipids.","output":"Inflammatory Bowel Disease and COVID-19: How Microbiomics and Metabolomics Depict Two Sides of the Same Coin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a three-dimensional (3D) approach for virtual histology and histopathology based on multi-scale phase contrast x-ray tomography, and use this to investigate the parenchymal architecture of unstained lung tissue from patients who succumbed to Covid-19.

Sixty-six struggling middle school readers were randomly assigned to a computerized version of the intervention, a teacher-led version, or business-as-usual (BaU) control instruction. The influence of language status (i.e., English Learner status) and pre-intervention levels of mind-wandering, anxiety, and mindset on the effects of the inferential reading comprehension intervention were examined.

The computer-led intervention was associated with improved inference-making for students with higher levels of self-reported anxiety and mind-wandering. In contrast, the computer-led intervention was less beneficial than BaU instruction for English learners.

The STA procedure is an emerging concept in minimally invasive surgery that presents technical difficulties and challenges compared with traditional laparoscopy. Using multiple instruments inserted through a single trocar generates internal and external conflicts. Achieving triangulation requires the instruments and surgeon's hands to cross over at the point of entry. Robotic-assisted surgery may overcome these difficulties owing to its capability of dissociating the hands of the surgeon from the instruments. DESIGN Prospective study consisting of 18 randomly performed porcine STA Nissen fundoplications with and without robotic assistance. SETTING A research institute. PARTICIPANTS Three surgeons with different experience. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Operative time, intraoperative complications, and the number of conflicts between the instruments and/or hands of the surgeons. RESULTS All of the procedures were successfully completed. Mean operative time (45.6 +/- 11.2 vs 65.4 +/- 10.7 minutes; P = .03) and number of conflicts (1.0 +/- 0.9 vs 3.8 +/- 1.2; P < .001) were significantly reduced in the robotic series. CONCLUSIONS Use of the robotic platform allows the surgeon to select which hand will move which instrument. Inverting the control allows crossing of the instruments without any consequences to the surgeon. Moreover, this system offers instruments with multiple degrees of freedom.

Although the prototypic concept of CSS was first proposed 116 years ago, we have only begun to study and understand CSS for less than 30 years. Actually, diseases under CSS umbrella include familial/primary and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and cytokine storm (CS). Hematologic malignancies and autoimmune diseases that cause CSS are named malignancy-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (MAHS) and MAS, respectively. In-depth research on the pathogenesis of HLH/CSS has greatly increased the number of patients that were able to be definitively diagnosed with HLH/CSS. However, it should be emphasized that HLH/CSS diagnosis is difficult at the early stages due to the non-specific clinical signs and symptoms, which tends to result in missed and incorrect diagnoses. Therefore, clinicians should not only possess extensive clinical experience to ensure high sensitivity to the characteristics of HLH/CSS but must also be familiar with HLH-2004/2009 diagnostic criteria, and HScore methods. The paper concisely comment evolution of CSS classifications, cytokines associated with CSS, evolution of CSS diagnostic criteria and importance of the correct identification of hemophagocytes in diagnosing CSS, which is timely and may benefit clinicians familiar HLH-2004/2009 diagnostic criteria, and HScore methods.

While education is now commonly accepted as a basic right, much of the developing world continues to suffer from learning poverty. The learning society of the future, characterized by information ubiquity and global connectedness on one hand, and inequity and survival challenges on the other, will require learning to be reimagined. Testing and implementing these experiments at scale will bring a learning society closer to realizing the goals of access, quality, and relevance. ?

AIMS The aim of this study is to explore the clinical significance of peripheral blood eosinophil in diagnosing ECRS. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a prospective study of 221 patients diagnosed with CRS. Lund-Mackay score, peripheral blood eosinophil absolute count, peripheral blood eosinophil percentage were detection to compare the clinical features with ECRS and non-ECRS. ROC curve was performed to assess the efficiency of clinical index to predict ECRS. RESULTS The ECRS group of patients had significantly higher scores compared with those of the non-ECRS group. Different extent and severity of mucosal thickening on total Lund-Mackay scores, anterior ethmoidal, posterior ethmoidal and ostiomeatal complex have confirmed different blood eosinophil levels in CRS patients. The combination of peripheral blood eosinophil percentage and posterior ethmoidal score to predict ECRS was 0.807.

This study was conducted to present our long-term outcome of VADAs treated with a Tubridge flow diverter (TFD), a new device developed in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinical and angiographic data of six patients harboring large VADAs and treated with TFDs were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS A total of nine TFDs were successfully implanted in six patients. Angiographic follow-up images were available for all patients at a median of 26.0 (18.5, 37.5) months after treatment. Five of the six VADAs were completely occluded, and the last was improved (near complete occlusion). In-stent stenosis was detected in one case and was handled appropriately by angioplasty and stenting. All covered branches and parent arteries remained patent. There were no complications or new neurological deficits observed in any of the patients. At the latest clinical follow-up (36.5 (26.0, 44.5) months), all patients achieved 0 in the modified Rankin scale score.

Previously, we demonstrated that immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the FIPV spike protein (S) induced early death after challenge with FIPV (Vennema et al., 1990, J. Virol. 64, 1407C1409). In this paper we describe similar immunizations with the FIPV membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The genes encoding these proteins were cloned and sequenced. Comparison of the amino acid sequences with the corresponding sequences of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus revealed 84.7 and 77% identity for M and N, respectively. Vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the cloned genes induced antibodies in immunized kittens. Immunization with neither recombinant induced early death after challenge with FIPV, strongly suggesting that antibody-dependent enhancement is mediated by antibodies against S only. Immunization with the N protein recombinant had no apparent effect on the outcome of challenge. However, three of eight kittens immunized with the M protein recombinant survived the challenge, as compared to one of eight kittens of the control group.","output":"Primary structure of the membrane and nucleocapsid protein genes of feline infectious peritonitis virus and immunogenicity of recombinant vaccinia viruses in kittens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is impacting the research community worldwide with unforeseen long-term consequences for research, doctoral training, and international collaboration.

Their effectiveness is relatively unknown - some studies describe 40% of adults with literacy levels below the necessary for optimal use. eLiteracy has been a buzzword during the pandemic, but we still don't understand who benefits from it. This study aims to understand the ability of women to identify and use COVID-19 online information and its link with knowledge and behavior METHODS: Web-based survey conducted on female adults. Coronavirus eHealth literacy scales measured skills to apply information (CoV-eHEALHS) and COVID-19?related knowledge, conspiracy beliefs, and adherence to protective behaviors (COVID-19 KAPs). Spearman correlation and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to identify association between CoV-eHEALHS and COVID-19 KAP, and between these and age, income, and level of education RESULTS: Higher CoV-eHEALS were seen in higher level of education (2=17,03; p = 0,002), higher knowledge ( = 0,19; p = 0,000), lower conspiracy (=-0,27; p = 0,000) and higher adherence to protective measures ( = 0,24; p = 0,000). Higher knowledge was seen in greater ages ( = 0,11; p = 0,000), higher education (2=36,40; p = 0,000) and greater income (2=19,96; p = 0,001). Lower conspiracy was seen in higher education (2=31,50; p = 0,000) and higher income (2=9,71; p = 0,046). Higher adherence to protective measures had no correlation with socioeconomical factors. CONCLUSIONS: There was association between higher eHealth literacy and COVID-19 KAP, reinforcing public health stakeholders to invest on disseminating digital information. There were worse results in younger women of lower education and income, suggesting information should be adapted to this population KEY MESSAGES: Digitally disseminated information is important because of the association between higher eHealth literacy and knowledge and protective behavior.

Previous studies have reported liver enzyme changes as well as diarrhea as a common GI manifestation of COVID-19. However, there are few reports about COVID-19 synchronous cutaneous and liver involvement. Additionally, there are few reports about intrahepatic cholestasis in COVID-19 patients. In this article, a confirmed case of COVID-19 with vasculopathy-related cutaneous manifestation and liver cholestasis is reported. A 67-year-old Iranian woman was admitted to Taleghani Hospital with epigastric pain, vomiting, anosmia, rising liver enzyme levels, fever, itching, and skin rashes. Skin and liver biopsies were performed during the patients admission; the results suggested vasculopathy-related cutaneous lesion and liver cholestasis.

Information regarding the impact of cardiovascular complication on fatal outcome is scarce. Objective: To evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective single-center case series analyzed patients with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Analysis began February 25, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed in patients with and without elevation of troponin T (TnT) levels. Results: Among 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 144 patients (77%) were discharged and 43 patients (23%) died. The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 13.33% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5%] vs 16 [13.2%]). Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (? = 0.530, P < .001) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (? = 0.613, P < .001). Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (P = .001; P < .001), while no significant dynamic changes of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (P = .96; P = .16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2%] vs 69 [51.1%]) and mechanical ventilation (31 [59.6%] vs 14 [10.4%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels. The mortality rates of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% (7 of 19) and 21.4% (36 of 168) (P = .13). Conclusions and Relevance: Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury. Aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury.","output":"Cardiovascular Implications of Fatal Outcomes of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We describe the design of a longitudinal cohort study to determine SARS-CoV-2 incidence and prevalence among a population-based sample of adults living in six San Francisco Bay Area counties. METHODS: Using an address-based sample, we stratified households by county and by census-tract risk. Risk strata were determined by using regression models to predict infections by geographic area using census-level sociodemographic and health characteristics. We disproportionately sampled high and medium risk strata, which had smaller population sizes, to improve precision of estimates, and calculated a desired sample size of 3400. Participants were primarily recruited by mail and were followed monthly with PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs, testing of venous blood samples for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antigens, and testing of the presence of neutralizing antibodies, with completion of questionnaires about socio-demographics and behavior. Estimates of incidence and prevalence will be weighted by county, risk strata and sociodemographic characteristics of non-responders, and will take into account laboratory test performance. RESULTS: We enrolled 3842 adults from August to December, 2020, and completed follow-up March 31, 2021. We reached target sample sizes within most strata.

Substantial variability was observed in concentrations of measured pollutants within each run (e.g., up to 97% for BC) and between different runs (e.g., 93% for PM2.5 during morning versus afternoon) in bike-trailer. Compared with cyclist height, the average bike-trailer concentration of fine and coarse particles was higher by up to 14% and 18%, respectively, during both morning and afternoon runs. The lockdown restrictions when schools were closed led to a reduction in bike-trailer PM2.5 concentrations by up to 91% compared with eased lockdown period when schools re-opened in March 2021. Trailer covers led up to 50% (fine particles) and 24% (BC;a component of PM2.5) reductions in concentrations compared with trailers without cover.

Schwere allergische Reaktionen und Anaphylaxien nach COVID-19-Impfungen sind sehr seltene unerwnschte Nebenwirkungen, die aber aufgrund potenziell letaler Ausg?nge viel Aufmerksamkeit erhalten und ein hohes Ma? an Verunsicherung ausgel?st haben. Methoden: Das aktuelle Wissen zu anaphylaktischen Reaktionen auf Impfstoffe und speziell zu den derzeit neuen mRNA-COVID-19-Impfstoffen wurde zusammengestellt mittels einer Literaturanalyse durch Recherchen in Medline, Pubmed sowie den nationalen und internationalen Studien- und Leitlinienregistern, der Cochrane Library und dem Internet unter besonderer Bercksichtigung offizieller Webseiten der World Health Oranization (WHO), der Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), der European Medicines Agency (EMA), des Robert-Koch-Instituts (RKI) und des Paul-Ehrlich-Instituts (PEI). Ergebnisse: Basierend auf der internationalen Literatur und bisheriger Erfahrungen zu schweren allergischen Reaktionen im Kontext der COVID-19-Impfungen werden von einem Expertengremium Empfehlungen fr Prophylaxe, Diagnostik und Therapie dieser allergischen Reaktionen gegeben. Schlussfolgerung: Vor einer COVID-19-Impfung mit den derzeit zugelassenen Impfstoffen sind Allergietests fr die allermeisten Allergiker nicht notwendig. Bei allergischer/anaphylaktischer Reaktion auf den verabreichten COVID-19-Impfstoff wird eine allergologische Abkl?rung empfohlen, wie auch fr eine kleine potenzielle Risikopopulation vor der ersten Impfung.

the World Health Organization Research is finding that it is an inflammatory and coagulopathic infection, predisposing to thrombotic events even with thromboprophylaxis We describe a COVID19-positive patient who developed acute limb ischemia CASE PRESENTATION: 54-year-old female with OSA, COPD and hypertension presented to the ER with fever, shortness of breath of 7 days COVID19 PCR was positive After marked D-dimer elevation, the decision was made to escalate VTE prophylaxis to therapeutic enoxaparin After refusing doses she developed acute right lower extremity paresthesia and pain Distal pulses were nonpalpable, fleeting by doppler Arterial ultrasound suggested proximal arterial occlusion Heparin drip was started, inflammatory markers and d-dimer improved A contingency plan for loss of pulses was to utilize alteplase infusion via right femoral arterial line but never required She developed severe ARDS requiring intubation with proning She improved, underwent tracheostomy and weaned from ventilation With negative COVID19 PCRs, peripheral angiography found occlusions of the right popliteal, proximal anterior tibial, peroneal arteries, with chronic posterior tibial occlusion After thrombectomy and angioplasty, patency with two vessel run-off was achieved, oral anticoagulation started and she was discharged to LTACH DISCUSSION: Acute limb ischemia is a vascular emergency that threatens limb viability Literature review suggests that COVID19 patients are predisposed to thrombotic events due to cytokine storm, stasis, hypoxia, endothelial dysfunction Multiple retrospective analyses have demonstrated similar incidents of thrombosis ranging from 12-31% A minority of these events are arterial D-dimer, platelets, ferritin, IL-6 and LDH correlate with cytokine storm and procoagulant state Elevated D-dimer levels are an independent predictor of mortality, have strong correlation with complications and are a tool to aid in the decision to escalate standard prophylaxis to therapeutic anticoagulation Current prophylaxis recommendations include daily unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin Aggressive prophylactic dosing has been suggested in these patients but clinical benefit has not been confirmed Research in China has suggested these doses may reduce mortality in severe COVID19 infection by decreasing systemic inflammation early in the

Adherence to DOT and the association between treatment method and time to treatment is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of a randomized 2% of laboratory-confirmed chlamydia infections reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2019. Clinicians and pharmacies were contacted to ascertain treatment methods and timing. We assessed frequency of DOT and pharmacy prescriptions in the treatment of chlamydia infection in Massachusetts. We used log rank test to compare time to treatment initiation for patients receiving DOT versus pharmacy prescriptions. Data were stratified according to whether treatment was empiric or laboratory-driven. KEY RESULTS: We ascertained full outcomes for 199 patients. Eighty patients received DOT and 119 patients received pharmacy prescriptions. DOT was more common among those receiving empiric treatment and pharmacy prescriptions were more common among those receiving laboratory-driven treatment. The median time to treatment was 1.5 days for patients treated with DOT and 3 days for those treated with pharmacy prescriptions.

The Vaccine Hesitancy Matrix (VHM), developed by a WHO strategic advisory group of experts, can serve as an important tool to categorize vaccine hesitancy reasons reported in the JRF. We aimed to describe the reasons for vaccine hesitancy reported globally from 2014 to 2017 to ascertain trends over time and understand the comparability of using the VHM to classify hesitancy reasons from 2014 to 2016 based on previously published literature. We conducted a quantitative content analysis to code and categorize vaccine hesitancy reasons reported in the JRF from 2014 to 2017. Vaccine hesitancy trends were consistent from 2014 to 2017, where vaccine hesitancy reasons were mainly related to individual and group level influences (59%) followed by contextual influences (25%), and vaccine- or vaccination-specific issues (16%). Comparability of our approach to categorize vaccine hesitancy to the previously published JRF data showed that results were mostly but not entirely consistent. Major differences in categorizing vaccine hesitancy were noted between two specific reasons C experience with past vaccination (under individual and group influences) and risk/benefit- scientific evidence (under vaccine and vaccination-specific issues); this was usually due to lack of clear definitions in some sub-categories and generic responses reported in the JRF. The JRF hesitancy module may benefit from modifications to improve the data quality.

Maternal and Child Health (MCH) services particularly benefit from task-shifting to LHWs or similar cadres. However, evidence on the roles and usefulness of LHWs in MCH service delivery in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is not fully known. OBJECTIVES To examine evidence of the roles and impact of lay health worker programmes focusing on Women Living with HIV (WLH) and their HIV-exposed infants (HEIs). METHODS A scoping review approach based on Arksey and O'Malley's guiding principles was used to retrieve, review and analyse existing literature. We searched for articles published between January 2008 and July 2018 in seven (7) databases, including: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Joanna Briggs, The Cochrane Library, EBM reviews and Web of Science. The critical constructs used for the literature search were \\"lay health worker\\", \\"community health worker\\", \\"peer mentor\\", \\"mentor mother,\\" \\"Maternal and Child health worker\\", \\"HIV positive mothers\\", \\"HIV exposed infants\\" and PMTCT. RESULTS Thirty-three (33) full-text articles meeting the eligibility criteria were identified and included in the final analysis. Most (n = 13, 39.4%) of the included studies were conducted in South Africa and used a cluster RCT design (n = 13, 39.4%). The most commonly performed roles of LHWs in HIV specific MCH programmes included: community engagement and sensitisation, psychosocial support, linkage to care, encouraging women to bring their infants back for HIV testing and supporting default tracing. Community awareness on Mother to Child Transmission of HIV (MTCT), proper and consistent use of condoms, clinic attendance and timely HIV testing of HEIs, as well as retention in care for infected persons, have all improved because of LHW programmes. CONCLUSION LHWs play significant roles in the management of WLH and their HEIs, improving MCH outcomes in the process. LHW interventions are beneficial in increasing access to PMTCT services and reducing MTCT of HIV, though their impact on improving adherence to ART remains scanty. Further research is needed to evaluate ART adherence in LHW interventions targeted at WLH. LHW programmes can be enhanced by increasing supportive supervision and remuneration of LHWs.","output":"Impact of lay health worker programmes on the health outcomes of mother-child pairs of HIV exposed children in Africa: A scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus-like particles (VLPs) are virus-derived structures made up of one or more different molecules with the ability to self-assemble, mimicking the form and size of a virus particle but lacking the genetic material so they are not capable of infecting the host cell. Expression and self-assembly of the viral structural proteins can take place in various living or cell-free expression systems after which the viral structures can be assembled and reconstructed. VLPs are gaining in popularity in the field of preventive medicine and to date, a wide range of VLP-based candidate vaccines have been developed for immunization against various infectious agents, the latest of which is the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the efficacy of which is being evaluated. VLPs are highly immunogenic and are able to elicit both the antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses by pathways different from those elicited by conventional inactivated viral vaccines. However, there are still many challenges to this surface display system that need to be addressed in the future. VLPs that are classified as subunit vaccines are subdivided into enveloped and non- enveloped subtypes both of which are discussed in this review article. VLPs have also recently received attention for their successful applications in targeted drug delivery and for use in gene therapy. The development of more effective and targeted forms of VLP by modification of the surface of the particles in such a way that they can be introduced into specific cells or tissues or increase their half-life in the host is likely to expand their use in the future. Recent advances in the production and fabrication of VLPs including the exploration of different types of expression systems for their development, as well as their applications as vaccines in the prevention of infectious diseases and cancers resulting from their interaction with, and mechanism of activation of, the humoral and cellular immune systems are discussed in this review.

The COVID-19 pandemic appears to be further exacerbating health inequities for marginalized populations. The experiences of resettled refugee women are not fully known. AIM: To understand Syrian refugee womens experiences accessing postnatal healthcare services and supports during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Semi-structured, virtual interviews were conducted with eight resettled Syrian refugee women living in Nova Scotia (Canada) who were postnatal between March and August 2020. Data analysis was informed by constructivist grounded theory. FINDINGS: Three themes emerged: the impacts of COVID-19 on postnatal healthcare; loss of informal support; and grief and anxiety. Women experienced difficult healthcare interactions, including socially and physically isolated deliveries, challenges accessing in-person interpreters, and cancelled or unavailable in-home services (e.g., public health nurse and doula visits). Increased childcare responsibilities and limited informal supports due to pandemic restrictions left women feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. Stay-at-home orders resulted in some women reporting feelings of isolation and loss, as they were unable to share in person postnatal moments with friends and family, ultimately impacting their mental wellness. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 and associated public health restrictions had significant impacts on postnatal Syrian refugee women. Data presented in this study demonstrated the ways in which the pandemic environment and related restrictions amplified pre-existing barriers to care and postnatal health inequalities for resettled refugee womenparticularly a lack of postnatal informal supports and systemic barriers to care.","output":"COVID affected us all: the birth and postnatal health experiences of resettled Syrian refugee women during COVID-19 in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between maximal exercise capacity measured before severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and hospitalization due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We identified patients (&#8805;18 years) who completed a clinically indicated exercise stress test between January 1, 2016, and February 29, 2020, and had a test for SARS-CoV-2 (ie, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test) between February 29, 2020, and May 30, 2020. Maximal exercise capacity was quantified in metabolic equivalents of task (METs). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the likelihood that hospitalization secondary to COVID-19 is related to peak METs, with adjustment for 13 covariates previously identified as associated with higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. RESULTS: We identified 246 patients (age, 5912 years; 42% male; 75% black race) who had an exercise test and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among these, 89 (36%) were hospitalized. Peak METs were significantly lower (P<.001) among patients who were hospitalized (6.72.8) compared with those not hospitalized (8.02.4). Peak METs were inversely associated with the likelihood of hospitalization in unadjusted (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.92) and adjusted models (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.99). CONCLUSION: Maximal exercise capacity is independently and inversely associated with the likelihood of hospitalization due to COVID-19. These data further support the important relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and health outcomes. Future studies are needed to determine whether improving maximal exercise capacity is associated with lower risk of complications due to viral infections, such as COVID-19.","output":"Inverse Relationship of Maximal Exercise Capacity to Hospitalization Secondary to Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Caregivers of persons living with Alzheimers disease and Alzheimers disease-related dementias (PLWD; AD/ADRD) benefit from unique interventions to address their different needs. While information on which interventions best meet specific needs exists, less is known about how to match caregivers with those interventions. To address this research gap, we tested Care to Plan (CtP) within a large healthcare system. After care navigators guided caregivers through twenty CtP tailoring questions to identify caregivers greatest needs, the online tool provided the intervention type best suited to meet their needs, along with region-specific information on available programs. This mixed methods analysis evaluated the utility of the CtP tool with 20 family caregivers of PLWD after a 1 month follow-up. Most caregivers agreed that the CtP tool was helpful (85%) and would recommend the tool to other caregivers (90%). Caregivers also said they valued being able to discuss the CtP recommendations with the care navigator (95%). However, only 65% said they found services that met their needs or planned on using services recommended by CtP. Interview data indicate time constraints and restricted availability of resources due to COVID-19 precautions reduced caregivers abilities to pursue some recommendations. In addition, the stage of dementia experienced by their care recipient may explain why others found CtP less useful. However, these caregivers noted the potential utility of the resources for their future care planning needs.

(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), the two major constituents of cannabinoids, and their metabolites are contaminants of emerging concern due to the limited information on their environmental impacts. As well, their releases to the water systems and environment are expected to increase due to recent legalization. Solid-phase extraction is the most common technique for the extraction and pre-concentration of cannabinoids in water samples as well as a clean-up step after the extraction of cannabinoids from solid samples. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is the most common technique used for the analysis of cannabinoids. THC and its metabolites have been detected in wastewater, surface water, and drinking water. In particular, 11-nor-9-carboxy-(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) has been detected at concentrations up to 2590 and 169 ng L(-1) in untreated and treated wastewater, respectively, 79.9 ng L(-1) in surface water, and 1 ng L(-1) in drinking water. High removal of cannabinoids has been observed in wastewater treatment plants; this is likely a result of adsorption due to the low aqueous solubility of cannabinoids. Based on the estrogenicity and cytotoxicity studies and modelling, it has been predicted that THC and THC-COOH pose moderate risk for adverse impact on the environment. While chlorination and photo-oxidation have been shown to be effective in the removal of THC-COOH, they also produce by-products that are potentially more toxic than regulated disinfection by-products. The potential of indirect exposure to cannabinoids and their metabolites through recreational water is of great interest. As cannabinoids and especially their by-products may have adverse impacts on the environment and public health, more studies on their occurrence in various types of water and environmental systems, as well as on their environmental toxicity, would be required to accurately assess their impact on the environment and public health.","output":"A critical review on the detection, occurrence, fate, toxicity, and removal of cannabinoids in the water system and the environment()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Key Features of the UK-REACH Cohort (Profile in a nutshell) The UK-REACH Cohort was established to understand why ethnic minority healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of poorer outcomes from COVID-19 when compared to their white ethnic counterparts in the United Kingdom (UK).

University students living in school compound with groups and sharing a common cafeteria are more susceptible to contract and spread the virus. Risk perception multiplies fear and anxiety that triggers precautionary action. However, research is scant in this particular field. OBJECTIVE: To assess the perceived risk of COVID-19 and its associated factors among University Students in Northeast Ethiopia during school reopening. METHODS: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 682 Debre Berhan University students from December 1C15, 2020, when students just get back to school. Data was collected using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire. A multistage sampling technique was used to select study subjects. Data were cleaned and entered into Epi-Data version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25 software for analysis. Descriptive statistics, bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were run to summarize the results. RESULTS: The overall perceived risk of COVID-19 was 296 (43.4%), 95% CI (39.4C47.4). Age (AOR (CI) =3.27 (1.87C5.71), open relationship (AOR (CI) =3.17 (1.73C5.79), fathers education (AOR (CI) =2.29 (1.31C4.02), having diabetes (AOR (CI) =2.64 (1.15C6.07), and information source from ministry of health (MOH) (AOR (CI) =1.87 (1.27C2.75) had significantly high-risk perception.

This study aimed to investigate the evolutionary dynamics and spatiotemporal patterns of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the region. Materials and Methods: A total of 1491 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 10 Southeast Asian countries were downloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database on November 17, 2020. The evolutionary relationships were assessed using maximum likelihood (ML) and time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, and the phylogenetic clustering was tested using principal component analysis (PCA). The spatial patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread within Southeast Asia were inferred using the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) model. The effective population size (Ne) trajectory was inferred using the Bayesian Skygrid model. Results: Four major clades (including one potentially endemic) were identified based on the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree. Similar clustering was yielded by PCA; the first three PCs explained 46.9% of the total genomic variations among the samples. The time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and the evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Southeast Asia were estimated to be November 28, 2019 (September 7, 2019 to January 4, 2020) and 1.446  10(?3) (1.292  10(?3) to 1.613  10(?3)) substitutions per site per year, respectively. Singapore and Thailand were the two most probable root positions, with posterior probabilities of 0.549 and 0.413, respectively. There were high-support transmission links (Bayes factors exceeding 1,000) in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia; Malaysia involved the highest number (7) of inferred transmission links within the region. A twice-accelerated viral population expansion, followed by a temporary setback, was inferred during the early stages of the pandemic in Southeast Asia. Conclusions: With available genomic data, we illustrate the phylogeography and phylodynamics of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Southeast Asia. Continuous genomic surveillance and enhanced strategic collaboration should be listed as priorities to curb the pandemic, especially for regional communities dominated by developing countries.","output":"Molecular Phylogenesis and Spatiotemporal Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Southeast Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Identification of therapies to prevent severe COVID-19 remains a priority. We sought to determine whether hydroxychloroquine treatment for outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection could prevent hospitalization, mechanical ventilation or death. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in Alberta during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic without direct contact with participants. Community-dwelling individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] viral ribonucleic acid test) within the previous 4 days, and symptom onset within the previous 12 days, were randomly assigned to oral hydroxychloroquine or matching placebo for 5 days. Enrolment began Apr. 15, 2020. The primary outcome was the composite of hospitalization, invasive mechanical ventilation or death within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included symptom duration and disposition at 30 days. Safety outcomes, such as serious adverse events and mortality, were also ascertained. Outcomes were determined by telephone follow-up and administrative data. RESULTS: Among 4919 individuals with a positive RT-PCR test, 148 (10.2% of a planned 1446 patients) were randomly assigned, 111 to hydroxychloroquine and 37 to placebo. Of the 148 participants, 24 (16.2%) did not start the study drug. Four participants in the hydroxychloroquine group met the primary outcome (4 hospitalizations, 0 mechanical ventilation, 4 survived to 30 days) and none in the placebo group. Hydroxychloroquine did not reduce symptom duration (hazard ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.49-1.21). Recruitment was paused on May 22, 2020, when a since-retracted publication raised concerns about the safety of hydroxychloroquine for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Although we had not identified concerns in a safety review, enrolment was slower than expected among those eligible for the study, and cases within the community were decreasing. Recruitment goals were deemed to be unattainable and the trial was not resumed, resulting in a study underpowered to assess the effect of treatment with hydroxychloroquine and safety. INTERPRETATION: There was no evidence that hydroxychloroquine reduced symptom duration or prevented severe outcomes among outpatients with proven COVID-19, but the early termination of our study meant that it was underpowered.

The conformation of the glycoprotein in situ is distinct from the structure of the isolated trimeric ectodomain, showing that a splaying of the membrane distal domains is required to mediate contacts that form the lattice. The splaying of these domains is also coupled to changes in the structure of the stem region which is involved in membrane fusion, thereby linking HEFs membrane fusion conformation with its assembly on the virus surface.

Amid soaring contagion due to newer strains of the virus, it is imperative to design dynamic, spatiotemporal models to contain the spread of infection during future outbreaks of the same or variants of the virus. The reliance on existing prediction and contact tracing approaches on prior knowledge of inter- or intra-zone mobility renders them impracticable. We present a spatiotemporal approach that employs a network inference approach with sliding time windows solely on the date and number of daily infection numbers of zones within a geographical region to generate temporal networks capturing the influence of each zone on another. It helps analyze the spatial interaction among the hotspot or spreader zones and highly affected zones based on the flow of network contagion traffic. We apply the proposed approach to the daily infection counts of New York State as well as the states of USA to show that it effectively measures the phase shifts in the pandemic timeline. It identifies the spreaders and affected zones at different time points and helps infer the trajectory of the pandemic spread across the country. A small set of zones periodically exhibit a very high outflow of contagion traffic over time, suggesting that they act as the key spreaders of infection. Moreover, the strong influence between the majority of non-neighbor regions suggests that the overall spread of infection is a result of the unavoidable long-distance trips by a large number of people as opposed to the shorter trips at a county level, thereby informing future mitigation measures and public policies.","output":"Spatiotemporal tracing of pandemic spread from infection data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Identifying the extent of environmental contamination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential for infection control and prevention. The extent of environmental contamination has not been fully investigated in the context of severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. AIM: To investigate environmental SARS-CoV-2 contamination in the isolation rooms of severe COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy. METHODS: Environmental swab samples and air samples were collected from the isolation rooms of three COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia. Patients 1 and 2 received mechanical ventilation with a closed suction system, while patient 3 received high-flow oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was used to detect SARS-CoV-2; viral cultures were performed for samples not negative on rRT-PCR. FINDINGS: Of the 48 swab samples collected in the rooms of patients 1 and 2, only samples from the outside surfaces of the endotracheal tubes tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR. However, in patient 3's room, 13 of the 28 environmental samples (fomites, fixed structures, and ventilation exit on the ceiling) showed positive results. Air samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Viable viruses were identified on the surface of the endotracheal tube of patient 1 and seven sites in patient 3's room.

This pattern deviates from a decade-long trend before 2020 and the onset of COVID-19, during which the proportion of incarcerated Black people was declining.

AIMS: To describe the prevalence of WRMI among O&Gs in Australia and New Zealand, explore risk factors for such injuries, and evaluate their impact. METHODS: An online survey of Fellows of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists was conducted in July 2016. It comprised questions on personal attributes, type of work, site and cause of WRMI, if any and treatment required. RESULTS: We received responses from 765 O&Gs giving a response rate of 38.3% (765/1997). Four hundred and ten specialists (53.6%) reported suffering a WRMI at some point, including 252 (32.9%) who reported multiple injuries. In multivariable analysis, females had increased risk of WRMI (odds ratio (OR): 2.12; 95% CI: 1.54-2.91) and among generalists and subspecialists, gynaecological oncologists had highest risk for WRMI (OR: 3.13; 95% CI: 1.21-8.14). Commonest sites of injury were back (218/633, 34.4%) and shoulder (131/633, 20.7%). Laparoscopic surgery (117/633, 18.5%) was the commonest cause of injury. Treatment was required for 88.6% of injuries (561/633) including 8.4% (53/633) of cases which required surgery. Ongoing symptoms post-injury were reported for 52.1% of injuries (330/633) and in 25.8% (163/633) of instances the practitioner needed to modify their scope of work. CONCLUSION: This survey among a large cohort of O&Gs shows a high prevalence of WRMI with a profound negative impact on the practitioner and profession.

Distinctive microvascular abnormalities in COVID-19 include endothelial inflammation, disruption of intercellular junctions and microthrombi formation. A distinct COVID-19-associated coagulopathy along with increased cytokines and activation of platelets, endothelium and complement occur in COVID-19, which is more frequent with worsening disease severity. This proinflammatory milieu may result in immunothrombosis, a host defence mechanism that can become dysregulated, leading to excess formation of immunologically mediated thrombi which predominantly affect the microvasculature. The haemostatic and immune systems are intricately linked, and multifactorial processes are likely to contribute to VTE and immunothrombosis in COVID-19. This state-of-the-art review will explore the pathobiological mechanisms of immunothrombosis and VTE in COVID-19 focusing on: COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, pathology, endothelial dysfunction and haemostasis, the immune system and thrombosis, genetic associations and additional thrombotic mechanisms.

The primary aim of the study is to describe the chronology of lung pathologic changes in COVID-19 by using a post-mortem transbronchial lung cryobiopsy approach. Our secondary aim is to correlate the histologic findings with computed tomography patterns. SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, who died while intubated and mechanically ventilated, were enrolled. The procedure was performed 30 min after death, and all lung lobes sampled. Histopathologic analysis was performed on thirty-nine adequate samples from eight patients: two patients (illness duration < 14 days) showed early/exudative phase diffuse alveolar damage, while the remaining 6 patients (median illness duration32 days) showed progressive histologic patterns (3 with mid/proliferative phase; 3 with late/fibrotic phase diffuse alveolar damage, one of which with honeycombing). Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was positive predominantly in early-phase lesions. Histologic patterns and tomography categories were correlated: early/exudative phase was associated with ground-glass opacity, mid/proliferative lesions with crazy paving, while late/fibrous phase correlated with the consolidation pattern, more frequently seen in the lower/middle lobes. This study uses an innovative cryobiopsy approach for the post-mortem sampling of lung tissues from COVID-19 patients demonstrating the progression of fibrosis in time and correlation with computed tomography features.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records for diagnoses, clinical course, chest X-ray findings, laboratory data, and antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: All nine patients were misdiagnosed at the outpatient department between 07/2009 and 07/2017. They were diagnosed with septicemia and hemophagocytic syndrome, sepsis and hemophagocytic syndrome, severe infection, hepatitis and hemophagocytic syndrome, or upper respiratory tract infection. Among the nine patients, hepatic function examination showed decreased albumin and elevated C-reactive protein levels in all patients; alanine aminotransferase was increased and platelets were decreased in eight patients. Weil-Felix reaction was positive in three of nine patients. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated positive IgM antibody and EB virus-IgM in all nine patients; Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody was positive in seven patients. All nine patients underwent chest computed tomography; no abnormality was found in two patients. Patch shadow with increased density was found in seven patients, including four patients with right pleural effusion and two with bilateral pleural effusion. Bone marrow biopsy was performed in all nine patients and hemophagocytic cells were seen. The nine misdiagnosed cases were given multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics either successively or concomitantly before and after admission, but no effective antibiotics against Orientis tsutsugamushi were applied.

To explore the high infectivity mechanism, the charge distributions of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and variants of concern were calculated through a series of net charge calculation formulas. The results showed that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein had more positive charges than that of SARS-CoV. Further results showed that the variants had similar but higher positive charges than preexisting SARS-CoV-2. In particular, the Delta variant had the greatest increase in positive charges in S1 resulting in the highest infectivity. In particular, the S1 positive charge increased greatly in the Delta variant. The S1 positive charge increased, and due to the large negative charge of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), this resulted in a large increase in Coulombs force between S1 and ACE2. This finding agrees with the expectation that the positive charges in the spike protein result in more negative charges on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than that of SARS-CoV. Thus, the infectivity of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant may be evaluated preliminarily by calculating the charge distribution.","output":"The Analyses of High Infectivity Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and Its Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although low sodium intake (<2g/day) and high potassium intake (>35g/day) are proposed as public health interventions to reduce stroke risk, there is uncertainty about the benefit and feasibility of this combined recommendation on prevention of stroke and its subtypes. METHODS: We obtained random urine samples from 9,275 cases of acute first stroke and 9,726 matched controls (8,761 matched pairs for conditional analysis) from 27 countries and estimated the 24-hour sodium and potassium excretion, a surrogate for intake, using the Tanaka formula. Using multivariable conditional logistic regression, we determined the associations of estimated 24-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion with stroke and its subtypes. RESULTS: The mean estimated 24-hour sodium and potassium urinary excretion was 329g/day and 157g/day, with 001% of participants having both low sodium (<20g/day) and high potassium excretion (>35g/day). There was a moderate positive correlation between sodium and potassium excretion (r=04435, P<0.001) and between sodium excretion and blood pressure (P<0.001). Compared with an estimated urinary sodium excretion of 28-35g/day (second quartile, reference), higher (>426g/day) (OR 1.81;95%CI,1.65-2.00) and lower (<28g/day) sodium excretion (OR 1.39;95%CI,1.26-1.53) were significantly associated with increased risk of stroke. The stroke risk associated with the highest quartile of sodium intake (sodium excretion >426g/day) was significantly greater (P<0.001) for intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) (OR 2.38;95%CI,1.93-2.92) than for ischemic stroke (OR 1.67;95%CI,1.50-1.87), and greater for large vessel and small vessel ischemic stroke than for cardioembolic ischemic stroke. Urinary potassium was inversely and linearly associated with risk of stroke, and stronger for ischemic stroke than ICH (P=0.026). In an analysis of combined sodium and potassium excretion, the combination of high potassium intake (>158g/day) and moderate sodium intake (2.8-3.5 g/day) was associated with the lowest risk of stroke. CONCLUSION: The association of sodium intake and stroke is J-shaped, with high sodium intake a stronger risk factor for intracerebral haemorrhage than ischemic stroke. Our data suggest that moderate sodium intake - rather than low sodium intake - combined with high potassium intake may be associated with the lowest risk of stroke and expected to be a more feasible combined dietary target.","output":"Urinary Sodium and Potassium, and Risk of Ischaemic and Haemorrhagic Stroke (INTERSTROKE): a case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Words are malleable objects, influenced by events that are reflected in written texts.

Impaired proteostasis has been implicated as a potential cause of dementia, that can be therapeutically targeted to improve patient outcomes. This review aimed to collate all current evidence of the potential for targeting proteostasis with repurposed drugs as an intervention for age-related dementia and cognitive decline. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and Embase databases were searched from inception until 4th July 2017 for studies published in English. Interventional studies of repurposed proteostasis-modifying drugs in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy Body disease, vascular dementia, and cognitive aging, in either animal models or humans with change in cognition as the outcome were included. The SYRCLE and Cochrane tools were used to assess risk of bias for included studies. Results: Overall 47 trials, 38 animal and 9 human, were isolated for inclusion in this review. Drugs tested in animals and humans included lithium, rapamycin, rifampicin, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Drugs tested only in animals included Macrophage and Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factors, methylene blue, dantrolene, geranylgeranylacetone, minocycline and phenylbutyric acid. Lithium (n = 10 animal, n = 6 human) and rapamycin (n = 12 animal, n = 1 human) were the most studied proteostasis modifying drugs influencing cognition. Nine of ten animal studies of lithium showed a statistically significant benefit in Alzheimer's models. Rapamycin demonstrated a significant benefit in models of vascular dementia, aging, and Alzheimer's, but may not be effective in treating established Alzheimer's pathology. Lithium and nilotinib had positive outcomes in human studies including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients respectively, while a human study of rifampicin in Alzheimer's failed to demonstrate benefit. Microdose lithium showed a strongly significant benefit in both animals and humans. While the risk of bias was relatively low in human studies, the risk of bias in animal studies was largely unclear. Conclusion: Overall, the collective findings support the hypothesis that targeting proteostasis for treatment of dementia may be beneficial, and therefore future studies in humans with repurposed proteostasis modifying drugs are warranted.

Only a few thousand viruses have been isolated, sequenced, and assigned a taxonomy, which further limits the ability to identify and quantify viruses in the microbiome. Additionally, the vast diversity of viruses represents a challenge for classification, not only in constructing a viral taxonomy, but also in identifying similarities between a virus genotype and its phenotype. However, the diversity of viral sequences can be leveraged to classify their sequences in metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples. Methods To identify and quantify viruses in transcriptomic and genomic samples, we developed a dynamic programming algorithm for creating a classification tree out of 715,672 metagenome viruses. To create the classification tree, we clustered proportional similarity scores generated from the k-mer profiles of each of the metagenome viruses. We then integrated the viral classification tree with the NCBI taxonomy for use with ParaKraken (a parallelized version of Kraken), a metagenomic/transcriptomic classifier. The resulting Kraken2 database of the metagenomic viruses can be found here: https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1615774 and is compatible with Kraken2. Results To illustrate the breadth of our utility for classifying viruses with ParaKraken, especially samples without virus-induced pathophysiology, we analyzed data from a plant metagenome study identifying the differences between two Populus genotypes in three different compartments and on a human metatranscriptome study identifying the differences between Autism Spectrum Disorder patients and controls in post mortem brain tissue. In the Populus study, we identified genotype and compartment-specific viral signatures, while in the Autism study we identified a significant increase in abundance of eight viral sequences in post mortem brains. We also show the potential accuracy for classifying viruses by utilizing both the JGI and NCBI viral databases to identify the uniqueness of viral sequences. Finally, we utilize the NCBI databases to identify pathogenic viruses in known COVID-19 and cassava brown streak virus infection samples to validate the potential usefulness of classifying viruses. Conclusion Viruses represent an essential component of the microbiome. The ability to classify viruses represents the compulsory first step in better understanding their role in the microbiome. Our viral classification method allows for a more complete identification of viral sequences than previous methods. This will improve identification of associations between viruses and their hosts as well as viruses and other microbiome members and can be used with any tool that utilizes a taxonomy for classification (such as Kraken).","output":"A k-mer based approach for virus classification identifies coronavirus infections and viral associations in human and plant microbiomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CEL NAUKOWY: Celem artyku?u jest analiza przewidywanych i widocznych ju? dzisiaj konsekwencji kryzysu pandemii w wymiarze politycznym, gospodarczym, spo?ecznym i religijnym PROBLEM I METODY BADAWCZE: Autor korzysta z bogatego spektrum wypowiedzi wsp?czesnych analitykw kryzysu COVID-19, dokonuj?c przegl?du ich opinii oraz oceniaj?c ich rzeczywiste podstawy Przywo?uje pogl?dy i prognozy formu?owane w ?wiecie zachodnich demokracji przez politykw, naukowcw, hierarchw Ko?cio?a PROCES WYWODU: Proces wywodu polega na analizie wsp?czesnych problemw zwi?zanych z zaraz? w Europie i USA Drugim stopniem analiz jest sformu?owanie domniema co do przysz?ych konsekwencji kryzysu WYNIKI ANALIZY NAUKOWEJ: Najistotniejsz? konkluzj? artyku?u jest prba rozpoznania konsekwencji kryzysu w kluczowych dziedzinach ?ycia zachodnich demokracji Zdaniem autora obecny kryzys przyczynia si? do wzrostu podejrzliwo?ci spo?eczestw zachodnich wobec pastwa demoliberalnego, ktre w sytuacji pandemii stara si? uwypukli? swoj? sk?onno?? do dzia?a autorytarnych Chodzi tu przede wszystkim o oddzia?ywanie w duchu interwencjonizmu gospodarczego, centralizmu, protekcjonizmu WNIOSKI, INNOWACJE, REKOMENDACJE: Autor dochodzi do wniosku, i? obecny kryzys powoduje radykalizacj? istniej?cych ju? wcze?niej idei Jego zdaniem ani elity polityczne, ani te? hierarchowie Ko?cio?a nie s? w stanie zachowa? rwnowagi intelektualnej wobec kryzysu COVID-19, ktry nazywa on kryzysem ?rozchwiania\\" Ostatecznie nie wiadomo, jaka czeka nas przysz?o??

Despite their distinctive characteristics compared to native students, the mental health issues of international students only started receiving attention very recently. So far, the literature on this topic lacks a comprehensive overview of its sub-topic and trending issues. By using bibliometric analysis, this research aims to fulfil this gap and provide a review of the extant literature about MHIS. Specifically, this study aims to (i) draw the growth trajectory and geographic distribution of the literature on MHIS; (ii) identify the documents and authors that have the greatest impact, generally and locally, within the major topic clusters of the literature on MHIS; and (iii) identify the most researched keywords in the literature on MHIS over time. The results have shown that academic documents about international students mental health are increasing in number and becoming more extensive content-wise.

Provision of support for these challenges is complicated by the high number of people requiring support and the need to maintain physical distancing. Text4Hope, a daily supportive SMS text messaging program, was launched in Canada to mitigate the negative mental health impacts of the pandemic among Canadians. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the changes in the stress, anxiety, and depression levels of subscribers to the Text4Hope program after 6 weeks of exposure to daily supportive SMS text messages. METHODS: We used self-administered, empirically supported web-based questionnaires to assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of Text4Hope subscribers. Perceived stress, anxiety, and depression were measured with the 10-Item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Generalized Anxiety DisorderC7 (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health QuestionnaireC9 (PHQ-9) scale at baseline and sixth week time points. Moderate or high perceived stress, likely generalized anxiety disorder, and likely major depressive disorder were assessed using cutoff scores of 14 for the PSS-10, 10 for the GAD-7, and 10 for the PHQ-9, respectively. At 6 weeks into the program, 766 participants had completed the questionnaires at both time points. RESULTS: At the 6-week time point, there were statistically significant reductions in mean scores on the PSS-10 and GAD-7 scales but not on the PHQ-9 scale. Effect sizes were small overall. There were statistically significant reductions in the prevalence rates of moderate or high stress and likely generalized anxiety disorder but not likely major depressive disorder for the group that completed both the baseline and 6-week assessments. The largest reductions in mean scores and prevalence rates were for anxiety (18.7% and 13.5%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Text4Hope is a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible means of implementing a population-level psychological intervention. This service demonstrated significant reductions in anxiety and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic and could be used as a population-level mental health intervention during natural disasters and other emergencies.

Information on the respiratory system mechanical characteristics of this disease is limited. The aim of this study is to describe the respiratory system mechanical properties of ventilated COVID-19 patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Patients consecutively admitted to the medical intensive care unit at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City, USA, from April 19 to May 1, 2020, were prospectively studied; final date of follow-up was May 1, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: At the time of first patient contact, ventilator information was collected including mode, settings, peak airway pressure, plateau pressure, and total positive end expiratory pressure. Indices of airflow resistance and respiratory system compliance were calculated and analyzed. MAIN RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 58 years. 6 out of 12 (50%) patients were female. Of the 21 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients on invasive mechanical ventilation, 9 patients who were actively breathing on the ventilator were excluded. All the patients included were on volume-control mode. Mean [standard deviation] ventilator indices were: resistive pressure 19 [4] cmH2O, airway resistance 20 [4] cmH2O/L/s, and respiratory system static compliance 39 [16] ml/cmH2O. These values are consistent with abnormally elevated resistance to airflow and reduced respiratory system compliance.

In this paper, we analyze the emergence and large-scale expansion of a community-based environmental protection system (the Voluntary Environmental Agents Program - VEA Program) in the Brazilian Amazon and identify factors that have determined its success since its inception, 25 years ago. Collective actions to protect the environment in the region have been undertaken by local people for at least 40 years, before their legal regulation in 2001 by the federal government of Brazil, and by the Amazonas state in 2007. The system is based on territorial surveillance and monitoring, and on guidelines for the better use of the territory and its natural resources. Between 1995 and 2020, the VEA Program expanded into the two protected areas where it was first implemented reaching approximately 9 thousand km2 of area protected by the system. The number of people participating also grew in this period by around 2050%, as did the participation of women, which grew by 5600%. The system was replicated in 37 protected areas in central Amazonia, and currently covers almost 200 thousand km2 of Amazon rainforest. From our analyses we unveil four main factors that may have allowed the VEA Program to expand and flourish: (a) the communities' previous demand for an effective control system, (b) its legal formalization and regulation, (c) the support from external institutions, and (d) the consolidation of community-based management programs to fund actions. These factors shall be further investigated as to confirm their critical role in the success of the VEA Program. We demonstrate that this community-based environmental protection system has established itself as a legitimate form of social control, and as a mechanism of socio-environmental governance in the areas in which it operates. By allowing more effective protection of territories, it generates consensus amongst users for the adequate management of natural resources, especially in contexts where government's actions are absent or inefficient. We claim that this system can be replicated in various parts of the world.","output":"Community-based environmental protection in the Brazilian Amazon: Recent history, legal landmarks and expansion across protected areas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In light of the disproportionate risk of hospitalization and death attributable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among racial and ethnic minority groups, parental attitudes and concerns regarding school reopening were assessed by race and ethnicity using data from three online CARAVAN omnibus surveys conducted during July 8-12, 2020, by ENGINE Insights.* Survey participants included 858 parents who had children and adolescents in kindergarten through grade 12 (school-aged children) living in their household.

RECENT FINDINGS: The most preponderant pornography use motivations were self-exploration and seeking education. In line with the international situation in screening PPU, inconsistent assessment resulted in fluctuant prevalence in China. Fortunately, several screening scales were confirmed valid in Chinese sample. The symptoms of PPU among Chinese were similar with samples from other Western countries.

Evidence suggests that infection incidence rates (IRs) are rebounding after easing of social restrictions (eg, mask mandates). The reemergence of infectious disease complicates efforts to manage the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To examine IRs of frequently occurring infectious diseases after a successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign in Israel and cessation of social restrictions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using records for respiratory and gastrointestinal infectious diseases at 209 community clinics in southern Israel from 2017 to 2021. Included patients attended community clinics from January 1, 2017, to June 30, 2021. EXPOSURES: Incidence of infectious diseases was estimated in the first 3 months after the easing of social restrictions (ie, April-June 2021) across age groups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age-specific and disease-specific weekly IRs per 100 000 population for April to June were compared between 2017 and 2021 and expected current IR was estimated using segmented linear regression. Growth rates of respiratory infections across years and weekly diagnoses detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction testing were also compared. RESULTS: Among 386 711 patients with a total of 1 221 568 visits to community clinics, the mean (SD) age was 27.29 (23.93) years, and there were 202 494 (52.3%) male patients and 184 217 (47.7%) female patients. Children aged 0 to 3 years had significantly increased rates of respiratory and gastrointestinal infection diagnoses (IR ratio, 2.64; 95% CI, 2:30-2.91; P < .001). In addition, incidence of nonCSARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections were significantly increased across age groups (IR ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.56-1.94; P < .001).

In this study, we reviewed proteases of SARS-CoV-2 based on related articles published in journals indexed by Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar from December 2019 to April 2020. Based on this study, it is concluded that this coronavirus has about 76% genotype similarity to SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Also, similarities between these two viruses have been found in the mechanism of entry into host cells and pathogenicity. ACE 2, the angiotensin convertase enzyme 2, has roles in the Renin- Angiotensin-Aldosterone system (RAAS) and blood pressure regulation. Some mechanisms have been reported for the role of ACE 2 in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. For example, the interaction between the ACE 2 receptor and spike protein mediated by TMPRSS2, Cathepsin B/L, and other enzymes is responsible for the entry of the virus into human cells and pathogenicity. Some host cell endosomal enzymes are necessary to cleavage coronavirus spike protein and cause binding to their common receptor.

For many, this ongoing experience not only involves the burden of caregiving but also the burden of grief as their loved-ones newfound medical condition can result in the loss of the person they previously knew. Dramatic cognitive, behavioral, and personality changes, often leave caregivers bereft of the significant relationship they shared with the affected person prior to the illness or injury. This results in what we term conditions of acquired non-death interpersonal loss (NoDIL). Current approaches to these losses use an amalgam of models drawn from both death and non-death loss. Despite their utility, these frameworks have not adequately addressed the unique processes occurring in the interpersonal sphere where the grieving caregiver needs to reach some modus vivendi regarding the triad of who the person was, who they are now, and who they will yet become. In this paper we propose a process-based model which addresses cognitive-emotional-behavioral challenges caregivers meet in the face of their new reality. These require a revision of the interpersonal schemas and the relationships that takes into account the ongoing interactions with the affected family member. The model and its utility to identify adaptive and maladaptive responses to NoDIL is elaborated upon with clinical material obtained from caregivers of people diagnosed with major neuro-cognitive disorder and pediatric traumatic brain injury. The article concludes with implications for theory, research and clinical intervention.","output":"Caregivers Grief in Acquired Non-death Interpersonal Loss (NoDIL): A Process Based Model With Implications for Theory, Research, and Intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals with a history of allergy are potentially at risk of suffering from adverse effects after COVID-19 vaccination. We sought to assess the tolerance towards the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in allergic patients. To address this issue, we used a questionnaire conducted on-line in a group of medical professionals who were vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. A total of 1808 respondents, out of whom 1707 received two doses of the vaccine, returned the questionnaire. Local reactions after injection were more frequent in allergic individuals after both doses (swelling p = 0.0003). Systemic adverse events (AE-SYS) occurred more often after the second than the first dose in both groups (allergic persons: 77.29% vs. 41.06%);vomiting and arthralgia occurred more often in allergic subjects (p = 0.0009). AE-SYS in allergic individuals lasted longer than in non-allergic ones after the first (p = 0.01) and the second dose (p = 0.0009). Allergic reactions after vaccination were reported more frequently in allergic subjects: after the first dose (p = 0.00001) and after the second dose (p = 0.001). Rhinitis was the most frequent symptom observed more often in allergic patients. No severe allergic reactions occurred during the full cycle of vaccination. Although the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is tolerated worse by allergic than non-allergic individuals, the occurring adverse symptoms are mild and do not preclude a successful completion of the vaccination cycle. The presence of symptoms suggestive of allergy does not constitute a condition of increased risk of developing clinically significant adverse events following Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination.","output":"Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Tolerance in Allergic versus Non-Allergic Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emerging cross-sectional reports find that the COVID-19 pandemic and related social restrictions negatively affect lifestyle behaviours and mental health in general populations. AIMS: To study the longitudinal impact of COVID-19 on work practices, lifestyle and well-being among desk workers during shelter-at-home restrictions. METHODS: We added follow-up after completion of a clinical trial among desk workers to longitudinally measure sedentary behaviour, physical activity, sleep, diet, mood, quality of life and work-related health using validated questionnaires and surveys. We compared outcomes assessed before and during COVID-19 shelter-at-home restrictions. We assessed whether changes in outcomes differed by remote working status (always, changed to or never remote) using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). RESULTS: Participants (N = 112; 69% female; mean (SD) age = 45.4 (12.3) years; follow-up = 13.5 (6.8) months) had substantial changes to work practices, including 72% changing to remote work. Deleterious changes from before to during shelter-at-home included: 1.3 (3.5)-h increase in non-workday sedentary behaviour; 0.7 (2.8)-point worsening of sleep quality; 8.5 (21.2)-point increase in mood disturbance; reductions in five of eight quality of life subscales; 0.5 (1.1)-point decrease in work-related health (P < 0.05). Other outcomes, including diet, physical activity and workday sedentary behaviour, remained stable (P &#8805; 0.05). Workers who were remote before and during the pandemic had greater increases in non-workday sedentary behaviour and stress, with greater declines in physical functioning. Wake time was delayed overall by 41 (61) min, and more so in workers who changed to remote. CONCLUSIONS: Employers should consider supporting healthy lifestyle and well-being among desk workers during pandemic-related social restrictions, regardless of remote working status.","output":"Covid-19 shelter-at-home and work, lifestyle and well-being in desk workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal specimens (NPS) are commonly used for SARS-CoV-2 testing but can be uncomfortable for patients. Self-collected saliva or anterior nasal specimens (ANS) for SARS-CoV-2 detection are less invasive but the sensitivity of these specimen types has not been thoroughly evaluated. METHODS: During September-November 2020, 730 adults undergoing SARS-CoV-2 testing at community testing events and homeless shelters in Denver provided self-collected saliva and ANS specimens before NPS collection and answered a short survey about symptoms and specimen preference. Specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR; viral culture was performed on a subset of specimens positive by rRT-PCR. Sensitivity of saliva and ANS for SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR was measured against NPS. Subgroup analyses included test outcomes by symptom status and culture results. RESULTS: Sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR appeared higher for saliva than for ANS (85% vs. 80%) and among symptomatic participants than among those without symptoms (94% vs. 29% for saliva; 87% vs. 50% for ANS). Among participants with culture-positive SARS-CoV-2 by any specimen type, sensitivity of saliva and ANS by rRT-PCR was 94% and 100%, respectively. Saliva and ANS were equally preferred by participants; most would undergo NPS again despite being least preferred. CONCLUSIONS: Saliva was slightly more sensitive than ANS for SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR. Both saliva and ANS reliably detected SARS-CoV-2 among participants with symptoms. Self-collected saliva and ANS offer practical advantages, are preferred by patients, and might be most useful for testing people with COVID-19 symptoms.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 detection on self-collected saliva or anterior nasal specimens compared with healthcare personnel-collected nasopharyngeal specimens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, two educators offer their reflections on the impact of relational pedagogy in the form of an extended relational approach to the launch and delivery of an Executive MBA programme for post-experience learners in the midst of a universal experience of the global pandemic. The pandemic exacerbated the increasing influence of consumerism on student identity and effectively destroyed any prospect of a normal student experience together with its perceived value. A relational approach extending theories of relational pedagogy beyond the relationship of the educator and the learner is offered as a counter to this, allowing the educators to mediate the relationships between the learner, the content and the learning process, and to navigate the additional interfaces of post-experience, online learning. The paper emerged from collective reflection on practice and the findings support the contention that a relational approach addresses the more negative aspects of academic accountability when couched in terms of economic exchange. Envisioning education as a set of processes intended to enhance relationships, three themes are drawn out and are illustrated with examples from practice. These themes are digital residency, precarity and judgement, and weird intimacy. The findings offer new perspectives and enable recommendations to enhance both online and present in person education and learning.","output":"You what?!

Instrumental observations made by the Geophysical Monitoring Center (GMC) at the Institute of Geosphere Dynamics (IGD), Russian Academy of Sciences, show that the quarantine-related decrease in production activity caused significant changes in the amplitude and spectral characteristics of acoustic noise above the city, as compared to the long-term averages. During the quarantine period, the amplitude of the main spectral components and the average amplitude of acoustic noise decreased by more than two times. The diurnal variation of the amplitude of noise caused by production activities in the daytime was much less evident.

The Home Se-Cure project included cancer patients living near Galliera Hospital. Patients received home visits by registered nurses (RNs), whoperformed blood tests and delivered cancer therapies. Patients were instructed to take drugs after blood test results and therapy confirmation by oncologists. Sixty-six patients decided to participate and 38 declined the service. A customer satisfaction questionnaire was administered to a subgroup of patients participating in the project. The most prevalent disease in the HSC group was prostate cancer. The mean age of the patients in HSC was 78.4 years and 68.9 in the decliner group. The majority of the HSC participants appreciated the project because they could stay at home (71%) and reduce the risk of COVID-19 contagion (67.7%). Compared to decliners, the time the study group saved was 2033 hours.

Plaque levels of 28 microbial species, especially those of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Tannerella forsythia, and serum and salivary levels of IgA and IgG against these five species were determined. Additionally, LPS activity was measured. High CRS associated strongly with all IgA/IgG antibody and LPS levels in saliva, whereas in serum the associations were not that obvious. In the final logistic regression model, the best predictors of high CRS were saliva IgA burden against the five species (OR 7.04, 95% CI 2.25-22.0), IgG burden (3.79, 1.78-8.08), LPS (2.19, 1.38-3.47), and the sum of 17 subgingival Gram-negative species (6.19, 2.10-18.3).

While greatly emphasizing protection, most guiding documents have neglected to support and protect the psychosocial needs of frontline health care workers and patients and their families during provision of palliative and end-of-life care. Consequently, the stage has been set for increased anxiety, moral distress, and moral injury and extreme moral hazard. A family-centered approach to care has been unilaterally relinquished to a secondary and nonessential role during the current crisis. This phenomenon violates a foundational public health principle, namely, to apply the least restrictive means to achieve good for the many. Instead, there has been widespread adoption of utilitarian and paternalistic approaches. In many cases the foundational principles of palliative care have also been neglected. No circumstance, even a global public health emergency, should ever cause health care providers to deny their ethical obligations and human commitment to compassion. The lack of responsive protocols for family visitation, particularly at the end of life, is an important gap in the current recommendations for pandemic triage and contingency planning. A stepwise approach to hospital visitation using a tiered, standardized process for responding to emerging clinical circumstances and individual patients' needs should be considered, following the principle of proportionality.

Growing evidence suggests that COVID-19 is a systemic illness that primarily injures the vascular endothelium, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. SARS-CoV-2 infection is believed to trigger a cytokine storm that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of endothelialitis and vascular injury, eventually leading to respiratory and multi-organ failure in COVID-19 patients. We used a multiplex immunoassay to systematically profile and compare 65 inflammatory cytokines/chemokines/growth factors in plasma samples from 24 hospitalized (severe/critical) COVID-19 patients, 14 mild/moderate cases, and 13 healthy controls (HCs). Patients with severe/critical and mild/moderate COVID-19 had significantly higher plasma levels of 20 analytes than HCs. Surprisingly, only one cytokine (MIF) was among these altered analytes, while the rest were chemokines and growth factors. In addition, only MMP-1 and VEGF-A were significantly elevated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to mild/moderate cases. Given that excessive MMP-1 plays a central role in tissue destruction in a wide variety of vascular diseases and that elevated VEGF-A, an EC activation marker, increases vascular permeability, we further studied MMP-1 enzymatic activity and other EC activation markers such as soluble forms of CD146, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1. We found that plasma MMP-1 enzymatic activity and plasma levels of MMP-1 and EC activation markers were highly dysregulated in COVID-19 patients. Some dysregulations were associated with patient age or gender, but not with race. Our results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients have distinct inflammatory profiles that are distinguished from the cytokine storms in other human diseases.

Our secondary objectives were to determine which types of medications older adults may be more likely to restrict and to determine factors that influence these decisions. Design Cross-sectional survey experiment in which participants read 6 scenarios, each stating they had a three-day supply of a particular medication remaining. Setting and participants National web-based survey distributed to 1,457 U.S. adults 65 years and older by Dynata during March 25 C April 1, 2020. Outcome measures Participants reported whether they would go to a pharmacy, have a medication delivered, or restrict use of each medication. They reported their perceptions and experiences with COVID-19, health risk factors, preferences for more or less care (Medical Maximizer-Minimizer), medication attitudes (Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire), health literacy, prescription insurance status, and demographics. Results Most participants (84%) were told to shelter in place, but only 12% reported attempting to obtain extra medications. Participants most often reported that they would go to the pharmacy to obtain each medication (range tramadol 48.9% to insulin 64.9%), except for zolpidem which they were most likely to restrict (45.4%). Participants who reported risk factors for COVID-19 (beyond age) were just as likely to go to the pharmacy as those without. In multinomial logistic regression analyses, women and the oldest participants were more likely to seek delivery of medications. Restricting medications was most common for 2 symptom-focused medications (tramadol and zolpidem), and both demographic factors (e.g., gender) and beliefs (e.g., medical maximizing-minimizing preferences) were associated with such decisions.

Severely injured patients are often in continuous need of intensive care and ventilator treatment. The question arises, whether restrictions related to COVID-19 have led to a decrease in severely injured patients and thus to an increase in intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all seriously injured patients with an injury severity score (ISS) 16 was performed between 17 March and 30 April 2020 at a level 1 trauma center in Germany. The mechanism of injury and the ISS were recorded. Further data were collected as to whether it was a work-related accident, a documented suicide attempt and if surgery was necessary in the first 24 h after arrival in hospital. Data from 2018 and 2019 served as a control group. RESULTS: There was no substantial difference in the total number of seriously injured patients (2018 n = 30, 2019 n = 23, 2020 n = 27). Furthermore, there was no relevant difference in the number of patients needing intensive care or ventilator treatment when leaving the shock room. The number of patients needing an operative intervention within the first 24 h after arriving at hospital was slightly higher in 2020. The mean ISS was at a constant level during all 3 years. In 2020 there was no polytraumatized motorbike rider, who did not have a work-related accident (2018 n = 5, 2019 n = 4, 2020 n = 0). A noticeable increase in work-related accidents was observed (2018: 10%, 2019: 26.1%, 2020 44.4%). DISCUSSION: Restrictions related to COVID-19 did not lead to a reduction in seriously injured patients needing ICU care. Due to the monocentric data analysis there is room for misinterpretation. In general, intensive care and operating capacities should be managed with adequate consideration for seriously injured patients even in times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

As many commercial antibody tests are either time-consuming or tend to produce false negative or false positive results when only one antigen is considered, we developed an automated, flow-based chemiluminescence microarray immunoassay (CL-MIA) that allows for the detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike protein (S1 fragment), and nucleocapsid protein (N) in human serum and plasma in less than 8 min. The CoVRapid CL-MIA was tested with a set of 65 SARS-CoV-2 serology positive or negative samples, resulting in 100% diagnostic specificity and 100% diagnostic sensitivity, thus even outcompeting commercial tests run on the same sample set. Additionally, the prospect of future quantitative assessments (i.e., quantifying the level of antibodies) was demonstrated. Due to the fully automated process, the test can easily be operated in hospitals, medical practices, or vaccination centers, offering a valuable tool for COVID-19 serosurveillance.

METHODS In a single-centre, controlled, randomised study, patients were prescribed dapagliflozin in addition to standard therapy, or were in receipt of standard therapy. The prespecified outcome was renal function deterioration; the secondary outcomes were the development of resistance to diuretics, weight loss, death during hospitalisation and the rehospitalisation or death for any reason within 30 days following discharge. RESULTS 102 patients were included (73.411.7 years, 57.8% men). The average left ventricular ejection fraction was 44.9%14.7%, the average N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 4706 (1757; 11 244) pg/mL, the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 51.619.5 mL/min. eGFR decreased 48 hours after randomisation in the dapagliflozin group (-4.2 (-11.03; 2.28) mL/min vs 0.3 (-6; 6) mL/min; p=0.04) but did not differ between the groups on discharge (54.7119.18 mL/min and 58.9224.65 mL/min; p=0.36). The incidence of worsening renal function did not differ (34.4% vs 15.2%; p=0.07). In the dapagliflozin group, there was less tendency to increase the dose of loop diuretics (14% vs 30%; p=0.048), lower average doses of loop diuretics (78.4638.95 mg/day vs 102.8231.26 mg/day; p=0.001) and more significant weight loss (4100 (2950; 5750) g vs 3000 (1380; 4650) g; p=0.02). In-hospital mortality was 7.8% (4(8%) in the dapagliflozin and 4 (7.7%) in the control group (p=0.95). The number of deaths within 30 days following discharge in the dapagliflozin group and in the control group was 9 (19%) and 12 (25%), p=0.55; the number of rehospitalisations was 14 (29%) and 17 (35%), respectively (p=0.51). CONCLUSION The use of dapagliflozin was associated with a more pronounced weight loss and less need to increase diuretic therapy without significant deterioration of the renal function.

Although SILS achieves essentially the same goal as NOTES (a nearly invisible scar in the umbilicus), it does not carry the significant potential risks of a transluminal approach. The SILS approach has been most commonly described for cholecystectomy and appendectomy. The authors describe a novel application for this approach in the placement of a feeding jejunostomy tube. The described application for this technique is the first to be reported. METHODS The authors describe use of the technique for two intensive care unit (ICU) patients requiring long-term postpyloric tube feeds. Access was obtained through the umbilicus with the SILS port. The selected loop of the jejunum was exteriorized through this incision, and the feeding tube was placed. The loop was returned into the abdomen, and the SILS port was replaced in the incision. Under laparoscopic visualization and guidance, the feeding tube was brought externally through a predetermined site in the left midabdomen. RESULTS Two patients underwent SILS jejunostomy tube placement. The average operating time was 42.5 min. No intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications occurred. Tube feedings were started on postoperative day 1 for both patients, with good bowel function. CONCLUSION The SILS technique for jejunostomy placement is a promising and feasible alternative to the current methods. It is less invasive than the open approach while providing complete intraabdominal visualization. It is less technically demanding than the direct percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ) approach and avoids the risks and difficulties associated with it. The same benefits of other SILS procedures are evident in this application. The authors believe a series study will further highlight long-term benefits and any potential complications.","output":"A novel application for single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS): SIL jejunostomy feeding tube placement."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection prominently affects the respiratory system, and patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are at an increased risk of developing respiratory conditions.

ABSTRACT: Aedes aegypti, the mosquito species transmitting dengue, zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses, is fully adapted to thrive in urban areas. The temporal activity of this mosquito, however, varies within urban areas which might imply different transmission risk. In this work, we hypothesize that temporal differences in mosquito activity patterns are determined by local environmental conditions. Hence, we explore the existence of groups of temporal patterns in weekly time series of Ae. aegypti ovitraps records (2017C2019) by means of time series clustering. Next, with the aim of predicting risk in places with no mosquito field data, we use machine learning classification tools to assess the association of temporal patterns with environmental variables derived from satellite imagery and predict temporal patterns over the city area to finally test the relationship with dengue incidence. We found three groups of temporal patterns that showed association with land cover diversity, variability in vegetation and humidity and, heterogeneity measured by texture indices estimated over buffer areas surrounding ovitraps. Dengue incidence on a neighborhood basis showed a weak but positive association with the percentage of pixels belonging to only one of the temporal patterns detected. The understanding of the spatial distribution of temporal patterns and their environmental determinants might then become highly relevant to guide the allocation of prevention and potential interventions.

Rapid clearance of pathogens allows for a quick return to a healthy state and increased survival. Pathogen-targeted approaches to combating infection have inherent limitations, including their pathogen-specific nature, the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and poor vaccine efficacy, among others. Another way to survive an infection is to tolerate the alterations to homeostasis that occur during a disease state through a process called host tolerance or resilience, which is independent from pathogen burden. Alterations in homeostasis during infection are numerous and include tissue damage, increased inflammation, metabolic changes, temperature changes, and changes in respiration. Given its importance and sensitivity, the lung is a good system for understanding host tolerance to infectious disease. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children under five worldwide. One reason for this is because when the pulmonary system is altered dramatically it greatly impacts the overall health and survival of a patient. Targeting host pathways involved in maintenance of pulmonary host tolerance during infection could provide an alternative therapeutic avenue that may be broadly applicable across a variety of pathologies. In this review, we will summarize recent findings on tolerance to host lung infection. We will focus on the involvement of innate immune responses in tolerance and how an initial viral lung infection may alter tolerance mechanisms in leukocytic, epithelial, and endothelial compartments to a subsequent bacterial infection. By understanding tolerance mechanisms in the lung we can better address treatment options for deadly pulmonary infections.","output":"Surviving Deadly Lung Infections: Innate Host Tolerance Mechanisms in the Pulmonary System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus swept around the world in 2020, outpacing public health efforts to contain it, many everyday human mobilities were brought to an abrupt halt, while others were drastically reorganized.

One area that is severely affected is ear, nose and throat (ENT)/laryngology where speech and language therapists (SLTs) engage in a diverse range of practice with patients with a range of conditions, including voice disorders, airway problems, and head and neck cancers (HNCs). A large majority of these patients are in high\\\\risk categories, and many specialized clinical practices are vulnerable. In addition, workforce and research issues are challenged in both the immediate context and the future. AIMS: To discuss the threats and opportunities from the COVID\\\\19 pandemic for SLTs in ENT/laryngology with specific reference to clinical practice, workforce and research leadership. METHODS & PROCEDURES: The relevant sections of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) health systems building blocks framework (2007) were used to structure the study. Expert agreement was determined by an iterative process of multiple\\\\group discussions, the use of all recent relevant policy documentation, and other literature and shared documentation/writing. The final paper was verified and agreed by all authors. MAIN CONTRIBUTION: The main threats to ENT/laryngology SLT clinical services include increased patient complexity related to COVID\\\\19 voice and airway problems, delayed HNC diagnosis, reduced access to instrumental procedures and inequitable care provision. The main clinical opportunities include the potential for new modes of service delivery and collaborations, and harnessing SLT expertise in non\\\\instrumental assessment. There are several workforce issues, including redeployment (and impact on current services), training implications and psychological impact on staff. Workforce opportunities exist for service innovation and potential extended ENT/SLT practice roles. Research is threatened by a reduction in immediate funding calls and high competition. Current research is affected by very limited access to participants and the ability to conduct face\\\\to\\\\face and instrumental assessments. However, research opportunities may result in greater collaboration, and changes in service delivery necessitate robust investigation and evaluation. A new national set of research priorities is likely to emerge. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: The immediate impact of the pandemic has resulted in major disruption to all aspects of clinical delivery, workforce and research for ENT/laryngology SLT. It is unclear when any of these areas will resume operations and whether permanent changes to clinical practice, professional remits and research priorities will follow. However, significant opportunity exists in the post\\\\COVID era to re\\\\evaluate current practice, embrace opportunities and evaluate new ways of working. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT: ENT/laryngology SLTs manage patients with a range of conditions, including voice disorders, airway problems and HNCs. The diverse scope of clinical practice involves highly specialized assessment and treatment practices in patients in high\\\\risk categories. A large majority of active research projects in this field are patient focused and involve instrumental assessment. The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has created both opportunities and threats for ENT SLT clinical services, workforce and research. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE: This study provides a discussion of the threats and opportunities from the COVID\\\\19 pandemic for ENT/laryngology SLT with specific reference to clinical practice, workforce and research leadership. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WORK? The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has resulted in major disruption to all aspects of clinical delivery, workforce and research for ENT/laryngology SLT. Changes to clinical practice, professional remits and research priorities are of indeterminant duration at this time, and some components could be permanent.

RESULTS: One hundred nine medical oncologists from 18 countries in Europe (n = 93), United States (n = 5), and Latin America (n = 11) answered the survey. A systematic tracing of COVID-19-positive patients was continued in the postacute phase by 77.1% of the centers; 64.2% of the respondents participated in a local registry and 56% in international or national registries of infected patients. Treatment adaptations were introduced, and surgery was the most affected modality being delayed or canceled in more than 10% of patients in 34% of the centers, whereas early cessation of palliative treatment was reported in 32.1% of the centers; 64.2% of respondents reported paying attention to avoid undertreatments. The use of telemedicine has been largely increased. Similarly, virtual tools are increasingly used particularly for medical education and international or national or multidisciplinary meetings. 60.6% of the participants reduced clinical activity, and 28.4% compensated by increasing their research activity.

Inefficiencies in referral systems in high-income countries are more pronounced than lower and middle-income countries. Primary care practitioners play a major role in determining which patients are referred to surgeon and might represent an opportunity to improve this situation. With conventional methods of referrals, surgery clinics are often overcrowded with non-surgical referrals and surgical patients experience longer waiting times as a consequence. Improving the quality of referral communications should lead to more timely access and better cost-effectiveness for elective surgical care. This review summarises the research evidence for effective interventions within the scope of primary-care referral methods in the surgical care pathway that might shorten waiting time for elective surgeries. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases in December-2019 to January-2020, for articles published after 2013. Eligibility criteria included major elective surgery lists of adult patients, excluding cancer related surgeries. Both randomised and non-randomised controlled studies were eligible. The quality of evidence was assessed using ROBINS-I, AMSTAR 2 and CASP, as appropriate to the study method used. The review presentation was limited to a narrative synthesis because of heterogeneity. The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42019158455. RESULTS: The electronic search yielded 7543 records. Finally, nine articles were considered as eligible after deduplication and full article screening. The eligible research varied widely in design, scope, reported outcomes and overall quality, with one randomised trial, two quasi-experimental studies, two longitudinal follow up studies, three systematic reviews and one observational study. All the six original articles were based on referral methods in high-income countries. The included research showed that patient triage and prioritisation at the referral stage improved timely access and increased the number of consultations of surgical patients in clinics. CONCLUSIONS: The available studies included a variety of interventions and were of medium to high quality researches.

METHODS: Psychiatric outpatient visits and patient diagnostic information were extracted from the EHR(electronic health records) of a Korean tertiary hospital during 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and 3 months before the COVID-19 outbreak. Visit rates of psychiatric outpatients according to primary psychiatric diagnosis category before and after the COVID-19 pandemic were compared using an over-dispersed Poisson regression model. The temporal associations between the number of daily outpatient visits and the daily number of newly confirmed cases were examined by time-series analysis within each diagnosis category. RESULTS: Total daily outpatient visit rate was significantly reduced during the pandemic. Among the nine most prevalent diagnosis categories, the daily visit rates for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders were significantly reduced by about 29.8%, 14.8%, and 13.3% respectively. Time-series analysis showed significant temporal correlations between the daily number of newly confirmed cases and the daily visit rates for anxiety disorders and depressive disorders, whereas patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders showed no significant temporal association.

METHODS: This trial was conducted in two stages. In the dose-escalation stage, patients with advanced ESCC refractory or intolerant to previous chemotherapy received escalating doses of LY01610. A recommended dose based on patient tolerance was then expanded in the second stage. LY01610 was administered intravenously every 2 weeks, except that the first cycle in dose escalation was 3 weeks to allow observation of DLTs. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled across 4 dose levels (30, 60, 90 and 120 mg/m(2)). The DLTs included vomiting and febrile neutropenia, and the MTD was 90 mg/m(2). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were leukopenia in six patients (25.0%), anemia in six patients (25.0%) and neutropenia in five patients (20.8%). One patient achieved complete response, and four had partial response, including one patient receiving LY01610 at the starting dose of 30 mg/m(2). Compared with conventional irinotecan, the PK profile of LY01610 was characterized by increased and prolonged exposure of total irinotecan and the active metabolite SN-38 in plasma.

Electron microscopy of the mucosal epithelium 12 h after inoculation showed that the virus penetrates into the absorptive cells between microvilli, possibly by a pinocytic mechanism. Afterwards, virus particles were most often seen within dilated cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). These infected cells showed a range of changes, such as disruption of the microvilli, loss of cytoplasmic density and deposition of lipid droplets. Subsequently, most of the epithelial cells were desquamated from the villi. The interaction of virus and intestinal cells thus indicates that rotavirus is pathogenic for the epithelial cells.","output":"Electron microscopy of the intestine of gnotobiotic piglets infected with porcine rotavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study measures inequality of opportunity in earnings of different types of workers living in urban locations by using methodology similar to those developed in Ferreira and Gignoux (Review of Income and Wealth 57: 622C657, 2011) with household-level data taken from Periodic the Labour Force Surveys. In calculating the index of unequal opportunity, we use ex ante concept of equal opportunity, and gender, social status and parents education as circumstance variables. Shapley decomposition is performed to find out the relative roles of the circumstance variables in unequal opportunity in earnings. This empirical exercise reveals that a substantial part (nearly one-fourth) of total earning inequality is accounted for by inequality of opportunity in urban India. Parental education plays a significant role in contributing to unequal opportunity for regular salaried and self-employed workers, and gender difference is very much important in explaining unequal earning opportunity for casual wage workers.","output":"Social Identity, Gender and Unequal Opportunity of Earning in Urban India: 2017C2018 to 2019C2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article reviews predators that are able to control populations of mosquito larvae (Culicidae) in phytotelmata and their anthropogenic analogs.

In Brazil, 110 thousand cases and 5,901 deaths were confirmed by the end of April 2020. The scarcity of laboratory resources, the overload on the service network, and the broad clinical spectrum of the disease make it difficult to document all the deaths due to COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess the mortality rate in Brazilian capitals with a high incidence of COVID-19. METHODS: We assessed the weekly mortality between epidemiological week 1 and 16 in 2020 and the corresponding period in 2019. We estimated the expected mortality at 95% confidence interval by projecting the mortality in 2019 to the population in 2020, using data from the National Association of Civil Registrars (ARPEN-Brasil). RESULTS: In the five capitals with the highest incidence of COVID-19, we identified excess deaths during the pandemic. The age group above 60 years was severely affected, while 31% of the excess deaths occurred in the age group of 20-59 years. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.94) between excess deaths and the number of deaths confirmed by epidemiological monitoring. The epidemiological surveillance captured only 52% of all mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the cities examined. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the simplicity of the method and its low cost, we believe that the assessment of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic should be used as a complementary tool for regular epidemiological surveillance.","output":"Tracking excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 epidemic as an epidemiological surveillance strategy-preliminary results of the evaluation of six Brazilian capitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traumatic brain injury is associated with coagulopathy that increases mortality risk. Viscoelastic hemostatic assays such as thromboelastography (Haemonetics SA, Signy, Switzerland) provide rapid coagulopathy assessment and may be particularly useful for goal-directed treatment of traumatic brain injury patients. We conducted a systematic review to assess thromboelastography in the evaluation and management of coagulopathy in traumatic brain injury patients. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed Central, Embase, and CENTRAL. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical studies of adult patients with traumatic brain injury (isolated or polytrauma) who were assessed by either standard thromboelastography or thromboelastography with platelet mapping plus either conventional coagulation assays or platelet function assays from January 1999 to June 2021. DATA EXTRACTION: Demographics, injury mechanism and severity, diagnostic, laboratory data, therapies, and outcome data were extracted for analysis and comparison. DATA SYNTHESIS: Database search revealed 1,169 sources; eight additional articles were identified by the authors. After review, 31 publications were used for qualitative analysis, and of these, 16 were used for quantitative analysis. Qualitative and quantitative analysis found unique patterns of thromboelastography and thromboelastography with platelet mapping parameters in traumatic brain injury patients. Patterns were distinct compared with healthy controls, nontraumatic brain injury trauma patients, and traumatic brain injury subpopulations including those with severe traumatic brain injury or penetrating traumatic brain injury. Abnormal thromboelastography K-time and adenosine diphosphate % inhibition on thromboelastography with platelet mapping are associated with decreased survival after traumatic brain injury. Subgroup meta-analysis of severe traumatic brain injury patients from two randomized controlled trials demonstrated improved survival when using a viscoelastic hemostatic assay-guided resuscitation strategy (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17C0.91; p = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Thromboelastography and thromboelastography with platelet mapping characterize coagulopathy patterns in traumatic brain injury patients. Abnormal thromboelastography profiles are associated with poor outcomes. Conversely, treatment protocols designed to normalize abnormal parameters may be associated with improved traumatic brain injury patient outcomes. Current quality of evidence in this population is low; so future efforts should evaluate viscoelastic hemostatic assay-guided hemostatic resuscitation in larger numbers of traumatic brain injury patients with specific focus on those with traumatic brain injury-associated coagulopathy.","output":"Use of Thromboelastography in the Evaluation and Management of Patients With Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Due to massive screening of the persistent coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, supply difficulties emerged for swabs and extraction reagents leading to test alternative choices. Quality sampling may have an impact on the result and a low RNA detection may be difficult to interpret because it does not necessarily mean that infectious particles are present in biological samples. There is a need to understand whether the Ct value information is relevant and informative. Methods We compared the pre-analytical stability of RNA in saline solution, UTM(R), Amies and Cary-Blair transport media. Expression profile of E, N and RdRp genes was assessed at various concentration levels with the Allplex (TM) 2019-nCoV Assay. Factors that may influence the determination of Ct were studied with several extraction reagents coupled to the GSD NovaPrime(R) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing kit. Results Seventy two-hour RNA stability has been demonstrated for all the transport media assessed. A matrix effect was shown, leading to a decrease in the detection of E and RdRp genes, so that only N gene was often found for Ct greater than 35.0. A follow-up over more than 67,000 patients suggests that N gene may be a sensitive indicator to detect a new active viral circulation, but establishing a correlation between a positive threshold and a low risk of infection for a given method remains difficult. Conclusions Several transport media and extraction processes are suitable for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection. During periods of active virus circulation, any weakly positive results should be considered.","output":"RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and salivary specimens: contribution of alternative collection systems and extraction processes to cope with mass screening.

Seropositive survivors were rapidly boosted after first dose with higher antibody titer than non-survivors and seronegative survivors after second dose. However, antibody titer did not differ between first and second dose among seropositive survivors.

The present study tested the hypothesis that human mobility may be a potential factor contributing to reductions in PIDs that can be transmitted by droplets among children. Methods: : An ecological study was conducted using two publicly available datasets: surveillance on infectious diseases collected by the Japanese government and COVID-19 community mobility reports presented by Google. Among common PIDs, we focused on focused on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF), group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), and herpangina because of their nature as droplet-transmissible PIDs. The COVID-19 community mobility reports demonstrated percent decreases in the movement of people over time in groceries and pharmacies, parks, and transit stations. We compared the weekly trends in numbers of patients with PIDs identified in 2020 with those identified in the previous years 2015C2019. We then determined the associations between numbers of patients with PIDs and percentage decreases in human mobility during 2020 using Pearson correlation analysis. Results: : Despite experiencing their peak seasons, dramatic reductions were observed in the numbers of patients with PCF and GAS pharyngitis after the 10th week in 2020. Beyond the 20th week, no seasonal peaks were observed in the numbers of patients with all PIDs identified in 2020. Significant correlations were found between percentage decreases in human mobility in transit stations and numbers of patients with HFMD (Pearson correlation coefficient [95% confidence interval]: 0.65 [0.44C0.79]), PCF (0.47 [0.21C0.67]), RSV infection (0.45 [0.19C0.66]), and GAS pharyngitis (0.34 [0.06C0.58]). No significant correlations were found between numbers of patients with PIDs and human mobility in parks. Conclusions: : The highest correlations were found for the associations between numbers of patients with PIDs and human mobility in transit stations, suggesting that adult-to-child transmission may be a primary factor associated with increased numbers of patients with PIDs, rather than cross-transmission among children. A reduction in human mobility for adults may contribute toward decreases in the numbers of children with droplet-transmissible PIDs.","output":"Human Mobility and Droplet-transmissible Pediatric Infectious Diseases During the Coronavirus Disease-2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infection with COVID\\\\19 is characterized by respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms.

Methods: 31 patients who were pathologically diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer and had undergone surgical treatment in Beijing Tongren Hospital during June 2018 and December 2020 were enrolled. All patients were squamous cell carcinoma patients. There were 25 males and 6 females, and the age ranged between 44 and 70 years old. The number of patients with T1, T2, T3, and T4 stage disease was 8, 15, 8, and 0, respectively, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging method, 8th edition. After the dissection of the submandibular and cervical lymph nodes, the parapharyngeal space was exposed, and the parapharyngeal space lymph node and the outer borderline of the tumor were dissected, and then the inner borderline of the tumor was dissected via a transoral approach; the tumor was dissected en bloc, and the defects were reconstructed with the flap from the neck through the parapharyngeal space. Results: Among the patients enrolled, 21 were HPV positive and 10 were HPV negative. 8 patients were free of lymph node metastasis. The tumor resection margins were negative in all 31 patients. Safe and sufficient excision of tumors was feasible by this new surgical approach, avoiding complications associated with mandibulotomy or lip-splitting. All patients had no obvious dysfunctions of swallowing and voice. By the time of this follow-up, none died caused by OPSCC, and only two patients suffered from local recurrence.

The recent inclusion of bedaquiline into TB drug regimens has improved treatment outcomes, but this advance is threatened by the emergence of strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) resistant to bedaquiline. Clinical bedaquiline resistance is most frequently conferred by resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in the Rv0678 gene which can also confer cross-resistance to clofazimine, another TB drug. We compiled a dataset of 3,682 Mtb genomes, including 223 carrying Rv0678 bedaquiline RAVs. We identified at least 15 cases where RAVs were present in the genomes of strains collected prior to the use of bedaquiline in TB treatment regimes. Phylogenetic analyses point to multiple emergence events and in some cases widespread circulation of RAVs in Rv0678, often prior to the introduction of bedaquiline or clofazimine. Strikingly, this included three cases predating the antibiotic era. The presence of a pre-existing reservoir of bedaquiline-resistant Mtb strains necessitates the urgent implementation of rapid drug susceptibility testing and individualised regimen selection to safeguard the use of bedaquiline in TB care and control.","output":"Detection of a bedaquiline / clofazimine resistance reservoir in Mycobacterium tuberculosis predating the antibiotic era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small area population forecasts are widely used by government and business for a variety of planning, research and policy purposes, and often influence major investment decisions.

RECENT FINDINGS When complications are methodically and systematically recorded, 64% of patients will sustain a complication within 90 days of radical cystectomy. Various preoperative, postoperative, and intraoperative strategies have been identified to reduce morbidity. Prior to surgery, patients should have reversible medical conditions treated, mechanical bowel preparation can be omitted if using small bowel for reconstruction, venous thromboembolism and antimicrobial infection prophylaxis should be initiated, nutrition should be optimized, and patient education should be provided. During surgery, complications can be attenuated by utilizing meticulous surgical technique, minimizing blood loss, fluid management can be guided by transesophageal cardiovascular Doppler, and lower extremity repositioning should be performed as soon as feasible. After surgery, early mobilization, incentive spirometry, early nasogastric tube removal, alvimopan usage, and judicious jejunostomy tube feeding, or total parenteral nutrition usage may reduce morbidity.

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic caused by a newly discovered virus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the World Health Organisation in 2019. RT-PCR is considered the golden standard for COVID-19 detection. Due to the limited RT-PCR resources, early diagnosis of the disease has become a challenge. Radiographic images such as Ultrasound, CT scans, X-rays can be used for the detection of the deathly disease. Developing deep learning models using radiographic images for detecting COVID-19 can assist in countering the outbreak of the virus. This paper presents a computer-aided detection model utilizing chest X-ray images for combating the pandemic. Several pre-trained networks and their combinations have been used for developing the model. The method uses features extracted from pre-trained networks along with Sparse autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) for the detection of COVID-19. Two publicly available chest X-ray image datasets, consisting of 504 COVID-19 images and 542 non-COVID-19 images, have been combined to train the model. The method was able to achieve an accuracy of 0.957 8 and an AUC of 0.982 1, using the combination of InceptionResnetV2 and Xception. Experiments have proved that the accuracy of the model improves with the usage of sparse autoencoder as the dimensionality reduction technique.","output":"A computer-aided diagnosis system for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia on chest X-ray images by integrating CNN with sparse autoencoder and feed forward neural network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we report four coding-complete severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome sequences from Stockholm, Sweden, sampled in late April 2020 A rare variant at bp 23463 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was found, which corresponds to the S1 subunit of the spike protein, changing an arginine (R) residue to histidine (H)","output":"Four SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequences from Late April in Stockholm, Sweden, Reveal a Rare Mutation in the Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 vaccines become available to the public, there will be a massive worldwide distribution effort.

Unfortunately, currently, there is no specific and effective treatment for COVID-19. As SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike proteins (S) to bind to a host cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2(ACE2), and this interaction is proved to be responsible for entering a virus into host cells, it makes an ideal target for antiviral drug development. In this work, we design three very short peptides based on the ACE2 sequence/structure fragments, which may effectively bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein and may, in turn, disrupt the important virus-host protein-protein interactions, blocking early steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To obtain a comprehensive view of the effects of MV infection on target cells, DNA microarray analyses of two different cell-types were performed. An epithelial (293SLAM; a 293 cell line stably expressing SLAM) and lymphoid (COBL-a) cell line were inoculated with purified wild-type MV. Microarray analyses revealed significant differences in the regulation of cellular gene expression between these two different cells. In 293SLAM cells, upregulation of genes involved in the antiviral response was rapidly induced; in the later stages of infection, this was followed by regulation of many genes across a broad range of functional categories. On the other hand, in COBL-a cells, only a limited set of gene expression profiles was modulated after MV infection. Since it was reported that V protein of MV inhibited the IFN signaling pathway, we performed a microarray analysis using V knockout MV to evaluate V protein's effect on cellular gene expression. The V knockout MV displayed a similar profile to that of parental MV. In particular, in COBL-a cells infected with the virus, no alteration of cellular gene expression, including IFN signaling, was observed. Furthermore, IFN signaling analyzed in vitro was completely suppressed by MV infection in the COBL-a cells. These results reveal that MV induces different cellular responses in a cell-type specific manner. Microarray analyses will provide us useful information about potential mechanisms of MV pathogenesis.","output":"Measles virus induces cell-type specific changes in gene expression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, the Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core has made a series of comprehensive arrangements for the overall promotion of epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development As an important component of Chinese food industry, the health food industry meets the health needs of special populations and contributes huge economic and social benefits In order to further understand the consumption of health food by the general public, and to grasp the policy needs of the health food industry under epidemic situation and subsequent development, this article systematically analyzes the current health food consumption situation by conducting a questionnaire survey on some health food companies in China At the same time, combined with market demand, it proposes market supervision policy recommendations to promote the development of the health food industry ? 2020, Editorial Office of Journal of CIFST All right reserved","output":"Investigation and Analysis of Health Food Industry Consumption and Policy Recommendations under the COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are able to establish persistence. However, how coronaviruses react to persistence and whether the selected viruses have altered their characteristics remain unclear. In this study, we found that the persistent infection of bovine coronavirus (BCoV), which is in the same genus as SARS-COV-2, led to alterations of genome structure, attenuation of gene expression, and the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) with a previously unidentified pattern. Subsequent analyses revealed that the altered genome structures were associated with the attenuation of gene expression. In addition, the genome structure at the 5 terminus and the cellular environment during the persistence were responsible for the sgmRNA synthesis, solving the previously unanswered question regarding the selection of transcription regulatory sequence for synthesis of BCoV sgmRNA 12.7. Although the BCoV variants (BCoV-p95) selected under the persistence replicated efficiently in cells without persistent infection, its pathogenicity was still lower than that of wild-type (wt) BCoV. Furthermore, in comparison with wt BCoV, the variant BCoV-p95 was not able to efficiently adapt to the challenges of alternative environments, suggesting wt BCoV is genetically robust.

However, this fraction depends heavily on the sampling intensity and the various test criteria used in different jurisdictions, and many sources indicate that a large fraction of cases tend to go undetected. METHODS: Estimates of the true prevalence of COVID-19 in a population can be made by random sampling and pooling of RT-PCR tests. Here I use simulations to explore how experiment sample size and degrees of sample pooling impact precision of prevalence estimates and potential for minimizing the total number of tests required to get individual-level diagnostic results. RESULTS: Sample pooling can greatly reduce the total number of tests required for prevalence estimation. In low-prevalence populations, it is theoretically possible to pool hundreds of samples with only marginal loss of precision. Even when the true prevalence is as high as 10% it can be appropriate to pool up to 15 samples. Sample pooling can be particularly beneficial when the test has imperfect specificity by providing more accurate estimates of the prevalence than an equal number of individual-level tests.

Methods Hourly concentrations of air pollutants and daily number of PCR-confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 were acquired (February 20th, 2020 to January 4th, 2021). A generalized additive model (GAM) assuming a quasi-Poisson distribution was used to model the associations in each city up to lag-day 7 (for mortality) and 14 (for morbidity). Then, the city-specific estimates were meta-analyzed using a fixed effect model to obtain the overall relative risks (RRs). Results A total of 114,964 confirmed cases and 21,549 deaths were recorded in these cities. For confirmed cases, exposure to PM2.5, NO2, and O3 for several lag-days showed significant associations. In case of mortality, meta-analysis estimated that the RRs for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3 concentrations were 1.06 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.13), 1.06 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.19), 1.15 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.38), and 1.07 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.31), respectively.

Physical examination showed swelling and tenderness of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, wrists, and knees. She had increased inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein:108 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 95mm, alpha-2 and gamma-globulins, interleukin 6: 16.5 pg/mL). Immunological tests revealed positive rheumatoid factor (128 UI/mL), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (200UI/mL), anti-nuclear antibodies (1:320), and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (12.24U/mL). She had the genotype: HLA-DRB1*04:11, HLA-DQB1*03:01, and HLA-DQB1* 03:02. Hands and feet radiographs did not show any erosion.

To achieve this purpose, we first carried out a literature review and, later, we applied a content analysis, being a specific methodology, to the television programming of Atresmedia, Mediaset and RTVE during the week between the 19th and the 25th of April, 2021. We have utilized an analysis sheet that allowed us to identify the main characteristics of the educational programs that are broadcasted in each channel (duration, broadcast schedule, frequency, genre, type of production and model of educational television, according to the categorization of Prez Tornero, 2007). Based on the conducted research, it can be concluded that educational television in Spain is dominated by external production content and that the percentage of formats produced within the European Union (51,3%) and outside the EU (48,7%) are very similar. Another feature that has been identified is that television contents are expanded towards the digital arena, in the websites of the media groups within our sample. This dynamic confirms that there is an expansion of educational television towards new media, which can also be exploited for educational purposes. However, educational television in Atresmedia and Mediaset occupies a marginal space in Spanish television programming compared to RTVE.","output":"La televisin educativa en Espa?a: la oferta de Atresmedia, Mediaset y RTVE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates how agri-food research and innovation (R&I) activity may interact with sustainable local development processes. The focus is on smart specialisation strategies and partnerships between agri-food business and research organisations, established under the open innovation paradigm. An exploratory study is carried out on recent (2010C19) agri-food R&I activity in Puglia (Italy), covering both projects and patents carried out by 47 research centres (affiliated to any of 11 research institutions) and 40 agri-food enterprises. Beside project data analysis based on categorisation, the methodology applied social network analysis to partnerships. Findings point to Sustainable Manufacturing and Human and Environmental Health being the prevalent target areas of innovation activity, thus resulting in some form of sustainable agricultural intensification, with a bias towards Industrial Biotechnology, Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology. Open innovation approaches seem to be still phasing in, and the innovation potential of agri-food enterprises appears to be largely untapped. Future research may address the friction between industry-driven smart specialisation strategies and place-based innovation patterns that harness the intangible potential of social and relational capital.","output":"Sustainable Local Development and Smart Specialisation Strategies: Recent Developments in Agri-food Research and Innovation Partnerships in Puglia, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes between orthopaedic trainees using various preoperative training platforms (physical simulation [PS], virtual reality [VR], and reading/videos) in a slipped capital femoral epiphysis model. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: (1) reading/video control group (n = 7), (2) VR group (n = 7), or (3) PS group (n = 7). Participants in the VR group completed a VR slipped capital femoral epiphysis module while participants in the PS group practiced the placement of a screw in the physical module before evaluation of percutaneous screw placement in the PS model. Outcomes evaluated included overall surgical time, amount of fluoroscopy, Global Rating Scale score, radiographic screw position, physical screw accuracy, presence of breeching of the articular surface or femoral neck, and overall platform rating (0 to 10). RESULTS: No difference was observed in surgical time, Global Rating Scale score, radiographic or physical accuracy of screw position, or articular surface breaching between the groups. Subjectively, there was a difference in utility of platform rating between the groups (PS: 10  0, VR: 7  2, and control: 6  1, P = 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the associations between meteorological factors and the daily number of new cases of COVID-19 in 9 Asian cities. METHODS: Pearson correlation and generalized additive modeling (GAM) were performed to assess the relationships between daily new COVID-19 cases and meteorological factors (daily average temperature and relative humidity) with the most updated data currently available. RESULTS: The Pearson correlation showed that daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 were more correlated with the average temperature than with relative humidity. Daily new confirmed cases were negatively correlated with the average temperature in Beijing (r=C0.565, P<.001), Shanghai (r=C0.47, P<.001), and Guangzhou (r=C0.53, P<.001). In Japan, however, a positive correlation was observed (r=0.416, P<.001). In most of the cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, and Kuala Lumpur), GAM analysis showed the number of daily new confirmed cases to be positively associated with both average temperature and relative humidity, especially using lagged 3D modeling where the positive influence of temperature on daily new confirmed cases was discerned in 5 cities (exceptions: Beijing, Wuhan, Korea, and Malaysia). Moreover, the sensitivity analysis showed, by incorporating the city grade and public health measures into the model, that higher temperatures can increase daily new case numbers (beta=0.073, Z=11.594, P<.001) in the lagged 3-day model. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that increased temperature yield increases in daily new cases of COVID-19. Hence, large-scale public health measures and expanded regional research are still required until a vaccine becomes widely available and herd immunity is established.","output":"The Influence of Average Temperature and Relative Humidity on New Cases of COVID-19: Time-Series Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method is an innovative way to provide practical, evidence based clinical guidance to infection preventionist (IP) in the absence of clinical trial data.

On top of these measures, hemodialysis units have adopted their own rules to protect wards and patients from infection with SARS-CoV-2. Despite the rapidly growing knowledge on epidemiology, virology, and clinical disease, little is known about how these measures are perceived by patients themselves on hemodialysis. Methods: The study was performed in the three hemodialysis units in Vorarlberg, Austria's westernmost state. A questionnaire was developed consisting of 22 questions on patients' perceptions of the COVID-19 crisis and their feelings about the general precautions and specific steps implemented on dialysis wards. All adult patients were asked to fill out the questionnaire anonymously. Results: Of 202 patients on hemodialysis, 148 completed the questionnaire (66.9% men, mean age 68.313.3 years). The vast majority (83.1%) were worried by the COVID-19 crisis, but only 28.4% reported a negative effect on emotional well-being. Daily life was most affected by the general ban on visitors (58.6%) and home confinement (35.9%). Of the patients, 64.2% feared contracting COVID-19, 30.7% were afraid of financial consequences, and 14.6% were afraid of loneliness and isolation. The safety measures on dialysis wards were classified as adequate by 97.3% of the respondents. Of the patients, 78.2% felt safe during dialysis treatment. All dialysis-specific precautions (individual patient transport, health check, hand disinfection, wearing a face mask, and physical distancing) were rated important or very important by almost all patients. To date, none of the patients have acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: Although the SARS-CoV-2 crisis brought worry to and affected the lives of most patients on hemodialysis, its effect on their emotional well-being was moderate. Patients felt safe on dialysis wards, and acceptance of specific precautions was high.","output":"How Hemodialysis Patients Perceive the SARS-CoV-2 Health Crisis: Lessons from Austria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a multiorgan tropism including the kidneys. Recent autopsy series indicated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect both tubular and glomerular cells. Whereas tubular cell infiltration may contribute to acute kidney injury, data on a potential clinical correlative to glomerular affection is rare. We describe the first case of nephrotic syndrome in the context of COVID-19 in a renal transplant recipient. A 35 year old male patient received a kidney allograft for primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Three months posttransplant a recurrence of podocytopathy was successfully managed by plasma exchange, ivIG, and a conversion from tacrolimus to belatacept (initial proteinuria > 6 g/l decreased to 169 mg/l). Six weeks later he was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and developed a second increase of proteinuria (5.6 g/l). Renal allograft biopsy revealed diffuse podocyte effacement and was positive for SARS-CoV-2 in RNA in-situ hybridation indicating a SARS-CoV-2 associated recurrence of podocytopathy. Noteworthy, nephrotic proteinuria resolved spontaneously after recovering from COVID-19. The present case expands the spectrum of renal involvement in COVID-19 from acute tubular injury to podocytopathy in renal transplant recipients. Thus, it may be wise to test for SARS-CoV-2 prior to initiation of immunosuppression in new onset glomerulopathy during the pandemic.

The study aimed to report the outcomes of planned urgent and cancer cases during the current pandemic using a multi-disciplinary prioritisation group. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of patients having urgent or cancer surgery at a NHS Trust from 1st March to 30th April 2020 who had been prioritised by a multi-disciplinary COVID Surgery group. Rates of post-operative PCR positive and suspected COVID-19 infections within 30 days, 30-day mortality and any death related to COVID-19 are reported. RESULTS: Overall 597 patients underwent surgery with a median age of 65 years (interquartile range (IQR) 54-74 years). Of these, 86.1% (514/597) had a current cancer diagnosis. During the period, 60.8% (363/597) of patients had surgery at the NHS Trust whilst 39.2% (234/597) had surgery at Independent Sector hospitals. The incidence of COVID-19 in the East Midlands was 193.7 per 100,000 population during the study period. In the 30 days following surgery, 1.3% (8/597) of patients tested positive for COVID-19 with all cases at the NHS site. Overall 30-day mortality was 0.7% (4/597). Following a PCR positive COVID-19 diagnosis, mortality was 25.0% (2/8). Including both PCR positive and suspected cases, 3.0% (18/597) developed COVID-19 infection with 1.3% at the independent site compared to 4.1% at the NHS Trust (p=0.047).

This was previously referred to as post-intensive care syndrome-family. We systematically review randomized controlled trials for post-intensive care syndrome-family. DATA SOURCES Systematic research in databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINHAL for articles published between January 2000 and October 2019). STUDY SELECTION Interventions in randomized controlled trials for post-intensive care syndrome-family in relatives of adult ICU patients. DATA EXTRACTION Review, quality assessment, and risk assessment for bias of eligible publications were performed along recommended guidelines for each investigation. Quality assessment graded studies into \\"strong\\" (n = 5), \\"moderate\\" (n = 4), and \\"weak\\" (n = 2). DATA SYNTHESIS Out of 2,399 publications, 11 investigations were found eligible (3,183 relatives of ICU patients). Studies addressed interventions during ICU stay (n = 6), during the post-ICU period (n = 4), or both (n = 1). Two studies included relatives of dying/deceased patients. One study implemented end-of-life conferences and showed reduced prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (45% vs 69%; p = 0.01), anxiety (45% vs 67%; p = 0.02), and depression (29% vs 56%; p = 0.003). Family conferences with a physician and proactive participation of a nurse reduced anxiety-scores (p = 0.01) without reducing anxiety prevalence (33.3% vs 52.3%; p = 0.08). Other studies failed to improve symptoms or reduce prevalence of post-intensive care syndrome-family. Interestingly, condolence letters may even increase prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (52.4% vs 37.1%; p = 0.03). Meetings without the presence of ICU physicians were shown to increase Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores (25.9 vs 21.3; p = 0.0495). CONCLUSIONS Only few data are available on interventions for post-intensive care syndrome-family. It appears that proactive communication and provision of information seems pivotal for post-intensive care syndrome-family treatment. Interestingly, some interventions may even worsen post-intensive care syndrome-family. In the light of the relevance of post-intensive care syndrome-family in daily ICU care, more high-quality data seems urgently needed.","output":"Interventions in Post-Intensive Care Syndrome-Family: A Systematic Literature Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic affected every area of students lives, especially their education.

As an antiviral agent, propolis and various constituents have shown promising preclinical efficacy against adenoviruses, influenza viruses, respiratory tract viruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Over 300 chemical components have been identified in propolis, including terpenes, flavonoids, and phenolic acids, with the specific constituent profile varying widely according to geographic origin and regional flora. Propolis and its constituents have demonstrated potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 by modulating multiple pathogenic and antiviral pathways. Molecular docking studies have demonstrated high binding affinities of propolis derivatives to multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including 3C-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S-protein), and helicase (NSP13), as well as to the viral target angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to understand recruitment from the point of view of trial staff and discover what they consider important. METHODS: We applied pluralistic ethnographic methods, including analysis of trial documents, observation, and focus groups, and explored the recruitment processes of the EMPOWER (Early Signs Monitoring to Prevent Relapse in Psychosis and Promote Well-being, Engagement, and Recovery) feasibility trial, which is a digital app-based intervention for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. RESULTS: Recruitment barriers were categorized into 2 main themes: service characteristics (lack of time available for mental health staff to support recruitment, staff turnover, patient turnover [within Australia only], management styles of community mental health teams, and physical environment) and clinician expectations (filtering effects and resistance to research participation). Trial staff negotiated these barriers through strategies such as emotional labor (trial staff managing feelings and expressions to successfully recruit participants) and trying to build relationships with clinical staff working within community mental health teams.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical services were adapted to minimise hospital admissions. Our aim is to review the safety and efficacy of the surgical ambulatory service in the management of varying biliary pathology. METHOD: Data was retrospectively collected on consecutive patients referred to the surgical team with presumed biliary pathology between 30(th) April and 16(th) August 2020. Patients with presumed cholecystitis were discharged with oral antibiotics following local guidance with follow-up telephone consultations. Unsuccessful ambulation was determined by representation at 30 days. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-seventy patients were referred to the acute surgical team with presumed biliary pathology; 81 were suitable for ambulatory management and their first line imaging (abdominal ultrasound, MRCP or CT) was performed within a median of 4 days; 17% of these patients underwent second line imaging in the form of MRCP. Fourteen percent of these patients failed ambulatory management and were admitted to hospital; 3 underwent a cholecystectomy and 2 had an ERCP. CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with biliary disease can be safely managed in an ambulatory setting. Access to imaging early can facilitate successful discharge and ongoing ambulatory investigation and definitive management.","output":"814 The Ambulatory Management of Acute Biliary Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global coronavirus pandemic has devastated the cruise sector with widespread disruption and cancellations affecting millions of cruise passengers The cruise industry was negatively affected due to the enclavic and confined environment onboard, the high infection rates among both crew and passengers, and widespread negative media coverage This study explores the impact of COVID-19 on willingness to cruise and attitudes towards cruising for both cruisers and non-cruisers living in Australia and the United Kingdom Data analysis of respondents comments was undertaken using both Leximancer text analytic software and manual content analysis Findings indicate country of residence has a significant influence on risk perceptions for a cruise holiday and affects future intentions to cruise Specific impacts for the cruise industry are discussed and recommendations proposed for policy and practice","output":"Cruising through a pandemic: The impact of COVID-19 on intentions to cruise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We like to share some ideas on the publication Clinical and laboratory profile of children with COVID-19 admitted at a tertiary care hospital in Karnataka, Southern India1.

As Sahana KS, et al1 noted, some children have nutritional problems which might affect some laboratory parameters such as ferritin and haemoglobin. Additionally, a nutrition risk screening (NRS) score should be applied. In a previous report, NRS score was a good predictor for clinical outcome in cases with sepsis and it might be applicable to cases with COVID-192. Finally, the treatment given to different children might be different and it can result in different clinical outcomes. Those cases with atypical presentation may have received additional medications and it can affect both clinical outcome and clinical parameters.

Due to the stay-at-home mandate and practice of physical distancing, nearly all preventive care measures have been halted, including colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. The health consequences of this temporary suspension are of great concern, particularly for underserved populations, who experience substantial CRC-related disparities. In this Commentary, we describe challenges and opportunities to deliver COVID-adapted CRC screening to medically underserved populations receiving care in community health centers (CHC). This perspective is based on key informant interviews with CHC medical directors, teleconference discussions, and strategic planning assessments. To address the unprecedented challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we identify two broad calls to action: 1) Invest in CHCs now; and 2) Support equitable and adaptable telehealth solutions now and in the future. We also recommend four CRC-specific calls to action: Establish COVID-adapted best practices to implement mailed fecal immunochemical test (FIT) programs; Implement grassroots advocacy to identify community gastroenterologists who commit to performing colonoscopies for CHC patients; Assess cancer prevention priorities among individuals in underserved communities; and Assess regional CRC screening and follow-up barriers and solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic may further exacerbate existing CRC screening disparities in underserved individuals. This will likely lead to delayed diagnosis, a shift to later stage disease, and increased CRC deaths. To prevent this from happening, we call for timely action and a commitment to address the current extraordinary CRC screening challenges for vulnerable populations.","output":"The COVID-19 Pandemic: Identifying Adaptive Solutions for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Underserved Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The adherence to public health recommendations to control COVID-19 spread is influenced by public knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). We performed this cross-sectional study to assess the levels and determinants of public KAP towards COVID-19 in a large, multinational sample. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study (survey). SETTING: The questionnaire was distributed to potential respondents via online platforms. PARTICIPANTS: 71 890 individuals from 22 countries. METHODS: We formulated a four-section questionnaire in English, followed by validation and translation into seven languages. The questionnaire was distributed (May to June 2020) and each participant received a score for each KAP section. RESULTS: Overall, the participants had fair knowledge (mean score: 19.243.59) and attitudes (3.722.31) and good practices (12.121.83) regarding COVID-19. About 92% reported moderate to high compliance with national lockdown. However, significant gaps were observed: only 68.2% knew that infected individuals may be asymptomatic; 45.4% believed that antibiotics are an effective treatment; and 55.4% stated that a vaccine has been developed (at the time of data collection). 71.9% believed or were uncertain that COVID-19 is a global conspiracy; 36.8% and 51% were afraid of contacting doctors and Chinese people, respectively. Further, 66.4% reported the pandemic had moderate to high negative effects on their mental health. Female gender, higher education and urban residents had significantly (p&#8804;0.001) higher knowledge and practice scores. Further, we observed significant correlations between all KAP scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although the public have fair/good knowledge and practices regarding COVID-19, significant gaps should be addressed.

Strict measures generally focus on the patient-to-HCW contacts. However, interactions between the HCWs also pose a high risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure. AIMS: This study was aimed to investigate the effect of social contacts on the level of SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk among workers by broadening the current risk assessment algorithm. METHODS: Contact tracing records of the workers in a large university hospital between 19th March and 31st December 2020 were analysed. Multivariate conditional logistic regression models were estimated to evaluate factors associated with high-risk exposure for contacts among workers. RESULTS: Of the 329 exposed clusters, 260 (79%) were HCW-to-HCW contacted clusters. High-risk exposure was higher in the HCW-to-HCW contacts (44%), when compared to the patient-to-HCW contacts (5%) (P < 0.001). A total of 1827 HCWs contacted a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-positive co-worker. Among the HCW-to-HCW contacts, high-risk exposure was higher in the support staff (49%, P < 0.001), in non-patient care settings (47%, P < 0.001) and in the social contacts (57%, P < 0.001). Social contacts between workers increased the high-risk exposure (adjusted odds ratio: 3.50, 95% confidence interval 2.62C4.69) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A significant association between social contacts among workers and high-risk exposure of SARS-CoV-2 was observed.

However, despite the extensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, poor clinical response to treatment of acute otitis media is common in children. Numerous studies ranging from animal experiments to extensive clinical studies have clearly demonstrated that respiratory viruses play a crucial role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of acute otitis media. Viral infection of the upper respiratory tract initiates the whole cascade of events that finally leads to the development of acute otitis media as a complication. Respiratory viruses induce a release of inflammatory mediators in the nasopharynx, increase bacterial colonization and adherence, and have a suppressive effect on the host's immune defense. Recent data indicate that at least some types of viruses actively invade the middle ear. Viruses also seem to enhance the inflammatory process in the middle ear and impair the outcome of the disease. Vaccines against the major viruses predisposing to acute otitis media hold a great promise for the prevention of this disease.

In particular, the chloroquine analog N-(7-fluoro-quinolin-4-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine (compound 5) was highly effective in sensitizing cancer cell killing when combined with either Akt inhibitor 8 (1-{1-[4-(7-phenyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-g]quinoxalin-6-yl)-benzyl]-piperidin-4-yl}-1,3-dihydro-benzoimidazol-2-one) or 9 ([4-(2-chloro-4a,10a-dihydro-phenoxazin-10-yl)-butyl]-diethyl-amine hydrochloride).

The long-standing rural-to-urban route of population migration that has propelled waves of massive urbanization over the decades is increasingly being juxtaposed with a reverse movement, as the pandemic drives urban dwellers to suburban communities. The changing dynamics of the flow of residents to and from urban areas underscore the necessity of comprehensive urban land-use mapping for urban planning/management/assessment. These maps are essential for anticipating the rapidly evolving demands of the urban populace and mitigating the environmental and social consequences of uncontrolled urban expansion. The integration of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and imagery data provides an opportunity for urban planning projects to take advantage of its complementary geometric and radiometric characteristics, respectively, with a potential increase in urban mapping accuracies. We enhance the color-based segmentation algorithm for object-based classification of multispectral LiDAR point clouds fused with very high-resolution imagery data acquired for a residential urban study area. We propose a multilevel classification using multilayer perceptron neural networks through vectors of geometric and spectral features structured in different classification scenarios. After an investigation of all classification scenarios, the proposed method achieves an overall mapping accuracy exceeding 98%, combining the original and calculated feature vectors and their output space projected by principal components analysis. This combination also eliminates some misclassifications among classes. We used splits of training, validation, and testing subsets and the k-fold cross-validation to quantitatively assess the classification scenarios. The proposed work improves the color-based segmentation algorithm to fit object-based classification applications and examines multiple classification scenarios. The presented scenarios prove superiority in developing urban mapping accuracies. The various feature spaces suggest the best urban mapping applications based on the available characteristics of the obtained data. ? The Authors.

However, clinicopathologic features diagnostic of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have not been reported. We studied the reticuloendothelial organs of 4 consecutive patients who died of COVID-19 and correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters to detect HLH. METHODS: Autopsies were performed on 4 patients who died of COVID-19. Routine H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining for CD163 were performed to detect hemophagocytosis. Clinical and laboratory results from premortem blood samples were used to calculate H-scores. RESULTS: All 4 cases demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage within the lungs. Three of the 4 cases had histologic evidence of hemophagocytosis within pulmonary lymph nodes. One case showed hemophagocytosis in the spleen but none showed hemophagocytosis in liver or bone marrow.

One month after lockdown commenced (T2), we assessed 30 psychological and behavioural traits in more than 4000 twins in their mid-twenties and compared their responses to the same traits assessed in 2018 (T1). Mean changes from T1 to T2 were modest and inconsistent. Contrary to the hypothesis that major environmental changes related to COVID-19 would result in increased variance in psychological and behavioural traits, we found that the magnitude of individual differences did not change from T1 to T2. Twin analyses revealed that while genetic factors accounted for about half of the reliable variance at T1 and T2, they only accounted for ~ 15% of individual differences in change from T1 to T2, and that nonshared environmental factors played a major role in psychological and behavioural changes. Shared environmental influences had negligible impact on T1, T2 or T2 change. Genetic factors correlated on average .86 between T1 and T2 and accounted for over half of the phenotypic stability, as would be expected for a 2-year interval even without the major disruption of lockdown. We conclude that the first month of lockdown has not resulted in major psychological or attitudinal shifts in young adults, nor in major changes in the genetic and environmental origins of these traits.

The resulting lung lesions compromise patient pulmonary function and increase mortality, or end in permanent lung damage for those who have recovered from the COVID-19 disease. Therefore, local pulmonary fibrinolysis can be efficacious in degrading pre-existing fibrin clots and reducing the conversion of lung lesions into lasting scars. Plasminogen is considered a key player in fibrinolysis processes, and in view of a bench-to-bedside translation, we focused on the aerosolization of an orphan medicinal product (OMP) for ligneous conjunctivitis: human plasminogen (PLG-OMP) eye drops. As such, the sterile and preservative-free solution guarantees the pharmaceutical quality of GMP production and meets the Ph. Eur. requirements of liquid preparations for nebulization. PLG-OMP aerosolization was evaluated both from technological and stability viewpoints, after being submitted to either jet or ultrasonic nebulization. Jet nebulization resulted in a more efficient delivery of an aerosol suitable for pulmonary deposition. The biochemical investigation highlighted substantial protein integrity maintenance with the percentage of native plasminogen band > 90%, in accordance with the quality specifications of PLG-OMP.

Criminalization, stigmatization and the psychological, physical, behavioural and economic consequences of substance use make people who inject drugs (PWID) extremely vulnerable to many infectious diseases. While relationships between drug use and blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections are well studied, less attention has been paid to other infectious disease outbreaks among PWID. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 is likely to disproportionally affect PWID due to a high prevalence of comorbidities that make the disease more severe, unsanitary and overcrowded living conditions, stigmatization, common incarceration, homelessness and difficulties in adhering to quarantine, social distancing or self-isolation mandates. The COVID-19 pandemic also jeopardizes essential for PWID services, such as needle exchange or substitution therapy programmes, which can be affected both in a short- and a long-term perspective. Importantly, there is substantial evidence of other infectious disease outbreaks in PWID that were associated with factors that enable COVID-19 transmission, such as poor hygiene, overcrowded living conditions and communal ways of using drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 crisis might increase risks of homelessnes, overdoses and unsafe injecting and sexual practices for PWID. In order to address existing inequalities, consultations with PWID advocacy groups are vital when designing inclusive health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Challenges posed by COVID-19 to people who inject drugs and lessons from other outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent research has shown that Anthrenus pimpinellae (Fabricius, 1775) is a complex of species numbering at least 21 in the Palearctic region.

The ability to generate true knockout alleles at high saturation provides a sensitive means to study virus-host interactions. To illustrate the power of such haploid genetic screens, we highlight the discovery of the lysosomal proteins NPC1 and LAMP1 as intracellular receptors for Ebola virus and Lassa virus, respectively.

We develop the sustainable supply chain doughnut model with regards to the SDGs, through which we investigate workers rights violations. Examples from both UK-based and world-wide supply chains illustrates our conceptual model. Supply chains have shortfalls in all aspects of the social foundation when it comes to workers as one of their main stakeholders. Until supply chains are successful in overcoming shortfalls across all elements of the social foundation, moving to the next layer of the doughnut framework is impossible, which is the safe and just space for all humans, including workers. This safe and just space seems out of reach despite international efforts such as the SDGs.

Methods ANFH was induced by a combination of hypersensitivity vasculitis caused by injection of horse serum and subsequent administration of a high dose of corticosteroid. The pathological changes were detected with digital radiography (DR), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ink artery infusion angiography, hematoxylinCeosin staining, and immunohistochemistry. Results The imageological and pathological changes corresponded to the clinical characteristics of early stage ANFH. DR showed bilaterally increased bone density, an unclear epiphyseal line, and blurred texture of cancellous bone. CT showed spot-like low-density imaging of cancellous bone, thinner cortical bone, osteoporosis, and an unclear epiphyseal line. MRI showed bone marrow edema and spot-like high signals in T2-weighted imaging in cancellous bone. Ink artery infusion angiography showed fewer obstructed blood vessels in the femoral head. HE staining of pathological sections showed fewer trabeculae and thin bone, an increased proportion of empty osteocyte lacunae, decreased hematopoiesis, thrombosis, and fat cell hypertrophy. Immunohistochemistry showed attenuated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in osteoblasts and chondrocytes, and on the inner membrane of blood vessels.

Design Service delivery evaluation. Setting All primary and secondary care providers in the South West of England, approximate population 4 million. Participants 3890 patients aged []50 years presenting in primary care with low-risk symptoms of colorectal cancer, following NICE NG12 and DG30, with a FIT (HM-JACKarc assay) analysed from 01/06/2018 to 31/12/2018. Main outcome measures Diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Results 618 (15.9%) patients tested positive at a threshold of 10g Hb/g faeces (median 36g Hb/g faeces (IQR 17 to 149)); 458 (74.1%) of these had an urgent referral to specialist lower gastrointestinal (GI) services within three months. 43 were diagnosed with colorectal cancer within 12 months. 3272 patients tested negative; 324 (9.9%) were referred on an urgent lower GI pathway in secondary care within three months. 8 were diagnosed with colorectal cancer within 12 months. The positive predictive value of FIT for colorectal cancer in the low-risk symptomatic population was 7.0% (95% CI 5.1% to 9.3%) and the negative predictive value was 99.8% (CI 99.5% to 99.9%). Sensitivity was 84.3% (CI 71.4% to 93.0%), and specificity 85.0% (CI 83.8% to 86.1%). The area under the ROC curve was 0.92 (CI 0.86 to 0.96). A threshold of 37g Hb/g faeces would identify patients with an individual 3% risk of cancer. Conclusions FIT performs exceptionally well to triage patients with low-risk symptoms of colorectal cancer in primary care.

Currently, no specific vaccine or treatment has been approved for this disease. To develop a therapeutic agent for SFTS, we isolated antibodies from a phage-displayed antibody library that was constructed from a patient who recovered from SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection. One antibody, designated as Ab10, was reactive to the Gn envelope glycoprotein of SFTSV and protected host cells and A129 mice from infection in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Notably, Ab10 protected 80% of mice, even when injected 5 days after inoculation with a lethal dose of SFTSV. Using cross-linker assisted mass spectrometry and alanine scanning, we located the non-linear epitope of Ab10 on the Gn glycoprotein domain II and an unstructured stem region, suggesting that Ab10 may inhibit a conformational alteration that is critical for cell membrane fusion between the virus and host cell. Ab10 reacted to recombinant Gn glycoprotein in Gangwon/Korea/2012, HB28, and SD4 strains. Additionally, based on its epitope, we predict that Ab10 binds the Gn glycoprotein in 247 of 272 reported SFTSV isolates previously reported. Together, these data suggest that Ab10 has potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent that could protect against more than 90% of reported SFTSV isolates. Author summary Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease localized to China, Japan, and Korea. This tick-borne virus has infected more than 5,000 humans with a 6.4% to 20.9% fatality rate. Currently, there are no prophylactic or therapeutic measures against this virus. Historically, antibodies from patients who recovered from viral infection have been used to treat new patients. Until now, one recombinant monoclonal antibody was approved for the prophylaxis of respiratory syntial virus infection. We selected 10 antibodies from a patient who recovered from SFTS and found that one antibody potently inhibited SFTS viral infection in both test tube and animal studies. We determined the binding site of this antibody to SFTS virus, which allowed us to predict that this antibody could bind 247 out of 272 SFTS virus isolates reported up to now. We anticipate that this antibody could be developed into a therapeutic measure against SFTS.","output":"An anti-Gn glycoprotein antibody from a convalescent patient potently inhibits the infection of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergency or crisis management, both in civilian or military context, is regarded as a complex socio-technical system, whose dynamic nature and complexity require a holistic approach. Over time, scholars developed diverse strategies and methods to capture such complexity and effectively design emergency plans for more or less severe disasters scenarios.

This manuscript explores such adaptive capacity as put in place by a leading Norwegian organization in providing emergency management solutions, facing unexpected challenges (at the time of the event): handling of Covid-19 infection episodes on offshore oil platforms. The study, conducted through the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) highlights the relevance of organizational learning which allows to handle emergencies by adapting plans to the specific context and by renewing new emergency management procedures derived from lessons learned. The study focuses on three different Covid-19 infection management cases to understand the nuances of actions and emerging adaptations that led to the development of a revised of an emergency plan, seen again through the lens of FRAM. While the methodological approach refers to Covid-19 infection management, we believe it can be extended into larger crisis management, providing a use case for the applicability of FRAM into emergency management scenarios.","output":"Resilience in emergency management: Learning from COVID-19 in oil and gas platforms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses most often infect the respiratory or intestinal tract.

Among them, insufficiently large listing of medical services covered by MMI, inability to provide medical services to all those in need due to shortage of equipment, working areas, qualified care, etc. It is noted that among the general trends of MMI, the Russian medical insurance system (not only that it is not a classical one), especially during the pandemic, is broken out of social insurance: two funds, structures, costs of informatization, etc. However, in Russia, even in such conditions, health care is funded through the MMI system up to 50%.

Do the sweat glands maximum ion reabsorption rates increase following heat acclimation in healthy older individuals and is this associated with elevated aldosterone concentrations? What is the main finding and its importance? Sweat glands maximum ion reabsorption rates improved heterogeneously across body sites, which occurred without any changes in aldosterone concentration following a controlled hyperthermic heat acclimation protocol in healthy older individuals. ABSTRACT We examined whether the eccrine sweat glands ion reabsorption rates improved following heat acclimation (HA) in older individuals. Ten healthy older adults (>65 yrs) completed a controlled hyperthermic (+0.9?C rectal temperature, Tre ) HA protocol for 9 non-consecutive days. Participants completed a passive heat stress test (lower leg 42?C water submersion) pre-HA and post-HA to assess physiological regulation of sweat glands ions reabsorption at the chest, forearm and thigh. The maximum ion reabsorption rate was defined as the inflection point in the slope of the relation between galvanic skin conductance and sweat rate (SR). We explored the responses again after a 7-day decay. During passive heating, the Tb thresholds for sweat onset on the chest and forearm were lowered after HA (P < 0.05). However, neither sweat sensitivity (i.e. the slope), the SR at a given Tre , nor gross sweat loss improved after HA (P > 0.05). Any changes observed were lost during the decay. Pilocarpine-induced sudomotor responses to iontophoresis did not change after HA (P  0.801). Maximum ion reabsorption rate was only enhanced at the chest (P = 0.001) despite unaltered aldosterone concentration after HA. The data suggests that this adaptation is lost after 7-days decay. The HA protocol employed in the present study induced partial adaptive sudomotor responses. Eccrine sweat glands ion reabsorption rates improved heterogeneously across the skin sites. It is likely that aldosterone secretion did not alter the chest sweat ion reabsorption rates observed in the older adults. This article is protected by copyright.

STUDY DESIGN: 152 HAdV positive samples were genotyped by Sanger sequencing of a fragment of the hexon gene using published primers along with a newly developed primer set for enhanced genotyping of HAdV D. Phylogenetic analysis was used for genotyping and genotypes were compared with epidemiological information. In addition, HAdV burden and co-infection was evaluated for samples tested in laboratory analysis packages. RESULTS: Six out of seven HAdV species were identified and represented by 13 types. Young children (<5 years old) were more likely to be positive for HAdV and co-infections with other gastrointestinal or respiratory viruses were common. Possible outbreaks of ocular infections due to HAdV D could not be confirmed. CONCLUSION: A diverse set of HAdV species were circulating in Denmark in the study period and although possible transmission clusters were identified, this could not be verified with current genotyping methods Young children were commonly affected by HAdV infection and co-infections with other viral pathogens were frequent suggesting a possible underestimation of the real HAdV burden.","output":"Molecular epidemiology of human adenovirus infections in Denmark, 2011C2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a procedure to introduce general dependence structures on a set of Dirichlet processes.

Methods: We conducted an electronic, prospective, cross-sectional national survey of EPs from October 6CDecember 29, 2020. Measures assessed negative mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and insomnia), positive work-related outcomes, and strategies used to cope with COVID-19. After preliminary analyses and internal reliability testing, we performed four separate three-stage hierarchical multiple regression analyses to examine individual and organizational predictive factors for psychological distress. Results: Response rate was 50%, with 517 EPs completing the survey from 11 different sites. Overall, 85% of respondents reported negative psychological effects due to COVID-19. Participants reported feeling more stressed (31%), lonelier (26%), more anxious (25%), more irritable (24%) and sadder (17.5%). Prevalence of mental health conditions was 17% for depression, 13% for anxiety, 7.5% for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 18% for insomnia. Regular exercise decreased from 69% to 56%, while daily alcohol use increased from 8% to 15%. Coping strategies of behavioral disengagement, self-blame, and venting were significant predictors of psychological distress, while humor and positive reframing were negatively associated with psychological distress. Conclusion: Emergency physicians have experienced high levels of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those using avoidant coping strategies were most likely to experience depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD, while humor and positive reframing were effective coping strategies.","output":"Sources of Distress and Coping Strategies Among Emergency Physicians During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter provides evidence that population health in the Emerging European Economies (EEE) lagged behind the EU average before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.

However, the advancement in medical science has made it possible to identify that the novel infectious agent is from the coronavirus family. Rapid genome sequencing by various groups helped in identifying the structure and function of the virus, its immunogenicity in diverse populations, and potential preventive measures. Coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, causing pneumonia and lymphopenia in infected individuals. Viral components like spike and nucleocapsid proteins trigger an immune response in the host to eliminate the virus. These viral antigens can be either recognized by the B cells or presented by MHC complexes to the T cells, resulting in antibody production, increased cytokine secretion, and cytolytic activity in the acute phase of infection. Genetic polymorphism in MHC enables it to present some of the T cell epitopes very well over the other MHC alleles. The association of MHC alleles and its downregulated expression has been correlated with disease severity against influenza and coronaviruses. Studies have reported that infected individuals can, after recovery, induce strong protective responses by generating a memory T-cell pool against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These memory T cells were not persistent in the long term and, upon reactivation, caused local damage due to cross-reactivity. So far, the reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2, which is highly contagious, shows related symptoms in three different stages and develops an exhaustive T-cell pool at higher loads of viral infection. As there are no specific treatments available for this novel coronavirus, numerous small molecular drugs that are being used for the treatment of diseases like SARS, MERS, HIV, ebola, malaria, and tuberculosis are being given to COVID-19 patients, and clinical trials for many such drugs have already begun. A classical immunotherapy of convalescent plasma transfusion from recovered patients has also been initiated for the neutralization of viremia in terminally ill COVID-19 patients. Due to the limitations of plasma transfusion, researchers are now focusing on developing neutralizing antibodies against virus particles along with immuno-modulation of cytokines like IL-6, Type I interferons (IFNs), and TNF-&#945; that could help in combating the infection. This review highlights the similarities of the coronaviruses that caused SARS and MERS to the novel SARS-CoV-2 in relation to their pathogenicity and immunogenicity and also focuses on various treatment strategies that could be employed for curing COVID-19.","output":"Overview of Immune Response During SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Lessons From the Past"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is essential to examine the longevity of the defensive immune response engendered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

With learning promising to be online, at least in part, for the near future, instructors may be thinking of providing online collaborative learning opportunities to their students who are increasingly isolated from their peers because of social distancing guidelines. This paper aims to provide design recommendations for online collaborative project-based learning exercises based on this research in a software engineering course at the university level. Design/methodology/approach: Through joint work between learning scientists, course instructors and software engineering practitioners, instructional design best practices of alignment between the context of the learners, the learning objectives, the task and the assessment are actualized in the design of collaborative programming projects for supporting learning. The design, first segments a short real-time collaborative exercise into tasks, each with a problem-solving phase where students participate in collaborative programming, and a reflection phase for reflecting on what they learned in the task. Within these phases, a role-assignment paradigm scaffolds collaboration by assigning groups of four students to four complementary roles that rotate after each task. Findings: By aligning each task with granular learning objectives, significant pre- to post-test learning from the exercise as well as each task is observed. Originality/value: The roles used in the paradigm discourage divide-and-conquer tendencies often associated with collaborative projects. By requiring students to discuss conflicting ideas to arrive at a consensus implementation, their ideas are made explicit, thus providing opportunities for clarifying misconceptions through discussion and learning from the collaboration.","output":"Designing for learning during collaborative projects online: tools and takeaways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is associated with elevated rates of anxiety and relatively lower compliance with public health guidelines in younger adults. To develop strategies for reducing anxiety and increasing adherence with health guidelines, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to anxiety and health compliance in the context of COVID-19. Earlier research has shown that greater perceived risk of negative events and their costs are associated with increased anxiety and compliance with health behaviors, but it is unclear what role they play in a novel pandemic surrounded by uncertainty. In the present study we measured (1) perceived risk as the self-reported probability of being infected and experiencing serious symptoms due to COVID-19 and (2) perceived cost as financial, real-world, physical, social, and emotional consequences of being infected with COVID-19. Worry was assessed using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PWSQ) and health compliance was measured as endorsement of the World Health Organization (WHO) health directives for COVID-19. Our results showed that greater perceived risk and costs of contracting the COVID-19 virus were associated with greater worry and while only costs were associated with greater compliance with health behaviors. Neither self-reported worry nor its interaction with cost estimates was associated with increased engagement in health behaviors. Our results provide important insight into decision making mechanisms involved in both increased anxiety and health compliance in COVID-19 and have implications for developing psychoeducational and psychotherapeutic strategies to target both domains.","output":"Online Survey of the Impact of COVID-19 Risk and Cost Estimates on Worry and Health Behavior Compliance in Young Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The air quality in the cities of developing countries is deteriorating with the proliferation of anthropogenic activities that add pollutant matters in the lower part of the troposphere Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter lower than 10 m (PM(10)) is considered one of the direct indicators of air quality in an urban area as it brings health morbidities The article empirically investigates the role COVID-19 related lockdown has played in bringing down pollution level (PM(10)) in the megacity of Kolkata It does so by taking account of PM(10) level in three stages - pre, presage and complete-lockdown timelines The extracted results show a significant declining trend (about 77% vis-a-vis the pre-lockdown period) with 95% of the geographical area under 100 m/m(3) and a strong fit with the station-based records The feasibility and robustness showed by the remotely sensed data along with other earth observatory information for larger-scale pollution prevalence make its adoption imperative Simultaneously, it becomes urgent in times of lockdown when the physical mobility of maintenance and research staff to stations is significantly curtailed The work contributes to study on PM(10) by its ability to replicate in examining cities of both the global north and global south","output":"COVID-19 induced lockdown and decreasing particulate matter (PM10): An empirical investigation of an Asian megacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Given the importance of possible vertical transmission, it is essential to study all neonates delivered from COVID-19 positive mothers to analyze the route of transmission of infection that will optimize the universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 and minimize the risk of disease in neonates","output":"A neonate born to an infected COVID-19 mother was tested positive just 24 hours after its birth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Although myocardial injury can occur with acute COVID-19, there is limited understanding of changes with myocardial metabolism in recovered patients.

The virus is transmitted by inhalation of infectious particles suspended in the air, direct deposition on mucous membranes and indirect contact via contaminated surfaces. Therefore, disinfection methods that can halt such transmission are important in this pandemic and in future viral infections. AIM: Highlight the efficacy of several disinfection methods against SARS-CoV-2, based on up-to-date evidence found in literature. METHODS: A research was conducted through two databases to assess the disinfection methods used against SARS-CoV-2. From a total of 1229 studies found, 60 were included. Quality assessment was evaluated by the OHAT risk of bias tool. FINDINGS: Disinfection methods on environmental surfaces were approached by 28 studies; 16 articles addressed disinfection methods used on biological surfaces; 4 articles presented disinfection methods for airborne coronavirus and 16 studies demonstrated methods used to recondition PPEs. CONCLUSIONS: Several household and hospital disinfection agents and UV-C irradiation were effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 on environmental surfaces. Formulations containing povidone-iodine can provide virucidal action on the skin and mucous membranes. In the case of hand hygiene, typical soap bars and alcohols can inactivate SARS-CoV-2.

Results: : Covid-19 patients were older (46.4018.21 years vs 34.4318.80 years) and hada higher body weight (70.2710.67 kg vs 60.5412.33 kg, P <0.05). The main symptoms that were similar between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients, and Covid-19 patients showed a lower incidence of sputum production (6.67% vs 45.16%, P <0.01) and a lower white-cell count (4.8310 9 /L vs 7.4310 9 /L) and lymphocyte count (0.9010 9 /L vs 1.5710 9 /L) ( P <0.01). Although there were no differences, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were elevated in Covid-19 patients. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of CT images were 0.87 and 0.97, respectively. Covid-19 patients showed a higher contact history of Wuhan residents (80% vs 30.11%) and higher familial clustering (53.33% vs 8.60%, P <0.001). Covid-19 patients showed a higher major adverse events (ARDS, 13.33%;death, 6.67%;P <0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggested that Covid-19 patients had a significant history of exposure and familial clustering and a higher rate of severe status;biochemical indicators showed lymphocyte depletion.","output":"The preliminary comparative results between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients in Western China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among passengers and crew on a cruise ship led to quarantine of approximately 3,700 passengers and crew that began on February 3, 2020, and lasted for nearly 4 weeks at the Port of Yokohama, Japan (1).

To date, such a manipulation is realized mainly via spin-polarized current based on spin-transfer torque or spin-orbital torque effect. However, this scheme is energy consuming and may produce massive Joule heating. To reduce energy dissipation and risk of heightened temperatures of skyrmion-based devices, an effective solution is to use electric field instead of current as stimulus. Here, we realize an electric-field manipulation of skyrmions in a nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectrical heterostructure at room temperature via an inverse magneto-mechanical effect. Intriguingly, such a manipulation is non-volatile and exhibits a multistate feature. Numerical simulations indicate that the electric-field manipulation of skyrmions originates from strain-mediated modification of effective magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

It is of great importance to forecast the number of cases in terms of strategic decisions to be taken by governments especially in outbreak periods and to manage the dilemma mentioned. One of the important issues today is the Covid-19 outbreak for almost all countries. Unfortunately, no effective vaccine or treatment has been found for Covid-19 yet. At the time of this study, however, it was reported that the total number of reported cases by the World Health Organization worldwide was more than thirteen million. Various quarantine measures have been necessary to deal with such a large epidemic. Quarantine measures taken by governments bring countries to face to face with the economic crisis. This creates economic uncertainties and puts governments under tremendous pressure to make accurate and least harmful strategic decisions. For these reasons, governments prefer to make strategic decisions for Covid-19 step by step observing the situation rather than making a sudden decision. If the number of pandemic cases could be predicted before a predetermined time, it would be used as an important guide for governments to manage public health and economic dilemma more accurately. Therefore, this study provides artificial neural network (ANN) and deep learning models (long-short term memory, LSTM networks) to forecast Covid-19 cases before 7-day. The proposed models were tested on real data for Turkey. The results showed that LSTM models performed better than ANN models in both cumulative cases and new cases on the training data set. Comparing the performance of the proposed models over the whole data set, it was observed that the ANN and LSTM algorithms gave competitive results. I addition, the cumulative case forecast performances of both ANN and LSTM models were observed to be better than the new case forecast.","output":"YAPAY SNR A?LARI VE DERN ??RENME KULLANARAK TRKYE''DEK COVID-19 VAKALARI ?N TAHMN MODELLER"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Dental team members require fit testing for respirators to deliver aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Health Canada defines side effect as a harmful and unintended response to a health product. Given drug safety concerns, this study's purpose was to review the unintended side effects of cannabis in otolaryngology. METHODS The Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) protocol was used to conduct a scoping review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases. (PROSPERO: CRD42020153022). English studies in adults were included from inception to the end of 2019. In-vitro, animal, and studies with n < 5 were excluded. Primary outcome was defined as unintended side effects (defined as any Otolaryngology symptom or diagnosis) following cannabis use. Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine: Levels of Evidence and risk of bias using the Risk of Bias in randomized trials (RoB 2) and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tools were assessed.. Two authors independently reviewed all studies; the senior author settled any discrepancies. RESULTS Five hundred and twenty-one studies were screened; 48 studies were analysed. Subspecialties comprised: Head and Neck (32), Otology (8), Rhinology (5), Airway (5), Laryngology (1). Cannabis use was associated with unintended tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss, infection, malignancy, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, thyroid dysfunction, and dyspnea. About half (54.1%) of studies showed increased side effects, or no change in symptoms following cannabis use. Oxford Levels of Evidence was 2-4 with substantial heterogeneity. Risk of bias assessment with RoB2 was low to high and ROBINS-1 was moderate to critical. CONCLUSION This was the first comprehensive scoping review of unintended side effects of cannabis in Otolaryngology. The current literature is limited and lacks high-quality research Future randomized studies are needed to focus on therapeutic effects of cannabis in otolaryngology. Substantial work remains to guide clinicians to suggest safe, evidence-based choices for cannabis use.","output":"Cannabis related side effects in otolaryngology: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present system concept of metal and scrap recycling plants deals with possible effects of renewed legislative amendments and evaluates legal and technological as well as economical aspects of the value stream oriented shredder process.

Consequently, in many hospitals, these drugs were discontinued as a \\"precautionary measure\\". We aimed to assess whether the in-hospital discontinuation of ARBs or ACEIs, in real-life conditions, was associated with a reduced risk of death as compared to their continuation and also to compare head-to-head the continuation of ARBs with the continuation of ACEIs. METHODS: Adult patients with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission during March 2020 were consecutively selected from 7 hospitals in Madrid, Spain. Among them, we identified outpatient users of ACEIs/ARBs and divided them in two cohorts depending on treatment discontinuation/continuation at admission. Then, they were followed-up until discharge or in-hospital death. An intention-to-treat survival analysis was carried out and hazard ratios (HRs), and their 95%CIs were computed through a Cox regression model adjusted for propensity scores of discontinuation and controlled by potential mediators. RESULTS: Out of 625 ACEI/ARB users, 340 (54.4%) discontinued treatment. The in-hospital mortality rates were 27.6% and 27.7% in discontinuation and continuation cohorts, respectively (HR=1.01; 95%CI 0.70-1.46). No difference in mortality was observed between ARB and ACEI discontinuation (28.6% vs. 27.1%, respectively), while a significantly lower mortality rate was found among patients who continued with ARBs (20.8%, N=125) as compared to those who continued with ACEIs (33.1%, N=136; p=0.03). The head-to-head comparison (ARB vs. ACEI continuation) yielded an adjusted HR of 0.52 (95%CI 0.29-0.93), being especially notorious among males (HR=0.34; 95%CI 0.12-0.93), subjects older than 74 years (HR=0.46; 95%CI 0.25-0.85), and patients with obesity (HR=0.22; 95%CI 0.05-0.94), diabetes (HR=0.36; 95%CI 0.13-0.97), and heart failure (HR=0.12; 95%CI 0.03-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: The discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs at admission did not improve the in-hospital survival.

DESIGN: Multisite, pre-post single-group evaluation. SETTING: Community-based social service organizations (Na?=a?16) in five U.S. states, purposively sampled for maximum variation of participants and providers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 320 homebound older adults (mean(SD) age 72.9(9.6), 79% female, 44% people of color, 81% low-income, 61% living alone, average four chronic conditions) with clinically significant depression (PHQ-9 mean(SD) 12.7(4.6)). INTERVENTION: Four to 6 month home-based depression care management model delivered by trained front-line providers. MEASUREMENTS: Brief validated social connectedness scales: Duke Social Support Index 10-item (DSSI-10), PROMIS-Social Isolation (6-item), UCLA-Loneliness (3-item); sociodemographic and health measures. RESULTS: At baseline, PEARLS participants overall and with &#8805;1 of the following characteristics were less socially connected: younger (50-64), white, LGBTQ+, not partnered, not caregiving, living alone, financial limitations, chronic conditions, and/or recently hospitalized. Six-months post-PEARLS enrollment, participants significantly increased social interactions and satisfaction with social support (DSSI-10 t[312]a?=a?5.2, p <0.001); and reduced perceived isolation (PROMIS t[310]a?=a?6.3, p <0.001); and loneliness (UCLA t[301]a?=a?3.7, p =0.002), with small to moderate effect sizes (Cohen's d DSSI-10: 0.28, PROMIS-SI: 0.35, UCLA: 0.21). Increased social connectedness was associated with reduced depression. Improvements in social connectedness (except social interactions) persisted during early COVID-19.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey. Individuals were eligible to participate if they were currently a registered, licensed pharmacist practicing in Canada. We collected perspectives of both telepharmacy users and non-users by creating a survey logic that asked specific and shared questions between the two groups. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics including means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. Results: Between October and December 2020, 136 pharmacists completed the survey, including 61 (52.6%) telepharmacy users and 55 (47.4%) non-users.

Nonetheless, our study identified areas of consideration for better integration of telepharmacy in pharmacy practice including optimizing workflow, addressing barriers, and providing training to pharmacy students.","output":"Perspectives and experiences with telepharmacy among pharmacists in Canada: A cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Erythrocytes have long been mistaken as exclusively inert oxygen carriers lacking immune function. Here we show that red blood cells (RBCs) serve as immune sensors through surface expression of the nucleic acid-sensing toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a classically endosomal receptor that initiates immune responses following the detection of unmethylated CpG motifs present in pathogen and mitochondrial DNA. Mammalian RBCs express TLR9 on their surface and bind CpG-containing bacterial, malarial, and mitochondrial DNA. Erythrocyte-bound CpG DNA increases during infection, and CpG-carrying RBCs trigger accelerated erythrophagocytosis and innate immune activation characterized by RBC-TLR9 dependent local and systemic cytokine production. Thus, RBC nucleic acid detection and capture regulates red cell clearance and immune responses and provides evidence for RBCs as innate immune sentinels during pathologic states.

Previous research has investigated the impact of media richness on user satisfaction; however, little attention has been given to the mixed effects of the nesting of multiple media. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact and differences of the use of single or mixed media on users perceived effect from the perspectives of social support and satisfaction by mining user reviews on online health platforms. The data were collected from a professional online psychological counseling platform. We collected data on 48,807 reviews from 11,694 users. Text annotation and sentiment analysis were then used to extract variable eigenvalues from the reviews. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and hierarchical regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. The results show that mixed media with different richness has a significant impact on the users perceived effects. Among them, compared to text + audio, using text + audio + video/face to face can significantly improve the users perceived social support and satisfaction. However, compared to single medium, mixed media with higher richness may not necessarily achieve a better effect. We found that the inclusion of video/face to face mixed media significantly reduced the users perceived social support and satisfaction compared to text or audio use alone. These research results complement the blank media richness theory in the field of online health care and provide guidance for improving the personalized customization of online psychological counseling platforms.","output":"Are Diverse Media Better than a Single Medium?

To answer this question, I examine reports and publications by government and civil society bodies as well as news coverage about the campaign. Drawing on insights from the sociology of the state and from science and technology studies, I argue that Israel was able to secure vaccines by using its state-power as a form of currency.

However, traditional air cleaning systems (e.g. fibrous filter, electrostatic removal system) have some risks in operation process, including re-aerosolization and electric breakdown. To avoid these risks, the current study proposed an UV+Filter (ultraviolet and fibrous pleated filter) system to efficiently capture airborne SARS-CoV-2 aerosols and deactivate them in filter medium. It is challenging to quantitatively design UV+Filter due to complex characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols (e.g. aerodynamic size, biological susceptibility) and hybrid filtration/disinfection processes. This study numerically investigated the overall performances of different air cleaning devices (e.g. Fibrous-filter, UV+Filter, two-stage ESP (electrostatic precipitator) et al.) for removal of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols and compared them in term of filtration efficiency, energy consumption and secondary pollution. The prediction of developed models was validated with the experimental data from literature. UV+Filter is the most reliable and safest, while its energy consumption is highest.

Since in vitro models recapitulating this are limited, the aims of this study were to develop mixed macrovesicular steatosis in immortalized hepatocytes and investigate effects on intracellular metabolism by altering nutritional substrates. METHODS Huh7 cells were cultured in 11 mM glucose and 2% human serum (HS) for 7 days before additional sugars and fatty acids (FAs), either with 200 M FAs (low fat low sugar; LFLS), 5.5 mM fructose + 200 M FAs (low fat high sugar; LFHS), or 5.5 mM fructose + 800 M FAs (high fat high sugar; HFHS), were added for 7 days. FA metabolism, lipid droplet characteristics, and transcriptomic signatures were investigated. RESULTS Between the LFLS and LFHS conditions, there were few notable differences. In the HFHS condition, intracellular triacylglycerol (TAG) was increased and the LD pattern and distribution was similar to that found in primary steatotic hepatocytes. HFHS-treated cells had lower levels of de novo-derived FAs and secreted larger, TAG-rich lipoprotein particles. RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis showed changes in several pathways including those involved in metabolism and cell cycle. CONCLUSIONS Repeated doses of HFHS treatment resulted in a cellular model of NAFLD with a mixed macrovesicular LD pattern and metabolic dysfunction.

Conversely, bottom-up approaches that build on and mobilize community health assets are often critiqued for tasking the most vulnerable and marginalized communities to use their own limited resources without real opportunities for change. Taking into consideration these community health promotion shortcomings, this article asks how communities may be most effectively and appropriately supported in pursuing their health. This article reviews how community health is understood, moving from negative to positive conceptualizations; how it is determined, moving from a risk-factor orientation to social determination; and how it is promoted, moving from top-down to bottom-up approaches. Building on these understandings, we offer the concept of 'resourcefulness' as an approach to strengthen positive health for communities, and we discuss how it engages with three interrelated tensions in community health promotion: resources and sustainability, interdependence and autonomy, and community diversity and inclusion. We make practical suggestions for outside organizations to apply resourcefulness as a process-based, place-based, and relational approach to community health promotion, arguing that resourcefulness can forge new pathways to sustainable and self-sustaining community positive health.","output":"Toward resourcefulness: pathways for community positive health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Since the global financial crises of 2008, there has been a rise in the number of people experiencing food insecurity.

In this study, we build a statistical model that resolves this interpretation issue. A varying coefficient model with basis expansion is used to capture the nonlinear structure of the weather effect. This approach results in an interpretable model when the regression coefficients are nonnegative. To estimate the nonnegative regression coefficients, we employ nonnegative least squares. Three real data analyses show the practicality of our proposed statistical modeling. Two of them demonstrate good forecast accuracy and interpretability of our proposed method.

The aims were to describe the characteristics of ICU patients with a C. spp. positive deep respiratory specimen, to investigate the impact of C. spp. on the occurrence of pneumonia, and to evaluate the outcomes of these pneumonia. METHODS: We retrospectively included all adult patients admitted to ICU in a 1000-bed University Hospital (2007C2017) who had a C. spp. positive lower respiratory tract specimen at a significant quantitative level. We used clinical, radiological, and microbiological criteria to classify the likelihood of such pneumonia. RESULTS: Among the 31 patients included, acute respiratory failure and postoperative care after major surgery were the main reasons of admission. SAPS II was 47 [34C60]. C. spp. pneumonia was considered as probable, possible and unlikely in 10, 14, and 7 patients, respectively. Fifty-two and 94% of C. spp. strains were sensitive to amoxicillin, and vancomycin/linezolid, respectively. Seventeen patients had a complete course of antibiotic against C. spp. The overall ICU mortality was 58%.

Transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparison method to identify themes. Most respondents described a recent uptick in opioid use independently, and in combination with other substances. As compared to heroin, NMPO was perceived to be more frequently used and less stigmatized among youth. Stakeholders perceived the process of transitioning from using NMPO to heroin as more common among White vs. Black youth and was perceived as occurring faster among White vs. Black youth. Some stakeholders believed racial differences in internal stigma against heroin use, and differential health service use among Black youth and White youth may have influenced these differences. Trauma and poverty were noted determinants of youth opioid use. Barriers to service provision included youth cognitive development, stigma and structural factors (e.g., disinvestment, lack of youth-centered and integrated services). Stakeholders perceive prevalent NMPO among Baltimore youth and identify multilevel barriers to delivering prevention, treatment and harm reduction services to this population.

A CDK 4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy is recommended as 1st line therapy for patients with metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer. CDK 4/6 inhibitors have purported immunomodulatory effects and while effective, myelosuppression is a common adverse effect of CDK 4/6 inhibitor treatment of breast cancer. The impact of CDK 4/6 inhibitor therapy on immunogenicity of vaccines is not known. In this study, we evaluated the spike antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines among patients with breast cancer receiving endocrine therapy with or without CDK 4/6 inhibitors. Methods: In the Cancer COVID and Vaccine (CANVAX) study eligible patients included patients with breast cancer who had completed all scheduled doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Chart review was conducted to identify patients who had received endocrine therapy with or without CDK 4/6 inhibitor. We used validated assays to measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 total IgA/M/G spike antibodies and virus neutralization. We evaluated the magnitude of antibody response based on geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) as well as the % of patients with inadequate seroconversion (defined as levels <100 U/ml). Independent T-test based on log-transformed antibody values was utilized to compare the spike antibody levels and p value of  0.05 Swas considered statistically significant.

However, patients who received Ad26.COV2.S had lower levels of mean spike antibody levels (GMC 47 U/ml), compared with patients treated with BNT162b2 (GMC 400 U/ml) or mRNA1273 (GMC 2203 U/mL;P<0.01 for both comparisons). Comparison of neutralization titers in 66 individuals supported the above results. 11 (15.1%) patients had low antibody titers (<100U/ml) of seroconversion and 3 received a booster vaccine, with 1 having available repeat titer results thus far demonstrating a significant improvement. Conclusions: The majority of patients receiving CDK 4/6 inhibitor have adequate antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, particularly mRNA vaccines. However, a minority of patients may require booster vaccine to augment immunity. Monitoring spike antibody levels could be helpful to identify patients with inadequate seroconversion and guide mitigation strategies for patients with breast cancer.","output":"Immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with breast cancer receiving CDK 4/6 inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even though they are conscious, patients who are unable to speak while connected to a mechanical ventilator have serious difficulties in communicating with healthcare staff.

Between the 10th and the 23rd of May 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among a representative sample of the French population aged 18 and over and a specific sample of the French population over 65. Among the 3,056 respondents, 28.0% (856) would consider participation in a COVID-19 VCT. Factors independently negatively associated with willingness to participate in a COVID-19 VCT were female gender with an adjusted odd ratio (aOR) 0.42 and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.35-0.51, and mistrust in health actors (in their own physician and pharmacists, health ministry, government, scientists in medias, medias and pharmaceutical companies) with aOR 0.86 (95% CI 0.84-0.88) by one-point increase in mistrust in health actors score. Factors positively associated with willingness to participate in a COVID-19 VCT were COVID-19 vaccination or intention to get vaccinated with aOR 4.89 (95% CI 3.15-7.61), being a healthcare worker with aOR 2.051 (95% CI 1.51-2.80), being at risk for severe COVID-19 with aOR 1.39 (95% CI 1.14-1.69) and altruism as the main reason for getting vaccination with aOR 1.56 (95% CI 1.29-1.88). In May 2021, despite COVID 19 vaccine availability, 28% of the French population would agree to participate in a COVID-19 VCT.

Control measures such as social distancing, use of face masks in public places, business and school closures, city or transportation lockdowns, mass gathering bans, population education and engagement, contact tracing, and improved mass testing protocols are being used to contain the pandemic. Currently, there are no studies to date that rank the effectiveness of these measures, resulting in government responses that may be uncoordinated and inefficient. In this study, we developed a Discrete Time Markov Chain model that captures the above control measures and ranks them. We found that the importance of the measures changes over time and depends on the stage of transmission dynamics, as well as the ecological environment. For example, contact tracing is a powerful measure to effectively control the pandemic, however, our results show that while it is indeed helpful during the early stages of the pandemic, it is much less important after a vaccination program takes effect. Besides, our model improved the standard SEIR compartmental model by taking into account the dynamic temporal transmission and recovery probabilities along with considering a portion of the population that will not comply with government-mandated control measures.

Prioritizing cleft/craniofacial surgery in the already overloaded medical system will then become an issue. The European Cleft Palate Craniofacial Association, together with the European Cleft and Craniofacial Initiative for Equality in Care, performed a brief survey to capture a current snapshot during a rapidly evolving pandemic. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to the 2242 participants who attended 1 of 3 recent international cleft/craniofacial meetings. RESULTS: The respondents indicated that children with Robin sequence who were not responding to nonsurgical options should be treated as emergency cases. Over 70% of the respondents indicated that palate repair should be performed before the age of 15 months, an additional 22% stating the same be performed by 18 months. Placement of middle ear tubes, primary cleft lip surgery, alveolar bone grafting, and velopharyngeal insufficiency surgery also need prioritization. Children with craniofacial conditions such as craniosynostosis and increased intracranial pressure need immediate care, whilst children with craniosynostosis and associated obstructive sleep apnea syndrome or proptosis need surgical care within 3 months of the typical timing. Craniosynostosis without signs of increased intracranial pressure needs correction before the age of 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: This survey indicates several areas of cleft and craniofacial conditions that need prioritization, but also certain areas where intervention is less urgent.

The SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory disorders and other life-threatening diseases (during/post-infection) such as black mold disease, diabetes, cardiovascular, and neurological disorders/diseases. COVID-19 infection emerged challenging to control as SARS-CoV-2 transmits through respiratory droplets (> 10 m size range), aerosols (< 5 m), airborne, and particulate matter (PM1.0 PM2.5 and PM10.0). SARS-CoV-2 is more infective in indoor premises due to aerodynamics where droplets, aerosols, and PM1.0/2.5/10.0 float for a longer time and distance leading to a higher probability of it entering upper and lower respiratory tracts. To avoid human-to-human transmission, it is essential to trap and destroy SARS-CoV-2 from the air and provide virus-free air that will significantly reduce indoor viral exposure concerns. In this process, an efficient nano-enable photoelectrochemical oxidation (PECO, a destructive approach to neutralize bio-organism) assisted air purification is undoubtedly a good technological choice. This technical perspective explores the role of PECO-assisted Air-Purifiers (i.e., Molekule as a focus example for proof-of-concept) to trap and destroy indoor microorganisms (bacteria and viruses including Coronaviruses), molds, and allergens, and other indoor air pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and PM1.0/2.5/10.0.

Methods : Lymphocyte subsets were analysed in COVID-19 patients, and the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and CD4+ T cell-related indicators in the colon were compared between patients with and without diarrhoea. Correlation analyses were performed for ACE2 and other indicators to identify the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and CD4+ mediated inflammation. The expression and distribution of CD4+ T cell-associated chemokines and their receptors were detected to determine the possibility of migration of CD4+ T cells to inflammation sites. Results : The CD4+ T cell counts and percentages and CD4/CD8 ratio showed the most significant differences between the two groups. The diarrhoea group expressed higher levels of ACE2, Tbet, and TNF at both the mRNA and protein levels, with no difference from the non-diarrhoea group for the percentage of ACE2+TNF+ cells, indicating an indirect association between ACE2 and TNF. The mRNA expression of CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCR3, and the number of CD4+CXCR3+T cells was increased in the diarrhoea group.

Little is known about risk, presentation and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection in kidney transplantation recipients, who may be at high-risk due to long-term immunosuppression, comorbidity and residual chronic kidney disease. Whilst COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease, in severe cases it can cause kidney and multi-organ failure. It is unknown if immunocompromised hosts are at higher risk of more severe systemic disease. Therefore, we report on seven cases of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients (median age 54 (range 45-69), three females, from a cohort of 2082 managed transplant follow-up patients) over a six-week period in three south London hospitals. Two of seven patients presented within three months of transplantation. Overall, two were managed on an out-patient basis, but the remaining five required hospital admission, four in intensive care units. All patients displayed respiratory symptoms and fever. Other common clinical features included hypoxia, chest crepitation, lymphopenia and high C-reactive protein. Very high D dimer, ferritin and troponin levels occurred in severe cases and likely prognostic. Immunosuppression was modified in six of seven patients.

Blood was collected longitudinally, and SARS-CoV-2-specific binding and live-virus neutralization response to 614D (WT), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variants were evaluated by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assay and Focus Reduction Neutralization Assay (FRNT) respectively. We determined the longevity and persistence of vaccine-induced antibody response in NSCLC patients. The effect of vaccine-type, age, gender, race and cancer therapy on the antibody response was evaluated. ResultsBinding antibody titer to the mRNA vaccines were lower in the NSCLC patients compared to the healthy volunteers (P=<0.0001).

Current terahertz metamaterials cannot be used to develop such protein sensors due to their low refractive index sensitivities. A simple method is proposed that is compatible with all geometrical structures of terahertz metamaterials to increase their refractive index sensitivities. This method uses patterned photoresist to float the split-ring resonators (SRRs) of a terahertz metamaterial at a height of 30 m from its substrate that is deposited with complementary SRRs. The floating terahertz metamaterial has an extremely large refractive index sensitivity of 532 GHz/RIU because its near field is not distributed over the substrate and also because the complementary SRRs confine the field above the substrate. The floating terahertz metamaterial senses bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the protein binding of BSA and anti-BSA as BSA, and anti-BSA solutions with low concentrations that are smaller than 0.150 mol/L are sequentially dropped onto it.

Tapestry combines ideas from compressed sensing and combinatorial group testing to create a new kind of algorithm that is very effective in deconvoluting pooled tests. Unlike Boolean group testing algorithms, the input is a quantitative readout from each test and the output is a list of viral loads for each sample relative to the pool with the highest viral load. For guaranteed recovery of [Formula: see text] infected samples out of [Formula: see text] being tested, Tapestry needs only [Formula: see text] tests with high probability, using random binary pooling matrices. However, we propose deterministic binary pooling matrices based on combinatorial design ideas of Kirkman Triple Systems, which balance between good reconstruction properties and matrix sparsity for ease of pooling while requiring fewer tests in practice. This enables large savings using Tapestry at low prevalence rates while maintaining viability at prevalence rates as high as 9.5%. Empirically we find that single-round Tapestry pooling improves over two-round Dorfman pooling by almost a factor of 2 in the number of tests required. We evaluate Tapestry in simulations with synthetic data obtained using a novel noise model for RT-PCR, and validate it in wet lab experiments with oligomers in quantitative RT-PCR assays.

METHODS We searched seven scientific databases for peer-reviewed publications of all study designs. Two reviewers independently screened the publications for eligibility and performed data extraction. Data were analysed by applying an inductive, interpretive approach for data synthesis. RESULTS Fifteen publications were included for analysis. We identified six factors hat facilitate co-production: 1) prioritizing co-production in the organization, 2) providing a safe environment that promotes trust and patience, 3) using a language the patient understands, 4) respecting the patient's knowledge and priorities, 5) improvising with knowledge and courage, and 6) engaging in self-reflection. CONCLUSIONS The scoping review illustrated that co-production with immigrant patients can be successful if the system and professionals are interested and prepared.

Ventrain? was originally designed to facilitate emergency ventilation using active expiration through short, small-bore cannulas. Herein, we studied its efficacy (oxygenation and ventilation) and safety (avoidance of hyperinflation) in a long, small-bore AEC. METHODS In six anesthetized pigs, the upper airway was obstructed, except for a 100 cm long, 3 mm internal diameter AEC. After apneic desaturation to a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of < 70%, ventilation through the AEC was started with Ventrain at an oxygen flow of 15 Lmin-1, a frequency of 30 breathsmin-1, and an inspiration/expiration ratio of approximately 1:1. It was continued for ten minutes. RESULTS Within one minute, severe hypoxia was reversed from a median [interquartile range] arterial saturation (SaO2) of 48 [34-56] % before initiation of Ventrain ventilation to 100 [99-100] % afterward (median difference 54%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 44 to 67; P = 0.028). In addition, hypercarbia was reversed from PaCO2 of 59 [53-61] mmHg to 40 [38-42] mmHg (median difference of -18 mmHg; 95% CI -21 to -15; P = 0.028). After ten minutes of Ventrain use, peak inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures were lower than during baseline pressure-controlled ventilation (8 [7-9] mmHg vs 12 [10-14] mmHg and -2 [-3 to +1] mmHg vs 4 [2 to 4] mmHg, respectively; P = 0.027 for both). No hemodynamic deterioration occurred. CONCLUSION Ventrain provides rapid reoxygenation and effective ventilation through a small-bore AEC in pigs with an obstructed airway. In clinical emergency situations of obstructed airways, this device may be able to overcome problems of unintentional hyperinflation and high intrapulmonary pressures when ventilating through long, small-bore catheters and could therefore minimize the risks of barotrauma and hemodynamic instability.","output":"Emergency ventilation with the Ventrain? through an airway exchange catheter in a porcine model of complete upper airway obstruction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus, arrhythmias were not in the foreground However, the virus seems to affect many organs and the cardiac tropism is now well known Knowledge in this area is still far from exhaustive, but several series published concerning patients with COVID-19 find a significant proportion of arrhythmias, some of which can potentially lead to a fatal outcome These rhythm disorders are mainly supraventricular, such as atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter but also ventricular disorders like ventricular tachycardias (VT) ventricular fibrillation (VF) and more rarely torsades de pointe (TdP) The causes are multiple, due to the multiorgan damage caused by the virus and potential drug interactions In addition, the question of monitoring rhythm disorders that may emerge in the medium and long term after an infection remains to be explored","output":"[COVID-19 and arrhythmias]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been associated with a high prevalence of myocardial injury and increased cardiovascular morbidity.

METHODS: This prospective, observational study of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection was conducted from June 6th to November 26th, 2020 in a tertiary care hospital. Copeptin and hs-cTnI levels on admission were collected and tested for their association with the primary composite endpoint of ICU admission or 28-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 213 eligible patients with COVID-19 were included of whom 55 (25.8%) reached the primary endpoint. Median levels of copeptin and hs-cTnI at admission were significantly higher in patients with an adverse outcome (Copeptin 29.6 pmol/L, [IQR, 16.2C77.8] vs 17.2 pmol/L [IQR, 7.4C41.0] and hs-cTnI 22.8 ng/L [IQR, 11.5C97.5] vs 10.2 ng/L [5.5C23.1], P<0.001 respectively). ROC analysis demonstrated an optimal cut-off of 19.6 pmol/L for copeptin and 16.2 ng/L for hs-cTnI and an increase of either biomarker was significantly associated with the primary endpoint. The combination of raised hs-cTnI and copeptin yielded a superior prognostic value to individual measurement of biomarkers and was a strong prognostic marker upon multivariable logistic regression analysis (OR 4.274 [95% CI, 1.995C9.154], P<0.001). Addition of copeptin and hs-cTnI to established risk models improved C-statistics and net reclassification indices. CONCLUSION: The combination of raised copeptin and hs-cTnI upon admission is an independent predictor of deterioration (ICU admission) or 28-day mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

METHODS: In this randomized study, 29 child participants (25 males) underwent training with a smart, digital, cognitive stimulation program (KAD_SCL_01) or with 3 commercial video games for 12 weeks, 3 days a week, 15 minutes a day. Participants completed a neuropsychological assessment and a preintervention and postintervention magnetoencephalography study in a resting state with their eyes closed. In addition, information on clinical symptoms was collected from the childs legal guardians. RESULTS: In line with our main hypothesis, we found evidence that smart, digital, cognitive treatment results in improvements in inhibitory control performance. Improvements were also found in visuospatial working memory performance and in the cognitive flexibility, working memory, and behavior and general executive functioning behavioral clinical indexes in this group of participants. Finally, the improvements found in inhibitory control were related to increases in alpha-band power in all participants in the posterior regions, including 2 default mode network regions of the interest: the bilateral precuneus and the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex.

In total, 43.0% of patients had a positive PCR and 56.5% a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 89.2%, specificity 68.2%, likelihood ratio (LR)+ 2.81 and LR- 0.16. Sensitivity was higher in patients with high risk pneumonia (CURB-65 score 3; n = 17, 100%) and with sepsis (SOFA score 2; n = 137, 95.5%). Of the 35 patients (31.8%) with a suspicious CT and a negative RT-PCR, 9 had another respiratory viral pathogen, and in 7 patients, COVID-19 was considered likely. One of nine patients with a non-suspicious CT and a positive PCR had developed symptoms within 48 hours before scanning. DISCUSSION: The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic ED patients is high, but used as a single diagnostic test, CT can not safely diagnose or exclude COVID-19. However, CT can be used as a quick tool to categorize patients into probably positive and probably negative cohorts.","output":"CT in relation to RT-PCR in diagnosing COVID-19 in The Netherlands: A prospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evolution of the COVID-19 disease is monitored on the basis of the daily number of infected patients and the daily number of deaths provided from national health agencies The variation of such parameters with time parallels that described for the growth/decay of historic transportation systems revealing the appearance of discontinuities The evolution of the pandemic disease is represented in terms of two nominally equivalent formulations: a logistic model with sharp changes in its rate parameters, and in topological terms resulting in 2nd order phase transitions in the infected patients/time space","output":"The evolution of COVID-19: A discontinuous approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction - The growing number of cases and deaths due to Covid-19 has prompted the lockdown of the French population from 17th March 2020 This epidemic crisis and containment conditions are likely to impact the mental health of the population Sante publique France has thus set up a behavioural and psychological surveillance with one of the objectives being to assess the state of the mental health of the population, identify its determinants and monitor its evolution Methods - Samples of the general population are issued from an access panel of the BVA polling institute For each wave, an independent sample of 2,000 people aged 18 and over residing in metropolitan France are interviewed via Internet The data presented here are from the first two waves that took place from March 23 to 25 and March 30 to April 1, 2020 Results - In wave 1, the prevalence of anxiety was 26 7%, i e twice the rate observed in the general population (13 5% in 2017) In wave 2, the prevalence of anxiety had significantly decreased to 21 5% Higher risks for anxiety are associated with 1/Socio-demographic characteristics: being a woman, being a parent of children aged 16 years or younger, declaring a difficult financial situation;2/Living conditions related to the epidemic situation: working from home and having a friend or relative who has been ill or has had symptoms of Covid-19;3/Knowledge, attitudes and practices about Covid-19: seeing Covid-19 as a serious disease and feeling vulnerable to the disease Conversely, having a good understanding of the disease transmission route, respecting containment measures, feeling able to adopt protective measures and having confidence in the government action reduce the risk of having anxiety Moreover, the decrease in anxiety between the two waves has not been observed in people who report a difficult financial situation, in the least advantaged socio-professional categories, or in people living in promiscuity, thus reflecting the widening gap of health inequalities during the lockdown Conclusions - These first results helped strengthen and adjust the response for mental health promotion and prevent the development of psychological disorders They also highlight the need to protect and support the most vulnerable households Finally, they suggest a protective effect of the lockdown on anxiety and question a possible upward trend of anxiety level after the lockdown","output":"The mental health of the French facing the Covid-19 crisis: prevalence, evolution and determinants of anxiety disorders during the first two weeks of lockdown (CoviPrev study, 23-25 March and 30 March-1 April, 2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection can produce neurological features.

For example, a patient admitted to a room previously occupied by a patient colonized or infected with one of these pathogens has a higher risk for acquiring one of these pathogens than a patient admitted to a room whose previous occupant was not colonized or infected. This risk is not surprising because multiple studies have demonstrated that surfaces in hospital rooms are poorly cleaned during terminal cleaning. To reduce surface contamination after terminal cleaning, no touch methods of room disinfection have been developed. This article will review the no touch methods, ultraviolet light devices, and hydrogen peroxide systems, with a focus on clinical trials which have used patient colonization or infection as an outcome. Multiple studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet light devices and hydrogen peroxide systems have been shown to inactivate microbes experimentally plated on carrier materials and placed in hospital rooms and to decontaminate surfaces in hospital rooms naturally contaminated with multidrug-resistant pathogens.

Such symbiosis occurs only in a clade of angiosperms known as the nitrogen-fixing clade (NFC). It has long been proposed that root nodule symbiosis evolved several times (in parallel) in the NFC. Two recent phylogenomic studies compared the genomes of nodulating and related non-nodulating species across the four orders of the NFC and found that genes essential for nodule formation are lost or pseudogenized in the non-nodulating species. As these symbiosis genes are specifically involved in the symbiotic interaction, it means that the presence of pseudogenes and the loss of symbiosis genes strongly suggest that their ancestor, which still had functional genes, most likely had a symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. These findings agree with the hypothesis that nodulation evolved once at the common ancestor of the NFC, and challenge the hypothesis of parallel evolution.

However, the safety of cryopreservation has been controversial in unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, especially for bone marrow grafts. In addition, in unrelated HSCT, the effect of the time from harvest to cryopreservation of donor grafts required for the transportation of donor graft has not been fully clarified. Study design: In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the first 112 patients with available data who underwent cryopreserved unrelated blood and marrow transplantation through the Japan Marrow Donor Program during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: There were 112 patients, including 83 who received bone marrow (BM) graft and 29 who received peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft. The median time from stem cell harvest to cryopreservation was 9.9 hours (range 2.6-44.0 hours) and the median time from cryopreservation to infusion was 231.2 hours. The incidence of neutrophil engraftment at day 28 after HSCT was 91.1%, and among 109 patients (excluding 3 patients with early death), all but one achieved neutrophil engraftment within 60 days after HSCT. The time-to-neutrophil and time-to-platelet engraftment were shorter in PBSCT than in BMT, but these differences were not statistically significant (P=0.064 and P=0.18). Multivariate analysis among BM recipients revealed that a higher number of frozen nucleated cells and the absence of HLA mismatch were associated with faster neutrophil engraftment. The time-to-neutrophil engraftment after unrelated cryopreserved BMT was not different from that after unrelated BMT without cryopreservation. Conclusion: Unrelated donor BM and PBSC grafts can be safely cryopreserved even after the transit time from the harvest center to the transplantation center. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, cryopreservation can be considered as an option, while balancing the risks and benefits of the procedure.","output":"Cryopreservation of unrelated hematopoietic stem cells from a blood and marrow donor bank during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The higher rates of psychological disorders in women may partly be attributable to gender differences in response to stressors and coping styles. The objective of this study was to contribute to the growing body of literature investigating gender differences in mental health outcomes and coping styles during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in a large sample of individuals from 59 countries with variable demographic and socio-cultural characteristics. Materials and Methods: Survey data were collected from the general population following a snowball sampling method, and the survey was promoted through social media platforms and mailing lists. Participants included 6882 individuals from the general population from 59 countries around the world. A combination of both standardized and adapted measures was used to create a survey, originally in English and then translated to Spanish, Italian, French, German, and Turkish. Results: Compared with men, women presented with higher levels of trauma-related distress; had a harder time decompressing; were more depressed, anxious and stressed; showed decreased frustration tolerance and reported lower quality of sleep and an increased likelihood of taking sleep medication or other natural sleep remedies. Overall, women tended to be more vulnerable during the pandemic in developing symptoms consistent with various forms of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic distress. However, they also were more likely than men to use a variety of adaptive coping strategies, including concentrating on doing something about the situation and getting emotional support from others. Conclusions: A high prevalence of mood symptoms was noted among women.

As a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), elective surgery and in-patients visits have been cancelled or postponed worldwide. AIM: To systematically explore the impact of the pandemic in the management of ACD. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, MedxRiv, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched to 22 December 2020. Studies which reported on the management of patients with ACD during the COVID-19 pandemic were eligible. For cross sectional studies, outcomes of interest included the number of hospital admission for ACD, as well as key features of disease severity (complicated or not) across two time periods (pre- and during lockdown). RESULTS: A total of 69 papers were inspected, and 21 were eligible for inclusion. Ten papers were cross sectional studies from seven world countries; six were case reports; three were qualitative studies, and two review articles. A 56% overall decrease in admissions for ACD was observed during lockdown, peaking 67% in the largest series. A 4%-8% decrease in the rate of uncomplicated diverticulitis was also noted during the lockdown phase. An initial non-operative management was recommended for complicated diverticulitis, and encouraged to an out-of-hospital regimen. Despite initial concerns on the use of laparoscopy for Hinchey 3 and 4 patients to avoid aerosolized contamination, societal bodies have progressively mitigated their initial recommendations as actual risks are yet to be ascertained.

However, stress is not the only out come as sometimes traumatic event leads towards growth as well. Our objective was to study the relationship between post-traumatic stress, hope, perceived social support and post traumatic growth in police officials who actively participated in war on terror and secondly to highlight the role these factors and demographic variables like marital status and family system play in the promotion of post traumatic growth. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted on the officials of police who participated in war on terror and were currently deployed in peaceful areas. Study was planned at Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad. Sample of the study comprised of 200 police officials. Sample was collected by using non probability purposive sampling technique. This technique was selected as focus of the study was on particular group of police officials who participated in war on terror and had direct exposure of life-threatening trauma during the war. Scales were used in Urdu language. Perceived social support scale and post traumatic growth inventory were available in Urdu language. Scales that were available in English like PDS-5 (PTSD diagnostic scale) and Adult Hope scale were translated in Urdu language and were culturally adapted. Post traumatic growth inventory was used for measuring post traumatic growth. PTSD diagnostic scale (PDS-5) was used for measuring post-traumatic stress. Perceived social support was measured by using Multidimensional scale of social support and hope was measured by using Adult hope scale. RESULTS: Age range of the participants was between 21 to 54 years (Mean 33.6, SD= 6.3). Higher exposure to traumatic events was positively related with growth. Study variables like hope and social support showed positive relationship with post traumatic growth.

The stretch of Tawi river particularly in the Jammu city is experiencing pollution load and the quality is degraded. The present study highlights the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the water quality of Tawi river in Jammu, J&K Union Territory. Water quality data based upon the real-time water monitoring for four locations (Below Tawi Bridge, Bhagwati Nagar, Belicharana and Surajpur) have been obtained from the web link of Jammu and Kashmir Pollution Control Board. The important parameters used in the present study include pH, alkalinity, hardness, conductivity, BOD and COD. The river was designated fit for bathing in all the monitoring locations except Bhagwati Nagar which recorded a BOD value >5 mg/L because of domestic sewage and municipal waste dumping. The overall water quality in the river during lockdown was good and falls in Class B with pH (7.0C8.5), alkalinity (23.25C185.0 mg/L), hardness (84.25C177.5 mg/L), conductivity (117C268 ms/cm). The improved water quality obtained during lockdown is never long-lasting as evident from the BOD and COD values observed during Unlock 1.0 due to accelerated anthropogenic activities in response to overcoming the economic loss, bringing the river water quality back to the degraded state.

The extent to which parents want cost transparency in their childrens care is not well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To explore the preferences and experiences of parents of hospitalized children regarding the discussion and consideration of health care costs in the inpatient care of their children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional multicenter survey study included 6 geographically diverse university-affiliated US childrens hospitals from November 3, 2017, to November 8, 2018. Participants included a convenience sample of English- and Spanish-speaking parents of hospitalized children nearing hospital discharge. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2020, to June 25, 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Parents preferences and experiences regarding transparency of their childs health care costs. Multivariable linear regression examined associations between clinical and sociodemographic variables with parents preferences for knowing, discussing, and considering costs in the clinical setting. Factors included family financial difficulties, childs level of chronic disease, insurance payer, deductible, family poverty level, race, ethnicity, parental educational level, and study site. RESULTS: Of 644 invited participants, 526 (82%) were enrolled (290 [55%] male), of whom 362 (69%) were White individuals, 400 (76%) were non-Hispanic/Latino individuals, and 274 (52%) had children with private insurance. Overall, 397 families (75%) wanted to discuss their childs medical costs, but only 36 (7%) reported having a cost conversation. If cost discussions were to occur, 294 families (56%) would prefer to speak to a financial counselor. Ninety-eight families (19%) worried discussing costs would hurt the quality of their childs care. Families with a medical financial burden unrelated to their hospitalized child had higher mean agreement that their childs physician should consider the familys costs in medical decision-making than families without a medical financial burden (effect size, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.18-0.92]). No variables were consistently associated with cost transparency preferences. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most parents want to discuss their childs costs during an acute hospitalization. Discussions of health care costs may be an important, relatively unexplored component of family-centered care.

MEASUREMENTS: The Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science databases and trial registries were searched from inception to November 5, 2019, and two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of individual outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty-one publications from 29 studies met the eligibility criteria. The data from six randomized controlled trials were used for the meta-analyses. The subgroup analysis including only the studies with the lowest risk of bias showed that SC hydration was associated with fewer adverse effects than intravenous (IV) hydration (risk ratio (RR) = 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53-0.88; P = .003; n = 4; I2 = 0.0%; 545 infusions in each group). In absolute numbers, patients treated with SC hydration had an incidence rate of 90 adverse effects per 1,000 infusions versus 130 adverse effects per 1,000 infusions (95% CI = 102-169) with IV hydration. Secondary outcomes comparing IV with SC hydration showed that SC was 3.2 minutes faster to set up and markedly reduced the risk of agitation (RR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.22-0.79; P = .007; I2 = 65%; n = 3); however, SC hydration delivered a lower volume of fluid and was less efficient at reducing serum osmolality (s-osmolality). CONCLUSIONS: SC hydration is safer than IV hydration and potentially reduces the risk of agitation, but it is less effective.

For instance, more than 200 million people are estimated to have died due to Black Death (bubonic plague) alone. This situation has not changed in near history either. Diseases such as influenza, HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as today, have emerged and threatened the modern human life. The common feature of these diseases can be listed as having a high risk of infection and transmission, rapidly spreading to large areas, and having high mortality rates and causing permanent damage to the body because of the low immunity profile of the exposed population. If the number of cases increases rapidly for these diseases, the capacity of healthcare services can be exceeded and healthcare services can be threatened as well. These characteristics of pandemic diseases force the authorities to take extraordinary precautions such as isolation and quarantine to reduce the risk of infection. However, these applications can make it difficult to provide proper health services to patients. The development of information technologies provides patients an easy and remote access to healthcare services via telemedicine applications. Telemedicine is used for diagnosis and treatment of diseases by following the same practices used in clinics. It also provides care givers a real-time and remote monitoring of their patients, which can be beneficial in terms of reducing the risk of infections and maintaining healthcare services during a pandemic.

The observed morbidity rates of the overall VBDs were significantly lower than the predicted rates (47.04% reduction; t = 31.72, P < 0.001). The greatest decline was found in dengue, with a 77.13% reduction (observed rate vs predicted rate: 0.0574 vs. 0.2510 per 100,000; t = 41.42, P < 0.001). Similarly, the average yearly mortality rate of total VBDs decreased by 77.60%, from 0.0064 per 100,000 population in 2015C2019 to 0.0014 per 100,000 population in 2020 (t = 6.58, P < 0.001). A decreasing trend was also seen in the monthly incidence of total VBDs in 2021 compared to 2020 by 43.14% (t = 5.48, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study verify that the mobility and mortality rates of VBDs significantly decreased from 2015C2019 to 2020C2021, and that they are possibly associated to the continuous COVID-19 mitigation and contamination strategy implemented in China in 2020C2021.

We retrospectively analyzed a COVID-19 cohort recruited during the first 40 days of the epidemic in Italy. We examined the association between obesity and 30-day mortality, admission to ICU, mortality and length of hospital stay in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Demographic, clinical and outcome data were retrospectively analyzed in 331 patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital between 21 February and 31 March 2020. The predictive effect of obesity on mortality was assessed using a Cox proportional-hazard regression model, its effect on ICU admission and mortality in the ICU using logistic regressions, and its effect on length of hospital stay using a linear regression. Seventy-four of 331 patients had a BMI &#8805;30 kg/m2. Among obese patients, 21 (28.4%) required admission in ICU and 25 died (33.8%). After controlling for sex, age, comorbidities and clinical data, obesity was not significantly associated with mortality, mortality in ICU and length of hospital stay. The effect of obesity on ICU admission remained significant after controlling for sex, age, interstitial lung disease, heart disease and serum C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Obese patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to ICU than non-obese patients. However, there were no significant differences in mortality between the two groups.","output":"The obesity paradox: Analysis from the SMAtteo COvid-19 REgistry (SMACORE) cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Impacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the transport sector and the corresponding policy measures are becoming widely investigated.

Methods and Results We obtained acute cardiovascular hospital episodes during the years 2019C2020 from region-wide data on public healthcare usage for the population of Catalonia (North-East Spain). We fitted time models to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and acute heart failure (HF) admissions during the first pandemic wave, the between-waves period, and the second wave compared with the corresponding pre-COVID-19 periods and to test for the interaction with sex, age, and area-based socioeconomic level. We evaluated the effect of COVID-19 period on in-hospital mortality. ACS (n = 8,636) and HF (n = 27,566) episodes were defined using primary diagnostic ICD-10 codes. ACS and HF admissions decreased during the first wave (IRR = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.58C0.76 and IRR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.55C0.68, respectively) and during the second wave (IRR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.72C0.88 and IRR = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.69C0.84, respectively);acute HF admissions also decreased in the period between waves (IRR: 0.81, 95%CI: 0.74C0.89). The impact was similar in all sex and socioeconomic subgroups and was higher in older patients with ACS. In-hospital mortality was higher than expected only during the first wave. Conclusion During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a marked decline in urgent cardiovascular hospital admissions that were attenuated during the second wave.

Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology that may enhance individuals personal efficacy, emotional response, and wellbeing. Objective: We aimed to conduct a single-cohort, controlled trial with a 2:1 (waiting-list C VR protocol) allocation for a self-administered at-home weekly VR-based protocol for reducing the psychological burden experienced during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. Methods: A national convenience sample of individuals having experienced at least two months of strict social distancing measures (including the stay-at-home order) experienced the following weekly protocol (COVID Feel Good, available online here: www.covidfeelgood.com) consisting of two integrated parts: the first part consists of a 10-minute 360 VR video entitled Secret Garden and the second part includes a series of social exercises, with a specific goal for each day of the week. Half of the sample experienced the VR video on the smartphone only, while the other half experienced the VR video using an immersive headset. Primary outcome measures were depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms (measured using the DASS-21, the PSS and the BHS scales). Secondary outcomes were the experienced social connectedness and the level of fear experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic (measured using the SCS and FCOR scales). Analytic methods included different separate linear mixed-effects models. Results: The study sample was 40 adults [18 females;mean age 30.3 12.00 (range: 21C65)]. Results indicated no significant changes (P=1.000) in study variables between the waiting period (i.e., data collected 7 days before the start of the treatment) and the baseline (i.e., data collected at the beginning of the intervention, T0). Participants exhibited improvement from baseline to postintervention for almost all primary variables (all Ps <0.05), except for the perceived hopelessness (P=0.1098). Results for the secondary outcomes indicated an increase in social connectedness from T0 to T1 (P=0.0327), but not a significant reduction in the perceived fear of Coronavirus (P=0.4121). Results indicated that treatment positive effects were stable at the 2-weels of follow-up for all study variables, except for depressive symptoms. None of the models were significant on the factor Immersion, suggesting that there is no significant effect of the modality (immersive vs non immersive) on the results of the treatment. Conclusions: This pragmatic pilot trial tried to understand if and how a weekly VR self-help protocol can help individuals in overcoming the psychological burden associated with spread of the COVID-19 and the consequent health emergency.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data on patients with COVID-19 hospitalized between February and April 2020 in an outbreak hospital in North-East Italy. Pre-existing diabetes was defined by self-reported history, electronic medical records, or ongoing medications. Newly-diagnosed diabetes was defined by HbA1c and fasting glucose. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU admission or death. RESULTS: 413 subjects were included, 107 of whom (25.6%) had diabetes, including 21 newly-diagnosed. Patients with diabetes were older and had greater comorbidity burden. The primary outcome occurred in 37.4% of patients with diabetes compared to 20.3% in those without (RR 1.85; 95%C.I. 1.33-2.57; p < 0.001). The association was stronger for newly-diagnosed compared to pre-existing diabetes (RR 3.06 vs 1.55; p = 0.004). Higher glucose level at admission was associated with COVID-19 severity, with a stronger association among patients without as compared to those with pre-existing diabetes (interaction p < 0.001). Admission glucose was correlated with most clinical severity indexes and its association with adverse outcome was mostly mediated by a worse respiratory function.

Surge events frequently challenge Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), where robust routine EC is required for resilient health systems. We aimed to describe the current status, determine priority actions and set minimum standards for EC systems development across the Pacific region. Methods We used a prospective, multiphase, expert consensus process to collect data from PICT EC stakeholders using focus groups, electronic surveys and panel review between August 2018 and April 2019. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, consensus agreement and graphic interpretation. We structured the research according to the World Health Organisation EC Systems and building block framework adapted for the Pacific context. Findings Over 200 participants from 17 PICTs engaged in at least one component of the multiphase process. Gaps in functional capacity exist in most PICTs for both facility-based and pre-hospital care. EC is a low priority across the Pacific and integrated poorly with disaster plans. Participants emphasised human resource support and government recognition of EC as priority actions, and generated 24 facility-based and 22 pre-hospital Pacific EC standards across all building blocks. Interpretation PICT stakeholders now have baseline indicators and a comprehensive roadmap for EC development within a globally recognised health systems framework. This study generates practical, context-appropriate tools to trigger further research, conduct evidence-based advocacy, drive future improvements and measure progress towards achieving universal health access for Pacific peoples.

In an orchard examined from 2017 to 2020, arthropods and diseases were studied by visual sampling under two irrigation treatments (T1, control and T2, regulated deficit irrigation (RDI)). Univariate analysis showed no influence of irrigation on the aphid Hyalopterus amygdali (Blanchard) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) population and damage, but Tetranychus urticae Koch (Trombidiformes: Tetranychidae) damage on leaves was significantly less (50C60% reduction in damaged leaf area) in the T2 RDI treatment compared to the full irrigation T1 control in 2019 and 2020. Typhlocybinae (principal species Asymmetrasca decedens (Paoli) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae)) population was also significantly lower under T2 RDI treatment. Chrysopidae and Phytoseiidae, important groups in the biological control of pests, were not affected by irrigation treatment. The most important diseases observed in the orchard were not, in general, affected by irrigation treatment. The multivariate principal response curves show significant differences between irrigation strategies in 2019 and 2020.

State-of-the-art algorithms for computing descriptors require the entire graph to be in memory, entailing a huge memory footprint, and thus do not scale well to increasing sizes of real-world networks. In this work, we propose streaming algorithms to efficiently approximate descriptors by estimating counts of sub-graphs of order [Formula: see text], and thereby devise extensions of two existing graph comparison paradigms: the Graphlet Kernel and NetSimile. Our algorithms require a single scan over the edge stream, have space complexity that is a fraction of the input size, and approximate embeddings via a simple sampling scheme.

This unique protease is not only responsible for processing the viral polyprotein into its functional units but is also capable of cleaving ubiquitin and ISG15 conjugates and plays a significant role in helping SARS-CoV evade the human immune system. We screened a structurally diverse library of 50,080 compounds for inhibitors of PLpro and discovered a noncovalent lead inhibitor with an IC(50) value of 20 microM, which was improved to 600 nM via synthetic optimization. The resulting compound, GRL0617, inhibited SARS-CoV viral replication in Vero E6 cells with an EC(50) of 15 microM and had no associated cytotoxicity. The X-ray structure of PLpro in complex with GRL0617 indicates that the compound has a unique mode of inhibition whereby it binds within the S4-S3 subsites of the enzyme and induces a loop closure that shuts down catalysis at the active site.

We asked 356 participants: (1) In your opinion, how likely is it that the spread of COVID-19 (the coronavirus) will cause a public health crisis in the United States? (2) How concerned are you that you will contract COVID-19 by attending events on campus? Participants' estimates of an impending national health crisis increased significantly during the study's second week (March 9-12) while concern about personally contracting COVID-19 from attending campus events increased only marginally during the study's final days. We find those expressing a higher likelihood of an impending national crisis were more concerned about contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events, suggesting a possible transmission from perceptions of national-level events to perceived personal vulnerability via local exposure. However, about 30% of participants perceived that COVID-19 would likely cause a public health crisis yet did not express concern about contracting COVID-19 from event attendance. These participants were significantly more likely to be younger students who agreed to participate in response to recruitment using same-day flyer distribution. Women expressed a higher likelihood of an emerging national health crisis, although they were not more concerned than men that attending campus events would result in virus contraction. Other groups (e.g., white, students younger than 25, highest income group) displayed similar concern about a national-level crisis, yet were significantly less concerned about contracting COVID-19 from attending campus events than others. Also, participants randomly assigned to information emphasizing the national impacts of food waste expressed significantly greater concern of contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events.

As such, RBD has become the major target for vaccine development, while RBD-specific antibodies are pursued as therapeutics. Here, we report the development and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific VHH/nanobody (Nb) from immunized alpacas. Seven RBD-specific Nbs with high stability were identified using phage display. They bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with affinity KD ranging from 2.6 to 113 nM, and six of them can block RBD-ACE2 interaction. The fusion of the Nbs with IgG1 Fc resulted in homodimers with greatly improved RBD-binding affinities (KD ranging from 72.7 pM to 4.5 nM) and nanomolar RBD-ACE2 blocking abilities. Furthermore, the fusion of two Nbs with non-overlapping epitopes resulted in hetero-bivalent Nbs, namely aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7, with significantly higher RBD binding affinities (KD of 59.2 pM and 0.25 nM) and greatly enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing potency. The 50% neutralization dose (ND50) of aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7 was 1.22 ng/mL (a??0.043 nM) and 3.18 ng/mL (a??0.111 nM), respectively. These high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 blocking Nbs could be further developed into therapeutics as well as diagnostic reagents for COVID-19.ImportanceTo date, SARS-CoV-2 has caused tremendous loss of human life and economic output worldwide. Although a few COVID-19 vaccines have been approved in several countries, the development of effective therapeutics, including SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies, remains critical.

METHODS: 153 blood spot samples from Bioko malaria patients were collected during 2016C2018 and the target TRAP gene was amplified. Together with the sequences from database, nucleotide diversity and natural selection analysis, and the structural prediction were preformed using bioinformatical tools. RESULTS: A total of 119 Bioko PfTRAP sequences were amplified successfully. On Bioko Island, PfTRAP shows its high degree of genetic diversity and heterogeneity, with  value for 0.01046 and Hd for 0.99. The value of dNCdS (6.2231, p < 0.05) hinted at natural selection of PfTRAP on Bioko Island. Globally, the African PfTRAPs showed more diverse than the Asian ones, and significant genetic differentiation was discovered by the fixation index between African and Asian countries (Fst > 0.15, p < 0.05). 667 Asian isolates clustered in 136 haplotypes and 739 African isolates clustered in 528 haplotypes by network analysis. The mutations I116T, L221I, Y128F, G228V and P299S were predicted as probably damaging by PolyPhen online service, while mutations L49V, R285G, R285S, P299S and K421N would lead to a significant increase of free energy difference (G > 1) indicated a destabilization of protein structure. CONCLUSIONS: Evidences in the present investigation supported that PfTRAP gene from Bioko Island and other malaria endemic countries is highly polymorphic (especially at T cell epitopes), which provided the genetic information background for developing an PfTRAP-based universal effective vaccine. Moreover, some mutations have been shown to be detrimental to the protein structure or function and deserve further study and continuous monitoring.

But little is known about the true frequency of DVT in patients who attend emergency department (ED) and are diagnosed with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics and outcomes of DVT in patients with COVID-19 attending the ED before hospitalization. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all COVID patients diagnosed with DVT in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, case group) during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. We compared DVT-COVID-19 patients with COVID-19 without DVT patients (control group). Relative frequencies of DVT were estimated in COVID and non-COVID patients visiting the ED and annual standardized incidences were estimated for both populations. Sixty-three patient characteristics and four outcomes were compared between cases and controls. RESULTS: We identified 112 DVT in 74 814 patients with COVID-19 attending the ED [1.50?; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.23-1.80?].

In COVID patients, the clinical characteristics associated with a higher risk of presenting DVT were older age and having a history of venous thromboembolism, recent surgery/immobilization and hypertension; chest pain and desaturation at ED arrival and some analytical disturbances were also more frequently seen, d-dimer >5000 ng/mL being the strongest. After adjustment for age and sex, hospitalization, ICU admission and prolonged hospitalization were more frequent in cases than controls, whereas mortality was similar (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.77-2.45).

The findings suggest that moving researchers into the same building increases their propensity to collaborate, with the effect plateauing five years after the move. The effects are large when compared to the average rate of collaboration among pairs of researchers, which suggests that spatial proximity is an important tool to support cross-disciplinary collaborative science.

Normally, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) protects the vascular endothelium from damage from oxidized phospholipids, which accumulate under conditions of oxidative stress. The current work evaluated the antioxidant function of HDL in IIM patients. METHODS: HDL's antioxidant function was measured in IIM patients using a cell-free assay, which assesses the ability of isolated patient HDL to inhibit oxidation of low-density lipoproteins and is reported as the HDL inflammatory index (HII). Cholesterol profiles were measured for all patients, and subgroup analysis included assessment of oxidized fatty acids in HDL and plasma MPO activity. A subgroup of IIM patients was compared with healthy controls. RESULTS: The antioxidant function of HDL was significantly worse in patients with IIM (n = 95) compared with healthy controls (n = 41) [mean (s.d.) HII 1.12 (0.61) vs 0.82 (0.13), P < 0.0001]. Higher HII associated with higher plasma MPO activity [mean (s.d.) 13.2 (9.1) vs 9.1 (4.6), P = 0.0006] and higher oxidized fatty acids in HDL. Higher 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in HDL correlated with worse diffusion capacity in patients with interstitial lung disease (r = -0.58, P = 0.02), and HDL's antioxidant function was most impaired in patients with autoantibodies against melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) or anti-synthetase antibodies. In multivariate analysis including 182 IIM patients, higher HII was associated with higher disease activity and DM diagnosis.

Vascular registries showed an immediate impact with significant declines in second quarter vascular procedure volumes witnessed across Europe and the United States. To better understand the magnitude and impact of the pandemic, organizations and study groups sent grass roots surveys to vascular specialists for needs assessment. Several vascular registries responded quickly by insertion of COVID-19 variables into their data collection forms. Over 80% of clinical trials have been reported delayed or not started due to factors that included loss of enrollment from patient concerns or mandated institutional shutdowns, weighing the risk of trial participation on patient safety.

With the objective to the effective disposal mode for express packaging, this paper introduces the consumers environmental awareness into the framework and establishes an evolutionary game model to explore the governing measures of the express packaging recycling industry. It is found that without considering consumers' environmental awareness, the government's reward and punishment mechanism alone cannot restrain the recycler's decision-making effectively, while the participation of the consumers with environmental awareness could drive the strategy of the recycler to converge to the ideal state effectively, which is recycling the express packaging actively. The sensitivity analysis shows that the participation of consumers with environmental awareness significantly weakens the recycling difficulty and reduces the recycling cost of the recycler, which is helpful to improve the willingness of the recycler to recycle the express packaging continually. Thereby, the express packaging recycling industry can be improved better when the consumer's awareness of environmental protection is enhanced.","output":"Dump or recycle?

The S glycoprotein is the major target for neutralizing antibodies elicited by natural infection and by vaccines. Approximately 35% of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein consists of carbohydrate, which can influence virus infectivity and susceptibility to antibody inhibition. We found that virus-like particles produced by coexpression of SARS-CoV-2 S, M, E and N proteins contained spike glycoproteins that were extensively modified by complex carbohydrates. We used a fucose-selective lectin to enrich the Golgi-resident fraction of a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein trimer, and determined its glycosylation and disulfide bond profile. Compared with soluble or solubilized S glycoproteins modified to prevent proteolytic cleavage and to retain a prefusion conformation, more of the wild-type S glycoprotein N-linked glycans are processed to complex forms. Even Asn 234, a significant percentage of which is decorated by high-mannose glycans on soluble and virion S trimers, is predominantly modified in the Golgi by processed glycans. Three incompletely occupied sites of O-linked glycosylation were detected. Viruses pseudotyped with natural variants of the serine/threonine residues implicated in O-linked glycosylation were generally infectious and exhibited sensitivity to neutralization by soluble ACE2 and convalescent antisera comparable to that of the wild-type virus. Unlike other natural cysteine variants, a Cys15Phe (C15F) mutant retained partial, but unstable, infectivity. These findings enhance our understanding of the Golgi processing of the native SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein carbohydrates and could assist the design of interventions.","output":"Analysis of glycosylation and disulfide bonding of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La eficacia antiinflamatoria de meloxicam tablet* fue evaluada por medio de la synovitis reversible inducida experimentalmente por el modelo de inyeccin intrasinovial (articulacin femorotibiopatelar) de cristal de urato de sdio em 16 Beagles.

A physician survey was performed to address this deficit and determine interest in clinical trials of alternative strategies for BMA administration. METHODS: Canadian oncologists treating patients with EBC were surveyed via an anonymized online survey. The survey collected information on: physician demographics, knowledge and interpretation of adjuvant bisphosphonate guidelines, and real world prescribing practices. Questions also determined thoughts around the design of future adjuvant BMA trials. RESULTS: Of 127 surveyed physicians, 53 eligible invitees responded (response rate 42%). The majority of physicians are offering high-risk postmenopausal patients adjuvant BMAs. The most common BMA regimen was adjuvant zoledronate (45/53, 85%) every 6 months for 3 years. Concerns around toxicities and repeated visits to the cancer centre were perceived as the greatest barriers to adjuvant bisphosphonate use. Respondents were interested in future trials of de-escalation of BMAs comparing a single infusion of zoledronate vs. 6-monthly zoledronate for 3 years. The most favoured primary endpoints for such a trial included disease recurrence and fragility fracture rates. CONCLUSION: Questions around optimal use of adjuvant bisphosphonates in patients with EBC still exist. There is interest among physicians in performing trials of de-escalation of these agents.

Epigenomic dynamics during human heart organogenesis thus may play a critical role in regulating heart development. However, it is unclear how histone mark H3K36me3 acts on heart development. Here we report that histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SETD2, an H3K36me3 methyltransferase, is a crucial regulator of the mouse heart epigenome. Setd2 is highly expressed in embryonic stages and accounts for a predominate role of H3K36me3 in the heart. Loss of Setd2 in cardiac progenitors results in obvious coronary vascular defects and ventricular non-compaction, leading to fetus lethality in mid-gestation, without affecting peripheral blood vessel, yolk sac, and placenta formation. Furthermore, deletion of Setd2 dramatically decreased H3K36me3 level and impacted the transcriptional landscape of key cardiac-related genes, including Rspo3 and Flrt2.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 329 patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 diagnosed based on their COVID-19 RT-PCR results and chest CT scans, were enrolled in the study. These patients were admitted to Kamkar Arab Nia Hospital, Qom, Iran from March to June 2020. Their blood groups and RH were determined, and demographic characteristics and clinical signs of patients were recorded. The patients temperature and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) were measured. Finally, the duration of hospitalization, intubation, and death rate were also analyzed. RESULTS: The results of the patients blood group analysis were as follows: 129(39.2%) patients had A type, 66(20.1%) B type, 21(6.4%) AB type, and 113(34.3%) O type. Of 329 patients, 297 (90.3%) had Rh antigen. The dead cases were higher in O blood type at 13 cases (11.5%). Considering the positive and negative rhesus antigen, 31 (10.4%) and 1 (3.1%) were dead respectively, but the difference was not statically significant. As for the A group, the mean of admission duration (8.46.1 days) was not significantly different from the B group (8.8 7.2 days).

The prevalence of anosmia (p = 0.001) and ageusia (p = 0.008) significantly decreased with the increasing age. In addition, 19.8% and 14.0% patients had anxiety and/or depression in the first survey, and one week after the first survey, respectively. Compared to patients without anxiety and/or depression, those with anxiety and/or depression had a longer quarantine duration.

This peculiar structure encompassed with its role in viral replication has promoted 3C protease as an interesting target for therapeutic agents in the treatment of diseases caused by human rhinovirus (HRV). Herein we present a comprehensive molecular dynamics study of the comparison of two potent inhibitors, sg85 and rupintrivir complexed with HRV-3C protease. The binding free energy studies revealed a higher binding affinity for sg85 ?58.853 kcal/mol than for rupintrivir ?54.0873 kcal/mol and this was found to be in correlation with the experimental data. The energy decomposition analysis showed that, residues Leu 127, Thr 142, Ser 144, Gly 145, Tyr 146, Cys 147, His 161, Val 162, Gly 163, Gly 164, Asn 165, Phe 170 largely contributed to the binding of sg85, whereas His 40, Leu 127 and Gly 163 impacted the binding of rupintrivir. It further showed that His 40, Glu 71, Leu 127, Cys 147 Gly 163 and Gyl 164 are crucial residues that play a key role in ligand-enzyme binding; amongst these residues are residues of the conserved active site (His 40, Glu 71 and Cys 147). These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics and structural features and will serve as guidance in the design and development of potent novel inhibitors of HRV.

Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, insulin dose at home and at the hospital, other anti-hyperglycemic agents use, and outcomes were obtained. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the factors associated with diabetes control and mortality. Results: Patients who used insulin at home had higher mortality compared to those who did not (35% vs 18% p = .015), this was true even after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities and a1c OR 2.65 95% CI (1.23-5.71) p = .013.

These infections are increasingly caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, which colonize the patient's oropharynx and enter the lower respiratory tract around the endotracheal tube cuff or through the lumen. Progression of colonization to VAT and, in some patients, to VAP is related to the quantity, types, and virulence of invading bacteria versus containment by host defenses. Diagnostic criteria for VAT and VAP overlap in terms of clinical signs and symptoms, and they share similar microbiologic criteria when endotracheal sputum aspirate samples are used. In addition, the diagnosis of VAP requires a new and persistent infiltrate on a chest radiograph, which may be difficult to assess in critically ill patients, and a significant bacterial culture of a endtotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage specimen. Current guidelines for the management of VAP strongly recommend the use of early, appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy based on patient risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens. An alternative model focused on VAT, using serial surveillance of endotracheal aspirate specimens to identify multidrug-resistant pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities, would allow earlier, targeted antibiotic treatment that could improve outcomes in patients, prevent VAP, and provide an attractive model for clinical research trials.","output":"Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis and pneumonia: thinking outside the box."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Correct species identification is essential before initiation of TB treatment, due to substantial drug susceptibility profile differences among mycobacterial species. Given that nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are frequently resistant to first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, cases with mixed infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and NTM tend to be diagnosed as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases. Here we report results of a retrospective multicentre study that was conducted to determine the prevalence of TB-NTM infections in previously diagnosed laboratory-confirmed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients using phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. The results were then used to identify risk factors associated with susceptibility to mixed infections. Methods: From January 2019 through December 2019, we retrospectively collected MDR-TB isolates from three TB specialised hospitals. Species identifications of isolates were performed using the MeltPro Myco assay. Results: A total of 837 MDR-TB isolates were analysed, of which 22 isolates (2.6%) were found to contain a mixture of NTM and MTB organisms. Significant differences in prevalence rates of mixed infections across regions were observed, with prevalence rates ranging from 0.0% (0/213) in Beijing to 3.4% (12/353) in Fuzhou to 3.7% (10/271) in Guangzhou. Among the 22 patients with NTM-TB mixed infections, a total of five different mycobacterial species were identified, of which the most prevalent species was Mycobacterium intracellulare. Notably, a history of previous TB episodes correlated with higher mixed infection risk. Conclusion: The results reported here demonstrated that mixed infections with MTB and NTM occurred in approximately 3% of suspected MDR-TB patients in China. These findings raise concerns about the accuracy of molecular diagnostics-based species identification tests and draw attention to the possibility that NTM-MTB mixed infections will be misdiagnosed as MDR-TB in high TB burden settings.","output":"Effect of Mixed Infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Nontuberculous Mycobacteria on Diagnosis of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis: A Retrospective Multicentre Study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A few months ago, the availability of a reliable and cost-effective testing capacity for COVID-19 was a concern for many countries. With the emergence and circulation of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, another layer of challenge can be added for COVID-19 testing at both molecular and serological levels. This is particularly important for the available tests principally designed to target the S gene/protein where multiple mutations have been reported. Herein, the SARS-CoV-2 NP recombinant protein was utilized to develop a simple and reliable COVID-19 NP human IgG ELISA. The optimized protocol was validated against a micro-neutralization (MN) assay, in-house S-based ELISA, and commercial chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). The developed assay provides 100% sensitivity, 98.9% specificity, 98.9% agreement, and high overall accuracy with an area under curve equal to 0.9998  0.0002 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.99 to 1.00. The optical density values of positive samples significantly correlated with their corresponding MN titers. The assay specifically detects IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 NP protein and does not cross-detect IgG to the viral S protein. Moreover, it does not cross-react with antibodies related to other coronaviruses (e.g., the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus or human coronavirus HKU1).

The paper argues that biodiversity is not a free good and must be paid for. Ways forward in debates on commercial research and development in Antarctica can be found through increasing attention to the valuation of ecosystem services, new approaches to natural capital accounting and payment for ecosystem services that would bring the Antarctic, and the Antarctic Treaty System, into the wider fold of work on the economics of biodiversity. Economics based approaches can be criticised for reducing biodiversity to monetary exchange values at the expense of recognition of the wider values of biodiversity and its services.

Here we deploy large-scale numerical simulations to quantify the impact on pathogen transmission of a set of topological features covering the parameter space of realistic possibility. We first test through a series of stochastic simulations the differences in the spread of disease on several classes of network geometry (including highly skewed networks and small world).

For this, we build a dataset composed of more than 9000 social networks and 30 topological network metrics.

While the disease primarily presents as a respiratory illness, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have been reported in up to one-third of confirmed cases, and patients may have mild symptoms that do not prompt them to seek medical attention. Internet-based infodemiology offers an approach to studying symptoms at a population level, even in individuals who do not seek medical care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if a correlation exists between internet searches for gastrointestinal symptoms and the confirmed case count of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: The search terms chosen for analysis in this study included common gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Furthermore, the search terms fever and cough were used as positive controls, and constipation was used as a negative control. Daily query shares for the selected symptoms were obtained from Google Trends between October 1, 2019 and June 15, 2020 for all US states. These shares were divided into two time periods: pre-COVID-19 (prior to March 1) and post-COVID-19 (March 1-June 15). Confirmed COVID-19 case numbers were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data repository. Moving averages of the daily query shares (normalized to baseline pre-COVID-19) were then analyzed against the confirmed disease case count and daily new cases to establish a temporal relationship. RESULTS: The relative search query shares of many symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and constipation, remained near or below baseline throughout the time period studied; however, there were notable increases in searches for the positive control symptoms of fever and cough as well as for diarrhea. These increases in daily search queries for fever, cough, and diarrhea preceded the rapid rise in number of cases by approximately 10 to 14 days. The search volumes for these terms began declining after mid-March despite the continued rises in cumulative cases and daily new case counts. CONCLUSIONS: Google searches for symptoms may precede the actual rises in cases and hospitalizations during pandemics. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, this study demonstrates that internet search queries for fever, cough, and diarrhea increased prior to the increased confirmed case count by available testing during the early weeks of the pandemic in the United States. While the search volumes eventually decreased significantly as the number of cases continued to rise, internet query search data may still be a useful tool at a population level to identify areas of active disease transmission at the cusp of new outbreaks.","output":"Association of Search Query Interest in Gastrointestinal Symptoms With COVID-19 Diagnosis in the United States: Infodemiology Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 is highly infectious and generally susceptible to all human beings Pediatric patients, as a special group which is prone to various respiratory infectious diseases, need more people to nurse and care and may cause a higher risk of cross-infection Therefore, greater attention should be paid to this group During the prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019, it is an urgency to ensure the safety of children and medical staff, avoid cross-infection, reduce anesthesia-related complications, and accelerate the rehabilitation of pediatric patients The article introduces the following aspects based on the problem mentioned above: (1) perioperative treatment of surgery, involving preoperative consultation and assessment, necessity of surgery, arrangement of operating room, precautions during surgery, protection of children and medical staff, and the transportation route planning;(2) anesthesia process, including pick-up of the pediatric patient, preoperative sedation, choice of anesthesia method, anesthesia induction, identification and management of difficult airways, intraoperative management, as well as problems related to the extubation;(3) the disinfection of the ground, air and medical equipment after surgery, and registration and follow-up of the children;(4) protection and preparation of emergency tracheal intubation, selection and performance of intubation, precautions in intubation and judgement after intubation outside the operating room;(5) protection and preparation of central vein catheterization, selection of the catheter, anesthesia management of the central vein catheterization and relevant precautions;(6) protection of medical staff, sedation program and sedation procedure during the comfort treatment in outpatient sedation center;(7) problems of family signature of the in-hospital treatment for pediatric patients during special epidemic period ? 2020 Chinese Medical Association","output":"Pediatric anesthesia-related specification during coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traumatic events, such as natural disasters, often lead to significant resource loss for survivors, which can negatively affect emotional well-being.

Cuts to essential services, coupled with a growing homeless population, create a challenging environment to tackle this public health crisis. In this paper, we highlight an underexplored environmental constraint faced by people living and injecting drugs on the streets. Access to water for injection is restricted in the UK, due to legislative and financial barriers. Austerity measures, such as public toilet closures, further restrict the ability of people made homeless to access clean water and protect themselves from health harms. METHODS: We generated questionnaire (n = 455) and in-depth qualitative interview (n = 32) data with people who inject drugs in London for the Care and Prevent study. Participants provided detail on their life history; drug use, injecting and living environments; health conditions and care seeking practices. FINDINGS: A high proportion of the survey sample reported lifetime history of street homelessness (78%), bacterial infections (65%) and related hospitalisation (30%). Qualitative accounts highlight unsafe, potentially dangerous, injection practices in semi-public spaces. Multiple constraints to sourcing sterile water for injection preparation were reported. Alternatives to sterile water included puddle water, toilet cistern water, whisky, cola soda and saliva. Participants who injected heroin and crack cocaine together unanimously reported adding water at two stages during injection preparation: first, adding water as a vehicle for heroin (which was then heated); second, adding cold water to the heroin mixture prior to adding the crack cocaine. This new finding of a stage addition of solvent may represent an additional risk of infection. CONCLUSION: Currently, harm reduction equipment and resources for safe injecting are not meeting the needs of people who inject drugs who are street homeless or unstably housed. Preparation of injections with non-sterile water sources could precipitate bacterial and fungal infections, particularly when used without the application of heat. It is crucial that water for injection, also skin cleaning, is made available for the unstably housed and that harm reduction messaging is tailored to speak to the everyday realities of people who prepare and inject drugs in public spaces.","output":"Navigating environmental constraints to injection preparation: the use of saliva and other alternatives to sterile water among unstably housed PWID in London"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solid-organ transplant patients have a high risk of severe infection related to acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2).

Skill training is an essential part of medical education and cannot be fully digitalized nor should it be omitted. The pandemic demonstrates that skills like ultrasound are essential when treating critical ill patients. Medical faculties use peer assisted learning (PAL) concepts to teach skills, like ultrasound through specially trained student tutors. Aim: Here, we would like to share our experiences and elaborate how ultrasound teaching can be safely performed during the pandemic with an emphasis on adjustment of an existing PAL teaching concept. Method: At the hospital of Saarland University, we implemented a PAL teaching concept for abdominal, including emergency, ultrasound, and echocardiography, called \\"sonoBYstudents\\" to teach sonography to undergraduate medical students. Students are generally taught in small groups of 5 people in 90min sessions over a time of 8 weeks with an objective structured clinical exam (OSCE) at the end of the course program. Each semester nearly 50 students are taught in abdominal and emergency ultrasound and 30 students in echocardiography. Over five years, more than 600 students have been taught with at least 30 students being trained as student tutors. Given the pandemic, course size, course interval and total course time and total course time were adapted to the hygienic precautions. Results: 45 and 30 students were taught in abdominal ultrasound and echocardiography respectively achieving their learning goals measured via OSCE at the end of the courses. OSCE results were the same when compared to previous semesters. Conclusion: PAL as a teaching concept lives out of sustained educational strategies like practical and didactical trainings and an ongoing recruitment of new student tutors. Suspending PAL and its skill teaching would require starting from the beginning which is a time and cost consuming process. With sonoBYstudents we were able to demonstrate that an existing PAL concept can, with some effort, be adjusted to changing teaching circumstances. Apart from this ultrasound is a non-omittable part of medical skill training with easily appliable hygienic precautions during teaching sessions.","output":"TEACHING MUST GO ON: flexibility and advantages of peer assisted learning during the COVID-19 pandemic for undergraduate medical ultrasound education - perspective from the \\"sonoBYstudents\\" ultrasound group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 is associated with a high mortality rate, though outcomes of the different lung compliance phenotypes are unclear. We aimed to measure lung compliance and examine other factors associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. METHODS Adult patients with COVID-19 ARDS who required invasive mechanical ventilation at 8 hospitals in Singapore were prospectively enrolled. Factors associated with both mortality and differences between high (<40mL/cm H2O) and low (<40mL/cm H2O) compliance were analysed. RESULTS A total of 102 patients with COVID-19 who required invasive mechanical ventilation were analysed; 15 (14.7%) did not survive. Non-survivors were older (median 70 years, interquartile range [IQR] 67-75 versus median 61 years, IQR 52-66; P<0.01), and required a longer duration of ventilation (26 days, IQR 12-27 vs 8 days, IQR 5-15; P<0.01) and intensive care unit support (26 days, IQR 11-30 vs 11.5 days, IQR 7-17.3; P=0.01), with a higher incidence of acute kidney injury (15 patients [100%] vs 40 patients [46%]; P<0.01). There were 67 patients who had lung compliance data; 24 (35.8%) were classified as having high compliance and 43 (64.2%) as having low compliance. Mortality was higher in patients with high compliance (33.3% vs 11.6%; P=0.03), and was associated with a drop in compliance at day 7 (-9.3mL/cm H2O (IQR -4.5 to -15.4) vs 0.2mL/cm H2O (4.7 to -5.2) P=0.04).

The expression and distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) in various human organs might also show other possible infection routes. High ACE2 ribonucleic acid expression has been identified in the gastrointestinal tract (GI) indicating its importance as a possible infection pathway of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 induces viral entry into the host and most importantly has been found to be associated with the function of the gut. Its deficiency has been implicated in several pathologies such as colorectal inflammation.

The human respiratory system is a complex interplay of many different variables. Therefore, this mini review has prioritised previous and ongoing research to find explanations based on three scientific areas: gravity, lung structure and fractal geometry and vascular regulation. It concludes that gravity is one of the variables responsible for ventilation/perfusion matching but in concert with lung structure and fractal geometry, ventilation and regulation of lung vascular tone. Since ventilation distribution does not change between supine and prone positions, the higher expression of nitric oxide in dorsal lung vessels than in ventral vessels is likely to be the most important mechanism behind enhanced oxygenation in the prone position.","output":"Using the prone position could help to combat the development of fast hypoxia in some patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic represents and will represent the greatest health, economic and social crisis of the new millennium.

On completion of the programme and informal assessment of 11 surgical competencies, participants completed a follow up questionnaire to assess their improvement. RESULTS: 70% reported improvement in 10 competencies and 30% across all 11 competencies. The greatest improvements were in abscess drainage and knot tying. 30% relayed increased interest in pursuing a surgical career. 80% were more likely to attend theatres in future. CONCLUSIONS: The teaching series facilitated increase in self-perceived confidence of students in basic surgical skills, whilst inspiring surgical interests. During challenging times, we must support learners to undertake activity that drives improvement in training for the wider benefit of health services. Innovative teaching programmes may reduce the impact of similar adversity in the future.","output":"21 Suture School: A Socially Distanced Surgical Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The problems existing in the online education courses of engineering majors in colleges and universities are studied, and the online education platform under the background of engineering certification is designed and researched.

Ongoing surveillance and characterization of Australian IBVs have shown that they have evolved separately from strains found throughout the rest of the world, resulting in the evolution of a range of unique strains and changes in the dominant wild-type strains, affecting tissue tropism, pathogenicity, antigenicity, and gene arrangement. Between 1961 and 1976 highly nephropathogenic genotype GI-5 and GI-6 strains, causing mortalities of 40% to 100%, predominated, while strains causing mainly respiratory disease, with lower mortality rates, have predominated since then. Since 1988, viruses belonging to two distinct and novel genotypes, GIII and GV, have been detected. The genome organization of the GIII strains has not been seen in any other gammacoronavirus. Mutations that emerged soon after the introduction of vaccination, incursion of strains with a novel lineage from unknown sources, recombination between IBVs from different genetic lineages, and gene translocations and deletions have contributed to an increasingly complex IBV population. These processes and the consequences of this variation for the biology of these viruses provide an insight into the evolution of endemic coronaviruses during their control by vaccination and may provide a better understanding of the potential for evolution of other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the continuing capacity of attenuated IBV vaccines developed over 40 years ago to provide protection against viruses in the same genetic lineage provides some assurance that coronavirus vaccines developed to control other coronaviruses may continue to be effective for an extended period.","output":"Infectious bronchitis virus in Australia: a model of coronavirus evolution - a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technostress, a stressor, has implications for employees psychological states; however, flexibility like work from home can have positive outcomes, especially for instructors who have to teach and ensure social distance during COVID-19.

This study aimed to assess the exposure health risks of COVID-19 among frontline healthcare workers in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. METHOD: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted on public health workers from May to August 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire via email and telegram services. Both descriptive statistics and bivariate followed by multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify distribution patterns and factors associated with exposure risks to COVID-19. Odds ratio with 95% Confidence Interval (CI), and a P-value of <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. RESULT: A total of 418 health care workers participated in the study with a response rate of 99.1%. The majority of the study participants 310(74.2%), were males, and 163(39%) were nurses/ midwives respectively. More than half of the respondents 237(56.7%), had reported that they didn\`t have face-to-face contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. Among the respondents, 173(41.4%), 147(35.2%), 63(15.1%), and 65(15.6%) of the health professionals had always used gloves, medical masks, face shield, or goggles/protective glasses, and disposable gown, respectively.

Methods: 3 patients with patellar tendinopathy aged 37-45 years with diagnostic of patellar tendinopathy with pain since 5-8 weeks were treated with a novel, less invasive electrolysis technique. Pain severity was measured by Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). Lower limb functionality was measured by a Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment questionnaire (VISA-P). A clinical interview and ultrasonography assesment were performed before study protocol were carried out. Each participants received 4 to 7 sessions of percutaneous electrolysis (350 A, 80 s) leaving at least one week between sessions during a total of 8 weeks. During this time, subjects also were undergone a therapeutic exercise protocol of lower limbs resistance training. Results: Pain severity decreased after 3 weeks treatment (p = 0.01) and was practically abolished after 4-7 sessions at 8 weeks (p = 0.2). The lower limb functionality (VISA-P) increased after 3 weeks treatment and the major difference was found at 8 weeks post-intervention (p = 0.001). Thickness of the patellar tendon decreased after 8 weeks treatment (p = 0.01).

We employ a dynamic-based approach to calibrate the accumulated clinically diagnosed data with a sudden jump on February 12 and 13. The model simulation shows reasonably good match with the adjusted data which allows the prediction of the cumulative confirmed cases. Numerical results reveal that the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism played a significant role on the containment of COVID-19. The spread of COVID-19 cannot be inhibited if any of the measures was not effectively implemented. Our analysis also illustrates that the Fangcang Shelter Hospitals are very helpful when the beds in the designated hospitals are insufficient.

Palliative care may lower costs for hospitalized adults, but the evidence has important limitations. Objective To estimate the association of palliative care consultation (PCC) with direct hospital costs for adults with serious illness. Data Sources Systematic searches of the Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, PubMed, CINAHL, and EconLit databases were performed for English-language journal articles using keywords in the domains of palliative care (eg, palliative, terminal) and economics (eg, cost, utilization), with limiters for hospital and consultation. For Embase, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL, we searched without a time limitation. For PubMed, CINAHL, and EconLit, we searched for articles published after August 1, 2013. Data analysis was performed from April 8, 2017, to September 16, 2017. Study Selection Economic evaluations of interdisciplinary PCC for hospitalized adults with at least 1 of 7 illnesses (cancer; heart, liver, or kidney failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; AIDS/HIV; or selected neurodegenerative conditions) in the hospital inpatient setting vs usual care only, controlling for a minimum list of confounders. Data Extraction and Synthesis Eight eligible studies were identified, all cohort studies, of which 6 provided sufficient information for inclusion. The study estimated the association of PCC within 3 days of admission with direct hospital costs for each sample and for subsamples defined by primary diagnoses and number of comorbidities at admission, controlling for confounding with an instrumental variable when available and otherwise propensity score weighting. Treatment effect estimates were pooled in the meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures Total direct hospital costs. Results This study included 6 samples with a total 133 118 patients (range, 1020-82 273), of whom 93.2% were discharged alive (range, 89.0%-98.4%), 40.8% had a primary diagnosis of cancer (range, 15.7%-100.0%), and 3.6% received a PCC (range, 2.2%-22.3%). Mean Elixhauser index scores ranged from 2.2 to 3.5 among the studies. When patients were pooled irrespective of diagnosis, there was a statistically significant reduction in costs (-$3237; 95% CI, -$3581 to -$2893; P < .001). In the stratified analyses, there was a reduction in costs for the cancer (-$4251; 95% CI, -$4664 to -$3837; P < .001) and noncancer (-$2105; 95% CI, -$2698 to -$1511; P < .001) subsamples. The reduction in cost was greater in those with 4 or more comorbidities than for those with 2 or fewer. Conclusions and Relevance The estimated association of early hospital PCC with hospital costs may vary according to baseline clinical factors. Estimates may be larger for primary diagnosis of cancer and more comorbidities compared with primary diagnosis of noncancer and fewer comorbidities. Increasing palliative care capacity to meet national guidelines may reduce costs for hospitalized adults with serious and complex illnesses.","output":"Economics of Palliative Care for Hospitalized Adults With Serious Illness: A Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reactive molecular oxygen (O2) plays important roles in bioenergetics and metabolism and is implicated in biochemical pathways underlying angiogenesis, fertilization, wound healing and regeneration.

Twenty-four conventional 5-day-old suckling piglets were randomly divided into four groups and were inoculated orally, intranasally (I.N.), intramuscularly (I.M.) with PEDV or DMEM (mock). Pigs were monitored daily for clinical signs and fecal viral load. Blood samples were collected at 7, 14, 21 days post infection (dpi) and subjected for the analyses of serum antibody production, T cell and natural killer (NK) cell frequencies, NK cytotoxicity and serum cytokine levels. Oral inoculation led to higher levels of PEDV-specific IgA antibodies in both serum and gut mucosal sites than did other routes of inoculation. Intranasal inoculation elicited significantly higher titers of virus-specific IgG antibodies in serum. PEDV-infected pigs regardless of inoculation routes had significantly lower NK cell frequencies than those of the control pigs at 14 dpi. The orally inoculated pigs had significantly higher CD3+CD8+ T cell frequencies as compared to I.N. or I.M. inoculated pigs at 14 dpi, while there was no significant difference among orally, I.N. or I.M. inoculated pigs and control pigs in CD3+CD4+ T cell frequencies in peripheral blood. PEDV-infected and control pigs had low, but detectable NK cell activities at 14 and 21 dpi, however, NK cell activities were barely detectable at 7 dpi whether the pigs were infected or not. Serum IL-10 levels were induced drastically in orally infected pigs at 7 dpi and then gradually declined. Serum IL-12 levels followed a similar pattern while the fold-change was much lower. In conclusion, oral inoculation may generate more comprehensive immune responses.","output":"Effect of route of inoculation on innate and adaptive immune responses to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection in suckling pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A systematic sample of 2800 articles published between 1970 and 2000 in 14 major biomedical journals was analysed to assess the implementation of the 'Three Rs' (replacement, reduction and refinement) in biomedical research.

Yet, we know little about how the delivery system, and primary care in particular, has responded and how this has impacted vulnerable patients. We aimed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on primary care practice sites and their vulnerable patients and to identify explanations for variation. Approach: We developed and administered a survey to practice managers and physician leaders from 173 primary care practice sites, October-November 2020. We report and graphically depict results from univariate analysis and examine potential explanations for variation in practices' process innovations in response to COVID-19 by assessing bivariate relationships between seven dependent variables and four independent variables. Findings: Among 96 (55.5%) respondents, primary care practice sites on average took more safety (8.5 of 12) than financial (2.5 of 17) precautions in response to COVID-19. Practice sites varied in their efforts to protect patients with vulnerabilities, providing care initially postponed, and experience with virtual visits. Financial risk, practice size, practitioner age, and emergency preparedness explained variation in primary care practices' process innovations. Many practice sites plan to sustain virtual visits, dependent mostly on patient and provider preference and continued reimbursement. Value: While findings indicate rapid and substantial innovation, conditions must enable primary care practice sites to build on and sustain innovations, to support care for vulnerable populations, including those with multiple chronic conditions and socio-economic barriers to health, and to prepare primary care for future emergencies.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Primary Care Practice Sites and Their Vulnerable Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Critical care is perhaps one of the most climate-intensive divisions of health care As greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the unprecedented threat of climate change has belatedly prompted an increased awareness of critical care's environmental impact Within our role as pediatric critical care providers, we have a dual responsibility not only to care for children at their most vulnerable, but also to advocate on their behalf There are clear, demonstrable effects of our worsening climate on the health of children, with the resultant increased burden of pediatric critical illness and disruption to health care systems From increasing wildfires and their effect on lung health, to the spread of vector-borne diseases such as dengue, and the increased migration of children due to a changing climate, the effects of a changing climate are here, and we are beginning to see the changing epidemiology of pediatric critical illness Ensuring that the effects of ongoing changes are minimized, including its future effects on child health, requires a multifaceted approach As part of this review, we will use the Lancet Countdown on Climate Change indicators to explore the impact of pediatric critical care on climate change and the inevitable influence climate change will have on the future practice of pediatric critical care globally","output":"Pediatric Critical Care and the Climate Emergency: Our Responsibilities and a Call for Change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global threat to human health. Internet hospitals have emerged as a critical technology to bring epidemic-related web-based services and medical support to the public. However, only a few very recent scientific literature reports have explored the effects of internet hospitals on psychological burden and disease knowledge in major public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the role of internet hospitals in relieving psychological burden and increasing disease knowledge during the early outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This survey was conducted from January 26 to February 1, 2020, during the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The platform used for the consultation was the WeChat public account of our hospital. To participate in the study, the patient was required to answer a list of questions to exclude the possibility of COVID-19 infection and confirm their willingness to participate voluntarily. Next, the participant was directed to complete the self-report questionnaire. After the internet consultation, the participant was directed to complete the self-report questionnaire again. The questionnaire included sections on general information, the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), and the participant's worries, disease knowledge, and need for hospital treatment. RESULTS: The total number of internet consultations was 4120. The consultation topics mainly included respiratory symptoms such as cough, expectoration, and fever (2489/4120, 60.4%) and disease knowledge, anxiety, and fear (1023/4120, 24.8%). A total of 1530 people filled out the questionnaires before and after the internet consultation.

There was no significant difference in the number of people who expressed concern about the COVID-19 pandemic before and after the internet consultation (&#967;21=0.7, P=.43). However, the degree of concern after the internet consultation was significantly alleviated (t2699=90.638, P<.001). The main worries before and after consultation were the dangers posed by the disease and the risk of infection of family members. The scores of the self-assessment risk after the internet consultation were significantly lower than those before consultation (t3058=95.694, P<.001). After the consultation, the participants' knowledge of the symptoms, transmission routes, and preventive measures of COVID-19 was significantly higher than before the consultation (t3058=-106.105, -80.456, and -152.605, respectively; all P<.001). The hospital treatment need score after the internet consultation decreased from 3.3 (SD 1.2) to 1.6 (SD 0.8), and the difference was statistically significant (t3058=45.765, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: During the early outbreak of COVID-19, internet hospitals could help relieve psychological burdens and increase disease awareness through timely and rapid spread of knowledge regarding COVID-19 prevention and control. Internet hospitals should be an important aspect of a new medical model in public health emergency systems.","output":"Effects of Internet Hospital Consultations on Psychological Burdens and Disease Knowledge During the Early Outbreak of COVID-19 in China: Cross-Sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a cytokine, gamma-interferon (IFN-) is considered a key player in the fine-tuned orchestration of immune responses. The extreme cellular sensitivity to cytokines is attested by the fact that very few of these bioactive molecules per cell are enough to trigger cellular functions. These findings can, at least partially, explain how/why homeopathically-prepared cytokines, and especially micro-immunotherapy (MI) medicines, are able to drive cellular responses. We focused our fundamental research on a unitary MI preparation of IFN-, specifically employed at 4 CH, manufactured and impregnated onto sucrose-lactose pillules as all other MI medicines. We assessed the IFN- concentration in the medium after dilution of the IFN- (4 CH)-bearing pillules and we evaluated in vitro drug responses in a wide range of immune cells, and in endothelial cells. Our results showed that IFN- (4 CH) stimulated the proliferation, the activation and the phagocytic capabilities of primary immune cells, as well as modulated their cytokine-secretion and immunity-related markers expression in a trend that is quite comparable with the well-recognized biological effects induced by IFN-. Altogether, these data provide novel and additional evidences on MI medicines, and specifically when active substances are prepared at 4 CH, thus suggesting the need for more investigations.","output":"The Unitary Micro-Immunotherapy Medicine Interferon- (4 CH) Displays Similar Immunostimulatory and Immunomodulatory Effects than Those of Biologically Active Human Interferon- on Various Cell Types"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is the professional journey of Dyana Vukovich, a trained bilingual school psychologist who remained a practitioner her entire career, but was also able to conduct research, lead a staff of school psychologists, and teach in a university setting.

A backcalculation method was employed to estimate the incidence of infection. The peak time of infection was seen for the time period from 2 to 4 February 2020, and the incidence has abruptly declined afterwards. The estimated number of new infections among passengers without close contact was very small from 5 February on which a movement restriction policy was imposed. Without the intervention from 5 February, it was predicted that the cumulative incidence with and without close contact would have been as large as 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176) and 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) cases, respectively, while these were kept to be 102 and 47 cases, respectively.

We demonstrated that intranasal delivery of VSV-VP1 can induce a potent antigen-specific mucosal immune response as well as a systemic immune response, particularly the induction of polyfunctional T cells. Importantly, mice immunized with VSV-VP1 were better protected against CVB3-induced viral myocarditis than those receiving a chitosan-formulated DNA vaccine. Increased dendritic cell (DC) maturation in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) was observed in the mice vaccinated with VSV-VP1, which could be a potential mechanism for the protective immune response. These findings support VSV as a viral delivery vector that can induce robust mucosal immunity that should be considered for further vaccine development.","output":"A vesicular stomatitis virus-based mucosal vaccine promotes dendritic cell maturation and elicits preferable immune response against coxsackievirus B3 induced viral myocarditis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: One of the risk factors for poor outcome with SARS-CoV-2 infection is diabetes mellitus; diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) are the most serious complications of diabetes mellitus. We aimed to explore the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients presenting with isolated DKA or combined DKA/HHS to our institution. METHODS: A retrospective, hospital based observation case series was performed on patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to Intensive Care Unit between 03/20/20 and 04/20/20. Inclusion criteria were: 1) Blood Glucose >250mg/dL; 2) Serum bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L; 3) Anion Gap >10; 4) serum pH < 7.3; 4) ketonemia or ketonuria; and 5) positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Hyperosmolality, on the other hand, was defined as an effective/calculated plasma osmolality >304 mOsm/kg. RESULTS: A total of 87 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the ICU during the study period, 12 of them had either isolated DKA or DKA/HHS. Baseline demographics, lab values and outcome are summarized in Table 1. Six of the patients had isolated DKA and six had combined DKA and HHS. The median age for the patient was 49.5 years old (range from 19 to 62 years old). The male to female ratio was 5:1. Of the 12 patients, 10 patients (83%) had a history of DM, nine were type 2 and only one type 1; two patients were newly diagnosed DM, presenting as DKA, presumptively precipitated by COVID-19. Five patients (42%) had a BMI >30 kg/m2. As for ethnicity; seven were Hispanic (59%), four African American (33%), and one Caucasian (8%). Patients with combined DKA/HHS, higher BMI, higher HbA1c, severe acidosis tended to have higher mortality. The striking feature was that isolated DKA or combined DKA/HHS was the initial presentation for COVID-19 for most of the cases. Table 1: Demographic characteristic, inflammatory markers and outcome.

From a clinical point of view, differentiation of the two disease entities is crucial for patient management. We therefore aim to detect clinical differences between Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and seasonal influenza patients at time of hospital admission. METHODS: In this single-center observational study, we included all consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 or influenza between November 2019 and May 2020. Data were extracted from a nationwide surveillance program and from electronic health records. COVID-19 and influenza patients were compared in terms of baseline characteristics, clinical presentation and outcome. We used recursive partitioning to generate a classification tree to discriminate COVID-19 from influenza patients. RESULTS: We included 96 COVID-19 and 96 influenza patients. Median age was 68 vs. 70 years (p = 0.90), 72% vs. 56% (p = 0.024) were males, and median Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 1 vs. 2 (p = 0.027) in COVID-19 and influenza patients, respectively. Time from symptom onset to hospital admission was longer for COVID-19 (median 7 days, IQR 3C10) than for influenza patients (median 3 days, IQR 2C5, p < 0.001). Other variables favoring a diagnosis of COVID-19 in the classification tree were higher systolic blood pressure, lack of productive sputum, and lack of headache. The tree classified 86/192 patients (45%) into two subsets with 80% of patients having influenza or COVID-19, respectively. In-hospital mortality was higher for COVID-19 patients (16% vs. 5%, p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Discriminating COVID-19 from influenza patients based on clinical presentation is challenging. Time from symptom onset to hospital admission is considerably longer in COVID-19 than in influenza patients and showed the strongest discriminatory power in our classification tree. Although they had fewer comorbidities, in-hospital mortality was higher for COVID-19 patients.

There are limited data on COVID-19 presentation and clinical outcome in a cardiac transplant recipient. Case Report A 54-year old woman a heart transplant recipient presented with symptoms of fatigue, excessive sleepiness and cough with phlegm for one week. She did not report any fever or shortness of breath. She had a heart transplant six months prior complicated by antibody-mediated rejection. She was treated with plasmapheresis, intravenous immune globulin, and high dose methylprednisolone. She could not have further scheduled RV biopsies due to the lockdown. She remained on a high dose of immune suppressive medication till her current presentation. Her medication included Prednisolone 20mg daily, Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) 1g bid, Tacrolimus 7 mg bid for a target FK level 10-15. On her current presentation to the hospital, she was found to be hypoxic, tachypnic, tachycardic with a BP 130/70. Her chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates. She had leukopenia 3.5 and lymphopenia 0.2, CRP 25, ferritin 1106, LDH 632, and IL6 87. She was started empirically on oseltamivir, vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Her COVID-19 PCR result was positive. Subsequently, she was started on Favipiravir loading of 1600 mg for two doses and a maintenance dose of 600 mg twice daily for 7 days. The MMF and tacrolimus were discontinued. The prednisone was switched to hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6h. Despite treatment, she had reduced level of consciousness and progressive bilateral lung infiltrates requiering mechanical ventilation. The multidisciplinary team discussed enrolling patients in the convalescent plasma study. The patient's family was informed and they agreed and consented to proceed with plasma therapy. Two units of compatible ABO plasma therapy was given for two consecutive days. Intravenous dexamethasone was started. She was extubated successfully after ten days. Given her marked clinical improvement, she was started on MMF 1g bid, and tacrolimus adjusted to the target FK level of 5. The patient was discharged home after three weeks of admission.

Vital sign trends are routinely used to monitor patients with changes in these parameters often preceding an adverse event. Wearable sensors can measure vital signs continuously (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature) remotely and can be utilised to recognise early clinical deterioration. METHODS: We describe the protocol for a pilot, proof-of-concept, observational study to be conducted in an engineered hotel near London airports, UK. The study is set to continue for the duration of the pandemic. Individuals arriving to London with mild symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 or returning from high-risk areas requiring quarantine, as recommended by the Public Health England, or healthcare professionals with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 unable to isolate at home will be eligible for a wearable patch to be applied for the duration of their stay. Notifications will be generated should deterioration be detected through the sensor and displayed on a central monitoring hub viewed by nursing staff, allowing for trend deterioration to be noted. The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of remote monitoring systems in detecting clinical deterioration for quarantined individuals in a hotel. DISCUSSION: This trial should prove the feasibility of a rapidly implemented model of healthcare delivery through remote monitoring during a global pandemic at a hotel, acting as an extension to a healthcare trust. Potential benefits would include reducing infection risk of COVID-19 to healthcare staff, with earlier recognition of clinical deterioration through ambulatory, continuous, remote monitoring using a discrete wearable sensor. We hope our results can power future, robust randomised trials.

A search of electronic information was conducted to identify studies comparing the diagnostic performance within the same patient cohort of chest CT scan versus RT-PCR in COVID-19 suspected cases. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were primary outcome measures. Secondary outcomes included other test performance characteristics, discrepant findings between both investigations and main chest CT findings. Random effects modelling was used for the analyses. Results Thirteen non-randomised studies enrolling 4092 patients were identified. Accuracy was statistically significantly higher for RT-PCR versus chest CT (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.22, P = 0.001). Chest CT is also less specific than RT-PCR. Ground-glass opacities and consolidations were the most common chest CT manifestations. Importantly, early small studies tended to favour chest CT versus later larger studies. Conclusion Chest CT is inferior to RT-PCR for the initial detection of COVID-19 and has more false positives. It may still be useful in confirming COVID-19, however, in patients with a suspicious clinical presentation, but who have a false-negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test.","output":"Chest CT versus RT-PCR for the Detection of COVID-19: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Swiprosin-1 or EFHD2, is a Ca2+ binding actin protein and its expression has been shown to be distinct in various cell types.

Moreover, COVID-19 has heighted the need for remote assessment in older people, who are at higher risk of being infection and are particularly advised to use social distancing measures, yet the importance of diagnosis and treatment of dementia remains unchanged. The emergence of remote measurement technologies (RMTs) allows for more precise and objective measures of function. However, RMT selection is a critical challenge. Therefore, this case study outlines the processes through which we identified relevant functional domains, engaged with stakeholder groups to understand participants' perspectives and worked with technical experts to select relevant RMTs to examine function. After an extensive literature review to select functional domains relevant to AD biomarkers, quality of life, rate of disease progression and loss of independence, functional domains were ranked and grouped by the empirical evidence for each. For all functional domains, we amalgamated feedback from a patient advisory board. The results were prioritized into: highly relevant, relevant, neutral, and less relevant. This prioritized list of functional domains was then passed onto a group of experts in the use of RMTs in clinical and epidemiological studies to complete the selection process, which consisted of: (i) identifying relevant functional domains and RMTs; (ii) synthesizing proposals into final RMT selection, and (iii) verifying the quality of these decisions. Highly relevant functional domains were, \\"difficulties at work,\\" \\"spatial navigation and memory,\\" and \\"planning skills and memory required for task completion.\\" All functional domains were successfully allocated commercially available RMTs that make remote measurement of function feasible. This case study provides a set of prioritized functional domains sensitive to the early stages of AD and a set of RMTs capable of targeting them. RMTs have huge potential to transform the way we assess function in AD-monitoring for change and stability continuously within the home environment, rather than during infrequent clinic visits. Our decomposition of RMT and functional domain selection into identify, synthesize, and verify activities, provides a pragmatic structure with potential to be adapted for use in future RMT selection processes.","output":"Selecting Remote Measurement Technologies to Optimize Assessment of Function in Early Alzheimer's Disease: A Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Several threatening infectious diseases, including influenza, Ebola, SARS, and COVID-19, have affected human society over the past decades. These disease outbreaks naturally inspire a demand for sustained and advanced safety and suppression measures. To protect public health and safety, further research developments on emergency analysis methods and approaches for effective emergency treatment generation are urgently needed to mitigate the severity of the pandemic and save lives. METHODS: To address these issues, a novel case-based reasoning (CBR) system is proposed using three phases. In the first phase, the similarity between the current case and the historical cases is calculated under a variety of heterogeneous information. In the second phase, a filter approach based on grey clustering analysis is created to retrieve relevant cases. In the third phase, the cases retrieved are taken as initial host nests in a cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, and our system searches an optimal solution through iteration of this algorithm. RESULTS: The proposed model is compared with a CBR method improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a CBR method improved by a differential evolution algorithm (DE), to confirm the efficiency of our CS algorithm in adapting solutions for public health emergencies. The results show that the proposed model is better than the existing algorithms. CONCLUSION: The proposed model improves the speed of case retrieval using grey clustering and increases solution accuracy with CS algorithms. The present research can contribute to government, CDC, and infectious disease emergency management fields with regard to the implementation of fast and accurate public biohazard prevention and control measures based on a variety of heterogeneous information.","output":"Novel Case-Based Reasoning System for Public Health Emergencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To identify host factors involved in Salmonella replication, SILAC\\\\based quantitative proteomics was used to investigate the interactions of Salmonella typhimurium with the secretory pathway in human epithelial cells.

The current study aimed to: (1) identify changes in the pattern of mental health symptoms over the first six months of the pandemic between individuals with an ED history, compared to a community sample without an ED history (non-ED); and (2) identify differences in mental health symptoms and concerns between two waves of the virus and associated lockdowns. METHOD: Data from 4915 respondents C 231 with an ED history C were compared across monthly time points from April to September 2020 on psychological symptoms including negative mood, quality of life, coping and hopefulness, as well as changes to eating and exercise behaviours. RESULTS: Mental health symptoms were increased in the ED group, but generally did not differ from non-ED in the pattern of symptoms reported over time. Increased depressive symptoms and restrictive eating behaviours were found across both groups in relation to the second wave/lockdown, as well as decreased hopefulness and quality of life. Respondents in both groups also reported coping worse during the second wave of the virus compared to the first wave. CONCLUSION: Although non-ED and ED groups tended to generally show the same pattern of symptoms, the mental health status of the ED group was significantly poorer than the non-ED group throughout the pandemic, and exacerbations in some symptoms (i.e. increased food restriction and depressive symptoms) is cause for concern.","output":"Mental health of individuals with and without eating disorders across six months and two waves of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children presenting with discoloured teeth commonly suffer from low self-esteem.

We used SARS-CoV-2 infected and glycosylated soluble SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 subunit (S1) treated THP-1 human-derived macrophage-like cell line to clarify the role of macrophages in pro-inflammatory responses. Soluble S1 upregulated TNF- and CXCL10 mRNAs, and induced secretion of TNF- from THP-1 macrophages. While THP-1 macrophages did not support productive SARS-CoV-2 replication, virus infection resulted in upregulation of both TNF- and CXCL10 genes.

Thus, virus-infected or soluble S1-activated macrophages may become sources of pro-inflammatory mediators contributing to hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Proinflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected and soluble spike glycoprotein S1 subunit activated human macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Nipple-areolar complex (NAC) tattooing remains a simple and safe procedure, which complements breast reconstruction. This study reviews 11 years of NAC tattooing to identify risk factors for tattoo-related complications. METHODS Patients undergoing NAC tattooing from January 2009 to March 2020 were reviewed. Patient information, reconstructive, and tattoo procedural details were analyzed. Tattoo-related breast infections, defined as breast redness requiring antibiotic therapy within 30 days after tattoo, were captured. Patients with reactive breast redness during the first 2 postprocedural days were excluded. RESULTS Overall, 539 patients (949 breasts) were included. Implant-based reconstruction (IBR) was performed in 73.6% of breasts (n = 698), whereas 26.4% (n = 251) underwent autologous-based reconstruction (ABR). Acellular-dermal matrix was used in 547 breasts (57.6%). There as a 13.7% (n = 130) of breasts that underwent pretattoo radiation. There was a 65.3% (n = 456) of breasts that underwent subpectoral IBR, whereas 34.7% (n = 242) breasts underwent prepectoral IBR. Tattoo-related infection rate was 2.2% (n = 21 breasts). Mean time to infection was 6.5  5.3 days. There was a 85.7% (n = 18) of infections that occurred in IBR patients, one third occurring in radiated patients. There was a 95.2% (n = 20) of infections that were treated with oral antibiotics only. One explantation was performed after failed intravenous antibiotics. On multivariable analysis, radiation history (odds ratio, 4.1, P = 0.007) and prepectoral IBR (odds ratio, 2.8, P = 0.036) were independent predictors of tattoo-related infection. Among irradiated breasts, breasts with IBR had greater odds of developing tattoo-related infection versus breasts with ABR (P = 0.025).

METHOD: Using the open data source of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, we extracted data regarding all patients under 21 years of age and who had any cancer, aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome between September 2009 and December 2013. The positive detection rates of 11 viruses was collected from the surveillance data of Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and seasonality analysis were conducted with both data. RESULTS: In total, 9085 patients were diagnosed with malignant disease during the study period; there were about 175 new cases per month on average. Monthly stacked time series by year showed an apparent seasonal variation with the highest monthly average in January as 236, and the lowest in September as 120. In winter, significantly more patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, neuroblastoma, and Hodgkins lymphoma than in other seasons. There was a temporal correlation with the diagnostic trends of several diseases and the prevalence of recent human parainfluenza virus.

Streaming Twitter data have revealed the status of the COVID-19 outbreak in the most affected regions. This study focuses on identifying COVID-19 patients using tweets without requiring medical records to find the COVID-19 pandemic in Twitter messages (tweets). For this purpose, we propose herein an intelligent model using traditional machine learning-based approaches, such as support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), na?ve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), and decision tree (DT) with the help of the term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to detect the COVID-19 pandemic in Twitter messages. The proposed intelligent traditional machine learning-based model classifies Twitter messages into four categories, namely, confirmed deaths, recovered, and suspected. For the experimental analysis, the tweet data on the COVID-19 pandemic are analyzed to evaluate the results of traditional machine learning approaches. A benchmark dataset for COVID-19 on Twitter messages is developed and can be used for future research studies. The experiments show that the results of the proposed approach are promising in detecting the COVID-19 pandemic in Twitter messages with overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score between 70% and 80% and the confusion matrix for machine learning approaches (i.e., SVM, NB, LR, RF, and DT) with the TF-IDF feature extraction technique. ?

This is especially important for near-to-source sites that are subject to significant daily variability in upstream populations.

Using wastewater biomarkers, it is demonstrated that population normalisation can reveal significant differences between days where SARS-CoV-2 concentrations are very similar. Confidence in the trends identified is strongest when samples are collected during dry weather periods; however, wet weather samples can still provide valuable information.

The aim of this bench study was to determine whether different interfaces and ventilator settings may influence patient-ventilator interaction in pediatric models of normal and mixed obstructive and restrictive respiratory conditions. METHODS A test lung, connected to a pediatric mannequin using different interfaces (endotracheal tube [ETT], face mask, and helmet), was ventilated in pressure support ventilation mode testing 2 ventilator settings (pressurization time [Timepress]50%/cycling-off flow threshold [Trexp]25%, Timepress80%/Trexp60%), randomly applied. The test lung was set to simulate one pediatric patient with a healthy respiratory system and another with a mixed obstructive and restricted respiratory condition, at different breathing frequencies (f) (30, 40, and 50 breaths/min). We measured inspiratory trigger delay, pressurization time, expiratory trigger delay, and time of synchrony. RESULTS At each breathing frequency, the helmet showed the longest inspiratory trigger delay compared with the ETT and face mask. At f30, the ETT had a reduced Tpress. The helmet had the shortest Tpress in the simulated child with a mixed obstructive and restricted respiratory condition, at f40 during Timepress50%/Trexp25% and at f50 during Timepress80%/Trexp60%. In the simulated child with a normal respiratory condition, the ETT presented the shortest Tpress value at f50 during Timepress80%/Trexp60%. Concerning the expiratory trigger delay, the helmet showed the best interaction at f30, but the worst at f40 and at f50. The helmet showed the shortest time of synchrony during all ventilator settings. CONCLUSIONS The choice of the interface can influence patient-ventilator synchrony in a pediatric model breathing at increased f, thus making it more difficult to set the ventilator, particularly during noninvasive ventilation. The helmet demonstrated the worst interaction, suggesting that the face mask should be considered as the first choice for delivering noninvasive ventilation in a pediatric model.","output":"Influence of different interfaces on synchrony during pressure support ventilation in a pediatric setting: a bench study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chest computed tomography (CT) image data is necessary for early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Artificial intelligence has been tried to help clinicians in improving the diagnostic accuracy and working efficiency of CT. Whereas, existing supervised approaches on CT image of COVID-19 pneumonia require voxel-based annotations for training, which take a lot of time and effort. This paper proposed a weakly-supervised method for COVID-19 lesion localization based on generative adversarial network (GAN) with image-level labels only. We first introduced a GAN-based framework to generate normal-looking CT slices from CT slices with COVID-19 lesions. We then developed a novel feature match strategy to improve the reality of generated images by guiding the generator to capture the complex texture of chest CT images. Finally, the localization map of lesions can be easily obtained by subtracting the output image from its corresponding input image. By adding a classifier branch to the GAN-based framework to classify localization maps, we can further develop a diagnosis system with improved classification accuracy. Three CT datasets from hospitals of Sao Paulo, Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology, and China Medical University about COVID-19 were collected in this article for evaluation. Our weakly supervised learning method obtained AUC of 0.883, dice coefficient of 0.575, accuracy of 0.884, sensitivity of 0.647, specificity of 0.929, and F1-score of 0.640, which exceeded other widely used weakly supervised object localization methods by a significant margin. We also compared the proposed method with fully supervised learning methods in COVID-19 lesion segmentation task, the proposed weakly supervised method still leads to a competitive result with dice coefficient of 0.575. Furthermore, we also analyzed the association between illness severity and visual score, we found that the common severity cohort had the largest sample size as well as the highest visual score which suggests our method can help rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, especially in massive common severity cohort. In conclusion, we proposed this novel method can serve as an accurate and efficient tool to alleviate the bottleneck of expert annotation cost and advance the progress of computer-aided COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"Lung Lesion Localization of COVID-19 From Chest CT Image: A Novel Weakly Supervised Learning Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On rounds in a 20-bed intensive care unit (ICU) one recent day, physician Joshua Denson assessed two patients with seizures, many with respiratory failure and others whose kidneys were on a dangerous downhill slide Days earlier, his rounds had been interrupted as his team tried, and failed, to resuscitate a young woman whose heart had stopped All shared one thing, says Denson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the Tulane University School of Medicine They are all COVID positive  As the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 surges past 2 2 million globally and deaths surpass 150,000, clinicians and pathologists are struggling to understand the damage wrought by the coronavirus as it tears through the body They are realizing that although the lungs are ground zero, its reach can extend to many organs including the heart and blood vessels, kidneys, gut, and brain","output":"How does coronavirus kill?

People have had to resort to virtual events, with a subsequent proliferation of webinars, online meetings, and digital resources. In this situation we have had to find new ways of measuring the impact of these activities. Using the activities of the Italian Lichen Society (Societ Lichenologica Italiana, SLI), Google Trends and colleagues' contributions, we evaluated the performances and impacts of virtual tools on lichenological literacy. We compared the relative success of virtual and in-person events and the effort required; we evaluated followers' appreciation of various categories of posts on SLI Facebook page; and designed a questionnaire to collate information on individual experiences of in-person and virtual events linked to lichens. As expected, online events generally required less effort to put together and deploy than in-person events and engaged more people, especially when recorded and made available online for a long time. Using online searches for the word \\"lichens\\" we found an association with national events, and there was a notable increase in membership of SLI over the last 10 years, demonstrating an increasing interest by people in lichens. Without excluding the positive effects of in-person experiences, we believe that online events offer a powerful tool to help increase interest in, and knowledge about lichens. This interest may help to mitigate the impact of anthropogenic activities on this sensitive component of the ecosystem and help human-lichen relationships.

Whereas many statistical models have been proposed and disparate systems are routinely used, each tailored to specific data streams and use, no systematic evaluation strategy of their performance in a real-world context exists. One difficulty in evaluating outbreak prediction, detection, or annotation lies in the scales of different approaches: How to compare slow but fine-grained genetic clustering of individual samples with rapid but coarse anomaly detection based on aggregated syndromic reports? Or alarms generated for different, overlapping geographical regions or demographics? We propose a general, data-driven, user-centric framework for evaluating heterogeneous outbreak algorithms. Discrete outbreak labels and case counts are defined on a custom data grid, associated target probabilities are then computed and compared with algorithm output. The latter is defined as discrete \`\`signals'' are generated for a number of grid cells (the finest available in the benchmarking data set) with different weights and prior outbreak information from which then estimated outbreak label probabilities are derived.

The analysis covers 380 counties, including 66 cities. This study used daily reports on the progress of the pandemic in Poland published by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Poland and unique, detailed data on 24 types of land use available in the Statistics Poland database. Statistical relationships were determined between the above-mentioned environmental variables and the variables characterizing COVID-19 (cases and deaths). Various basic types of regression models were analysed. The optimal model was selected, and the determination coefficient, significance level and the values of the parameters of these relationships, together with the estimation error, were calculated. The obtained results indicated that the higher the number of green-blue spaces in individual counties, the lower the total number of COVID-19 infections and deaths. These relationships were described by logarithmic and homographic models. In turn, an increase in the population density caused an increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths, according to the power model. These results can be used in the current analysis of the spread of the pandemic, including the location of potential outbreaks. In turn, the developed models can be used as a tool in forecasting the development of the pandemic and making decisions about the implementation of preventive measures.","output":"Green-Blue Spaces and Population Density versus COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in Poland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article considers government responses to unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It analyses the two main legislative responses adopted by North American governments: a broadening of access to (un)employment insurance (EI) and the adoption of payroll subsidies for companies. It comparatively and critically assesses these two solutions, to eventually propose an alternative plan. Under this plan, access to EI would be broadened to cover those not traditionally covered by it, such as self-employed workers, contract workers, and those caring for a family member sick from COVID-19 or for a child who is at home due to school and day-care closures. Unemployed workers who have traditionally paid into the EI system would be rewarded through a tax credit. To avoid incentivising temporary layoffs, a payroll subsidy would be adopted. The subsidy would make it as attractive to keep workers on payroll as to lay them off so they can benefit from EI. It would also provide a more faithful picture of unemployment rates during the crisis. The plan would also address broader concerns regarding the unsustainability of public spending during the crisis by limiting access to both temporary layoffs and the payroll subsidy. Large and profitable companies, as well as companies with high revenue or cash reserves, would not be able to temporarily lay their employees off during the crisis or benefit from the subsidy. For companies that face liquidity issues yet are not eligible for the subsidy, short-term, interest-bearing emergency loans would be available.","output":"Incentivising employment during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several risk factors are known to increase the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness in adults, including age and obesity. Specific comorbidities affecting COVID-19 outcomes in children are less well defined. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of overweight and obese (OW) children compared to underweight and normal weight (NW) children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Children between 2 and 18 years of age who were admitted to Texas Childrens Hospital from April through December of 2020 with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test were included. Asymptomatic patients undergoing surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the Centers for Disease Control definition. Demographic and clinical information was obtained from the electronic medical record. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.0. RESULTS: We identified 145 total children who met inclusion criteria. Fifty-five (38%) children were NW and 90 (62%) children were OW. Demographics and characteristics are shown (Figure 1). Underlying asthma or chronic lung disease was present in 13 (24%) vs 31 (34%) in the NW and OW groups respectively (P=0.17). OW children were more likely to have pneumonia than NW children [relative risk1.6 (CI 1.40-2.45)]. An elevated BMI was also associated with an increased risk of requiring oxygen [relative risk 1.4 (CI 1.03-1.96)]. The median length of hospitalization was 4 days for NW versus 5 days for OW children (P=0.6). Admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was similar between the groups (P=0.7). There was no significant difference in treatments administered to children in the two groups, although there was a trend towards increased steroid (29 (53%) vs 59 (67%), P=0.13) and remdesivir (12 (22%) vs 30 (33%), P=0.14) use in the OW children.

Remdesivir is one effective inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA replication. It supersedes other NTP analogues because it not only terminates the polymerization activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), but also inhibits the proofreading activity of intrinsic exoribonuclease (ExoN). Even though the static structure of Remdesivir binding to RdRp has been solved and biochemical experiments have suggested it to be a \\"delayed chain terminator\\", the underlying molecular mechanisms is not fully understood. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 24 microseconds to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of Remdesivir on nucleotide addition and proofreading. We found that when Remdesivir locates at an upstream site in RdRp, the 1'-cyano group experiences electrostatic interactions with a salt bridge (Asp865-Lys593), which subsequently halts translocation. Our findings can supplement the current understanding of the delayed chain termination exerted by Remdesivir and provide an alternative molecular explanation about Remdesivir's inhibitory mechanism. Such inhibition also reduces the likelihood of Remdesivir to be cleaved by ExoN acting on 3'-terminal nucleotides. Furthermore, our study also suggests that Remdesivir's 1'-cyano group can disrupt the cleavage site of ExoN via steric interactions, leading to a further reduction in the cleavage efficiency. Our work provides plausible and novel mechanisms at the molecular level of how Remdesivir inhibits viral RNA replication, and our findings may guide rational design for new treatments of COVID-19 targeting viral replication.","output":"1'-Ribose cyano substitution allows Remdesivir to effectively inhibit nucleotide addition and proofreading during SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the fight against the coronavirus, social distancing has proven to be an effective measure to hamper the spread of the disease.

This mHTS platform is based on microchannel devices (providing physical confinement during cell migration and limit migrating cells' proliferation rate) assembled 96-well plate (fitting to HTS manner).

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study aims to understand mens masculinities and their relationships with emergency contraception and abortion. The protocol presents a multimethod study of men aged over 18 years in James Town, Accra, Ghana. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the research will use two mobile-based methods: a survey and in-depth interviews. Using respondent-driven sampling, an estimated 789 men will be recruited to participate in the survey, asking questions on their knowledge, attitude, behaviours and roles in emergency contraception and abortion. In-depth interviews focused on constructions of masculinity will be conducted with a purposive sample of men who participated in the survey. Data will be analysed concurrently using multiple regression analyses of quantitative data and abductive analysis of qualitative data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by the London School of Economics and Political Science and the Ghana Health Service.

We aimed to describe the evolution of outbreaks of COVID-19 in all care homes in one large health region in Scotland. Methods: We did a population analysis of testing, cases, and deaths in care homes in the National Health Service (NHS) Lothian health region of the UK. We obtained data for COVID-19 testing (PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) and deaths (COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related), and we analysed data by several variables including type of care home, number of beds, and locality. Outcome measures were timing of outbreaks, number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in care home residents, care home characteristics associated with the presence of an outbreak, and deaths of residents in both care homes and hospitals. We calculated excess deaths (both COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related), which we defined as the sum of deaths over and above the historical average in the same period over the past 5 years. Findings: Between March 10 and Aug 2, 2020, residents at 189 care homes (5843 beds) were tested for COVID-19 when symptomatic. A COVID-19 outbreak was confirmed at 69 (37%) care homes, of which 66 (96%) were care homes for older people. The size of care homes for older people was strongly associated with a COVID-19 outbreak (odds ratio per 20-bed increase 335, 95% CI 199-563). 907 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recorded during the study period, and 432 COVID-19-related deaths. 229 (25%) COVID-19-related cases and 99 (24%) COVID-related deaths occurred in five (3%) of 189 care homes, and 441 (49%) cases and 207 (50%) deaths were in 13 (7%) care homes. 411 (95%) COVID-19-related deaths occurred in the 69 care homes with a confirmed COVID-19 outbreak, 19 (4%) deaths were in hospital, and two (<1%) were in one of the 120 care homes without a confirmed COVID-19 outbreak. At the 69 care homes with a confirmed COVID-19 outbreak, 74 excess non-COVID-19-related deaths were reported, whereas ten non-COVID-19-related excess deaths were observed in the 120 care homes without a confirmed COVID-19 outbreak. 32 fewer non-COVID-19-related deaths than expected were reported among care home residents in hospital. Interpretation: The effect of COVID-19 on care homes has been substantial but concentrated in care homes with known outbreaks. A key implication from our findings is that, if community incidence of COVID-19 increases again, many care home residents will be susceptible. Shielding care home residents from potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and ensuring rapid action to minimise outbreak size if infection is introduced, will be important for any second wave.

The incidence of ISR and its relationship with visit-to-visit HbA1c variability, expressed as coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation (SD) and variability independent of the mean (VIM), were studied. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to analyze the predictive value of HbA1c variability for ISR. RESULTS From September 2014 to July 2018 in Ruijin Hospital, a total of 420 diabetic patients (688 lesions) after stent implantation were included in the final analysis. During a mean follow-up of 12.8  1.3 months, the incidence of ISR was 8.6%, which was significantly increased in patients with higher CV of HbA1c (P = 0.001). The mean diameter stenosis (DS), net luminal loss and net luminal gain were 22.9  16.8%, 0.42  0.88 mm and 1.66  0.83 mm, respectively. Greater DS was observed in subjects with higher tertiles of CV of HbA1c (P < 0.001), and this trend was more prominent in patients with optimal glycemic control (HbA1c  7%) in the baseline.

RESULTS Sixty-five (52%) of 125 centres responded. Seventy-one per cent of centres had 300 non-ICU beds and 71% had dedicated cardiac ICUs. To respond to cardiac patients, dedicated cardiac rapid response teams were utilised in 29% of all centres (39% and 5% in centres with and without dedicated cardiac ICUs, respectively) [p = 0.006]. Early warning scores were utilised in 62% of centres. Only 31% reported that rapid response teams received specialised training. Transfers to ICU were higher for cardiac (73%) compared to generalised rapid response events (54%). The monitoring and reassessment of patients not transferred to ICU after the rapid response was variable. Cardiac and respiratory arrests outside the ICU were infrequent. Only 29% of centres formally appraise critical deterioration events (need for ventilation and/or inotropes post-rapid response) and 34% perform post-event debriefs.

Further, studies to date have disproportionately examined males and failed to examine sex differences. Here we examine the relationship between aerobic fitness and neuropsychological functioning in physically healthy youth and whether sex moderates these findings. Design: Sixty-four healthy emerging adults (16-25 years-old; 32 female) underwent measurement of objective aerobic fitness (VO2 max) and neuropsychological assessment. Exclusion criteria included: left-handedness, prenatal medical issues or alcohol/illicit drug exposure, Axis-I psychiatric disorders, major medical disorders including metabolic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, major neurologic disorders, LOS greater than 2 min, intellectual disability or learning disability, regular substance use (e.g., greater than biweekly use of cannabis) or positive drug toxicology testing. Method: Multiple regressions examined VO2 max, sex, sex*VO2interaction in relation to neurocognition, controlling for objectively measured body fat percentage. Results: Prior to including body fat percentage, higher VO2 max related to improved working memory (Letter-Number Sequencing; p = .03) and selective attention (CPT-II hit response time standard error; p = .03). Aerobic fitness significantly interacted with sex, as higher-fit males had better performance on two sustained attention tasks while females did not demonstrate this pattern (CPT-II variability standard error, p = .047; Ruff 2&7 Total Speed, p = .02). Body fat percentage was positively slower cognitive flexibility (D-KEFS color-word switching/inhibition, p = .046). Conclusions: VO2 independently predicted better working memory and selective attention. Increased aerobic fitness level related to increased performance on sustained attention tasks in males but not females. Therefore, aerobic fitness may be positively related to better cognitive functioning in physically healthy adolescents and emerging adults without metabolic conditions. Further research into factors (e.g., intensity or type of activity) that may relate to beneficial outcomes by sex are needed.","output":"Objective aerobic fitness level and neuropsychological functioning in healthy adolescents and emerging adults: Unique sex effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A remarkable feature of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the outpouring of voluntary action, community support and mutual aid across the world Yet, even as these modern epidemics were marked by heightened fears of foreigners, sharpened social divisions, and racialised policies of border control and quarantine, they could also be sources of solidarity, bringing together working classes, ethnic minorities, colonial subjects and others against state, medical or colonial authorities On the one hand, it is suggested that reactions could stem from the particular etiological, clinical or epidemiological characteristics of a disease;on the other hand, they could stem from particular meanings signified by a disease, the types of people associated with it, the preventive measures employed or the authorities tasked with their implementation","output":"Epidemics: Hate and Compassion from the Plague of Athens to AIDS ( Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 ), pp. x + 656, 22.99, hardback, ISBN: 9780198819660"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence relating to the impact of COVID-19 in people with diabetes (PWD) is limited but continuing to emerge.

The most recent global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has shown the major threat that RNA viruses can pose to humanity. In comparison, influenza has an even higher pandemic potential as a result of its high rate of mutations within its relatively short (<13 kbp) genome, as well as its capability to undergo genetic reassortment. In light of this threat, and the fact that RNA structure is connected to a broad range of known biological functions, deeper investigation of viral RNA (vRNA) structures is of high interest. Here, for the first time, we propose a secondary structure for segment 8 vRNA (vRNA8) of A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) formed in the presence of cellular and viral components. This structure shows similarities with prior in vitro experiments. Additionally, we determined the location of several well-defined, conserved structural motifs of vRNA8 within IAV strains with possible functionality. These RNA motifs appear to fold independently of regional nucleoprotein (NP)-binding affinity, but a low or uneven distribution of NP in each motif region is noted.

As an effort to prevent nosocomial infections among the medical staff, we switched from the traditional face-to-face instruction to a web-based multimodal teaching model in our resident training program. Specifically, we explored ways to provide remote training in the proper procedure of donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE). The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of various teaching methods in teaching clinical skills of our residents during the epidemic period. Methods: : 72 resident anesthesiologists (1st to 3 rd year) were recruited to receive remote skill training on donning and doffing of PPE. In this study, all participants received instructional videos/text for the proper protocol, in addition to watching a live-stream instructional video that simulated the procedure of donning and doffing of PPE. We matched the residents by year and divided them into two groups through a WeChat Draw Program. The video feedback (VF) group recorded and submitted videos of simulated donning and removing PPE followed by a debriefing session through a collaborative WeChat learning group. The independent learning (IL) group did not record videos, but were encouraged to consult with their instructors by WeChat or phone if they had any questions. Then the two groups completed questionnaire as well as theory tests and skill assessment. Results: The VF group responded positively to the additional video-recording/debriefing approach. We did not observe any significant difference between the two groups in theoretical test scores. However, the VF group had significantly higher performance than the IL group in skill assessment. Conclusion: The web-based teaching, simulation teaching and video feedback model is an effective alternative to the conventional face-to-face instruction as part of an adapted resident training curriculum involving donning and doffing of protective equipment during an epidemic outbreak.","output":"The Skill Training of Resident Anesthesiologists During the Outbreak Of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A gentleman in his 60s with end-stage kidney disease status post kidney transplantation on prednisone and tacrolimus presented with generalised weakness for 7 days, associated with altered mental status.

These different expressions of Catholicism, forged around the controversies over Maritain, had lasting and profound effects on the historical development of the Catholic Church and its positions on politics in both countries. Thus, our research intends to provide an explanation for both the different expressions of progressive Catholicism, which developed in the two countries in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as the different majority reactions on the part of the Catholic Church during the last military dictatorships in Chile and Argentina. We do not seek to impose a single explanation with this idea, but rather to highlight certain aspects of Catholicism in Argentina and Chile that help to explain the Churchs attitude to politics in both countries and which can be seen more clearly in a comparative analysis. In line with Reinhart Koselleck, we argue that the debates on Maritain opened different expectation horizons that outlined the possibilities of thinking the political expressions of conservative and progressive Catholicisms in both countries.

We used a similar approach to study the fusogenic mechanism of severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). METHODS: We tested the inhibitory activity against infection of two sets of peptides corresponding to sequences of SARS-CoV spike protein HR1 and HR2 regions and investigated the interactions between the HR1 and HR2 peptides by surface plasmon resonance, sedimentation equilibration analysis, circular dichroism, native polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography, and computer-aided homology modelling and molecule docking analysis. FINDINGS: One peptide, CP-1, derived from the HR2 region, inhibited SARS-CoV infection in the micromolar range. CP-1 bound with high affinity to a peptide from the HR1 region, NP-1. CP-1 alone had low -helicity and self-associated to form a trimer in phosphate buffer (pH 72). CP-1 and NP-1 mixed in equimolar concentrations formed a six-helix bundle, similar to the fusogenic core structure of HIV-1 gp41. INTERPRETATION: After binding to the target cell, the transmembrane spike protein might change conformation by association between the HR1 and HR2 regions to form an oligomeric structure, leading to fusion between the viral and target-cell membranes. At the prefusion intermediate state, CP-1 could bind to the HR1 region and interfere with the conformational changes, resulting in inhibition of SARS-CoV fusion with the target cells. CP-1 might be modifiable to increase its anti-SARS-CoV activity and could be further developed as an antiviral agent for treatment or prophylaxis of SARS-CoV infection.","output":"Interaction between heptad repeat 1 and 2 regions in spike protein of SARS-associated coronavirus: implications for virus fusogenic mechanism and identification of fusion inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is the most endangered felid species in the world. Lynx populations have decreased dramatically in size and distribution in the last four decades, thus becoming increasingly vulnerable to catastrophic events such as epizooties. From 1989 to 2000, serum samples were obtained from 48 free-ranging lynx captured in the Do?ana National Park (DNP, n = 31) and mountains of Sierra Morena (SM, n = 17) in southern Spain. Samples were tested for antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii, feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline/canine parvovirus (FPV/CPV), feline coronavirus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukaemia virus and canine distemper virus (CDV) and for FeLV p27 antigen, to document baseline exposure levels. Antibodies against T. gondii were detected in 44% of lynx, with a significantly greater prevalence in DNP (61%) than in SM (12%). In DNP, prevalence was significantly higher in adult (81%) than in juvenile and sub-adult (41%) lynx, but no such difference was observed in SM. Low prevalences (11%) of minimally positive titres were found for FHV-1, FCV and FPV/CPV. This, combined with the lack of evidence for exposure to CDV, FIV and FeLV, suggests that these lynx populations are na?ve and might be vulnerable to a disease outbreak in the future. Because of the reduced size of lynx populations, the documented low level of genetic variation (particularly in the DNP population) coupled with the recently documented state of immune depletion in a majority of necropsied lynx, it is important to better understand the threat and potential impact that disease agents might pose for the conservation of this endangered species.

METHODS: A total of 11 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted and structured according to the theory of planned behavior. RESULTS: Findings suggest that self-sampling may lift important barriers hampering traditional cervical cancer screening, such as those related to shame and chastity. However, self-sampling raises its own barriers too. Most importantly, some women fear that self-sampling may harm virginity. Some women also do not feel confident about their ability to properly use the self-sampling kit, but fears about the inability to properly use it often fade away upon having seen the self-sampling kit. Moreover, results show that knowledge about cervical cancer and its origin is limited, which may undermine womens willingness to participate in a screening program. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that communication strategies to encourage using self-sampling kits among women of Turkish and Moroccan origin could benefit from culturally sensitive approaches, for example, by placing emphasis on issues such as virginity and chastity. Consistent with a recent advice of the Health Council of the Netherlands, the kit could furthermore be sent to eligible women as a standard procedure, rather than upon request. This could reduce hassle and doubts about womens ability to use the self-sampling kit.

This study aimed to estimate the long-term impacts of the pandemic on cancer incidence and mortality in Canada using a mathematical model. Methods: We developed a stochastic microsimulation model to estimate the cancer care disruptions and its long-term impact on cancer incidence and mortality in Canada. The model reproduces cancer incidence, survival, and epidemiology in Canada, by using cancer incidence, stage at diagnosis and survival data from the Canadian Cancer Registries. We modeled reported declines in cancer diagnoses and treatments recorded in provincial administrative datasets from March 2020-June 2021. We assumed that diagnostic and treatment delays lead to an increased rate of death. Based on the literature, we assumed each 4-week delay in diagnosis and treatment would lead to a 6% to 50% higher rate of cancer death. Results are the median predictions of 10 stochastic simulations. Findings: The model predicts that cancer care disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to 21,247 (2.0%) more cancer deaths in Canada in 2020-2030, assuming treatment capacity is recovered to 2019 pre-pandemic levels in 2021. This represents 355,172 life years lost expected due to pandemic-related diagnostic and treatment delays. The highest absolute expected excess cancer mortality was predicted in breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, and in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. Diagnostic and treatment capacity in 2021 onwards highly influenced the number of predicted cancer deaths over the next decade. Interpretation: Cancer care disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic could lead to significant life loss; however, most of these could be mitigated by increasing diagnostic and treatment capacity in the post-pandemic era to address the service backlog.

Main body The innate immunity modules are at the forefront of combating against influenza infection in the respiratory tract, among which, innate T cells, particularly gamma-delta (æ) T cells, play a critical role in filling the gap needed for adaptive immune cells maturation, linking the innate and adaptive immunity together. Upon infection with influenza virus, production of cytokines and chemokines including CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 from respiratory epithelium recruits æ T cells at the site of infection in a CCR5 receptor-dependent fashion. Next, æ T cells become activated in response to influenza virus infection and produce large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL-17A. Regardless of æ T cells roles in triggering the adaptive arm of the immune system, they also protect the respiratory epithelium by cytolytic and non-cytolytic antiviral mechanisms, as well as by enhancing neutrophils and natural killer cells recruitment to the infection site. CONCLUSION: In this review, we explored varied strategies of æ T cells in defense to influenza virus infection and how they can potentially provide balanced protective immune responses against infected cells.

She presented with nephrotic syndrome (NS) and acute kidney injury. Four weeks prior to presentation, she had been prescribed a seven-day course of oral amoxicillin for submental swelling after dental extraction. Investigations showed high titer of antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-double stranded DNA, elevated serum IgE level, and positive Coombs test, along with positive anti-histone antibodies. Renal biopsy showed features of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) and partial podocyte foot process effacement without evidence of lupus nephritis.

The economic evaluation was conducted from an Australian healthcare sector perspective with a lifetime horizon. Health-related quality of life (EQ-5D) and total healthcare costs were compared between the intervention and the usual care group within the trial period. The 'UKPDS Outcomes Model 2' was used to simulate post-trial lifetime costs, life expectancy and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS No significant difference in health-related quality of life and costs was found between the two groups within the trial period.

The observability condition is verified by the factorization of the residual covariance matrix, which usually is a time-consuming computation task. Also, the search for criticalities is costly, being a combinatorial based problem. This paper proposes a parallel approach of the criticality analysis in the SE realm, through multi-threads execution on CPU and GPU environments. To date, no publication reporting the use of GPU for computing critical elements of the SE process is found in the specialized literature. Numerical results from simulations performed on the IEEE 14- and 30-bus test systems showed speed-ups close to 25[Formula: see text] , when compared with parallel CPU architectures .","output":"GPU-Based Criticality Analysis Applied to Power System State Estimation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leishmania infantum is a vector-borne zoonotic disease transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies and dogs are considered the main reservoir of the parasite. Feline leishmaniosis (FeL) caused by L. infantum is an emergent feline disease more and more frequently reported in endemic areas. This review summarizes current knowledge focusing similarities and differences with canine leishmaniosis (CanL). Cats are infected by the same Leishmania species than dogs but prevalence of the infection is lower and cases of disease are less frequently reported. Scarce information is available on adaptive immune response of cats naturally exposed to L. infantum infection and mechanisms responsible for susceptibility or resistance of feline hosts. However, about half of clinical cases of FeL are reported in cats with possible impaired immunocompetence. Coinfections or comorbidities are frequently detected in sick cats and they can contribute to a misrepresentation of clinical FeL albeit lesions associated with the presence of the parasite have been detected in skin, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, liver, oral mucosa, stomach, large bowel, kidney, nasal exudate, lung, eye. As for dogs, skin or mucocutaneous lesions are the most common reason for veterinary consultation and finding on physical examination in cats with leishmaniosis. Molecular investigations of Leishmania DNA and anti- Leishmania antibody detection are largely used with the same methodologies for both CanL and FeL, however few information is available about their diagnostic performance in feline hosts. Treatment of cats with clinical FeL is still empirically based and off label by using the most common drugs prescribed to dogs. Life expectancy of cats with clinical FeL is usually good unless concurrent conditions or complications occur and prognosis does not seem significantly influenced by therapy or retroviral coinfection. According to current knowledge, cats can play a role as additional reservoir host of L. infantum and, in a ? One Health ? perspective, preventative measures should be taken. In conclusion, albeit feline infection and the associated cat disease caused by L. infantum is increasingly reported in endemic areas and have many similarities with CanL, consolidated evidence-based knowledge is not available and we cannot exclude that important differences between dogs and cats exist about transmission, immunopathogenesis and best practice for management and prevention.","output":"Feline leishmaniosis: Is the cat a small dog?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An aging population and social informatization are currently the two main social phenomena affecting China.

The infectious nature of COVID-19 poses an additional risk of transmission to healthcare workers that should be taken into consideration. METHODS: We explore current literature and recommendations for tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 and look back at previous data from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003. RESULTS: Given the severity and clinical uncertainty of patients with COVID-19 and the increased risk of transmission to clinicians, careful consideration should be taken prior to performing tracheostomy. If tracheostomy is performed, we recommend a bedside approach to limit exposure time and number of exposed personnel. Bronchoscopy use with a percutaneous approach should be limited in order to decrease viral exposure. CONCLUSION: Thorough preprocedural planning, use of experienced personnel, enhanced personal protective equipment where available, and a thoughtful anesthesia approach are instrumental in maximizing positive patient outcomes while successfully protecting the safety of healthcare personnel.

Understanding hospitalist perspectives could help to address vaccine hesitancy among patients.Methods: We conducted an online survey of hospitalists at Mayo Clinic sites in Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin from 14 December 2020 through 4 January 2021. We collected demographic information and assessed perspectives on the COVID-19 vaccine and, for comparison, on the influenza vaccine. Descriptive statistics were used to compare responses between APPs and physicians.Results: The overall response rate was 42.7% (n = 128/300) and comprised of 53.9% women (n = 69/128) and 41.4% APPs (n = 53/128). Most hospitalists reported receiving or planning to receive vaccination against COVID-19 (93.7%; n = 119/128) and influenza (97.7%; n = 125/128). Most hospitalists reported they would advise 100% of patients to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (66% for APPs; 74.7% for physicians) and influenza vaccine (83% for APPs; 80% for physicians). Barriers to recommending the COVID-19 vaccine included patient health status and vaccine safety profile. Hospitalists reported that patients and coworkers receiving the COVID-19 vaccine would reduce their anxiety (~80% of hospitalists), social isolation (~64% of hospitalists), and improve their emotional support (~40% of hospitalists).

Therefore, it is also expected to be useful in the dental practice field, as a self-learning medium for non-face-to-face skill training during the ongoing pandemic (COVID-19). Accordingly, this study was conducted to assess 360 VR self-learning media for a periodontal instrument operation. MATERIALS AND METHODS We recruited 30 participants who had never experienced instrument training. We offered basic education and initial assessment (IA), then divided them into three groups: 1) PAPER: trained only with paper handouts; 2) 2D: trained with 2D video; 3) VR: trained with 360 VR. Each group performed self-learning and mid-term assessment (MA). Subjects then implemented home self-learning with the same media for one week, which was then followed by a final assessment (FA). RESULT Analysis of IA-to-FA improvement scores showed that VR and 2D video were significantly higher than the PAPER groups. Meanwhile, analysis of MA-to-FA improvement scores showed that only VR was substantially higher than the PAPER group. Although VR and 2D video groups were not considerably different, VR scores were numerically higher than 2D video in all improvement score analyses. DISCUSSION Both 2D video and 360 VR training were helpful to participants for an effective self-learning and also had good portability and accessibility as online-based learning methods. 360 VR showed higher learning efficiency than regular 2D video, possibly due to its autonomy, 360 visual information, and physical and immersive characteristics, which positively affected self-training.

Amongst the discussions is the gender-related responses to COVID-19 that generally assume females to better respond to COVID-19 than males. Despite the converging assumptions, previous studies tend to conceptualize gender as binary biological sex, and consequently, there is little understanding of the gender-COVID-19 measures compliance relationship. By taking gender as a multidimensional perspective, this research aims to examine the relationship between sex, gender psychology, and gender-role with voluntary compliance to COVID-19 measures as well as the moderating role of situational aspects that can activate individuals' responses toward COVID-19. A survey had been conducted in Indonesia, as Indonesia represents a country with relaxed COVID-19 restrictions making voluntary compliance is deemed important. Consistent with our predictions and previous studies, females tend to better comply with COVID-19 when gender is treated as dichotomous sex. However, a closer look at the gender dimensions revealed that gender psychology (feminine vs masculine) and gender-role (traditional vs egalitarian) provide a better explanation of the specific compliance behaviour toward COVID-19 measures. Interestingly, although situational pathogen avoidance (SPA) directly leads to adherence to several compliance behaviours, it does not moderate the four compliance behaviour of COVID-19 measures.

ABSTRACT: Brassica crops such as kale and swede can be supplied to cow diets during winter, however little is known about the effects of feeding those forage brassicas to lactating cows on cheese nutritional characteristics of milk and cheese. This study evaluated the effect of including kale or swede in pasture-fed lactating dairy cow diets on chemical composition, fatty acid (FA) profile, and sensory characteristics of Chanco-style cheese. Twelve early-lactation cows were used in a replicated (n = 4) 3  3 square Latin square design. The control diet consisted of (DM basis) 10.0 kg of grass silage, 4.0 kg of fresh grass pasture, 1.5 kg soybean meal, 1.0 kg of canola meal, and 4.0 kg of cereal-based concentrate. The other treatments replaced 25% of the diet with swede or kale. Milk yield, milkfat, and milk protein were similar between treatments as were cheese moisture, fat, and protein. Swede and kale increased total saturated cheese FA while thrombogenic index was greater in swede, but color homogeneity and salty flavor were greater while ripe cheese aroma less than for kale.

This study therefore aimed to compare the miRNA profiles and cellular characteristics of HEI-OC1 cells cultured under permissive (P-HEI-OC1) and non-permissive (NP-HEI-OC1) conditions. A significant increase in the level of expression of tubulin 1 class VI (Tubb1), e-cadherin (Cdh1), espin (Espn), and SRY (sex determining region Y)-box2 (Sox2) mRNAs was identified in non-permissive cells compared with permissive cells (P < 0.05, KruskalCWallis H test, 2-sided). miR-200 family, miR-34b/c, and miR-449a/b functionally related cluster miRNAs, rodent-specific maternally imprinted gene Sfmbt2 intron 10(th) cluster miRNAs (-466a/ -467a), and miR-17 family were significantly (P < 0.05, Welchs t-test, 2-tailed) differentially expressed in non-permissive cells when compared with permissive cells.

The proposed approach aims to minimise the video frames total distortion, ensuring better flow rate allocation and enhancing the video frames reliability. The proposed system consists of a proposed algorithm for Enhancing Video Quality, Distorting Minimization, Bandwidth efficiency, and Reliability Maximization called (EVQDMBRM) algorithm. The proposed algorithm reduces the video frames total distortion. In addition, it enhances the video quality in a real-time network by dynamically allocating the flow rate at the video source and maximizing the transmission reliability of the video frames. The result shows that the proposed EVQDMBRM algorithm improves the video quality with the minimized total distortion.

This presentation describes our experiences with developing 2 virtual intensive treatment programs for EDs, with a focus on perceived challenges and benefits. Methods: Clinical staff provided their perspectives working within our institutions 2 virtual intensive treatment programs for EDs, one of which treats children and adolescents (ages 10-16 years) and the other of which treats young adults (ages 17-25 years). Feedback was obtained from an interdisciplinary team of providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, adolescent medicine physicians, therapists, and dietitians. Results: Providers identified a number of challenges and benefits related to offering an intensive treatment program for EDs using a virtual format. Challenges included decreased supervision of patients eating behaviors during and after meals, complications obtaining accurate weight information, patient fatigue and reduced attention following multiple hours of virtual sessions, patient hesitancy speaking in virtual groups, fewer opportunities for in-session exposure therapy, and difficulties with technology. Benefits included greater access to services for patients with geographical limitations, easier involvement of family members in treatment, greater emphasis on between-session exposure exercises, increased generalizability to patients natural environment, reduced disruption of prosocial activities and responsibilities, and more seamless transitions to outpatient treatment.

As in people, SARS-CoV-2 infects animals through direct animal-to-animal contact and aerosol transmission between animals. Humans can also infect pets or other animals in their care and, although human-to-human transmission is the main route of viral spread in people, infected animals and specimens of their bodily fluids or tissues are a potential source of infection for veterinarians and technical or laboratory personnel that are handling them. In this perspective, we discuss how SARS-CoV-2 has necessitated rapid changes in laboratory operation to minimize zoonotic risk to personnel and to implement tests for identifying the virus in animals. The pandemic has highlighted the adaptability and quick response of veterinary diagnosticians to an emerging infectious disease and their critical role in maintaining animal health, while synergizing with and protecting human public health.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2): A Perspective Through the Lens of the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior to COVID\\\\19, the field of genetic counseling was responding to a workforce shortage in patient\\\\facing roles through efforts to increase the training capacity within existing programs, as well as development of new programs.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cross-sectional questionnaire was given to the general population in KSA, using Google forms, to collect data. A total of 1369 people responded. RESULTS: The findings showed that there is widespread knowledge of risk factors for obesity among citizens in Saudi Arabia. Participants' knowledge of risk factors was very high (95.5%). In addition, a significant association was found between demographics (gender, age, and level of education) and knowledge of risk factors for obesity, in assessing variables for knowledge of the risk factors for obesity in relation to the demographics of gender and level of education. In addition, from decision tree results, we found that level of education and marital status were the most important variables to affect knowledge of risk factors for obesity among respondents. The accuracy of correctly classified cases was 95.5%, the same in logistic regression and decision tree.

METHODS Poor-grade aneurysmal SAH patients were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2002-2011). Multivariable linear regression was used to analyze predictors of tracheostomy timing and multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of timing of intervention with mortality, complications, and discharge to institutional care. Covariates included patient demographics, comorbidities, severity of subarachnoid hemorrhage (measured using the NIS-SAH severity scale), hospital characteristics, and other complications and length of stay. RESULTS The median time to tracheostomy among 1380 poor-grade SAH admissions was 11 (interquartile range: 7-15) days after intubation. The mean number of days from intubation to tracheostomy in SAH patients at the hospital (p < 0.001) was the strongest predictor of tracheostomy timing for a patient, while comorbidities and SAH severity were not significant predictors. Mortality, neurologic complications, and discharge disposition did not differ significantly by tracheostomy time. However, later tracheostomy (when evaluated continuously) was associated with greater odds of pulmonary complications (p = 0.004), venous thromboembolism (p = 0.04), and pneumonia (p = 0.02), as well as a longer hospitalization (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis only found these associations between tracheostomy timing and medical complications in patients with moderately poor grade (NIS-SAH severity scale 7-9), while there were no significant differences by timing of intervention in very poor-grade patients (NIS-SAH severity scale > 9). CONCLUSIONS In this analysis of a large, national data set, variation in hospital practices was the strongest predictor of tracheostomy timing for an individual. In patients with moderately poor grade, later tracheostomy was independently associated with pulmonary complications, venous thromboembolism, pneumonia, and a longer hospitalization, but not with mortality, neurological complications, or discharge disposition.

SARS-CoV-2 uses a human protease called furin to aid in cellular entry and its main protease (M(pro)) to achieve viral replication. By targeting these proteins, scientists are trying to identify phytoconstituents of medicinal plants as potential therapeutics for COVID-19. Therefore, our study was aimed to identify promising leads as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and furin using the phytocompounds reported to be isolated from Acacia pennata (L.) Willd. RESULTS: A total of 29 phytocompounds were reported to be isolated from A. pennata. Molecular docking simulation studies revealed 9 phytocompounds as having the top 5 binding affinities towards SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and furin. Among these phytocompounds, quercetin-3-O--L-rhamnopyranoside (C_18), kaempferol 3-O--L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1  4)--D-glucopyranoside (C_4), and isovitexin (C_5) have the highest drug score. However, C_18 and C_4 were not selected for further studies due to bioavailability issues and low synthetic accessibility. Based on binding affinity, molecular properties, drug-likeness, toxicity parameters, ligand interactions, bioavailability, synthetic accessibility, structureCactivity relationship, and comparative analysis of our experimental findings with other studies, C_5 was identified as the most promising phytocompound. C_5 interacted with the active site residues of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) (GLU166, ARG188, GLN189) and furin (ASN295, ARG298, HIS364, THR365). Many phytocompounds that interacted with these amino acid residues were reported by other studies as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and furin. The oxygen atom at position 18, the COH group at position 19, and the 6-C-glucoside were identified as the pharmacophores in isovitexin (also known as apigenin-6-C-glucoside). Other in-silico studies reported apigenin as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and apigenin-o-7-glucuronide was reported to show stable conformation during MD simulations with SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). CONCLUSION: The present study found isovitexin as the most promising phytocompound to potentially inhibit the cellular entry and viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. We also conclude that compounds having oxygen atom at position 18 (C-ring), COH group at position 19 (A-ring), and 6-C-glucoside attached to the A-ring at position 3 on a C(6)CC(3)CC(6) flavonoid scaffold could offer the best alternative to develop new leads against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Computational guided identification of potential leads from Acacia pennata (L.)

This study is conducted with a hypothesis that there is no difference in the quality of life and cost-effectiveness of mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients in HI and FI. Patients and Methods: A mixed-method study was conducted in Jodhpur in September 2020. The purposive sampling technique was used and data from 120 individuals admitted in HI and FI were collected. The information about the status and functioning of isolation facilities was collected from various sources. Multi-stakeholder interactions with 15 personnel engaged in managing isolation facilities were done. EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) which consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) was used to assess health-related quality of life. Results: The strength of HI strategy is demonstrated by its ability to provide psychological and social support with minimal logistic requirements but the issue of sufficient household infrastructure, adequate family and societal support for implementing this strategy is of concern. The strength of FI strategy includes its ability to provide support to patients who have issues of sufficient household infrastructure, adequate family and societal support, but this strategy poses a threat of increasing human resource constraints and financial load on the health system.

A higher-intensity approach to pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis may be warranted. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to determine if a patient specific, targeted-intensity pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis protocol incorporating severity of illness, weight, and biomarkers decreased incidence of thrombosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Included patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 and received thromboprophylaxis within 48 h of admission. Exclusion criteria included receipt of therapeutic anticoagulation prior to or within 24 h of admission, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, pregnancy, or incarceration. Per-protocol patients received thromboprophylaxis according to institutional protocol involving escalated doses of anticoagulants based upon severity of illness, total body weight, and biomarker thresholds. The primary outcome was thrombosis. Secondary outcomes included major bleeding, mortality, and identification of risk factors for thrombosis. Of 1189 patients screened, 803 were included in the final analysis. The median age was 54 (42C65) and 446 (55.5%) were male. Patients in the per-protocol group experienced significantly fewer thrombotic events (4.4% vs. 10.7%, p = 0.002), less major bleeding (3.1% vs. 9.6%, p < 0.001), and lower mortality (6.3% vs. 11.8%, p = 0.02) when compared to patients treated off-protocol. Significant predictors of thrombosis included mechanical ventilation and male sex.

Despite the development and deployment of highly effective antibody and vaccine countermeasures, rapidly-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations at key antigenic sites in the spike protein jeopardize their efficacy. Indeed, the recent emergence of the highly-transmissible B.1.1.529 Omicron variant is especially concerning because of the number of mutations, deletions, and insertions in the spike protein. Here, using a panel of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) corresponding to those with emergency use authorization (EUA) or in advanced clinical development by Vir Biotechnology (S309, the parent mAbs of VIR-7381), AstraZeneca (COV2-2196 and COV2-2130, the parent mAbs of AZD8895 and AZD1061), Regeneron (REGN10933 and REGN10987), Lilly (LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016), and Celltrion (CT-P59), we report the impact on neutralization of a prevailing, infectious B.1.1.529 Omicron isolate compared to a historical WA1/2020 D614G strain. Several highly neutralizing mAbs (LY-CoV555, LY-CoV016, REGN10933, REGN10987, and CT-P59) completely lost inhibitory activity against B.1.1.529 virus in both Vero-TMPRSS2 and Vero-hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, whereas others were reduced ([~]12-fold decrease, COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 combination) or minimally affected (S309).

Turbidity was measured on combinations of virus and each sediment type at low concentration to determine aggregation rates. Aggregation of sediment with virus occurred regardless of mineral type, and larger fraction of virus is expected to aggregate with increasing sediment concentration leading to higher deposition rates. The negatively charged sediments, aggregated with 6 (also negatively charged at neutral pH) at a faster rate than the positively charged sediments, yielding turbidity slopes of 4.94  10(?3) s(?1) and 7.50  10(?4) s(?1) for 6-montmorillonite and 6-illite aggregates, respectively, and 2.98  10(?5) s(?1) and 2.84  10(?5) s(?1), for 6-goethite and 6-kaolinite, respectively. This indicates that the interaction between sediments and virus is hydrophobic, rather than electrostatic. Large numbers of virions remained viable post-aggregation, despite the fragility of the viral envelope, indicating that small-sized aggregates, which may travel more readily through porous media, may pose an infection risk. The fraction of 6 that remained viable varied with sediment type, with montmorillonite-6 aggregates experiencing the greatest reduction in infectivity at 35%.

Results: 34 out of 193 symptomatic children had GI symptoms. They had lower median age and weight, a higher rate of fever, a longer length of stay and more hematological and biochemical abnormalities than patients without GI symptoms. There was no significant difference in chest CT findings or stool SARS-CoV-2 test positive percentages between the two groups.

To remain safe, individuals must take preventive measures. Health behavior theories suggest that perceived risk is a key determinant of engagement in preventive behavior. People often underestimate their risk for disease compared with similar others, a phenomenon known as optimistic bias (OB). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore how OB affected individuals' engagement in COVID-19 preventive behavior/intentions. Based on health behavior theories, this study considered risk perception and risk response as mediators of the relationship between OB and individuals preventive health behaviors and intentions. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional survey design. Online survey platforms were used to recruit U.S. adults. A total of 293 valid responses were included in the analyses. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship of OB to the respondents health information seeking intention and related behavioral outcomes. RESULTS: Results from the first regression model showed that OB was negatively related to risk perception. In other words, optimistically biased respondents perceived their risk of COVID-19 to be low. The second model demonstrated that perceived risk was related positively to affective responses to risk (e.g., worry and fear). That is, the lower their perceived risk of COVID-19, the less likely respondents were to feel anxiety and fear about this disease. Models 3 and 4 revealed positive relationships between risk response and respondents intentions and behaviors. Finally, the results supported a fully mediated pathway: OB  risk perception  risk response  information seeking intention and behavioral outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that by decreasing their perceived risk and subsequent responses, optimistic bias can undermine individuals motivation to take precautions. To reduce this bias, the actual risk of COVID-19 should be reinforced.","output":"Optimistic bias and preventive behavioral engagement in the context of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter spp. are a growing public health threat, yet are not nationally notifiable, and most states do not mandate reporting. Additionally, there are no standardized methods to detect Acinetobacter spp. colonization. METHODS An outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) was identified at a Utah skilled nursing facility with a ventilator unit (vSNF). An investigation was conducted to identify transmission modes in order to control spread of CRAB. Culture-based methods were used to identify patient colonization and environmental contamination in the facility. RESULTS Of the 47 patients screened, OXA-23-producing CRAB were detected in 10 patients (21%), with 7 patients (15%) having been transferred from out-of-state facilities. Of patients who screened positive, 60% did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of active infection by chart review. A total of 38 environmental samples were collected and CRAB was recovered from 37% of those samples. Whole genome sequencing analyses of patient and environmental isolates suggested repeated CRAB introduction into the facility and highlighted the role of shared equipment in transmission. CONCLUSION The investigation demonstrated this vSNF was an important reservoir for CRAB in the community and highlights the need for improved surveillance, strengthened infection control and inter-facility communication within and across states.","output":"Infection Control Response to an Outbreak of OXA-23 Carbapenemase-Producing Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in a Skilled Nursing Facility in Utah."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical activity (PA) decreased and sedentary behavior (SB) increased in the pediatric population during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We examined the effects of PA and SB on cardiopulmonary exercise performance in children, adolescents and young adults both with and without underling cardiac disease, and hypothesized that there will be a change in aerobic and physical working capacity during the pandemic. This was a single-center retrospective longitudinal cohort study in patients age 6C22 years who underwent serial maximal cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Metabolic variables were obtained; PA and SB data were extracted from clinic notes. A total of 122 patients (60% male) underwent serial exercise testing with a median age of 14 years at the first CPET. Predicted peak aerobic capacity significantly decreased among both females and males during the pandemic, even after adjusting for changes in somatic growth. There was no significant change in physical working capacity during the pandemic. Patients who were more aerobically fit experienced a greater decrease in aerobic capacity during the pandemic compared to those less fit. In conclusion, cardiopulmonary exercise performance, notably aerobic activity, decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic in children, adolescents and young adults compared to pre-pandemic values. This decline was most notable in those with the highest pre-pandemic aerobic capacity values and was independent of somatic growth or changes in BMI.

This study identified and analyzed LOX gene family members in the A. annua genome at the chromosomal level. Twenty LOX genes with various molecular weights, isoelectric points, and amino acid numbers were identified and named AaLOX, which were located in the cytoplasm or chloroplast. The average protein length of all AaLOX was 850 aa. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the AaLOX was divided into two major groups, 9-LOX and 13-LOX. The exon numbers ranged from 1 to 12, indicating that different AaLOX genes have different functions. The secondary structure was mainly composed of alpha helix and random coil, and the tertiary structure was similar for most AaLOX. Upstream promoter region analysis revealed that a large number of cis-acting elements were closely related to plant growth and development, light response, hormone, and other stress responses. Transcriptome data analysis of different tissues suggested that the gene family was differently expressed in the roots, stems, leaves, and flowers of two A. annua strains HAN1 and LQ9. qRT-PCR confirmed that AaLOX5 and AaLOX17 had the highest expression in flowers and leaves.

We assessed the preliminary effects of two physical therapist-led interventions that target two distinct mechanisms, abnormal movement patterns and sensory disturbances. Abnormal movement patterns, such as excessive hip adduction, may create altered mechanical stresses on hip joint structures, resulting in subsequent injury, pain and activity limitations. Movement pattern training (MoveTrain) may improve movement patterns and patient-reported outcomes, however further investigation is needed to be definitive. Sensory disturbances such as peripheral sensitization and central sensitization (aka nociplastic pain) may also contribute to pain persistence long after an initial injury. Joint mobilization (JtMob) is proposed to impart a neurophysiological response within the peripheral and central nervous system that results in pain reduction and improved mobility, yet the investigation of JtMob for the treatment of PAHD is limited. Methods: Patients, 18-40 years, with chronic PAHD were recruited. Baseline assessment included self-report questionnaire completion, clinical examination and quantitative sensory testing. The primary outcome was the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), a hip-specific, patient-reported outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included movement evoked pain assessed with a repetitive step down task and a repetitive deep squat task, and pain pressure threshold assessed at the anterior groin of the most bothersome hip (local pressure hypersensitivity) and the dominant thenar eminence (generalized pressure hypersensitivity). After baseline assessment, patients were randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups, MoveTrain or JtMob. Randomization was stratified by sex and HOOS Symptoms quartile, as determined from data collected during previous study. Treatment was provided by 4 experienced physical therapists (2 in each treatment arm) who were trained in standardized procedures. Treatment for both groups included 10 supervised sessions over 12 weeks and incorporated assessment of patient goals, patient education and instruction in a home program. Patient education focused on patient-specific tasks, such as work or fitness activities, identified by each patient to be symptom-producing. The goal of MoveTrain was to reduce stresses on the hip joint by optimizing the biomechanics of daily and patient-specific tasks. The key element of MoveTrain was task-specific instruction to correct abnormal movement patterns demonstrated during daily tasks and patient-specific tasks. For example, hip adduction and femoral internal rotation were minimized during step-down tasks. The home program included repeated practice of the modified tasks. Difficulty of the tasks were progressed based on each patients performance. The goal of JtMob was to reduce pain and improve pain-free motion of the hip. The key element of JtMob was manual techniques provided by the physical therapist. Specific criteria were used to determine the joint mobilization techniques and parameters used for each patient. The patients symptom report to each technique was monitored and if indicated, the technique modified according to our outlined procedures. The home program included flexibility exercises. Immediately after treatment completion, patients returned for follow up assessment. Data collected at baseline and post-treatment were analyzed with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using a generalized linear model where change is the dependent variable and baseline is the covariate. The adjusted immediate treatment effect was calculated by subtracting the least squares mean change between baseline and post for MoveTrain minus JtMob from the ANCOVA, and assesses the between-group difference in change after adjusting for baseline. Results: Thirty-three patients with PAHD were randomized. Demographics are provided in Table 1. Four patients did not complete treatment or post-treatment testing (3 due to COVID pandemic, 1 lost t follow up);7 patients did not complete post-treatment laboratory testing (due to COVID), but did complete post-treatment questionnaires. Both groups demonstrated clinically important within-group improvements in the HOOS subscales and movement evoked pain ratings after treatment (Table 2). No changes were noted in pain pressure threshold for either group. After adjusting for baseline, there were no between-group differences in change in outcomes when comparing MoveTrain and JtMob. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings suggest that 12 weeks of physical therapist-led intervention, including either MoveTrain or JtMob, may result in improvements in patient-reported pain and activities limitations.

The present study was to explore the association of prognostic nutritional index (PNI) with the severity of COVID-19 and its predictive value of the severe form of COVID-19. Methods: The clinical data were collected from 122 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the Sixth People's hospital of Wenzhou, which is the specialized infectious hospital affiliated to Wenzhou Central Hospital. PNI = serum albumin (g/L) + 5  total lymphocyte count (/nL). Results: The study population consisted of 105 patients with common form (86.1%) and 17 patients with severe form (13.9%) of COVID-19. PNI was significantly declined from patients with common to severe form of COVID-19 (P = 0.029) regardless of gender, age range, and body mass index (BMI)-category. After adjustment of gender, age, indexes of liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, and current smoking, PNI remained to be independently and inversely associated with the severity of COVID-19 (odd ratio = 0.797, P = 0.030). Receiver operating characteristic showed PNI had similar accuracy for prediction of severe form of COVID-19 compared to its combination with gender, age, and BMI (P = 0.402). PNI < 49 were defined as a cut-off value for predicting the severe form of COVID-19. Conclusions: Poorer nutritional status predisposed patients with COVID-19 to severe form.

For dust mite and cockroach allergens, there is a dose response relationship between domestic exposure and sensitization. Given that allergen provocation can induce many of the features of asthma, the findings strongly suggest that there is a causal relationship between allergen exposure in the home and asthma. However, it remains unclear at what time the critical exposure occurs (ie, in infancy or later) and what role allergen exposure has played in the increasing prevalence and severity of asthma. Objective evidence of an immune response to allergens is generally not present until after 2 years of age. Viral infections play several different roles in asthma in childhood. In infancy, respiratory syncytial virus infection can induce bronchiolitis and set up recurrent wheezing over the next few years. However, the risk factors for this are maternal smoking and small lungs at birth, rather than allergy. By contrast, the role of rhinovirus in precipitating attacks in children and young adults is strongly associated with allergy. Thus the likely scenario is that allergen exposure over the first few years of life induces sensitization (ie, T(H2) cells and IgE antibodies). Continuing exposure can maintain inflammation in the nose and lungs. However, many other factors contribute to wheezing such that there is no simple relationship between allergen exposure and asthma. Nonetheless, it is clear that the changes that have increased asthma have acted on allergic children.

Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples are generally collected for serial viral load screening of respiratory contagions, but temporal profiles of these samples are not completely clear in patients with COVID-19. We performed an observational cohort study at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, which involved 31 patients with confirmed COVID-19 with or without underlying diseases. We obtained samples from each patient, and serial viral load was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We found that the viral load in the sputum was inclined to be higher than samples obtained from the nasopharyngeal swab at disease presentation. Moreover, the viral load in the sputum decreased more slowly over time than in the nasopharyngeal group as the disease progressed. Interestingly, even when samples in the nasopharyngeal swab turned negative, it was commonly observed that patients with underlying diseases, especially hypertension and diabetes, remained positive for COVID-19 and required a longer period for the sputum samples to turn negative. These combined findings emphasize the importance of tracking sputum samples even in patients with negative tests from nasopharyngeal swabs, especially for those with underlying conditions.

We sought to evaluate the only post-polio syndrome specific self-management programme in the United Kingdom. Methods This was a retrospective study of patients who had completed a residential self-management programme led by a multi-disciplinary clinical team. Following a confirmed diagnosis of post-polio syndrome by rehabilitation and neurology specialists, patients were offered to participate in the programme. Although group-based, patients also received individually tailored support on physical exercise and fatigue management. Physical effects, physical function, psychosocial well-being measures were assessed at baseline and 6 months follow-up. Knowledge was tested at baseline and immediately following the programme. Statistical comparisons were made using paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test according to the data distribution. Results Over a period of 17 years, 214 participants (median age 61.3 years old, 63% female) attended 31 programmes. At 6 months the following post-polio syndrome specific symptoms improved significantly: fatigue, as measured by the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue scale [37.6 (7.1) vs. 34.2 (9.3), P=0.005]; and pain [15.0 (6.1) vs. 13.1 (6.7), P=0.001], atrophy [10.0 (8.0-12.0) vs. 9.0 (7.0-11.0), P=0.002] and bulbar symptoms [3.0 (1.0-5.0) vs. 2.0 (0-4.0), P=0.003] as measured by the Index of Post-polio Sequelae scale. Knowledge related to post-polio syndrome also significantly increased [14.0 (11.0-16.0) vs. 17.0 (16.0-19.0), P=0.001]. Participants were able to walk at a faster speed over 10 meters [0.77 (0.59-1.00) vs. 0.83 (0.67-1.10) m/s, P=0.003] and walked longer distances during the 2-minute walk test [76.9 (31.7) vs. 82.0 (38.4) m, P=0.029].

The optimal selection of interventions targeting the virus is unknown. Therefore, evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support specific treatment against COVID-19 is urgently needed. The use of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) might have a role in the treatment and symptomatic management of patients with COVID-19. It was aimed at providing an overview of the available evidence and ongoing trials concerning the effects of CHMs for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: This is a narrative review of relevant studies. Searches were conducted to identify documents published till April 22, 2020. Electronic databases, evidence-based collections, websites of relevant organizations, and trial registries were consulted. Results: A total of 25 guidelines on the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were identified. Four guidelines provided recommendations on the use of CHMs; these guidelines were developed in China and South Korea and were based on the consensus of experts exclusively. The remaining 21 guidelines provided no guidance on CHMs. No finished RCTs of CHMs for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 was found. According to the evidence evaluated in this review, a Cochrane review of CHMs for severe acute respiratory syndrome and five uncontrolled observational studies of the effects of CHMs in patients with COVID-19, the effects of CHMs for COVID-19 are unknown. A total of 52 ongoing clinical trials of CHM interventions for the treatment of COVID-19 were found. These trials will be carried out mostly in China (n = 51).

Computed tomography angiography was carried out 3-4 days after surgery. Early in the series, renal hilum was left unclamped and renorrhaphy was subsequently carried out (conventional unclamping technique). An early unclamping technique has been used since November 2013. RESULTS A total of 61 patients underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy with early unclamping, and 35 patients underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy with conventional unclamping. Ischemia time was significantly shorter in the early unclamping group (16.5 vs. 23.1 min; P < 0.01). The early unclamping group showed a significantly lower incidence of asymptomatic renal artery pseudoaneurysm relative to the conventional unclamping group (11.4% vs. 28.6%; P = 0.03). Multivariate analysis showed that the early unclamping technique was a significant independent factor in reducing the risk of renal artery pseudoaneurysm (hazard ratio 0.27; P = 0.01).

Now, an increasing number of patients report postacute neurological sequelae, known as long COVID  even those without specific neurological manifestations in the acute phase. METHODS: Dynamic brain changes are crucial for a better understanding and early prevention of long COVID. Here, we explored the cross-sectional and longitudinal consequences of COVID-19 on the brain in 34 discharged patients without neurological manifestations. Gray matter morphology, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and volumes of white matter tracts were investigated using advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques to explore dynamic brain changes from 3 to 10 months after discharge. RESULTS: Overall, the differences of cortical thickness were dynamic and finally returned to the baseline. For cortical CBF, hypoperfusion in severe cases observed at 3 months tended to recover at 10 months. Subcortical nuclei and white matter differences between groups and within subjects showed various trends, including recoverable and long-term unrecovered differences. After a 10-month recovery period, a reduced volume of nuclei in severe cases was still more extensive and profound than that in mild cases. CONCLUSION: Our study provides objective neuroimaging evidence for the coexistence of recoverable and long-term unrecovered changes in 10-month effects of COVID-19 on the brain. The remaining potential abnormalities still deserve public attention, which is critically important for a better understanding of long COVID and early clinical guidance toward complete recovery.

OBJECTIVES: A 13-week randomized trial intervention utilizing iRT was conducted on older adults with NCD. We explored predictors of participants with positive and non-positive intervention responses using responder analysis, an analytic strategy that focuses on contributors to intervention response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Re-analysis of a published single-blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial on 251 older adult residents with NCD from residential facilities across Portugal. Participants received 13 weeks of biweekly iRT (26 sessions) or treatment/programming as usual. Outcomes included global cognition (Minimental State Examination), memory (MAT), executive functioning (FAB), depressive symptoms (GDS-15), and QoL (QoL-AD). RESULTS: There were more responders in the intervention than the control group on all five criteria, with significant differences for cognition (p = 0.001; f = 0.202; NNT = 5) and memory (p = 0.004; f = 0.184; NNT = 6). At baseline, intervention responders vs non-responders had: higher QoL-AD scores (30.23 vs 25.57; p < 0.001; d = -0.774) for cognition; lower FAB scores (1.41 vs -2.12; p < 0.001; d = 0.928) for executive functioning; higher GDS-15 scores for the depressive symptoms (7.57 vs 4.91; p < 0.001; d = -0.845), and for QoL (6.81 vs 5.33; p = 0.013; d = -0.443).

Thus, an alternative to the self versus non-self recognition model has been provided. The model, which suggests that the immune system discriminates dangerous from safe molecules, has established the basis for the future designation of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), a term that was coined by Walter G. Land, Seong, and Matzinger. The pathological importance of DAMPs is barely somewhere else evident as in the posttraumatic or post-surgical inflammation and regeneration. Since DAMPs have been identified to trigger specific immune responses and inflammation, which is not necessarily detrimental but also regenerative, it still remains difficult to describe their friend or foe role in the posttraumatic immunogenicity and healing process. DAMPs can be used as biomarkers to indicate and/or to monitor a disease or injury severity, but they also may serve as clinically applicable parameters for optimized indication of the timing for, i.e., secondary surgeries.

Thus, in this review, we focus on the recent literature dealing with the pathophysiological importance of DAMPs after traumatic injury.

Adenoviral (Ad) vectors, although highly efficient in liver gene transfer, have proven to be limited for pulmonary gene transfer with respect to efficiency, in part because of difficulty in assuring significant residence time in the lung and/or paucity of receptors for adenovirus on the endothelium. A recent study has shown that the use of a bispecific antibody to endothelial cells and Ad vectors efficiently redirects Ad vectors to pulmonary endothelium and improves gene expression in the lung. In this study, we report that pulmonary gene transfer by Ad vectors can also be improved significantly via the use of cationic liposomes. Preinjection of cationic liposomes followed by adenovirus led to a significant increase in the level of gene expression in the lung. The improvement in pulmonary gene transfer was associated with a decrease in the level of gene expression in the liver. Gene expression in the lung lasted for up to 2 weeks. This protocol, together with genetic modification of adenovirus, may prove to be useful for pulmonary gene transfer for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. This method may also be extended to pulmonary gene transfer using other types of viral vectors via vascular route.","output":"Redirecting adenovirus to pulmonary endothelium by cationic liposomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a huge challenge for health-care systems worldwide.

We performed a retrospective evaluation of all adult (age  18 years) ED patients enrolled in the AKTIN registry for the year 2019. Primary outcome was LOS for the whole cohort; secondary outcomes included LOS stratified by (1) patient-related, (2) organizational-related and (3) structure-related factors. Overall, 304,606 patients from 12 EDs were included. Average LOS for all patients was 3 h 28 min (95% CI 3 h 27 minC3 h 29 min). Regardless of other variables, patients admitted to hospital stayed 64 min longer than non-admitted patients. LOS increased with patients age, was shorter for walk-in patients compared to medical referral, and longer for non-trauma presenting complaints. Relevant differences were also found for acuity level, day of the week, and emergency care levels. We identified different factors influencing the duration of LOS in the ED. Total LOS was dependent on patient-related factors (age), disease-related factors (presentation complaint and triage level), and organizational factors (weekday and admitted/non-admitted status).

In England this led to a policy proposal and 100million (US$130million) of funding for all emergency departments to have co-located GP services. However, there is a lack of evidence for whether such service models are effective and safe. We examined diagnostic errors reported in patient safety incident reports to develop theories to explain how and why they occurred to inform potential priority areas for improvement and inform qualitative data collection at case study sites to further refine the theories. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods design using exploratory descriptive analysis to identify the most frequent and harmful sources of diagnostic error and thematic analysis, incorporating realist methodology to refine theories from an earlier rapid realist review, to describe how and why the events occurred and could be mitigated, to inform improvement recommendations. We used two UK data sources: Coroners reports to prevent future deaths (30.7.13C14.08.18) and National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) patient safety incident reports (03.01.05C30.11.15). RESULTS: Nine Coroners reports (from 1347 community and hospital reports, 2013C2018) and 217 NRLS reports (from 13 million, 2005C2015) were identified describing diagnostic error related to GP services in or alongside emergency departments. Initial theories to describe potential priority areas for improvement included: difficulty identifying appropriate patients for the GP service; under-investigation and misinterpretation of diagnostic tests; and inadequate communication and referral pathways between the emergency and GP services. High-risk presentations included: musculoskeletal injury, chest pain, headache, calf pain and sick children. CONCLUSION: Initial theories include the following topics as potential priority areas for improvement interventions and evaluation to minimise the risk of diagnostic errors when GPs work in or alongside emergency departments: a standardised initial assessment with streaming guidance based on local service provision; clinical decision support for high-risk conditions; and standardised computer systems, communication and referral pathways between emergency and GP services.

To mitigate spread, healthcare systems have been cohorting patients to limit contacts between uninfected patients and potentially infected patients or healthcare workers (HCWs). A major challenge in managing the pandemic is the presence of currently asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals capable of transmitting the virus, who could introduce COVID-19 into uninfected cohorts. The optimal combination of personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and other approaches to prevent these events is unclear, especially in light of ongoing limited resources. METHODS: Using stochastic simulations with a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered dynamic model, we quantified and compared the impacts of PPE use, patient and HCWs surveillance testing and subcohorting strategies. RESULTS: In the base case without testing or PPE, the healthcare system was rapidly overwhelmed, and became a net contributor to the force of infection. We found that effective use of PPE by both HCWs and patients could prevent this scenario, while random testing of apparently asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals on a weekly basis was less effective. We also found that even imperfect use of PPE could provide substantial protection by decreasing the force of infection. Importantly, we found that creating smaller patient/HCW-interaction subcohorts can provide additional resilience to outbreak development with limited resources. CONCLUSION: These findings reinforce the importance of ensuring adequate PPE supplies even in the absence of testing and provide support for strict subcohorting regimens to reduce outbreak potential in healthcare institutions.","output":"Evaluating the contributions of strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the healthcare setting: a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among infants and young children.

In this cross sectional study we used nasopharyngeal samples collected from hospitalized children diagnosed with severe CAP in accordance with WHO criteria between June 2013 and May 2014 to determine the causes of infection. The samples were analyzed for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) types 1,2 and 3, adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza viruses types A and B and coronavirus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Of 102 cases of severe CAP, samples were obtained in 91 cases and 48 (52.7%) were positive for respiratory viruses. The most common viruses were RSV (n = 22; 45.8%), rhinovirus (n = 11; 22.9%) and adenovirus (n = 9; 18.7%). Patients were aged 1 month to 4 years 5 months, with a median age of 1 year 1 month. Thirty-seven (77.1%) were male. Asthma was the most common co-morbidity affecting 5 (10.4%) of the 48 cases with an identified virus. The peak prevalence occurred during October (n = 17).

PATIENTS: Patients admitted between October 1, 2019, and October 1, 2020, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (N = 314) or influenza PCR (N = 82) within 2 weeks of admission were compared with inpatients without positive SARS-CoV-2 or influenza tests during the study period (N = 14,332). METHODS: National Healthcare Safety Network definitions were used to identify infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVACs), probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (PVAP), bloodstream infections (BSIs), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). A multiple logistic regression model was used to control for likely confounders. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had significantly higher rates of IVAC and PVAP compared to controls, with adjusted odds ratios of 4.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7C13.9) and 10.4 (95 % CI, 2.1C52.1), respectively.

Our objective was to provide a qualitative exploration of facilitators and barriers to: 1) implementing high-quality telehealth and 2) navigating reimbursement for telehealth services. METHODS: We used data from the 2020 State of Care CF Program Survey (n=286 U.S. care programs) administered in August-September to identify two cohorts of programs, with variation in telehealth quality (n=12 programs) and reimbursement (n=8 programs). We conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews with CF program directors and coordinators in December 2020, approximately 9 months from onset of the pandemic. We used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to identify facilitators and barriers of implementation, and inductive thematic analysis to identify facilitators and barriers of reimbursement. RESULTS: Factors differentiating programs with greater and lower perceived telehealth quality included telehealth characteristics (perceived advantage over in-person care, cost, platform quality); external influences (needs and resources of those served by the CF program), characteristics of the CF program (compatibility with workflows, relative priority, available resources); characteristics of team members (individual stage of change), and processes for implementation (engaging patients and teams). Reimbursement barriers included documentation to optimize billing; reimbursement of multi-disciplinary team members, remote monitoring, and telephone-only telehealth; and lower volume of patients. CONCLUSIONS: A number of factors are associated with successful implementation and reimbursement of telehealth. Future efforts should provide guidance and incentives that support telehealth delivery and infrastructure, share best practices across CF programs, and remove barriers.","output":"Barriers and facilitators to implementing telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative analysis of interviews with cystic fibrosis care team members()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Social isolation is strongly associated with poor mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social restrictions disrupted young people's social interactions and resulted in several periods during which school closures necessitated online learning. We hypothesise that digitally excluded young people would demonstrate greater deterioration in their mental health than their digitally connected peers during this time. Methods: We analysed representative mental health data from a sample of UK 10-15-year-olds (N = 1387); Understanding Society collected the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in 2017-19 and thrice during the pandemic (July 2020, November 2020 and March 2021). We employed cross-sectional methods and longitudinal latent growth curve modelling to describe trajectories of adolescent mental health for participants with and without access to a computer or a good internet connection for schoolwork. Outcomes: Adolescent mental health had a quadratic trajectory during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest mean Total Difficulties score around December 2020. The worsening and recovery of mental health during the pandemic was greatly pronounced among those without access to a computer, although we did not find evidence for a similar effect among those without a good internet connection. Interpretation: Digital exclusion, as indicated by lack of access to a computer, is a tractable risk factor that likely compounds other adversities facing children and young people during periods of social isolation.

The interferon-inducible 2,5-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetases (OAS) and ribonuclease L (RNase L) are components of a potent host antiviral pathway. We previously showed that murine coronavirus (MHV) accessory protein ns2, a 2H phosphoesterase superfamily member, is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) that cleaves 2,5-oligoadenylates (2-5A) thereby preventing activation of RNase L (Zhao et al., Cell Host and Microbe 11:607C16, 2012). The PDE activity of ns2 is required for viral replication in macrophages and for hepatitis. Here, we will demonstrate that group A rotavirus, the primary cause of severe, dehydrating gastroenteritis in children worldwide, encodes an homologous and similar PDE. The VP3 carboxy-terminal domain (VP3-CTD) shares sequence and predicted structural homology with ns2, including two catalytic His-x-Thr/Ser motifs. Recombinant VP3-CTD also demonstrated 2,5-PDE activity, which cleaved 2-5A in vitro. In addition, its expression in cells depleted 2-5A levels induced by OAS activation with poly (rI):poly (rC), preventing RNase L activation. In the context of recombinant chimeric MHV expressing inactive ns2, the VP3-CTD restored the ability to replicate efficiently in macrophages or in the livers of infected mice, while chimeras expressing inactive VP3-CTD (H718A or H798R) were attenuated. Also, chimeric viruses expressing active ns2 or VP3, but not mutant ns2 or VP3, were able to protect ribosomal RNA from RNase L-mediated degradation. Thus, VP3-CTD is a 2,5-PDE able to functionally substitute for ns2 in the context of MHV infection. Remarkably, therefore, two disparate RNA viruses encode proteins with homologous 2,5-PDEs that antagonize innate immunity. In addition, based on sequence and predicted structural homology with MHV ns2 and rotavirus VP3, several other viruses have been identified that encode proteins with predicted 2,5-PDE activities.","output":"244 Homologous 2,5-phosphodiesterases from disparate RNA viruses antagonize antiviral innate immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Participatory Design (PD) C whose inclusive benefits are broadly recognised in design C can be very challenging, especially when involving children. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to further barriers to PD with such groups. One key barrier is the advent of social distancing and government-imposed social restrictions due to the additional risks posed for e.g. children and families vulnerable to COVID-19. This disrupts traditional in-person PD (which involves close socio-emotional and often physical collaboration between participants and researchers). However, alongside such barriers, we have identified opportunities for new and augmented approaches to PD across distributed geographies, backgrounds, ages and abilities. We examine Distributed Participatory Design (DPD) as a solution for overcoming these new barriers, during and after COVID-19. We offer new ways to think about DPD, and unpick some of its ambiguities. We do this through an examination of the results from an online Interaction Design and Children (IDC) 2020 workshop. The workshop included 24 researchers with experience in PD, in a range of forms, in the context of children. Initially designed to take place in-person and to include a design session with children in a school in London, the workshop was adjusted to an online format in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the adverse circumstances, we discovered that the unexpected change of the workshop style from in-person to online was an opportunity and an impetus for us to address the new PD challenges of the global pandemic. In this article we contribute seven themes which were revealed during our IDC workshop, providing guidance on important areas for consideration when planning and conducting PD in the context of a global pandemic. With a focus on the term distributed, we offer insights on how DPD can be applied and explored in these circumstances with child participants. We conclude with a number of lessons learned, highlighting the opportunities and challenges DPD offers to enable continued co-design during a global pandemic. In particular, DPD provides greater access for some populations to be involved in PD, but technical and social challenges must be addressed.","output":"Distributing participation in design: Addressing challenges of a global pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, arguably the new millennium's most trying test of state capacity, caught the world off guard. In order to contain the spread of the virus, governments had to respond quickly and comprehensively: strict lockdowns, movement restrictions, masks, and social distancing - measures that draw not only on public resources but also on the buy-in and cooperation of civil society. Citizen compliance and cooperation are founded on trust in government institutions. As such, the pandemic has also been a stress test for trust in government. Trust in government is a crucial determinant of effective crisis management, and governments lacking such trust suffer a profound disadvantage. In many instances, strict lockdown measures were accompanied by an expansion of executive powers. This creates power imbalances, or aggravates existing ones, and poses a threat to trust in government. High levels of vaccine hesitancy, a looming recession, and expectations of government support require ongoing efforts to build and ensure trust in government. Even though many African countries seem to have gotten through the coronavirus crisis relatively well until now, vaccine hesitancy and looming recessions pose ongoing challenges for trust in government. Hence, governments must actively engage in building trust as they prepare for future crises. The Ebola epidemic has shown that a bottom-up approach entailing collaboration with pre-existing networks and institutions at the local level can facilitate this process. In contexts where executive powers have been expanded, the evolution of this process needs to be carefully monitored.","output":"Challenging Trust in Government: COVID in Sub-Saharan Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in 2014C2016 in West Africa was the largest on record and provided an opportunity for large clinical trials and accelerated efforts to develop an effective and safe preventative vaccine. Multiple questions regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of EVD vaccines remain unanswered. To address these gaps in the evidence base, the Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines (PREVAC) trial was designed. This paper describes the design, methods, and baseline results of the PREVAC trial and discusses challenges that led to different protocol amendments. METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial of three vaccine strategies against the Ebola virus in healthy volunteers 1 year of age and above. The three vaccine strategies being studied are the rVSVG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine, with and without a booster dose at 56 days, and the Ad26.ZEBOV,MVA-FN-Filo vaccine regimen with Ad26.ZEBOV given as the first dose and the MVA-FN-Filo vaccination given 56 days later. There have been 4 versions of the protocol with those enrolled in Version 4.0 comprising the primary analysis cohort. The primary endpoint is based on the antibody titer against the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein measured 12 months following the final injection. RESULTS: From April 2017 to December 2018, a total of 5002 volunteers were screened and 4789 enrolled. Participants were enrolled at 6 sites in four countries (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali). Of the 4789 participants, 2560 (53%) were adults and 2229 (47%) were children. Those < 18 years of age included 549 (12%) aged 1 to 4 years, 750 (16%) 5 to 11 years, and 930 (19%) aged 12C17 years. At baseline, the median (25th, 75th percentile) antibody titer to Ebola virus glycoprotein for 1090 participants was 72 (50, 116) EU/mL. DISCUSSION: The PREVAC trial is evaluatingplacebo-controlledtwo promising Ebola candidate vaccines in advanced stages of development. The results will address unanswered questions related to short- and long-term safety and immunogenicity for three vaccine strategies in adults and children.

Among them, P4A1 interacts directly with and covers majority of the Receptor Binding Motif of the Spike Receptor-Binding Domain, shown by high-resolution complex structure analysis. We further demonstrate the binding and neutralizing activities of P4A1 against wild type and mutant Spike proteins or pseudoviruses. P4A1 was subsequently engineered to reduce the potential risk for Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of infection and to extend its half-life. The engineered antibody exhibits an optimized pharmacokinetic and safety profile, and it results in complete viral clearance in a rhesus monkey model of COVID-19 following a single injection.

There have been congregating studies of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a disease that mainly attacks the lungs but also has mystifying effects on the heart, kidneys and brain. Researchers are also gathering information to ascertain why people are dying of COVID-19, whether it is solely a respiratory disorder, a coagulation disorder or multi-organ failure. Alterations in laboratory parameters like lactate, ferritin and albumin have been established as risk factors and are associated with outcomes, yet none have not been sub stantiated with a scientific biochemical rationale. SARSCoV-2 affects the alveolar type II epithelial cells which significantly disturbs its surfactant homeostasis, deprives Na,K-ATPase of ATP, thereby disturbing the alveolar lining fluid which then gradually decreases the alveolar gaseous exchange initiating the intracellular hypoxic conditions. This activates AMP-activated kinase, which further inhibits Na,K-ATPase, which can progressively cause respiratory distress syndrome. The virus may infect endothelial cell (EC) which, being less energetic, cannot withstand the huge energy requirement towards viral replication. There - fore glycolysis, the prime energy generating pathway, must be mandatorily upregulated. This can be achieved by Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). However, HIF-1 also activates transcription of von Willebrand factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and suppresses the release of thrombomodulin. This in turn sets off the coagulation cascade that can lead to in-situ pulmonary thrombosis and micro clots. The proposed HIF-1 hypothesis justifies various features, biochemical alteration, laboratory as well as autopsy findings such as respiratory distress syndrome, increased blood ferritin and lactate levels, hypoalbuminemia, endothelial invasion, in-situ pulmonary thrombosis and micro clots, and multi-organ failure in COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infecting endothelial cells, biochemical alterations, autopsy findings and outcomes in COVID-19, suggest role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a major public health concern.

Second, even assuming that healthcare workers do have a professional obligation to take on themselves the risks, payments for risk would create fair working conditions by avoiding exploitation. Third, payments for risk would make it more likely that public healthcare systems can discharge their institutional responsibility to provide healthcare in circumstances where healthcare workers may otherwise (perhaps legitimately) opt out. Fourth, payments for risk would guarantee an efficient healthcare system in pandemic situations.

The recently concluded &#945;-ketoamide ligand-bound X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6Y2F) from Zhang et al. has revealed the potential inhibitor binding mechanism and the molecular determinants responsible for substrate binding. METHODS: For the study, we have targeted the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for the screening of FDA approved antiviral drugs and carried out molecular docking based virtual screening. Further molecular dynamic simulation studies of the top three selected drugs carried out to investigated for their binding affinity and stability in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site. The phylogenetic analysis was also performed to know the relatedness between the SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from different countries. RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome reveals that the virus is closely related to the Bat-SL-CoV and does not exhibit any divergence at the genomic level. Molecular docking studies revealed that among the 77 drugs, screened top ten drugs shows good binding affinities, whereas the top three drugs: Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Tipranavir, and Raltegravir were undergone for molecular dynamics simulation studies for their conformational stability in the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein.

Smart contracts, based on blockchain technology, can be a legitimate approach for addressing these challenges. Smart contracts define rules and penalties in an agreement, enforce those rules, and render them irrevocable.

This has affected service delivery among all medical disciplines in India including neurorehabilitation services. Aims and Objectives: The aims and objectives of the study were to assess the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on neurorehabilitation services across India. Methodology: A prospective nationwide survey study was undertaken by the Indian Federation of Neurorehabilitation during the pandemic. A questionnaire was prepared using Google forms software consisting of four sections: demography, neurorehabilitation practice before COVID-19 pandemic, neurorehabilitation practice during COVID-19 pandemic, and continuing medical education during COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Responses (872) were received from neurorehabilitation professionals across the country out of which 2.2% professionals did not give consent for participating in the survey. Participants (36.6%) were practicing traditional or independent referral basis rehabilitation, while 63.4% participants were practicing multidisciplinary rehabilitation. On an average, respective units were conducting 500C750 therapy sessions per month. Majority of the rehabilitation units in India lacked a physiatrist, rehabilitation nurse, music therapist, cognitive therapist, and urologist. Approximately 80% of the rehabilitation units have the basic rehabilitation modalities and advance technology was present in only 20% of the rehabilitation units. During COVID-19 pandemic, 19.5% centers were providing elective services, 50.3% emergency services, 15.6% new outpatient services, and 22.7% were providing follow-up outpatient services. Centers (51.5%) were providing telerehabilitation services for neurological conditions during the times of COVID-19 pandemic. Professionals (61.1%) providing telerehabilitation were working from home. Among the patients who needed neurorehabilitation, 28% were doing their exercises independently, 31% were supervised by caregivers, 17% were supervised by therapists, and 24% were not receiving any therapy. Participants (95.5%) wanted to receive more training in the field of neurorehabilitation. The participants utilized webinars (71%), online courses (22%), case discussion forums (19%), panel discussions (13%), and literature search (8%) during COVID-19 pandemic to continue education. Conclusion: The study reflects the situation of neurorehabilitation service delivery in India during the pandemic as the respondents were from all parts of the country and included most components of the neurorehabilitation team. Neurorehabilitation services were severely affected across India during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tele-neurorehabilitation has emerged as a new service delivery model during the pandemic.

A secondary objective was to explore if GPs' individual characteristics and type of practice determined their adaptation. DESIGN: Observational study using an online questionnaire. Organisational changes were measured by a main question and detailed in two specific outcomes. To identify which GPs' characteristics impacted organisational changes, successive multivariate logistic modelling was performed. First, we identified the GPs' characteristics related to organisational changes with a univariate analysis. Then, we tested the adjusted associations between this variable and the following GPs' characteristics: age, gender and type of practice. SETTING: The questionnaire was administered online between 14 March and 21 March 2020. Practitioners were recruited by email using the contact lists of different French scientific GP societies. PARTICIPANTS: The target population was GPs currently practising in France (n=46 056). We obtained a total of 7481 responses. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome: Proportion of GPs who adapted their practice. Secondary outcome: GPs' characteristics related to organisational changes. RESULTS: Among the 7481 responses, 5425 were complete and were analysed. 3849 GPs (70.9%) changed their activity, 3605 GPs (66.5%) increased remote consultations and 2315 GPs (42.7%) created a specific pathway for probable patients with COVID-19. Among the 3849 GPs (70.9%) who changed their practice, 3306 (91.7%) gave more answers by phone, 996 (27.6%) by email and 1105 (30.7%) increased the use of video consultations. GPs working in multi-professional group practices were more likely to have changed their activity since the beginning of the epidemic wave than GPs working in mono-professional group or single medical practices (adjusted OR: 1.32, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.56, p=0.001).

Despite widespread usage of anti-CD20 antibodies for B cell depletion therapies, the biological function of their target remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CD20 controls the nanoscale organization of receptors on the surface of resting B lymphocytes. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of CD20 in resting B cells resulted in relocalization and interaction of the IgM-class B cell antigen receptor with the coreceptor CD19. This receptor rearrangement led to a transient activation of B cells, accompanied by the internalization of many B cell surface marker proteins. Reexpression of CD20 restored the expression of the B cell surface proteins and the resting state of Ramos B cells. Similarly, treatment of Ramos or naive human B cells with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab induced nanoscale receptor rearrangements and transient B cell activation in vitro and in vivo. A departure from the resting B cell state followed by the loss of B cell identity of CD20-deficient Ramos B cells was accompanied by a PAX5 to BLIMP-1 transcriptional switch, metabolic reprogramming toward oxidative phosphorylation, and a shift toward plasma cell development.

Methods: This study covered the period from January 14 to March 1, 2020. From February 24 on, the supine position method and the protective face screen were used to collect nasopharyngeal swabs, before which, the nasopharyngeal swabs were collected by sitting position method. All the patients were diagnosed with suspected/confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infection, who were admitted from February 19 on, before which, the nasopharyngeal swabs were collected outside the hospital. (1) Thirty-four operators meeting the inclusion criteria of the study were recruited in this retrospective cohort study. They were grouped according to the collection method of nasopharyngeal swabs. Sixteen operators of Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital who used the supine position method and the protective face screen were included in supine position method+protective face screen group (15 males and 1 female, aged 34-49 years); 18 operators (12 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University), 1 from Wuhan Jiangxia Mobile Cabin Hospital, 5 from the East District of People's Hospital of Wuhan University) who used the traditional sitting position method were included in sitting position method group (2 males and 16 females, aged 25-49 years). In supine position method+protective face screen group, when collecting sample, the patient lay flat and wore a special protective face screen for nasopharyngeal swab sampling, with neck slightly extending and face turning to the opposite side of the operator about 10. The self-designed questionnaire was used to investigate the cooperation, the incidence of nausea, coughing, sneezing, and struggling of patients evaluated by the operators, the operation time of single sampling, the fear of operation and the perceived exposure risk of operators of the two groups. (2) Sixty-five patients (22 males and 43 females, aged 25-91 years) admitted to Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital who successively received the sitting position method and supine position method+protective face screen for nasopharyngeal swabs sampling and with complete nucleic acid detection results were included. The positive rates of nucleic acid detection by the two sampling methods of nasopharyngeal swabs of the patients were statistically analyzed. (3) Forty-one patients who could express their feelings accurately were selected from the above 65 patients (12 males and 29 females, aged 27-83 years). The comfort of patients in the process of sampling by the two methods was investigated. (4) Thirty-four patients (10 males and 24 females, aged 25-83 years) with two or more consecutive negative results of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by sitting position method were selected from the above 65 patients. The positive rate of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swab of patients by supine position method+protective face screen, i.e. negative to positive rate was statistically analyzed. Data were statistically analyzed with Wilcoxon's sign rank test, t test, and chi-square test. Results: (1) The cooperation score of patients evaluated by the operators in supine position method+protective face screen group was significantly higher than that in sitting position method group (Z=-4.928, P<0.01), the incidence of nausea, choking cough, sneezing, and struggling of patients evaluated by the operators, and the fear of operation score and the perceived exposure risk score of operators were significantly lower than those of sitting position method group (Z=-5.071, -5.046, -4.095, -4.397, -4.174, -5.049, P<0.01), and the operation time of single sampling was significantly longer than that of sitting position method group (t=23.17, P<0.01). (2) The positive rate of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by supine position method+protective face screen was 60.00% (39/65), which was obviously higher than 41.54% (27/65) by sitting position method ((2)=4.432, P<0.05). (3) The comfort score of the 41 patients during nasopharyngeal swabs sampling by supine position method+protective face screen was significantly higher than that by sitting position method (Z=-5.319, P<0.01). (4) Of the 34 patients with two or more consecutive negative results of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by sitting position method, the rate of negative to positive of nucleic acid detection was 26.47% (9/34) after sampling by supine position method+protective face screen. Conclusions: Compared with the traditional sitting position method, detection of 2019 novel coronavirus nucleic acids of nasopharyngeal swabs collected by supine method combined with protective face screen is worth promoting, because of its better comfort of patients, low exposure risk for operators, in addition to reducing in the false negative result to some extent, which may help reduce false recurrence of discharged patients.","output":"[Clinical application effect of modified nasopharyngeal swab sampling for 2019 novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The immune system establishes during the prenatal period from distinct waves of stem and progenitor cells and continuously adapts to the needs and challenges of early postnatal and adult life.

When an increase/decrease was communicated, especially a large one, it was difficult to understand if it was due to a change in the epidemic evolution or if it was a fluctuation due to other reasons, such as an increase in the number of swabs or a delay in the swab processing. The aim of this paper is both to model the main trend of the outbreak evolution in the number of confirmed cases and to describe the daily fluctuations strongly dependent on the daily number of swabs. For our analysis, we propose a nonlinear asymmetric diffusion model, which includes information on the daily number of swabs, to describe daily fluctuations in the number of confirmed cases in addition to the main trend of the outbreak evolution. The proposed model is found to be the more efficient for prediction, as compared to 6 already existing models, including the SIRD and the logistic models.

Controlling transmission in healthcare settings is critical for reducing COVID-19 mortality. AIM: We aimed to describe the epidemiology and characteristics of healthcare-associated COVID-19 outbreaks and outbreak-related cases. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the investigation data of each healthcare-associated outbreak that occurred between 15th January 2020 and 31st July 2021 in Taiwan. We categorized the confirmed outbreak-associated cases as HCW, patient companion, and patient, and compared the characteristics of the confirmed cases among these categories. FINDINGS: A total of 54 healthcare-associated COVID-19 outbreaks including 512 confirmed cases were reported. The median number of affected cases per outbreak was 6 (interquartile range [IQR], 2C12), and the median outbreak duration was 12 days (IQR, 4.3C17.0). Only 5.7% and 0.2% of all confirmed cases had partial and full vaccinations, respectively. Most of the outbreaks (90%, 48/54) occurred in May and June 2021. HCW cases accounted for 19.5%, companion cases for 41.2%, and patients for 39.3% of the total cases. Patients were significantly older (72 years; IQR, 61C83) and had higher 30-day all-cause mortality (37.4%) than HCWs (41 years; IQR, 28C58; 0%) and companions (52 years; IQR, 42C62; 1%). CONCLUSION: Healthcare-associated COVID-19 outbreaks have a critical impact on patients. Nevertheless, two-thirds of cases in the healthcare-associated outbreaks in this study comprised HCWs and companions.

Besides yield, the effects of heat stress on fruit quality traits remain poorly characterised. In tomato, insights into how fruits regulate cellular metabolism in response to heat stress could contribute to the development of heat-tolerant varieties, without detrimental effects on quality. In the present study, the changes occurring in wild type tomato fruits after exposure to transient heat stress have been elucidated at the transcriptome, cellular and metabolite level. An impact on fruit quality was evident as nutritional attributes changed in response to heat stress. Fruit carotenogenesis was affected, predominantly at the stage of phytoene formation, although altered desaturation/isomerisation arose during the transient exposure to high temperatures. Plastidial isoprenoid compounds showed subtle alterations in their distribution within chromoplast sub-compartments. Metabolite profiling suggests limited effects on primary/intermediary metabolism but lipid remodelling was evident. The heat-induced molecular signatures included the accumulation of sucrose and triacylglycerols, and a decrease in the degree of membrane lipid unsaturation, which influenced the volatile profile.

Fourteen patients have recovered, while seven passed away. There were no differences between them in respect to clinical or laboratory parameters monitored. However, protein adducts of the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) were higher in the plasma of the deceased patients, while total antioxidant capacity was below the detection limit for the majority of sera samples in both groups. Moreover, levels of the HNE-protein adducts were constant in the plasma of the deceased patients, while in survivors, they have shown prominent and dynamic variations, suggesting that survivors had active oxidative stress response mechanisms reacting to COVID-19 aggression, which were not efficient in patients who died. Immunohistochemistry revealed the abundant presence of HNE-protein adducts in the lungs of deceased patients indicating that HNE is associated with the lethal outcome. It seems that HNE was spreading from the blood vessels more than being a consequence of pneumonia. Due to the limitations of the relatively small number of patients involved in this study, further research on HNE and antioxidants is needed. This might allow a better understanding of COVID-19 and options for utilizing antioxidants by personalized, integrative biomedicine approach to prevent the onset of HNE-mediated vitious circle of lipid peroxidation in patients with aggressive inflammatory diseases.","output":"Preliminary Findings on the Association of the Lipid Peroxidation Product 4-Hydroxynonenal with the Lethal Outcome of Aggressive COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Previously we reported bilateral lung transplantation is the last treatment option for irrecoverable COVID ARDS and post-COVID fibrosis. Now we report our first single lung transplant (SLTx) for post-COVID fibrosis. Case Report A 59-year-old, never-smoker, female, with history of obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, presented to an outside hospital with COVID-19, shortness of breath, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR) (Figure 1a). She was admitted to the intensive care unit, never requiring intubation, for an overall 40-day hospitalization. At discharge, she had shortness of breath with minimal activity and required continuous oxygen (O2) therapy. One year later she presented to our institution for an outpatient lung transplant evaluation for her post-COVID fibrosis. Her cardiac work up was unremarkable, with the absence of pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram and right heart catheterization. Computed Tomography of her chest showed only significant fibrosis in the upper lobes with traction bronchiectasis and volume loss (Figure 1c). Her lung ventilation perfusion scan showed grossly normal perfusion to both lungs. Thus, she was listed for left, right, and bilateral lungs with a Lung Allocation Score of 42. After 39 days of listing, she underwent left SLTx. Final pathology of her explanted lung (Figure 1d) showed both uninvolved lung parenchyma and interstitial fibrosis and capillary congestion (Figure 1e). Post-operatively, her course was unremarkable and she was discharged home on POD 19. She was seen in clinic on POD 22 and doing well with no need for supplemental O2 and improving CXR (Figure 1b). Summary SLTx can be used to treat debilitating post-COVID lung fibrosis when there is the absence of severe lung damage and pulmonary hypertension. Considering SLTx in these patients is necessary to expand the donor pool of lungs for a population of patients that will continue to grow with the continued COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Feasibility of Single Lung Transplant for Post-COVID Fibrosis: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread throughout the world's population since its initial discovery in 2019. The virus infects cells via a glycosylated spike protein located on its surface. The protein primarily binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, using glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) as co-receptors. Here, we performed bioinformatics and molecular dynamics simulations of the spike protein to investigate the existence of additional GAG binding sites on the receptor-binding domain (RBD), separate from previously reported heparin-binding sites. A putative GAG binding site in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the protein was identified, encompassing residues 245-246. We hypothesized that GAGs of a sufficient length might bridge the gap between this site and the PRRARS furin cleavage site, including the mutation S247R. Docking studies using GlycoTorch Vina and subsequent MD simulations of the spike trimer in the presence of dodecasaccharides of the GAGs heparin and heparan sulfate supported this possibility. The heparan sulfate chain bridged the gap, binding the furin cleavage site and S247R. In contrast, the heparin chain bound the furin cleavage site and surrounding glycosylation structures, but not S247R. These findings identify a site in the spike protein that favors heparan sulfate binding that may be particularly pertinent for a better understanding of the recent UK and South African strains. This will also assist in future targeted therapy programs that could include repurposing clinical heparan sulfate mimetics.","output":"Evidence of a Putative Glycosaminoglycan Binding Site on the Glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein N-terminal domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic hit almost all cities in Brazil in early 2020 and lasted for several months. Despite the effort of local state and municipal governments, an inhomogeneous nationwide response resulted in a death toll amongst the highest recorded globally. To evaluate the impact of the nonpharmaceutical governmental interventions applied by different cities - such as the closure of schools and business in general - in the evolution and epidemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, we constructed a full-sized agent-based epidemiological model adjusted to the singularities of particular cities. The model incorporates detailed demographic information, mobility networks segregated by economic segments, and restricting bills enacted during the pandemic period. As a case study, we analyzed the early response of the City of Natal - a midsized state capital - to the pandemic. Although our results indicate that the governmental response could be improved, the restrictive mobility acts saved many lives. The simulations show that a detailed analysis of alternative scenarios can inform policymakers about the most relevant measures for similar pandemic surges and help developing future response protocols.","output":"Measuring the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic at a city level: An agent-based computational modeling study of the City of Natal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyses the major legal problems posed by an eventual lawsuit claiming damages for contagion of COVID-19 within the retail store or commercial establishment of an entrepreneur The author deals with the following questions: The tort law rules applicable to such a case, the problems surrounding the proof of causation, as well as the content and role of the entrepreneur's duty of care ? 2020 Ibero-American Law Institute All rights reserved","output":"Liability for damages caused by infection of COVID-19 in retail stores and commercial establishments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital pathology (DP) has disrupted the practice of traditional pathology, including applications in education, research, and clinical practice.

Due to the tiny size, this microplastic adversely affected the environment, notably aquatic life via ingestion, choking, and entanglement. This microplastic is arduous to degrade as it takes a thousand years due to the properties of plastic itself and consequently remains in nature. In dealing with microplastic issues, this paper reflects the occurrence, impact, toxicity, and degradation methods of microplastics in the environment including physical, chemical, and biological treatments. Here, the physical treatment methods include incineration treatment, ultraviolet (UV), and photocatalytic. The incineration process contributes to environmental pollution due to the release of toxic gases into the atmosphere. In addition, chemical treatments for plastic waste are the degradation process involving chemical additives such as ethylene glycol (EG), nano-magnesium oxide (MgO), diethylene glycol (DEG), and calcium or zinc (Ca/Zn) stearate as a catalyst. These treatments depend on the chemicals that can affect human health and the ecosystem. The biodegradation treatment using bacterial and fungal species can consume the microplastic without disrupting the surrounding environment and biota. It includes recent findings on the biodegradation of microplastic under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Thus, biodegradation can be considered the best option to degrade microplastic as green and sustainable technology.","output":"Occurrence, impact, toxicity, and degradation methods of microplastics in environment-a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the contemporary era of unprecedented innovations such as the Internet of Things (IoT), modern applications cannot be imagined without the presence of a wireless sensor network (WSN). Nodes in WSN use neighbor discovery (ND) protocols to have necessary communication among the nodes. The neighbor discovery process is crucial as it is to be done with energy efficiency and minimize discovery latency and maximum percentage of neighbors discovered. The current ND approaches that are indirect in nature are categorized into methods of removal of active slots from wake-up schedules and intelligent addition of new slots. This work develops a lightweight intrusion detection system (IDS) based on two machine learning approaches, namely, feature selection and feature classification, in order to improve the security of the Internet of Things (IoT) while transferring medical data through a cloud platform. In order to take advantage of the comparatively cheap processing cost of the filter-based technique, the feature selection was carried out. The two methods are found to have certain drawbacks. The first category disturbs the original integrity of wake-up schedules leading to reduced chances of discovering new nodes in WSN as neighbors. When the second category is followed, it may have inefficient slots in the wake-up schedules leading to performance degradation. Therefore, the motivation behind the work in this paper is that by combining the two categories, it is possible to reap the benefits of both and get rid of the limitations of both. Making a hybrid is achieved by introducing virtual nodes that help maximize performance by ensuring the original integrity of wake-up schedules and adding efficient active slots. Thus, a Hybrid Approach to Neighbor Discovery (HAND) protocol is realized in WSN. The simulation study revealed that HAND outperforms the existing indirect ND models.","output":"Hybrid Block-Based Lightweight Machine Learning-Based Predictive Models for Quality Preserving in the Internet of Things- (IoT-) Based Medical Images with Diagnostic Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are highly susceptible from respiratory exacerbations from viral respiratory tract infections However, it is unclear whether they are at increased risk of COVID-19 pneumonia or COVID-19-related mortality We aimed to determine whether COPD is a risk factor for adverse COVID-19 outcomes including hospitalization, severe COVID-19, or death Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 clinical studies published between November 1st, 2019 and January 28th, 2021 (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020191491) We included studies that quantified the number of COPD patients, and reported at least one of the following outcomes stratified by COPD status: hospitalization;severe COVID-19;ICU admission;mechanical ventilation;acute respiratory distress syndrome;or mortality We meta-analyzed the results of individual studies to determine the odds ratio (OR) of these outcomes in patients with COPD compared to those without COPD Findings: Fifty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria, and underwent data extraction Most studies were retrospective cohort studies/case series of hospitalized patients Only four studies examined the effects of COPD on COVID-19 outcomes as their primary endpoint In aggregate, COPD was associated with increased odds of hospitalization (OR 4 23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3 65C4 90), ICU admission (OR 1 35, 95% CI 1 02C1 78), and mortality (OR 2 47, 95% CI 2 18C2 79) Interpretation: Having a clinical diagnosis of COPD significantly increases the odds of poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 COPD patients should thus be considered a high-risk group, and targeted for preventative measures and aggressive treatment for COVID-19 including vaccination ? 2021 The Authors","output":"COPD and the risk of poor outcomes in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Screening standing and walking balance is useful for people suspected of having vestibular disorders, a variety of neurologic and musculoskeletal disorders, and for screening astronauts returning after exposure to microgravity. Visitors to a community science education center children and adults, aged 4 to 85, were tested on tandem walking with eyes closed and the modified Romberg test on compliant foam. They were then asked about their experience participating in research, many people for the first time. METHODS: Subjects performed 10 steps of tandem walking with eyes closed, and three trials of the modified Romberg, or Clinical Test of Sensory Integration and Balance, with eyes closed, standing on compliant memory foam, with a) head still, b) head shaking in yaw, and c) head nodding in pitch. Afterward, staff queried subjects about the experience of participating in science. RESULTS: Age-related changes across the life span occurred in both sets of tests. Therefore, look-up tables by age are provided. Body mass index significantly affected tandem walking. Some sex differences were found. The tests were easy to administer in a community setting. Most participants enjoyed the experience and reported that they learned about the process of scientific research. DISCUSSION: These data support and extend the evidence for age-related changes in balance performance across the lifespan and for an influence of body mass index on some balance skills. Clinicians and sports educators should be cognizant of these differences when they use these tests for screening.

We aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live-attenuated influenza virus vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (dNS1-RBD) administered by intranasal spray in healthy adults. Methods We did double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 1 and 2 trials, followed by a phase 2 extension trial, at a single centre in Jiangsu, China. Healthy adults (18 years) who had negative serum or fingertip blood total antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 (in phases 1 and 2), with no prevalent SARS-CoV-2 infection or history of infection and no SARS-CoV-2 vaccination history (in all three trials reported here), were enrolled. Participants were randomly allocated (4:1 in phase 1, 2:1 in phase 2, and 1:1 in the extension trial) to receive two intranasal doses of the dNS1-RBD vaccine or placebo on days 0 and 14 or, for half of the participants in phase 2, on days 0 and 21. To avoid cross-contamination during administration, vaccine and placebo recipients were vaccinated in separate rooms in the extension trial. The phase 1 primary outcome was safety (adverse events recorded on days 0C44; serious adverse events recorded from day 0 until 12 months after the second dose). In the phase 2 and extension trials, the primary immunogenicity outcomes were SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response in peripheral blood (measured by IFN- ELISpot), proportion of participants with positive conversion for SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG and secretory IgA (s-IgA) antibodies, and concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG in serum and SARS-CoV-2 RBD s-IgA in the nasopharynx (measured by ELISA) at 1 month after the second dose in the per-protocol set for immunogenicity. 2 test and Fisher's exact test were used to analyse categorical data, and t test and Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare the measurement data between groups. These trials were registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000037782, ChiCTR2000039715, and ChiCTR2100048316). Findings Between Sept 1, 2020, and July 4, 2021, 63, 724, and 297 participants without a history of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were enrolled in the phase 1, phase 2, and extension trials, respectively. At least one adverse reaction after vaccination was reported in 133 (19%) of 684 participants in the vaccine groups. Most adverse reactions were mild. No vaccine-related serious adverse event was noted. Specific T-cell immune responses were observed in 211 (46% [95% CI 42C51]) of 455 vaccine recipients in the phase 2 trial, and in 48 (40% [31C49]) of 120 vaccine recipients compared with one (1% [0C5]) of 111 placebo recipients (p<00001) in the extension trial. Seroconversion for RBD-specific IgG was observed in 48 (10% [95% CI 8C13]) of 466 vaccine recipients in the phase 2 trial (geometric mean titre [GMT] 38 [95% CI 34C43] in responders), and in 31 (22% [15C29]) of 143 vaccine recipients (GMT 44 [33C58]) and zero (0% [0C2]) of 147 placebo recipients (p<00001) in the extension trial. 57 (12% [95% CI 9C16]) of 466 vaccine recipients had positive conversion for RBD-specific s-IgA (GMT 38 [95% CI 35C41] in responders) in the phase 2 trial, as did 18 (13% [8C19]) of 143 vaccine recipients (GMT 52 [40C68]) and zero (0% [0C2]) of 147 placebo recipients (p<00001) in the extension trial. Interpretation dNS1-RBD was well tolerated in adults. Weak T-cell immunity in peripheral blood, as well as weak humoral and mucosal immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, were detected in vaccine recipients. Further studies are warranted to verify the safety and efficacy of intranasal vaccines as a potential supplement to current intramuscular SARS-CoV-2 vaccine pools. Steps should be taken in future studies to reduce the potential for cross-contamination caused by the vaccine strain aerosol during administration.

In this study, a new technique is presented to fine-tune stiffness and biodegradability of collagen scaffolds by treatment with concentrated salt solutions. Collagen scaffolds were prepared by a casting, freezing and lyophilization process. Scaffolds were treated with 90% saturated salt solutions, the salts taken from the Hofmeister series, followed by chemical crosslinking. Treatment with salts consisting of a divalent cation in combination with a monovalent anion, e.g. CaCl2, resulted in fast shrinkage of the scaffolds up to approximately 10% of the original surface area. Effective salts were mostly at the chaotropic end of the Hofmeister series. Shrunken scaffolds were more than 10 times stiffer than non-shrunken control scaffolds, and displayed reduced pore sizes and swollen, less organized collagen fibrils. The effect could be pinpointed to the level of individual collagen molecules and indicates the shrinking effect to be driven by disruption of stabilizing hydrogen bonds within the triple helix. No calcium deposits remained in CaCl2 treated scaffolds. Subcutaneous implantation in rats showed similar biocompatibility compared to H2O and NaCl treated scaffolds, but reduced cellular influx and increased structural integrity without signs of major degradation after 3 months. In conclusion, high concentrations of chaotropic salts can be used to adjust the mechanical characteristics of collagen scaffolds without affecting biocompatibility.

The monthly ratios of inpatient cases were compared from August 2018 to July 2019 and August 2019 to July 2020 as a year-over-year comparison. These ratios were also compared according to the \\"A-DROP\\" severity score, and an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the monthly number of inpatient cases. RESULTS: This study included a total of 67,900 inpatient cases for CAP in 262 hospitals. During the COVID-19 pandemic (defined as the period between March and July 2020) the number of inpatient cases for CAP drastically decreased compared with the same period in the previous year (-48.1%), despite a temporary reduction in the number of other urgent admissions. The number of inpatient cases decreased according to the severity of pneumonia. Milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio than severe ones: mild -55.2%, moderate -45.8%, severe -39.4%, and extremely severe -33.2%. The ITS analysis showed that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the monthly number of inpatient cases for CAP (estimated decrease: -1233 cases; 95% CI -521 to -1955).

Viral burden in asymptomatic individuals can differ from symptomatic patients, which can impact test performance. We therefore evaluated the impact of expanded testing indications upon the sensitivity and specificity of molecular diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of laboratory results from 5,122 emergency room patients and inpatients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 05/03/2020 and 06/13/2020 using the Hologic Panther Fusion and the Cepheid Xpert assays at the Brigham & Womens Hospital in Boston, MA. Descriptive analyses were performed for trends in testing volume, rates of positivity and cycle thresholds (Cts) over time based on symptom status. We calculated the proportion of new diagnoses made on a patients first test as an indirect measure of sensitivity. We calculated the proportion of first tests that are positive with a Ct value < 35 as an indirect measure of specificity. RESULTS: The overall rate of positivity over the study period was 8.7% (599/7,510 tests; 440/4,795 people) and declined by 1.8% (95% CI -2.2% - -1.4%, P< 0.0001) each week.

This negatively impacts the performance of molecular assays by increasing the risk of false negatives and the detection of non-viable virus. Decision algorithms based on molecular assay results may need re-evaluation in light of these dynamics. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","output":"427.

OBJECTIVES To explore ACP knowledge, experiences, views, facilitators, and barriers among older adults of Turkish origin in Belgium. METHODS This qualitative study was based on constant comparative analysis of semi-structured interview content. Participants were 33 older adults (aged 65-84 years; mean, 71.7 years; median, 74.5 years) of Turkish origin living in Belgium. RESULTS Despite unfamiliarity with the term ACP in this sample, several participants had engaged in some ACP behaviors. Respondents considered ACP to be useful and were ready to engage in conversations about it. The most commonly mentioned facilitator was the provision of tailored information about ACP. Other facilitators included concerns about future care needs, increasing awareness among respondents' children about the advantages of ACP, and respondents' desire to avoid \\"burdening\\" their children. The most commonly mentioned barrier was respondents' lack of knowledge about ACP. Other barriers were language issues, a lack of urgency about ACP discussion, reliance on familial support, and older adults' fear of triggering negative emotions in themselves and their children. CONCLUSIONS The provision of tailored information about ACP to older adults of Turkish origin in Belgium and the promotion of awareness about the importance of ACP among their children (when patients desire), as well as the use of professional interpreters, could facilitate ACP engagement in this population.","output":"Advance Care Planning Among Older Adults of Turkish Origin in Belgium: Exploratory Interview Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmission and immune evasion has caused breakthrough infections in vaccinated population.

High morbidity rates and consequential economic losses have been devastating to the affected cattle and buffalo farms, especially those in developing countries. Therefore, a rapid and accurate method is urgently needed to detect M. bovis. In this study, a rapid and simple lateral flow strip for detecting antibodies against M. bovis was established that used carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) as the labelled materials. The results from the test strip were highly consistent with those from ELISA. The test showed high specificity (100%) and no cross-reaction with other bovine pathogens.

However, there are not many published articles on the pathological findings in the liver of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We collected the clinical data from 17 autopsy cases of COVID-19 patients including age, sex, BMI, liver function test (ALT, AST, ALP, direct bilirubin and total bilirubin), D-dimer and anticoagulation treatment. We examined histopathologic findings in postmortem hepatic tissue, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with antibody against COVID spike protein, CD68 and CD61, and electron microscopy. We counted the number of megakaryocytes in liver sections from these COVID-19 positive cases. RESULTS: Abnormal liver-associated enzymes were observed in 12/17 cases of COVID-19 infection. With the exception of three cases that had not been tested for D-dimer, all 14 patients' D-dimer levels were increased, including the cases that received varied doses of anticoagulation treatment. Microscopically, the major findings were widespread platelet-fibrin microthrombi, steatosis, histiocytic hyperplasia in the portal tract, mild lobular inflammation, ischemic-type hepatic necrosis and zone 3 hemorrhage. Rare megakaryocytes were found in sinusoids. COVID IHC demonstrates positive staining of the histiocytes in the portal tract. Under electron microscopy, histiocyte proliferation is present in the portal tract containing lipid droplets, lysosomes, dilated ribosomal endoplasmic reticulum (RER), micro-vesicular bodies and coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic findings in COVID-19 patients' liver include numerous amounts of platelet-fibrin microthrombi as well as various degrees of steatosis and histiocytic hyperplasia in the portal tract.

Methods: A online cross-sectional survey was conducted with the people living in Wuhan between March 12th and 23rd, 2020. Results: Of a total of 2411 complete responses, the mean and standard deviation for the total physical prevention barriers score was 19.73 (standard deviation +/- 5.3;range 12-45) out of a possible score of 48. Using a cut-off score of 44 for the State-Trait Inventory score, 79.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78.2-81.5) of the participants reported moderate to severe anxiety during the early phase of the outbreak, and 51.3% (95% CI 49.2-53.3) reported moderate to severe anxiety after the peak of coronavirus disease 2019 was over (during the study period). Comparing anxiety levels in the early phase of the outbreak and after the peak of the outbreak, 58.5% (95% CI 56.5-60.5) recorded a decreased anxiety. Females reported a higher likelihood of having decreased levels of anxiety than males (odds ratio = 1.78, 95% CI 1.48-2.14).

We assessed whether performance on the educational performance measurement (EPM) and situational judgement test (SJT) used for selection into foundation training predicted success at the Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) examination. METHODS This was a longitudinal, cohort study using data from the UK Medical Education Database (https://www.ukmed.ac.uk). UK medical graduates who had attempted Part A (n=2585) and Part B (n=755) of the MRCS between 2014 and 2017 were included. 2 and independent t-tests were used to examine the relationship between medical school performance and sociodemographic factors with first-attempt success at MRCS Part A and B. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify independent predictors of MRCS performance. RESULTS The odds of passing MRCS increased by 55% for Part A (OR 1.55 (95% CI 1.48 to 1.61)) and 23% for Part B (1.23 (1.14 to 1.32)) for every additional EPM decile point gained. For every point awarded for additional degrees in the EPM, candidates were 20% more likely to pass MRCS Part A (1.20 (1.13 to 1.29)) and 17% more likely to pass Part B (1.17 (1.04 to 1.33)). For every point awarded for publications in the EPM, candidates were 14% more likely to pass MRCS Part A (1.14 (1.01 to 1.28)). SJT score was not a statistically significant independent predictor of MRCS success. CONCLUSION This study has demonstrated the EPM's independent predictive power and found that medical school performance deciles are the most significant measure of predicting later success in the MRCS.

Few studies have assessed the immune cell composition of the neonatal calf lung and comparisons with circulating immune cells in the blood are lacking. We describe immune cell populations present in the peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue of young disease-free calves. Flow cytometric analysis revealed significant differences in cell subset distribution between the peripheral blood and respiratory tract, and between compartments within the respiratory tract. Notably, whereas WC1+ ?3? TCR + T lymphocytes dominate the peripheral blood, both the BAL fluid and lung tissue contained a high proportion of myeloid cells which expressed CD14 and CD172a (SIRP&#945;). Very low numbers of tissue myeloid cells expressed MHC Class II in comparison to circulating myeloid cells in the blood. Respiratory tract tissues had low frequencies of CD4+ and CD8 + T lymphocytes, which were significantly lower than in the blood.

Our study aimed to evaluate the relationship between BMI and EPS in patients with schizophrenia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Using data from the Research on Asian Psychotropic Prescription Patterns for Antipsychotics (REAP-AP) study, we compared the prevalence of EPS in 1448 schizophrenia patients stratified as underweight, normal range, overweight pre-obese, overweight obese I, overweight obese II, and overweight obese III according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system for body weight status, and with underweight, normal range, overweight at risk, overweight obese I, and overweight obese II according to the Asia-Pacific obesity classification. RESULTS: In the first step of the WHO classification system for body weight status, adjusting for the potential effects of confounding factors, the multinomial logistic regression model revealed that underweight was significantly associated with greater rates of bradykinesia and muscle rigidity, and a lower rate of gait disturbance. In the second step of the Asia-Pacific obesity classification, adjusting for the potential effects of confounding factors, the multinomial logistic regression model revealed that underweight was significantly associated with a higher rate of muscle rigidity. CONCLUSION: Findings of the present study consistently revealed that underweight was associated with a greater rate of muscle rigidity in a stepwise pattern among Asian patients with schizophrenia.

Patient initially underwent a CT-guided biopsy that was suspicious for a hemangioma and confirmed on final pathology to be the capillary subtype. DISCUSSION When diagnosed appropriately, patients avoid unnecessary additional testing and avoid erroneous treatment of this rare lesion. Based on our experience, we propose initial MRI imaging to characterize the hemangioma and evaluate for intradural involvement, DSA to assess vascularity followed by embolization of the lesion when able in order to minimize intra-operative hemorrhage risk, and ultimately surgery to achieve a gross total resection.","output":"Extradural lumbar nerve root and ganglion capillary hemangioma: case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective delivery of cancer care via telehealth requires a planned care system that accounts for myriad patient, provider, and practice/cancer center resources before, during, and after the care episode.

Its unique structure is now universally applied in engineering bioinspired materials. On the other hand, it is still a technical challenge to investigate its interfacial strength and fracture mechanisms at micro or nano-scale. In this work, the interfacial strength and fracture mechanism of the 'brick-mortar' structure in nacre are investigated using micro-sized cantilever beam and bend samples. As compared to previous works, a high aragonite/biopolymer interfacial strength is observed (~298 MPa). The crack propagation path is investigated via experiment and finite element modelling and compared with the fracture mechanics analysis. It is confirmed that crack deflection to the aragonite/biopolymer interface contributes to a high overall toughness.

Regardless of the origin of this virus, which is uncertain, it has produced a pandemic that has been the cause of human deaths worldwide. Two drugs are being used as antiviral against this virus; cloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, although controversy exists concerning their effectiveness. The main objective of this report is to present the electronic properties of cloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that might help explain the action mechanisms against virus. The idea that emerges from this study is that acid-base equilibrium is not the only criteria of importance to explain the action mechanism, but that the oxide-reduction balance may also help explain the toxicity or effectiveness of these drugs. Being molecules able to oxidize other molecules is similar to yin-yang; a dualism that describes contrary forces, as oxidation may produce dysfunction and affect the conditions needed for viral infection, replication and propagation of the virus, but also contribute to increasing oxidative stress. These results offer a further step along the path of understanding these action mechanisms.","output":"Cloroquine and hydroxychloroquine: The Yin-yang of these drugs from a theoretical study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We detected a high prevalence (12.5%) of novel avian coronaviruses in aquatic wild birds.

METHODS We analyzed outcomes of 239 patients who underwent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) coronary imaging between 2009-2011. Multivariable Cox regression was used to identify variables independently associated with the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; cardiac mortality, acute coronary syndromes (ACS), stroke, and unplanned revascularization) during follow-up. RESULTS Mean patient age was 649years, 99% were men, and 50% were diabetic, presenting with stable coronary artery disease (61%) or an acute coronary syndrome (ACS, 39%). Target vessel pre-stenting median lipid core burden index (LCBI) was 88 [interquartile range, IQR 50-130]. Median LCBI in non-target vessels was 57 [IQR 26-94]. Median follow-up was 5.3years. The 5-year MACE rate was 37.5% (cardiac mortality was 15.0%). On multivariable analysis the following variables were associated with MACE: diabetes mellitus, prior percutaneous coronary intervention performed at index angiography, and non-target vessel LCBI. Non-target vessel LCBI of 77 was determined using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis to be a threshold for prediction of MACE in our cohort. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for non-target vessel LCBI 77 was 14.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.47-133.51, p=0.002). The 5-year cumulative incidence of events in the above-threshold group was 58.0% vs. 13.1% in the below-threshold group. CONCLUSION During long-term follow-up of patients who underwent NIRS imaging, high LCBI in a non-PCI target vessel was associated with increased incidence of MACE.","output":"Long-term follow-up after near-infrared spectroscopy coronary imaging: Insights from the lipid cORe plaque association with CLinical events (ORACLE-NIRS) registry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Work-related stress among seafarers is well known but a suspected excess of work-related stress due to the COVID-19 so far has not been published.

Distancing directives are represented by rates of flow into these compartments, as well as by a reduction in contacts that lessens disease transmission. The dynamical behavior of this system is analyzed, under various different rate control strategies, and the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number to various parameters is studied. One of the striking features of this model is the existence of a critical implementation delay (CID) in issuing distancing mandates: while a delay of about two weeks does not have an appreciable effect on the peak number of infections, issuing mandates even slightly after this critical time results in a far greater incidence of infection. Thus, there is a nontrivial but tight window of opportunity for commencing social distancing in order to meet the capacity of healthcare resources. However, if one wants to also delay the timing of peak infections C so as to take advantage of potential new therapies and vaccines C action must be taken much faster than the CID. Different relaxation strategies are also simulated, with surprising results. Periodic relaxation policies suggest a schedule which may significantly inhibit peak infective load, but that this schedule is very sensitive to parameter values and the schedules frequency. Furthermore, we considered the impact of steadily reducing social distancing measures over time. We find that a too-sudden reopening of society may negate the progress achieved under initial distancing guidelines, but the negative effects can be mitigated if the relaxation strategy is carefully designed.","output":"A novel COVID-19 epidemiological model with explicit susceptible and asymptomatic isolation compartments reveals unexpected consequences of timing social distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This paper examined how mental health practitioners adjusted their practices during COVID-19. The authors hypothesized that practitioners would transition services to telehealth but that this would differ by provider type. METHOD: English-speaking adult mental health practitioners (N = 910) were recruited via professional listservs, personal emails, and social media. Data were collected 03/30/2020C04/10/2020 via an online Qualtrics survey asking about demographics and practice adjustments in response to COVID-19. Most practitioners were psychologists/doctoral-level therapists (41%), social workers/masters-level therapists (17%), and neuropsychologists (16%). The majority was employed in an academic medical center (19%) or private practice (22%). Differences among provider types were examined using chi-square tests with Bonferroni corrections and one-way ANOVAs with post-hoc Tukey tests. Preliminary Results (see Table 1): Most mental health practitioners adjusted their practices, primarily by transitioning to telehealth. The majority reported having easy access to information technology (IT) services. Although telehealth implementation was neutral to somewhat difficult, participants were neutral to somewhat likely to provide telehealth in the future. Compared to other practitioners, neuropsychologists saw fewer patients; were more likely to cancel, reschedule, or restrict appointments; were less likely to implement telehealth; and reported greater difficulty doing so. Findings related to other group differences (e.g., between settings) will also be presented. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, mental health practitioners rapidly shifted to telehealth, but neuropsychologists were less likely to do so and reported greater difficulty doing so. This may be related to the difficulty of administering neuropsychological tests remotely and has implications for neuropsychologists ability to meet patients needs during COVID-19.

Understanding the determinants of IFR variation for COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has direct implications for mitigation efforts with respect to clinical practice, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and the prioritisation of risk groups for targeted vaccine delivery. The IFR is also a crucial parameter in COVID-19 dynamic transmission models, providing a way to convert a population's mortality rate into an estimate of infections. METHODS: We estimated age-specific and all-age IFR by matching seroprevalence surveys to total COVID-19 mortality rates in a population. The term total COVID-19 mortality refers to an estimate of the total number of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19. After applying exclusion criteria to 5131 seroprevalence surveys, the IFR analyses were informed by 2073 all-age surveys and 718 age-specific surveys (3012 age-specific observations). When seroprevalence was reported by age group, we split total COVID-19 mortality into corresponding age groups using a Bayesian hierarchical model to characterise the non-linear age pattern of reported deaths for a given location. To remove the impact of vaccines on the estimated IFR age pattern, we excluded age-specific observations of seroprevalence and deaths that occurred after vaccines were introduced in a location. We estimated age-specific IFR with a non-linear meta-regression and used the resulting age pattern to standardise all-age IFR observations to the global age distribution. All IFR observations were adjusted for baseline and waning antibody-test sensitivity. We then modelled age-standardised IFR as a function of time, geography, and an ensemble of 100 of the top-performing covariate sets. The covariates included seven clinical predictors (eg, age-standardised obesity prevalence) and two measures of health system performance. Final estimates for 190 countries and territories, as well as subnational locations in 11 countries and territories, were obtained by predicting age-standardised IFR conditional on covariates and reversing the age standardisation. FINDINGS: We report IFR estimates for April 15, 2020, to January 1, 2021, the period before the introduction of vaccines and widespread evolution of variants. We found substantial heterogeneity in the IFR by age, location, and time. Age-specific IFR estimates form a J shape, with the lowest IFR occurring at age 7 years (00023%, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 00015C00039) and increasing exponentially through ages 30 years (00573%, 00418C00870), 60 years (10035%, 07002C15727), and 90 years (203292%, 146888C289754). The countries with the highest IFR on July 15, 2020, were Portugal (2085%, 0946C4395), Monaco (1778%, 1265C2915), Japan (1750%, 1302C2690), Spain (1710%, 0991C2718), and Greece (1637%, 1155C2678). All-age IFR varied by a factor of more than 30 among 190 countries and territories. After age standardisation, the countries with the highest IFR on July 15, 2020, were Peru (0911%, 0636C1538), Portugal (0850%, 0386C1793), Oman (0762%, 0381C1399), Spain (0751%, 0435C1193), and Mexico (0717%, 0426C1404). Subnational locations with high IFRs also included hotspots in the UK and southern and eastern states of the USA. Sub-Saharan African countries and Asian countries generally had the lowest all-age and age-standardised IFRs. Population age structure accounted for 74% of logit-scale variation in IFRs estimated for 39 in-sample countries on July 15, 2020. A post-hoc analysis showed that high rates of transmission in the care home population might account for higher IFRs in some locations. Among all countries and territories, we found that the median IFR decreased from 0466% (interquartile range 0223C0840) to 0314% (0143C0551) between April 15, 2020, and Jan 1, 2021. INTERPRETATION: Estimating the IFR for global populations helps to identify relative vulnerabilities to COVID-19. Information about how IFR varies by age, time, and location informs clinical practice and non-pharmaceutical interventions like physical distancing measures, and underpins vaccine risk stratification. IFR and mortality risk form a J shape with respect to age, which previous research, such as that by Glynn and Moss in 2020, has identified to be a common pattern among infectious diseases. Understanding the experience of a population with COVID-19 mortality requires consideration for local factors; IFRs varied by a factor of more than 30 among 190 countries and territories in this analysis. In particular, the presence of elevated age-standardised IFRs in countries with well resourced health-care systems indicates that factors beyond health-care capacity are important. Potential extenuating circumstances include outbreaks among care home residents, variable burdens of severe cases, and the population prevalence of comorbid conditions that increase the severity of COVID-19 disease. During the pre-vaccine period, the estimated 33% decrease in median IFR over 8 months suggests that treatment for COVID-19 has improved over time. Estimating IFR for the pre-vaccine era provides an important baseline for describing the progression of COVID-19 mortality patterns.

While most of these studies have employed two-dimensional (2D) face images as stimuli, some recent studies have used three-dimensional (3D) face images because they may contain cues not visible in 2D face images. As equipment required for 3D face images is considerably more expensive than that required for 2D face images, we here investigated how perceptual ratings of physical characteristics from 2D and 3D face images compare. METHODS: We tested whether 3D face images capture cues of strength, weight, and height better than 2D face images do by directly comparing the accuracy of strength, weight, and height ratings of 182 2D and 3D face images taken simultaneously. Strength, height and weight were rated by 66, 59 and 52 raters respectively, who viewed both 2D and 3D images. RESULTS: In line with previous studies, we found that weight and height can be judged somewhat accurately from faces; contrary to previous research, we found that people were relatively inaccurate at assessing strength. We found no evidence that physical characteristics could be judged more accurately from 3D than 2D images. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest physical characteristics are perceived with similar accuracy from 2D and 3D face images. They also suggest that the substantial costs associated with collecting 3D face scans may not be justified for research on the accuracy of facial judgments of physical characteristics.","output":"Do 3D Face Images Capture Cues of Strength, Weight, and Height Better than 2D Face Images do?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What's next for nursing after the pandemic.","output":"Where Do We Go from Here?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on biologic therapies is not well studied. The goal of this study was to measure the serological response to BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines in patients with IBD receiving different biologic therapies. Methods: We performed a multi-center prospective study between 1 August 2021 and 15 September 2021. We measured the seropositivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (SARS-CoV-2 IgG) and neutralizing antibody concentrations in patients with IBD receiving biologic therapies 4C10 weeks after their second dose or 3C6 weeks after their first dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines. Results: A total of 126 patients were enrolled (mean age, 31 years; 60% male; 71% Crohns disease, 29% ulcerative colitis). Of these, 92 patients were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine (73%) and 34 patients with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (27%). In patients being treated with infliximab and adalimumab, the proportion of patients who achieved positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels after receiving two doses of the vaccine were 44 out of 59 patients (74.5%) and 13 out of 16 patients (81.2%), respectively. In contrast, of those receiving ustekinumab and vedolizumab, the proportion of patients who achieved positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels after receiving two doses of the vaccine were 100% and 92.8%, respectively. In patients receiving infliximab and adalimumab, the proportion of patients who had positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels after two-dose vaccination was 40 out of 59 patients (67.7%) and 14 out 16 patients (87.5%), respectively. On the other hand, the proportion of patients who had positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels were 12 out of 13 patients (92.3%) and 13 out of 14 patients (92.8%) in patients receiving ustekinumab and vedolizumab, respectively. Conclusions: The majority of patients with IBD who were on infliximab, adalimumab, and vedolizumab seroconverted after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

Up to 29 February 2020, SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19 / 2019-nCoV) had infected more than 85 000 people in the world. In this study, we used 93 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the GISAID EpiFlu TM database to investigate the evolution and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in the first two months of the outbreak. We constructed haplotypes of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, performed phylogenomic analyses and estimated the potential population size changes of the virus. The date of population expansion was calculated based on the expansion parameter tau ( &#964;) using the formula t= &#964;/2 u. A total of 120 substitution sites with 119 codons, including 79 non-synonymous and 40 synonymous substitutions, were found in eight coding-regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Forty non-synonymous substitutions are potentially associated with virus adaptation. No combinations were detected. The 58 haplotypes (31 found in samples from China and 31 from outside China) were identified in 93 viral genomes under study and could be classified into five groups. By applying the reported bat coronavirus genome (bat-RaTG13-CoV) as the outgroup, we found that haplotypes H13 and H38 might be considered as ancestral haplotypes, and later H1 was derived from the intermediate haplotype H3.

However, the underlying anticancer mechanisms of solasonine, particularly in urinary bladder cancer (BC), remain unclear. In this study, we identified the potential targets and biological functions associated with solasonine activity using a bioinformatics approach. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and other signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK pathways, were potentially involved in the therapeutic effects of solasonine. The ability of solasonine in inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation in BC cells was confirmed experimentally, and the inhibition of ERK/MAPK, P38/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT pathways was validated by Western blot. Mechanistically, solasonine suppressed the expression of NRP1 protein, but not that of mRNA. Further results of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation analysis indicated that solasonine could directly bind to the b1 domain of NRP1 protein with a reasonable and stable docking conformation. We previously found that targeting NRP1 is a potential antitumor strategy. Combined with these findings, it can be speculated that the binding of solasonine with NRP1 on the cell membrane could prevent the formation of NRP1/VEGFA/VEGFR2 and NRP1/EGFR complexes, resulting in the inhibition of downstream signaling, including ERK/MAPK, P38/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT pathways. Additionally, intracellular solasonine could inhibit the membrane localization of NRP1 and provoke its cytoplasmic retention, facilitating the degradation of NRP1 protein in the cytoplasm. The dual effects induced by the binding of solasonine to NRP1 extracellularly and intracellularly could account for the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of solasonine on BC.","output":"Solasonine Induces Apoptosis and Inhibits Proliferation of Bladder Cancer Cells by Suppressing NRP1 Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Standard evaluation and management of the patient with suspected or proven cardiovascular complications of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome related-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is challenging.

For each, the authors consider the role of biomarker testing to guide imaging decision-making, provide differential diagnostic considerations, and offer general suggestions regarding application of various advanced imaging techniques.","output":"Multimodality Imaging in Evaluation of Cardiovascular Complications in Patients With COVID-19: JACC Scientific Expert Panel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing use of adjuvant bisphosphonates for early stage breast cancer (EBC), little is known about the patient experience with such treatments. A patient survey was performed to identify current prescribing practices, perceptions around the role of treatment, the impact of treatment on patients quality of life, and future trial designs. METHODS: EBC patients who had either completed or were currently receiving adjuvant bisphosphonates were sent an anonymized survey. The survey collected information on patient and disease characteristics, bisphosphonate scheduling, compliance, and tolerance. Questions also assessed patient interest in trials of de-escalated bisphosphonate therapy. RESULTS: A total of 255 patients were contacted, with 164 eligible respondents (eligible response rate 164/255, 64.3%). Median patient age was 52 years (range 28 to 82 years). The majority (111/163, 68.1%) were postmenopausal at the time of diagnosis, 23.3% (38/163) were premenopausal, and 7.4% (12/163) were perimenopausal. Most patients (78%) had received chemotherapy. Zoledronate was the most commonly used bisphosphonate (92%), with the majority receiving treatment every 6 months for 3 years (73%). While 66% (107/161) of respondents had experienced side effects with treatment, most had, or expected to, complete treatment (154/163, 94%). Provided there was no detriment in breast cancer outcomes, there was strong interest in future studies of de-escalating adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy.

Much research into Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASCs) over the years has focused on comparisons between neuro-typical people and people with Autism Spectrum Conditions. These comparisons have tended to draw attention to 'deficits' in cognitive abilities and descriptions of behaviours that are characterised as unwanted. Not surprisingly, this is reflected in the classification systems from the World Health Organisation and the American Psychiatric Association. Public opinion about ASC may be influenced by presentations in the media of those with ASC who also have intellectual disability. Given that diagnostic systems are intended to help us better understand conditions in order to seek improved outcomes, we propose a more constructive approach to descriptions that uses more positive language, and balances descriptions of deficits with research finding of strengths and differences. We propose that this will be more helpful to individuals on the Autism Spectrum, both in terms of individual self-view, but also in terms of how society views Autism Spectrum Conditions more positively. Commentary has also been made on guidance that has been adjusted for people with ASC in relation to the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Should Autism Spectrum Conditions Be Characterised in a More Positive Way in Our Modern World?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 virus spread over the world, governments restricted mobility to slow transmission. Public health measures had different intensities across European countries but all had significant impact on peoples daily lives and economic activities, causing a drop of CO2 emissions of about 10% for the whole year 2020. Here, we analyze changes in natural gas use in the industry and built environment sectors during the first half of year 2020 with daily gas flows data from pipeline and storage facilities in Europe. We find that reductions of industrial gas use reflect decreases in industrial production across most countries. Surprisingly, natural gas use in buildings also decreased despite most people being confined at home and cold spells in March 2020. Those reductions that we attribute to the impacts of COVID-19 remain of comparable magnitude to previous variations induced by cold or warm climate anomalies in the cold season.

Understanding the interaction patterns between a particular virus and human proteins plays a crucial role in unveiling the underlying mechanism of viral infection and pathogenesis. This could further help in prevention and treatment of virus-related diseases. However, the task of predicting proteinCprotein interactions between a new virus and human cells is extremely challenging due to scarce data on virus-human interactions and fast mutation rates of most viruses. RESULTS: We developed a multitask transfer learning approach that exploits the information of around 24 million protein sequences and the interaction patterns from the human interactome to counter the problem of small training datasets. Instead of using hand-crafted protein features, we utilize statistically rich protein representations learned by a deep language modeling approach from a massive source of protein sequences. Additionally, we employ an additional objective which aims to maximize the probability of observing human proteinCprotein interactions. This additional task objective acts as a regularizer and also allows to incorporate domain knowledge to inform the virus-human proteinCprotein interaction prediction model. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach achieved competitive results on 13 benchmark datasets and the case study for the SARS-CoV-2 virus receptor. Experimental results show that our proposed model works effectively for both virus-human and bacteria-human proteinCprotein interaction prediction tasks.

This is popularly known as long COVID. Objective: To estimate by country and territory of the number of patients affected by long COVID in 2020 and 2021, the severity of their symptoms and expected pattern of recovery Design: We jointly analyzed ten ongoing cohort studies in ten countries for the occurrence of three major symptom clusters of long COVID among representative COVID cases. The defining symptoms of the three clusters (fatigue, cognitive problems, and shortness of breath) are explicitly mentioned in the WHO clinical case definition. For incidence of long COVID, we adopted the minimum duration after infection of three months from the WHO case definition. We pooled data from the contributing studies, two large medical record databases in the United States, and findings from 44 published studies using a Bayesian meta-regression tool. We separately estimated occurrence and pattern of recovery in patients with milder acute infections and those hospitalized. We estimated the incidence and prevalence of long COVID globally and by country in 2020 and 2021 as well as the severity-weighted prevalence using disability weights from the Global Burden of Disease study. Results: Analyses are based on detailed information for 1906 community infections and 10526 hospitalized patients from the ten collaborating cohorts, three of which included children. We added published data on 37262 community infections and 9540 hospitalized patients as well as ICD-coded medical record data concerning 1.3 million infections. Globally, in 2020 and 2021, 144.7 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 54.8-312.9) people suffered from any of the three symptom clusters of long COVID. This corresponds to 3.69% (1.38-7.96) of all infections. The fatigue, respiratory, and cognitive clusters occurred in 51.0% (16.9-92.4), 60.4% (18.9-89.1), and 35.4% (9.4-75.1) of long COVID cases, respectively. Those with milder acute COVID-19 cases had a quicker estimated recovery (median duration 3.99 months [IQR 3.84-4.20]) than those admitted for the acute infection (median duration 8.84 months [IQR 8.10-9.78]). At twelve months, 15.1% (10.3-21.1) continued to experience long COVID symptoms. Conclusions and relevance: The occurrence of debilitating ongoing symptoms of COVID-19 is common. Knowing how many people are affected, and for how long, is important to plan for rehabilitative services and support to return to social activities, places of learning, and the workplace when symptoms start to wane.","output":"A global systematic analysis of the occurrence, severity, and recovery pattern of long COVID in 2020 and 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We aimed to assess the correlation between LUS Soldati proposed score and clinical presentation, course of disease and the possible need of ventilation support/intensive care. PATIENTS AND METHODS All consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalized in two COVID Centers were enrolled. All patients performed blood gas analysis and lung ultrasound (LUS) at admission. The LUS acquisition was based on standard sequence of 14 peculiar anatomic landmarks with a score between 0-3 based on impairment of LUS picture. Total score was computed with their sum with a total score ranging 0 to 42, according to Soldati LUS score. We evaluated the course of hospitalization until either discharge or death, the ventilatory support and the transition in intensive care if needed. RESULTS One hundred and fifty-six patients were included in the final analysis. Most of patients presented moderate-to-severe respiratory failure (FiO2 <20%, PaO2 <60 mmHg) and consequent recommendation to invasive mechanic ventilation (CPAP/NIV/OTI). The median ultrasound thoracic score was 28 (IQR 18-36) and most of patients could be ascertained either in a score 2 (40%) or score 3 pictures (24.4%). The bivariate correlation analysis displayed statistically significant and high positive correlations between the LUS score and the following parameters: ventilation (rho=0.481, p<0.001), lactates (rho=0.464, p<0.001), dyspnea (rho=0.398, p=0.001) mortality (rho=0.410, p=0.001).

Some patients develop acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with profound hypoxia, which likely requires invasive mechanical ventilation during prolonged periods. Corticosteroids have become a cornerstone therapy for patients with severe COVID-19, though only little data are available regarding their potential harms and benefits, especially concerning the risk of a ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infection (VA-LRTI). Methods: This retrospective multicenter study included patients admitted in four ICUs from Belgium and France for severe COVID-19, who required invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). We compared clinical and demographic variables between patients that received corticosteroids or not, using univariate, multivariate, and Fine and Gray analyses to identify factors influencing VA-LRTI occurrence. Results: From March 2020 to January 2021, 341 patients required MV for acute respiratory failure related to COVID-19, 322 of whom were included in the analysis, with 60.6% of them receiving corticosteroids. The proportion of VA-LRTI was significantly higher in the early corticosteroid group (63.1% vs. 48.8%, p = 0.011). Multivariable Fine and Gray modeling considering death and extubation as competing events revealed that the factors independently associated with VA-LRTI occurrence were male gender (adjusted sHR:1.7, p = 0.0022) and corticosteroids (adjusted sHR: 1.44, p = 0.022). Conclusions: in our multicenter retrospective cohort of COVID-19 patients undergoing MV, early corticosteroid therapy was independently associated with VA-LRTI.","output":"Early Corticosteroid Therapy May Increase Ventilator-Associated Lower Respiratory Tract Infection in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A legacy of the South African gold mining industry, now in decline, is a large burden of silicosis and tuberculosis among former migrant miners from rural South Africa and surrounding countries, particularly Lesotho and Mozambique. This neglected population faces significant barriers in filing claims for compensation for occupational lung disease. The objective of the study was to gain insight into the extent of such barriers, particularly for former miners and cross-border migrants. METHODS: The database of a large gold mining company and the statutory compensation authority were analyzed for the period 1973C2018 by country of origin, age, and employment status at the time of claim filing. Proportions and odds ratios (ORs) for each of the compensable diseases were calculated by the above variables. Processing delays of claims were also calculated. RESULTS: Annual company employment declined from 240,718 in 1989 to 43,024 in 2018 and the proportion of cross-border migrants within the workforce from 51.0 to 28.1%. The compensation database contained 68,612 claims. The majority of compensable claims in all diagnostic categories were from active miners. The odds of cross-border miners relative to South African miners filing a claim depended on employment status. For example, the OR for Lesotho miners filing while in active employment was 1.86 (95% CI 1.81, 1.91), falling to 0.94 (95% CI 0.91, 0.98) among former miners. The equivalent findings for Mozambiquan miners were 0.95 (95% CI 0.91, 1.00), falling to 0.44 (95% CI 0.41, 0.47). Median processing delays over the whole period were from 1.1 years from filing to adjudication, and 3.8 years from filing to payment. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide a quantitative view of differential access to occupational lung disease compensation, including long processing delays, among groups of migrant miners from the South African gold mines. There is a deficit of compensable claims for silicosis and silico-tuberculosis among former miners irrespective of country of origin. While cross-border miner groups appear to file more claims while active, this is reversed once they leave employment.

Results: Self-reported stress, anxiety, and depression were significantly higher during the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period (p < 0.001). Almost a quarter of participants reported high stress, while more than half reported moderate-to-severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. High resilience was negatively associated with high stress (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.46; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.22C0.98; p = 0.045), moderate-to-severe anxiety (OR = 0.47; 95%CI = 0.25C0.90; p = 0.022), and moderate-to-severe depression (OR = 0.50; 95%CI = 0.26C0.95; p = 0.036).

However, its accuracy is as low as 60-70%, which is inefficient to uncover the infected. In comparison, the chest CT has been considered as the prior choice in diagnosis and monitoring progress of COVID-19 infection. Although the COVID-19 diagnostic systems based on artificial intelligence have been developed for assisting doctors in diagnosis, the small sample size and the excessive time consumption limit their applications. To this end, this paper proposed a diagnosis prototype system for COVID-19 infection testing. The proposed deep learning model is trained and is tested on 2267 CT sequences from 1357 patients clinically confirmed with COVID-19 and 1235 CT sequences from non-infected people. The main highlights of the prototype system are: (1) no data augmentation is needed to accurately discriminate the COVID-19 from normal controls with the specificity of 0.92 and sensitivity of 0.93; (2) the raw DICOM image is not necessary in testing. Highly compressed image like Jpeg can be used to allow a quick diagnosis; and (3) it discriminates the virus infection within 6 seconds and thus allows an online test with light cost. We also applied our model on 48 asymptomatic patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We found that: (1) the positive rate of RT-PCR assay is 63.5% (687/1082). (2) 45.8% (22/48) of the RT-PCR assay is negative for asymptomatic patients, yet the accuracy of CT scans is 95.8%.

Low level of localized RHOA activation prevents actomyosin accumulation at the cleavage furrow and participates in MK polyploidization. In the platelet production, RHOA and CDC42 play opposite, but complementary roles. RHOA inhibits both proplatelet formation and MK exit from BM, whereas CDC42 drives the development of the demarcation membranes and MK migration in BM. Moreover, the RhoA or Cdc42 MK specific knock-out in mice and the genetic alterations in their down-stream effectors in human induce a thrombocytopenia demonstrating their key roles in platelet production.

For the purpose of this review, self-direction refers to the organization and/or coordination of your own life, including professional and other care, with the objective of having what you perceive to be a good life. The aim of this systematic review was to assess and describe interventions that aim to improve self-direction of people with dementia. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo and the Cochrane Library. Empirical studies up to April 2020 were included that used qualitative and/or quantitative methods and reported on interventions for people with dementia aimed at improving self-direction. Stepwise study selection and the assessment of methodological quality were conducted independently by two authors. Data on study and intervention characteristics, outcomes related to self-direction and well-being of people with dementia and factors influencing the feasibility were extracted systematically and described narratively. RESULTS Ten studies were identified describing a total of nine interventions. Interventions varied in terms of goals, content, target population and duration. Overall, interventions consisted of multiple components focusing on identifying \\"Who am I?\\" (beliefs, strengths, values, goals), identifying \\"What is important to me?\\" (meaningful activities and goal setting) and/or communicating about preferences with professionals and/or caregivers. The review provides indications that people with dementia may benefit from the interventions included. Overall, positive effects were found in studies on outcomes related to self-direction and wellbeing. However, outcomes measured using quantitative methods showed inconsistent effects between the studies. CONCLUSIONS Although the methodological quality of all the studies included was 'good' or at least 'fair', the evidence base of interventions aiming to improve self-direction is still limited due to the low number of studies, the low number of participants and the frequent use of and their authors' own non-standardized measures. Nevertheless, the review points towards positive effects on self-direction and well-being.

METHODS: Patients meeting ST elevation criteria and undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention from 27 March 2020, the day initial national lockdown measures were announced in Ireland, were included in the study. Patients presenting after the lockdown period, from 18 May to 31 June 2020, were also examined. Time from symptom onset to first medical contact (FMC), transfer time and time of wire cross was noted. Additionally, patient characteristics, left ventricular ejection fraction, mortality and biochemical parameters were documented. Outcomes and characteristics were compared against a control group of patients meeting ST elevation criteria during the month of January. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients presented with STEMI during the lockdown period. A significant increase in total ischaemic time (TIT) was noted versus controls (8.81 hours (16.4) vs 2.99 hours (1.39), p=0.03), with increases driven largely by delays in seeking FMC (7.13 hours (16.4) vs 1.98 hours (1.46), p=0.049). TIT remained significantly elevated during the postlockdown period (6.1 hours (5.3), p=0.05), however, an improvement in patient delays was seen versus the control group (3.99 hours (4.5), p=0.06). There was no difference seen in transfer times and door to wire cross time during lockdown, however, a significant increase in transfer times was seen postlockdown versus controls (1.81 hours (1.0) vs 1.1 hours (0.87), p=0.004). CONCLUSION: A significant increase in TIT was seen during the lockdown period driven mainly by patient factors highlighting the significance of public health messages on public perception.

Moreover, the addition of ECM-like proteins could enhance the biocompatibility of these scaffolds.

The characteristics and biocompatibility of the extracted SEP were evaluated using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) analysis and 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay. For scaffolds fabrication, a three-layer nanofibrous composite structure was produced using the electrospinning technique. The outer layers composed of polyvinyl alcohol, chitosan, and extracted SEP while the middle layer composed of polyethylene oxide, gelatin, and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs). For each layer, the electrospinning parameters were adjusted to form bead-free fibers. To improve fibers' stability against body fluids, the produced fibers were crosslinked using glutaraldehyde vapor. Several techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray, ATR-FTIR, swelling, tensile test, in vitro biodegradation, and MTT assay were implemented to evaluate the physical, chemical, and biological characterization of the fabricated fibers. The results showed that crosslinked fibers have adequate stability in water, suitable mechanical properties, and promising water uptake capacity. The MTT results also revealed that SEP and ZnO-NPs could increase scaffolds biocompatibility. Moreover, SEM photographs of cultured fibroblasts cells on the scaffolds showed that cells were well attached on the scaffolds and preserve their natural spindle shapes.

The scarcity of medical resources creates the need for national governments to establish admission criteria that are evidence-based and fair. Questions have been raised whether infection with HIV or tuberculosis (TB) may amplify the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes and therefore whether these conditions should be factored in when deciding on the rationing of intensive care facilities. In light of these questions, clinical evidence regarding inclusion of these infections as comorbidities relevant to intensive care unit admission triage criteria is investigated in the first of a two-part series of articles. There is currently no evidence to indicate that HIV or TB infection on their own predispose to an increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 or worse outcomes for COVID-19.

In serial data, bits of data are continuously released, but their combined effect may result in a privacy breach in the whole serial publication. Protecting serial data is crucial for preserving them from adversaries. Previous approaches provide privacy for relational data and serial data, but many loopholes exist when dealing with multiple sensitive values. We address these problems by introducing a novel privacy approach that limits the risk of privacy disclosure in republication and gives better privacy with much lower perturbation rates. Existing techniques provide a strong privacy guarantee against attacks on data privacy; however, in serial publication, the chances of attack still exist due to the continuous addition and deletion of data. In serial data, proper countermeasures for tackling attacks such as correlation attacks have not been taken, due to which serial publication is still at risk. Moreover, protecting privacy is a significant task due to the critical absence of sensitive values while dealing with multiple sensitive values. Due to this critical absence, signatures change in every release, which is a reason for attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach in order to counter the composition attack and the transitive composition attack and we prove that the proposed approach is better than the existing state-of-the-art techniques.

It can reduce the atopic skin molecular signature and induce a significant decrease in the clinical signs and symptoms of AD patients. AREAS COVERED Th2 activation has been confirmed or suspected in skin diseases other than AD, and several reports about the treatment with dupilumab in these conditions have been published. In order to review the new indications of dupilumab in dermatology, we performed a search on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Skin databases, and clinicaltrials.gov. EXPERT OPINION The analysis of available literature suggests that dupilumab may have a large application in dermatology, besides AD. Clinical trials are underway on some widespread disease (i.e., chronic urticaria, bullous pemphigoid, alopecia areata, or allergic contact dermatitis). The data are still partial, but they seem to indicate that dupilumab is efficacious and safe. On the other hand, the dupilumab use in some rare skin diseases remains only hypothetical or linked to few case reports. Dupilumab could have a prominent position in the therapeutic algorithm of chronic skin diseases that significantly affect the quality of life of patients, require long-term treatment, or lacking effective therapies.","output":"The emerging role of dupilumab in dermatological indications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Infectious diseases continue to pose a substantial burden on global populations, requiring innovative broad-spectrum prophylactic and treatment alternatives.

The outcomes were clinical recovery rates by Day 5 using self-assessment scores, pneumonia by chest X-rays, nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR on Day 5, changes of serum CRP levels, and adverse drug reactions. Chest X-rays and blood tests for CRP, liver and renal function, were performed on Days 1, 3, and 5. ResultsBaseline characteristics of patients in the APE-treatment (n=29) and placebo-control (n=28) groups were comparable. None had self-assessment scores showing complete clinical recovery by Day 5. Pneumonia occurred in 0/29 (0%) versus 3/28 (10.7%), (p=0.112).

For such densely populated built-environments, innovative energy systems such as the building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems serve as good options to capture and use renewable energy incident on large facade areas. To estimate the financial feasibility of implementing BIPV systems and the cost-competitiveness in comparison with conventional building materials, the LCC serves as an enabling tool to evaluate the viability of these energy systems as per the market need. A step-by-step illustration of the LCC analysis, based on the tool developed by the BIPV Centre of Excellence at the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), is provided as a case study.

This study was an investigation of the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in Saudi Arabia during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Serology results and epidemiological data were analyzed for 837 adult blood donors, with no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in Saudi Arabia from 20th to 25th May 2020. Seroprevalence was determined using electrochemical immunoassay to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.4% (12/837). Non-citizens had higher seroprevalence compared with citizens (OR 13.6, p = 0.001). Secondary education was significantly associated with higher seroprevalence compared with higher education (OR 6.8, p = 0.005). The data showed that the highest seroprevalence was in Makkah (8.1%). Uisng Makkah seroprevalence as the reference, the seroprevalence in other areas was: Madinah 4.1% (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12-1.94), Jeddah 2.3% (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.31-2.25), and Qassim 2.9 % (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.04-2.89) and these were not statistically different from seroprevalence in the Makkah region. CONCLUSIONS: At the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia, the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors was low, but was higher among non-citizens.

There is an urgent need for programs that prevent parental substance use disorders, yet few prevention programs exist that target parents unique needs and strengths. Adapting evidence-based treatment approaches for prevention might be an efficient, effective way to address this gap. The current study informed the rigorous adaptation of an evidence-based treatment that supports families involved with child welfare due to substance use, Families Actively Improving Relationships (FAIR), to a prevention-oriented intervention: PRE-FAIR. FAIR entails four treatment domains: substance use, parenting, mental health, and ancillary services (e.g., housing, medical care, and food). FAIR significantly improved parenting and reduced parental substance use in three rigorous treatment trials, but FAIRs effectiveness in preventing the initiation or escalation of opioid misuse and/or methamphetamine use is untested. To inform adaptation, particular attention was paid to operationalizing strategies underlying a key hypothesized mediator of successful parent outcomesengagement. Methods: Graduated FAIR parents (n = 9) and FAIR administrators, clinical supervisors, and clinicians (n = 11) participated in semi-structured interviews. Content analysis was used to identify key variables driving FAIR engagement and parent outcomes. Causal loop diagramming, a qualitative systems science method, was employed to operationalize emergent themes, and describe how causal links between key variables interrelated dynamically over time. Results: Themes reinforced the value of FAIRs treatment domains for supporting parents sobriety and parenting skills within a prevention orientation. Ancillary supports and strong relationships were particularly crucial for helping parents cope with stressors leading to substance use. Five engagement strategies were identified as essential to parent success: 24/7 clinician availability, in-person clinician advocacy, in-home delivery, strengths-based interactions, and urinalysis. Implications for PRE-FAIR engagement strategies and dosage were identified. Discussion: Traditional qualitative analyses and qualitative analyses based in systems science can inform rigorous adaptations of evidence-based treatment programs for prevention. Future research will explore additional required, fidelity-consistent prevention adaptations to FAIR, and the impact of PRE-FAIR on parental substance use and child welfare case outcomes.","output":"Prevention Adaptation of an Evidence-Based Treatment for Parents Involved With Child Welfare Who Use Substances"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) remains an underused treatment for choledocholithiasis, likely in part because of a lack of exposure to the procedure during surgery residency.

METHODS Senior surgery residents underwent a curriculum consisting of deliberate practice using the LCBDE simulator. Residents performed a simulated transcystic and transcholedochal LCBDE before and after completing the curriculum, which were rated by three faculty. Passing scores were determined using an Angoff method. RESULTS Ten residents participated. For transcystic LCBDE, all 10 residents failed the pretest. Assessment scores improved after the curriculum (20  4 vs 41  2; scale 0-45, P < .01), and all 10 residents passed the posttest. For transcholedochal LCBDE, all 10 residents failed the pretest. Transcholedochal scores improved after the curriculum (27  6 vs 46  4; scale 0-53, P < .01).

In particular, we explored differential lncRNAs-mediated regulation of differential genes and predicted the subcellular location of lncRNAs to reveal their potential roles. Results: Compared with TCM-defined balanced constitution (BC), 183 and 93 genes as well as 749 and 651 lncRNAs were differentially expressed (P < 0.05 and |log2 (fold change)| &#8805;1) in leukocytes of individuals from case populations 1 (QDC) and 2 (PQDS), respectively. Of them, 12 genes and 111 lncRNAs were common to each case population. Several networks were created to detail the interactions among case-specific genes, especially case-specific lncRNAs-mediated regulation of case-specific genes. Also, interaction networks were created for the common lncRNAs and genes. HCL analyses showed that differential genes and lncRNAs, especially the common genes and lncRNAs, kept similar expression patterns in both case populations. Furthermore, function enrichment analyses just indicated the common biological processes, namely, extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules. In addition, most common genes underwent very tight and complex regulation of many trans- and cis-acting lncRNAs. In particular, of them, ADAMTSL5, COL26A1, COL27A1, MSH5, and LOC390937 could be regulated by multiple case-specific and common lncRNAs, including the means that directs binding of the common lncRNAs to their coded proteins.

Conclusion: This review highlighted the main barriers and facilitators in implementing the nurse's role in primary care settings. These results offer useful elements for stakeholders to identify effective strategies in preparing programs and activities for implementing the nurse's role, acting on the elements identified as barriers and favouring the aspects that emerge as facilitators.","output":"Barriers and facilitators to the implementation of nurse's role in primary care settings: an integrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Early reported symptoms include fever, cough, and respiratory symptoms. There were few reports of digestive symptoms. However, with COVID-19 spreading worldwide, symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain have gained increasing attention. Research has found that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, is strongly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. Whether theoretically or clinically, many studies have suggested a close connection between COVID-19 and the digestive system. In this review, we summarize the digestive symptoms reported in existing research, discuss the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the gastrointestinal tract and liver, and determine the possible mechanisms and aetiology, such as cytokine storm.

It is urgent to exert adequate efforts for the management of dialysis patients, caregivers, and healthcare personnel (HCP). This study aimed at reporting practical workflow, identification of high-risk or suspected cases of CO-VID-19, and subsequent response measures. METHODS: At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, precautions and practice protocols were applied in our dialysis units (DUs). This single-center study retrospectively reviewed all high-risk/suspected cases from January 23, 2020, to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical feature, and detailed data on all cases were recorded. RESULTS: Practical workflow for the clinical management of dialysis patients, caregivers, and HCP was initiated. A total of 6 high-risk/suspected cases were identified. Female gender, older age, presence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, anuresis, immunocompromised status, hypoalbuminemia, and underweight were noticeable features in these cases. Direct evidence of infection or epidemiological risk was detected in five cases. Close monitoring for temperature and oxygen saturation during hemodialysis sessions may be reasonable. No confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in our DU, but certain cases showed rapid deterioration due to other critically severe condition needing hospitalization. Portable dialysis machines are of great need to ensure dialysis care provision. CONCLUSIONS: Our study described a practical workflow for patient-centered management during COVID-19 outbreak. Potential risk factors and underlying clinical patterns were reported.

Method: This is a retrospective study that looked at medical mortality in the ED from January 2004 to December 2009. We obtained data on the demographics and causes of death from the medical records and case notes of the deceased. Results: A total of 16587 patients were admitted during the period under review, of these 1262 (7.61%) died in the ED. The male to female ratio was 1.58:1.0 [772 males (61.2%), and 489 females (38.8%)]. Mortality was highest among the 20-45 years age range, followed by 46-65 years, >65 years and < 20 years in decreasing frequency [589(46.7%), 421(33.4%), 186 (14.8%) and 66(5.2%) respectively].

Using a recombinant HIV-1 carrying the green fluorescent protein reporter gene, we demonstrate that memory CD4+ T cells were susceptible to infection-induced cell death at a low multiplicity of infection. Infected memory CD4+ T cells underwent rapid necrotic cell death. Killing of host cells was dependent on X4 envelope-mediated viral fusion, but not on virion-associated Vpr or Nef. In contrast to peripheral resting CD4+ T cells, CD4+ T cells stimulated by mitogen or certain cytokines were resistant to HIV-1-induced early cell death. These results demonstrate that early steps in HIV-1 infection have a detrimental effect on certain subsets of CD4+ T cells. The early cell death may serve as a selective disadvantage for X4-tropic HIV-1 in acute infection but may play a role in accelerated disease progression, which is associated with the emergence of X4-tropic HIV-1 in the late stage of AIDS.","output":"Preferential cytolysis of peripheral memory CD4+ T cells by in vitro X4-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection before the completion of reverse transcription."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A better understanding of the effects of the lockdown on lifestyle behaviors may help to guide the public health response to COVID-19 at a national level and to update the global strategy to respond COVID-19 pandemic.

Possible factors for a long time from first symptom to diagnosis (the total interval) include patient, tumour and healthcare characteristics, but until now the most relevant risk factors and its association with outcomes remain unknown. Our study aims to (1) quantify total interval, the time interval from first symptom until (histological) diagnosis; (2) identify factors associated with interval length and (3) determine the association between total interval and HRQoL, stage and tumour size at diagnosis, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a longitudinal, prospective, international, multicentre cohort study among patients aged 18 years with newly diagnosed bone or soft tissue sarcoma at eight centres (three in UK, five in The Netherlands). Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires at five points in time; one at diagnosis and at follow-up points of 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.

To what extent Delta evades vaccine-induced immunity in immunocompromised individuals with systemic inflammatory diseases remains unclear. Methods. We conducted a prospective study in patients with systemic inflammatory diseases (cases) and controls receiving two doses of BNT162b2. Primary end points were anti-spike antibodies levels and cross-neutralization of Alpha and Delta variants after BNT162b2 vaccine. Secondary end points were T-cell responses, breakthrough infections and safety. Results. Sixty-four cases and 21 controls not previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. Kinetics of anti-spike IgG and IgA after BNT162b2 vaccine showed lower and delayed induction in cases, more pronounced with rituximab. Administration of two doses of BNT162b2 generated a neutralizing response against Alpha and Delta in 100% of controls, while sera from only one of rituximab-treated patients neutralized Alpha (5%) and none Delta. Other therapeutic regimens induced a partial neutralizing activity against Alpha, even lower against Delta. All controls and cases except those treated with methotrexate mounted a SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell response. Methotrexate abrogated T-cell responses after one dose and dramatically impaired T-cell responses after 2 doses of BNT162b2. Conclusions.

These patients show great complexity due to multiple organ involvement and a dynamic evolution over time; moreover, few information is available about the risk factors that may contribute to increase the time course of mechanical ventilation. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the risk factors associated with the inability to liberate COVID-19 patients from mechanical ventilation. Due to the complex evolution of the disease, we analyzed both pulmonary variables and occurrence of non-pulmonary complications during mechanical ventilation. The secondary objective of this study was the evaluation of risk factors for ICU mortality. METHODS: This multicenter prospective observational study enrolled 391 patients from fifteen COVID-19 dedicated Italian ICUs which underwent invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinical and laboratory data, ventilator parameters, occurrence of organ dysfunction, and outcome were recorded. The primary outcome measure was 28 days ventilator-free days and the liberation from MV at 28 days was studied by performing a competing risks regression model on data, according to the method of Fine and Gray; the event death was considered as a competing risk. RESULTS: Liberation from mechanical ventilation was achieved in 53.2% of the patients (208/391). Competing risks analysis, considering death as a competing event, demonstrated a decreased sub-hazard ratio for liberation from mechanical ventilation (MV) with increasing age and SOFA score at ICU admission, low values of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio during the first 5 days of MV, respiratory system compliance (C(RS)) lower than 40 mL/cmH(2)O during the first 5 days of MV, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and cardiovascular complications. ICU mortality during the observation period was 36.1% (141/391). Similar results were obtained by the multivariate logistic regression analysis using mortality as a dependent variable. CONCLUSIONS: Age, SOFA score at ICU admission, C(RS), PaO(2)/FiO(2), renal and cardiovascular complications, and late-onset VAP were all independent risk factors for prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Repair of large hiatus hernias is increasingly being performed. However, there is no consensus for the optimal technique for hiatal closure between sutured versus mesh-augmented (absorbable or non-absorbable) repair. METHODS A systematic review of Medline, Scopus (which encompassed Embase), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science and PubMed was performed to identify relevant studies comparing mesh-augmented versus sutured HH repair. Data were extracted and compared by meta-analysis, using odds ratio and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS Seven RCTs were found which compared mesh-augmented (non-absorbable mesh: n = 296; absorbable mesh: n = 92) with sutured repair (n = 347). There were no significant differences for short-term hernia recurrence (defined as 6-12 months, 10.1% mesh versus 15.5% sutured, P = 0.22), long-term hernia recurrence (defined as 3-5 years, 30.7% mesh vs 31.3% sutured, P = 0.69), functional outcomes and patient satisfaction. The only statistically significant difference was that the mesh repair required a longer operation time (P = 0.05, OR 2.33, 95% CI 0.03-24.69).

The topological structure of a complex system strongly impacts its collective behavior;therefore, mapping this structure is essential to fully understand the functions of the system as a whole and its fragility to unexpected disruptions or shocks. To this aim, we unravel the causal relationships between the 16 environmental conditions and human activity variables, mapping the backbone of the complex interplay between intervening physical observablessuch as NO2 emissions, energy consumption, intervening climate variables, and different flavors of human mobility flowsto a causal network model. To identify a tipping point during the period of observation, denoting the presence of a regime shift between distinct network states (i.e., before and during the shock), we introduce a novel information-theoretic method based on statistical divergence widely used in statistical physics. We find that despite a measurable decrease in NO2 concentration, due to an overall decrease in human activities, locking down a region as a climate change mitigation is an insufficient remedy to reduce emissions. Our results provide a functional characterization of socioenvironmental interdependent systems, and our analytical framework can be used, more generally, to characterize environmental changes and their interdependencies using statistical physics.","output":"COVID-19 Lockdown Unravels the Complex Interplay between Environmental Conditions and Human Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to propose a provisional assessment of the research developed in the context of the COVID19 pandemic since the beginning of 2020 It reviews the types of research already published, presents their methodologies and analyzes the questions posed It places recent research in the perspective of the history of empirical research on sexuality, particularly in relation to research carried out in the context of HIV/AIDS Situated in an intellectual history perspective, the article analyzes research currently being developed as the construction and prefiguration of a new paradigm of sexualities that distinguishes and associates sexual relations that take place in the presence of a real partner and those that take place with the help of a whole range of electronic devices qualified as virtual that provide support for the imagination and maintain sexual arousal for personal satisfaction Rsum Cet article vise  proposer un bilan provisoire de la recherche dveloppe dans le contexte de la pandmie de COVID19 depuis le dbut de lanne 2020 Il value les types de recherche dj publis, prsente leurs mthodologies et analyse les questions poses Il replace les recherches rcentes dans la perspective de lhistoire des recherches empiriques sur la sexualit et notamment par rapport  celles qui ont t ralises dans le contexte du VIH-sida Situ dans une perspective dhistoire intellectuelle, larticle analyse les recherches actuellement dveloppes comme la construction et la prfiguration dun nouveau paradigme des sexualits qui distingue et associe les relations sexuelles qui se droulent en prsence dun partenaire rel et celles qui se droulent avec laide de toute une panoplie doutils lectroniques qualifis de ? virtuels ? qui assurent un support  limagination et entretiennent lexcitation sexuelle en vue de la satisfaction personnelle","output":"COVID-19 and Sexualities: the emergence of a new paradigm of sexualities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a homotrimer that has two spatially distinct binding regions, three lectin-like domains (LLD) at the TIP of the protein and three basolaterally located receptor-binding sites, the latter of which are responsible for the inflammatory and cell death-inducing properties of the cytokine. Solnatide (a.k.a. TIP peptide, AP301) is a 17-mer cyclic peptide that mimics the LLD of human TNF which activates the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and, as such, recapitulates the capacity of TNF to enhance alveolar fluid clearance, as demonstrated in numerous preclinical studies. TNF and solnatide interact with glycoproteins and these interactions are necessary for their trypanolytic and ENaC-activating activities. In view of the crucial role of ENaC in lung liquid clearance, solnatide is currently being evaluated as a novel therapeutic agent to treat pulmonary edema in patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS. To facilitate the description of the functional properties of solnatide in detail, as well as to further target-docking studies, we have analyzed its folding properties by NMR. In solution, solnatide populates a set of conformations characterized by a small hydrophobic core and two electrostatically charged poles. Using the structural information determined here and also that available for the ENaC protein, we propose a model to describe solnatide interaction with the C-terminal domain of the ENaC subunit. This model may serve to guide future experiments to validate specific interactions with ENaC and the design of new solnatide analogs with unexplored functionalities.","output":"Conformational ensemble of the TNF-derived peptide solnatide in solution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previously considered of meagre significance to the human race, coronaviruses have effectively evolved to jump the species barrier and cause widespread contagion in mankind The SARS pandemic, the MERS situation in the middle-east and the ongoing COVID 2019 epidemic are all attributed to this evolving virus COVID 2019 is the seventh coronavirus isolated successfully and the third beta-coronavirus that causes a fatal illness in humans;the other two beta-coronaviruses being severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV Having a natural reservoir in bats these viruses infect humans through an intermediate host and then rapidly adapt and mutate for human to human transmissions Four other known alpha coronaviruses cause only common cold in humans Although mortality rate of COVID 2019 epidemic is lower at 2 5% than the previous two CoV outbreaks, that is, 9 6% in SARS and 34 4% in MERS, but rapid transmissibility points towards a sustained epidemic of epic proportions In the absence of any specific treatment protocols and experimental vaccines still under research, management largely depends upon symptomatic therapy, strict infection control and quarantine measures Restriction of human interactions with known animal sources of the virus as a measure of prevention is essentially required Owing to huge genetic diversity and frequent genomic recombination, novel coronaviruses might emerge periodically, warranting the need for extensive research and development of effective treatments and vaccines ? 2020, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine All rights reserved","output":"Coronavirus: A threat to global public health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in deceased patients is key when considering appropriate safety measures to prevent infection during postmortem examinations.

Distinguishing them requires knowledge of the designated app purpose. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning-based system that is capable of generating natural language text describing the purpose and core functionality of Android apps based on their actual code. We design a dense neural network that captures the semantic relationships of resource identifiers, string constants, and API calls contained in apps to derive a high-level picture of implemented program behavior. For arbitrary applications, our system can predict precise, human-readable keywords and short phrases that indicate the main use-cases apps are designed for. We evaluate our solution on 67,040 real-world apps and find that with a precision between 69% and 84% we can identify keywords that also occur in the developer-provided description in Google Play.

However, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) usually causes only mild symptoms, so transmission chains may grow to include several individuals before at least one index case becomes ill enough to self-report for diagnosis and care. Here, simple mathematical models were developed to evaluate the implications of delayed index case detection for retrospective contact tracing and management responses. Specifically, these simulations illustrate how: (1) Contact tracing and management may effectively contain most but not all large SARS-CoV-2 clusters arising at foci with high reproduction numbers because rapidly expanding transmission chains ensure at least one overtly symptomatic index case occurs within two viral generations a week or less apart. (2) However, lower reproduction numbers give rise to thinner transmission chains extending through longer sequences of non-reporting asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic individuals, often spanning three or more viral generations (2 weeks of transmission) before an overtly symptomatic index case occurs. (3) Consequently, it is not always possible to fully trace and contain such long, thin transmission chains, so the community transmission they give rise to is underrepresented in surveillance data. (4) Wherever surveillance systems are weak and/or transmission proceeds within population groups with lower rates of overt clinical symptoms and/or self-reporting, case and contact management effectiveness may be more severely limited, even at the higher reproduction numbers associated with larger outbreaks. (5) Because passive surveillance platforms may be especially slow to detect the thinner transmission chains that occur at low reproduction numbers, establishing satisfactory confidence of elimination may require that no confirmed cases are detected for two full months, throughout which presumptive preventative measures must be maintained to ensure complete collapse of undetected residual transmission. (6) Greater scope exists for overcoming these limitations by enhancing field surveillance for new suspected cases than by improving diagnostic test sensitivity. (7) While population-wide active surveillance may enable complete traceability and containment, this goal may also be achievable through enhanced passive surveillance for paucisymptomatic infections, combining readily accessible decentralized testing with population hypersensitization to self-reporting with mild symptoms. Containment and elimination of SARS-CoV-2 will rely far more upon presumptive, population-wide prevention measures than was necessary for SARS-CoV-1, necessitating greater ambition, political will, investment, public support, persistence and patience. Nevertheless, case and contact management may be invaluable for at least partially containing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially larger outbreaks, but only if enabled by sufficiently sensitive surveillance. Furthermore, consistently complete transmission chain containment may be enabled by focally enhanced surveillance around manageably small numbers of outbreaks in the end stages of successful elimination campaigns, so that their endpoints may be accelerated and sustained.","output":"Long, thin transmission chains of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 may go undetected for several weeks at low to moderate reproduction numbers: Implications for containment and elimination strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the risk of patients contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during their hospital stay to inform the safety of hospitalization for a nonCCOVID-19 indication during this pandemic. METHODS: A case series of adult patients hospitalized for 2 or more nights from May 15 to June 15, 2020 at large tertiary-care hospital in the midwestern United States was reviewed. All patients were screened at admission with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Selected adult patients were also tested by IgG serology. After dismissal, patients with negative serology and PCR at admission were asked to undergo repeat serologic testing at 14C21 days after discharge. The primary outcome was healthcare-associated COVID-19 defined as a new positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test on or after day 4 of hospital stay or within 7 days of hospital dismissal, or seroconversion in patients previously established as seronegative. RESULTS: Of the 2,068 eligible adult patients, 1,778 (86.0%) completed admission PCR testing, while 1,339 (64.7%) also completed admission serology testing. Of the 1,310 (97.8%) who were both PCR and seronegative, 445 (34.0%) repeated postdischarge serology testing. No healthcare-associated COVID-19 cases were detected during the study period. Of 1,310 eligible PCR and seronegative adults, no patients tested PCR positive during hospital admission (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0%C0.3%). Of the 445 (34.0%) who completed postdischarge serology testing, no patients seroconverted (0.0%; 95% CI, 0.0%C0.9%).

As most diabetic patients with ASCVD are asymptomatic, it is most neglected in clinical practice. For this reason, identifying high-risk ASCVD population with intensified treatment is very important. In recent years, the relationship between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and ASCVD has caused much academic concern, but the results are inconsistent. Moreover, whether all grades of DR increase the risk of ASCVD remains controversial. Most importantly, very few data can be found in China. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to discuss whether all grades of DR increase the risk of ASCVD after adjustment for the traditional cardiovascular risk factors and to assess the independent contribution of DR to cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM, hoping to provide more evidence for early identification of ASCVD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 425 T2DM patients with complete physical and biochemical data were included in the study. The grade of DR was assessed with two 45 color digital retinal images. Based on the presence of history of ASCVD, 425 T2DM patients were divided into 2 groups: ASCVD group and non-ASCVD group. RESULTS: ASCVD patients were older and had a significantly higher fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and proportion of history of ASCVD. At the same time, they were more likely to be females, and had lower level of alcohol and calculated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) than non-ASCVD patients. Their trend to develop DR with ASCVD was significantly higher than patients with non-ASCVD ((2) = 5.805, P = 0.016). DR was an independent statistical indicator of the presence of ASCVD [odds ratio (OR) (95% CI): 2.321 (1.152C4.678), P = 0.018]. Furthermore, when DR was divided into non-proliferative retinopathy (NPDR) and proliferative retinopathy (PDR) according to its severity, only PDR was significantly associated with incident ASCVD [OR (95% CI): 8.333 (1.813C38.304), P = 0.006]. After adjusting for traditional ASCVD risk factors, such an association still existed [OR (95% CI): 7.466 (1.355C41.137), P = 0.021]. CONCLUSION: DR associates strongly with ASCVD in the Chinese population with T2DM. With the increasing severity of DR, the risk of ASCVD also increases. After adjustment for traditional risk factors, PDR is still an independent risk marker for ASCVD.","output":"Proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes correlates with the presence of atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] In this work, a photocatalytic process was carried out to recover gold (Au) from the simulated non-cyanide plating bath solution. Effects of semiconductor types (TiO(2), WO(3), Nb(2)O(3), CeO(2), and Bi(2)O(3)), initial pH of the solution (3C10), and type of complexing agents (Na(2)S(2)O(3) and Na(2)SO(3)) and their concentrations (1C4 mM each) on Au recovery were explored. Among all employed semiconductors, TiO(2) exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity to recover Au from the simulated spent plating bath solution both in the absence and presence of complexing agents, in which Au was completely recovered within 15 min at a pH of 6.5. The presence of complexing agents remarkably affected the size of deposited Au on the TiO(2) surface, the localized surface plasmon effect (LSPR) behavior, and the valence band (VB) edge position of the obtained Au/TiO(2), without a significant change in the textural properties or the band gap energy. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained Au/TiO(2) tested via two photocatalytic processes depended on the common reduction mechanism rather than the textural or optical properties. As a result, the Au/TiO(2) NPs obtained from the proposed recovery process are recommended for use as a photocatalyst for the reactions occurring at the conduction band rather than at the valence band. Notably, they exhibited good stability after the fifth photocatalytic cycle for Au recovery from the actual cyanide plating bath solution.","output":"Photocatalytic Recovery of Gold from a Non-Cyanide Gold Plating Solution as Au Nanoparticle-Decorated Semiconductors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A raiva  uma zoonose que afeta todos os mamferos e causa cerca de 55.000 mortes humanas por ano, causada pelo vrus da raiva.

More specifically, this study used an experimental design to assess the effects of using stigmatized language to describe the virus as well as the threat to physical health and economic wellbeing posed by the virus on COVID-19 prejudice. Data were collected from a national sample of 1451 adults residing within the United States. Results from 2  2 x 2 between-subjects analyses of covariance demonstrated that emphasizing the connection between China and COVID-19, rather than framing the virus neutrally, increased negative attitudes toward Asian Americans, beliefs that resources should be prioritized for Americans rather than immigrants, and general xenophobia. Emphasizing the severity of the economic impact of the virus also increased beliefs that Asian Americans are a threat to resources and general xenophobia. In contrast, messages which emphasized the serious health risks of COVID-19 did not increase bias toward Asian Americans or xenophobia. Our findings suggest that specific types of public health messaging related to infectious diseases, especially framing the virus in terms of its country of origin or its likely economic impact, may elicit prejudice and xenophobia. Public health campaigns that emphasize the severity of the virus, however, are not likely to trigger the same negative attitudes.

The ability to quickly predict traffic patterns in different scenarios has become more urgent to support short-term operations and long-term transportation planning, emergency management, and resource allocation. Urban traffic exhibits a high spatial correlation in which links adjacent to a congested link are likely to become congested due to spillback effects. The spillback behavior requires modeling the entire metropolitan area to recognize all of the upstream and downstream effects from intentional or unintentional perturbations to the network. However, there is a well-known trade-off between increasing the level of detail of a model and decreasing computational performance. This paper addresses these performance shortcomings by introducing a new platform MANTA for traffic microsimulation at the metropolitan-scale. MANTA employs a highly parallelized GPU implementation that is fast enough to run simulations on large-scale demand and networks within a few minutes. We test our platform to simulate the entire Bay Area metropolitan region over the course of the morning using half-second time steps. The runtime for the nine-county Bay Area simulation is just over four minutes, not including routing and initialization. This computational performance significantly improves state of the art in large-scale traffic microsimulation and offers new capacity for analyzing the detailed travel patterns and travel choices of individuals for infrastructure planning and emergency management.","output":"Microsimulation Analysis for Network Traffic Assignment (MANTA) at Metropolitan-Scale for Agile Transportation Planning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the global lockdowns caused by the COVID-19, or coronavirus, pandemic had resulted in a sharp drop in demand for crude oil.

PARTICIPANTS: 27 participants, UK residents aged 18 years and older. METHODS: Qualitative study consisting of six focus groups carried out between 1st-12th May, 2020 (39-50 days into the UK 'lockdown'). RESULTS: Participants were divided as to whether or not they felt they would use the app. Analysis revealed five themes: (1) lack of information and misconceptions surrounding COVID-19 contact tracing apps; (2) concerns over privacy; (3) concerns over stigma; (4)concerns over uptake; and (5) contact tracing as the 'greater good'. Concerns over privacy, uptake and stigma were particularly significant amongst those stated they will not be using the app, and the view that the app is for the 'greater good' was particularly significant amongst those who stated they will be using the app. One of the most common misconceptions about the app was that it could allow users to specifically identify and map COVID-19 cases amongst their contacts and in their vicinity. CONCLUSIONS: Our participants were torn over whether digital contact tracing is a good idea or not, and views were heavily influenced by moral reasoning.

Design-Setting-Subjects-Methods: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted using data from 15 nursing homes in the Marseille area. Older residents with confirmed COVID-19 between March and June 2020 were enrolled. The clinical and biological characteristics, the treatment measures, and the outcomes in residents living in these nursing homes were collected from the medical records. Results: A total of 321 residents were diagnosed with COVID-19 including 12 centenarians. The median age was 101 years in centenarians and 89 years in other residents. The most common symptoms were asthenia and fever. Three centenarians (25%) experienced a worsening of pre-existing depression (vs. 5.5% of younger residents; p = 0.032). Mortality was significantly higher in centenarians than in younger residents (50% vs. 21.3%, respectively; p = 0.031). A quarter of the younger residents and only one centenarian were hospitalized. However, 33.3% of the centenarians received treatment within the context of home hospitalization.

In addition to the millions of individuals who have been infected with the disease, billions of individuals have been asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on epidemics or traumatic events suggests that this can lead to profound behavioral and mental health changes; however, researchers are rarely able to track these changes with frequent, near-real-time sampling or compare their findings to previous years of data for the same individuals. OBJECTIVE: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data among college students who have been participating in a longitudinal study for the past 2 years, we sought to answer two overarching questions. First, have the behaviors and mental health of the participants changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous time periods? Second, are these behavior and mental health changes associated with the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media? METHODS: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students, with 178 (82.0%) students providing data during the Winter 2020 term. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term compared to previous terms in the same cohort were modeled using mixed linear models. RESULTS: During the first academic term impacted by COVID-19 (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P<.001) relative to previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks. Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and the week of the academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant. In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term were strongly associated with increased amount of COVID-19-related news. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P<.001) and depression (P=.03) were significantly associated with COVID-19-related news. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with prior academic terms, individuals in the Winter 2020 term were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed. A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, were associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting. While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods to reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.","output":"Mental Health and Behavior of College Students During the Early Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has highlighted the need for the rapid generation of efficient vaccines for emerging disease. Virus-like particles, VLPs, are an established vaccine technology that produces virus-like mimics, based on expression of the structural proteins of a target virus that can stimulate strong neutralizing antibody responses. SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus where the basis of VLP formation has been shown to be the co-expression of the spike, membrane and envelope structural proteins.

Unfortunately, the global vaccination is not efficient enough to attain a vaccine-based herd-immunity and yet no special and effective drug is developed to contain the spread of the disease. Previously we have identified CD147 as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrated that CD147 antibody effectively inhibits infection and cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants. In CD147KO VeroE6 cells, infections of SARS-CoV-2, its variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351) and pseudovirus mutants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.525, B.1.526 (S477N), B.1.526 (E484K), P.1, P.2, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2) were decreased. Meanwhile, CD147 antibody effectively blocked the entry of variants and pseudomutants in VeroE6 cells, and inhibited the expression of cytokines. A model of SARS-CoV-2-infected hCD147 transgenic mice was constructed, which recapitulated the features of exudative diffuse alveolar damage and dynamic immune responses of COVID-19. CD147 antibody could effectively clear the virus and alveolar exudation, resolving the pneumonia. We found the elevated level of cyclophilin A (CyPA) in plasma of severe/critical cases, and identified CyPA as the most important proinflammatory intermediate causing cytokine storm. Mechanistically, spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 bound to CD147 and initiated the JAK-STAT pathway, which induced expression of CyPA. CyPA reciprocally bound to CD147, triggered MAPK pathway and consequently mediated the expression of cytokine and chemokine.

The stigma and bias people with obesity (PwO) experience is one of the barriers hindering the dialogue between PwO and their Health Care Professionals (HCPs). The results from the ACTION IO Australian cohort are reported here. Identification of local barriers can inform strategies to improve access to quality obesity care within Australia. METHODS The ACTION-IO study was an online cross-sectional survey conducted in 11 countries during June-October 2018. In Australia 1,000 community based adult PwO (body mass index 30 kg/m based on self-reported height and weight) and 200 HCPs involved with direct patient care (seeing 10 patients with obesity/month) completed the survey. RESULTS There was a mean delay of 8.9 years from when a PwO first started to struggle with their weight, and the initial discussion with an HCP about this. HCPs acknowledged weight loss efforts in only 38.5% of their patients, although 74.6% of PwO had attempted weight loss. Most PwO (82.0%) assumed full responsibility for their weight loss. HCPs identified short appointment times (60.5%) and the cost of obesity medication, programmes and services (58.5%) as barriers to weight management conversations and weight loss, respectively. Most PwO want their HCP to raise the issue of weight with 64 % reporting finding such conversations positive and helpful. CONCLUSION Compared to global results, Australian PwO took 3 years longer to seek medical care about their weight.

Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has recently served as a therapeutic technique for MSA by personalized stimulation. The primary aim of this systematic review is to assess the effects of NIBS on two subtypes of MSA: parkinsonian-type MSA (MSA-P) and cerebellar-type MSA (MSA-C). Methods: A literature search for English articles was conducted from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and PsycINFO up to August 2021. Original articles investigating the therapeutics application of NIBS in MSA were screened and analyzed by two independent reviewers. Moreover, a customized form was adopted to extract data, and the quality of articles was assessed based on the PEDro scale for clinical articles. Results: On the whole, nine articles were included, i.e., five for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), two for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), one for paired associative stimulation, with 123 patients recruited. The mentioned articles comprised three randomized controlled trials, two controlled trials, two non-controlled trials, and two case reports which assessed NIBS effects on motor function, cognitive function, and brain modulatory effects. The majority of articles demonstrated significant motor symptoms improvement and increased cerebellar activation in the short term after active rTMS. Furthermore, short-term and long-term effects on improvement of motor performance were significant for tDCS. As opposed to the mentioned, no significant change of motor cortical excitability was reported after paired associative stimulation. Conclusion: NIBS can serve as a useful neurorehabilitation strategy to improve motor and cognitive function in MSA-P and MSA-C patients. However, further high-quality articles are required to examine the underlying mechanisms and standardized protocol of rTMS as well as its long-term effect.

Although primary isolation of HMPV has been achieved in several different cell lines, the low level of virus replication and the subsequent recovery of low levels of infectious HMPV have hampered biochemical studies on the virus. These experimental methodologies usually require higher levels of biological material that can be achieved following HMPV infection. In this study we demonstrate that expression of the HMPV F, G and M proteins in mammalian cells leads to HMPV virus-like particles (VLP) formation. This experimental strategy will serve as a model system to allow the process of HMPV virus assembly to be examined. METHODS: The HMPV F, G and M proteins were expressed in mammalian cell lines. Protein cross-linking studies, sucrose gradient centrifugation and in situ imaging was used to examine interactions between the virus proteins. VLP formation was examined using sucrose density gradient centrifugation and electron microscopy analysis. RESULTS: Analysis of cells co-expressing the F, G and M proteins demonstrated that these proteins interacted. Furthermore, in cells co-expression the three HMPV proteins the formation VLPs was observed. Image analysis revealed the VLPs had a similar morphology to the filamentous virus morphology that we observed on HMPV-infected cells. The capacity of each protein to initiate VLP formation was examined using a VLP formation assay. Individual expression of each virus protein showed that the G protein was able to form VLPs in the absence of the other virus proteins. Furthermore, co-expression of the G protein with either the M or F proteins facilitated their incorporation into the VLP fraction. CONCLUSION: Co-expression of the F, G and M proteins leads to the formation of VLPs, and that incorporation of the F and M proteins into VLPs is facilitated by their interaction with the G protein. Our data suggests that the G protein plays a central role in VLP formation, and further suggests that the G protein may also play a role in the recruitment of the F and M proteins to sites of virus particle formation during HMPV infection.","output":"Evidence for the interaction of the human metapneumovirus G and F proteins during virus-like particle formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unter einem virtuellen Team wird im Allgemeinen die Zusammenarbeit einer Gruppe von Personen auf Distanz mithilfe von Technologie verstanden.

CASE SUMMARY: A 31-year-old male smoker presented to the emergency department with atypical chest pain for 5 days. Blood investigations showed raised troponin enzymes. Review of his past medical history revealed decreased vision in the left eye, starting at the age of 10 years which progressed to blindness. He was diagnosed to have IGFBP7 mutation which causes eye manifestations in the form of FRAM.

According to global statistical data, severe COVID-19 with immune-system hyperactivity is observed mainly in elderly people. At the same time, aging is characterized by a decrease in immune responses. This paradox may be resolved by the assumption that DNA regions that can move along the genome with the copy and paste mechanism (retroelements) may play a role in COVID-19 development; these elements are characterized by abnormal expression patterns in aging. Their interaction with SARS-CoV-2 may occur at the level of RNA interference or RNA recombination, or the virus can use retroelement proteins to integrate into the host genome. There is supporting evidence of this interaction: data indicating the efficiency of antiretroviral drugs at the early stage of COVID-19, the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 for a long time after recovery, the persistence of coronavirus infections, and changes in the L1 retrotransposon expression patterns in the lung tissues of COVID-19 patients. In additional, retroelements affect the functioning of the immune system and affect the receptors interacting with SARS-CoV-2. Recombination with retroelements and viral insertions into host genomes have been demonstrated in the case of other infections caused by nonretroviral, RNA-containing viruses. The presumable interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and retroelements may explain the differences in the severity and lethality of COVID-19 in different countries as a result of specific insertional patterns in the genomes of individuals belonging to different human populations.

We assessed the cumulative incidence of acute of CV complications during hospitalisation for CAP in Internal Medicine Units (IMUs). METHODS: This was a prospective study carried out in 26 IMUs, enrolling patients consecutively hospitalised for CAP. Defined CV complications were: newly diagnosed heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, new onset of supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias, new onset hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Outcome measures were: in-hospital and 30-day mortality, length of hospital stay and rate of 30-day re-hospitalisation. RESULTS: A total of 1266 patients were enrolled, of these 23.8% experienced at least a CV event, the majority (15.5%) represented by newly diagnosed decompensated heart failure, and 75% occurring within 3 days. Female gender, a history of CV disease, and more severe pneumonia were predictors of CV events. In-hospital (12.2% vs 4.7%, p < 0.0001) and 30-day (16.3% vs 8.9%, p = 0.0001) mortality was higher in patients with CV events, as well as the re-hospitalisation rate (13.3% vs 9.3%, p = 0.002), and mean hospital stay was 11.4  6.9 vs 9.5  5.6 days (p < 0.0001).

However, the challenge that remains is the development of a method, experimental or computational, which can both determine the permeation rate and provide mechanistic insights into the transport process to help with the rational design of any given molecule. Typically, one of the following three methods are used to measure the membrane permeability: (1) experimental permeation assays acting on either artificial or natural membranes; (2) quantitative structureCpermeability relationship models that rely on experimental values of permeability or related pharmacokinetic properties of a range of molecules to infer those for new molecules; and (3) estimation of permeability from the Smoluchowski equation, where free energy and diffusion profiles along the membrane normal are taken as input from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. While all these methods provide estimates of permeation coefficients, they provide very little information for guiding rational drug design. In this study, we employ a highly parallelizable weighted ensemble (WE) path sampling strategy, empowered by cloud computing techniques, to generate unbiased permeation pathways and permeability coefficients for a set of drug-like molecules across a neat 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine membrane bilayer.

Results One hundred and twenty-one patients were recruited to COVID-RV, 118 underwent imaging and it was possible to determine the primary outcome in 112. RVD was present in seven (6.2% [95%CI; 2.5%, 12.5%]) patients. Thirty-day mortality was 85.7% in those with RVD, compared to 44.8% in those without (p=0.051). Patients with RVD were more likely to have; pulmonary thromboembolism (p<0.001), higher plateau pressure (p=0.048), lower dynamic compliance (p=0.031), higher NT-proBNP (p<0.006) and more frequent abnormal troponin (p=0.048). Abnormal NT-proBNP (OR 4.77 [1.22, 21.32], p=0.03) and abnormal Troponin (16.54 [4.98, 67.12], p<0.001) independently predicted 30-day mortality. Conclusion COVID-RV demonstrates a prevalence of RVD in ventilated patients with COVID-19 of 6.2% and is associated with a mortality of 85.7%. Association is observed between RVD and each of the aetiological domains of; ARDS, ventilation, micro/macro thrombi and myocardial injury.","output":"Right Ventricular Dysfunction in Ventilated Patients with COVID-19 (COVID-RV)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is highly active in acute promyelocytic leukemia but not in other types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

This phase I/II clinical trial investigated the safety and efficacy of TCP/ATRA treatment as salvage therapy for relapsed/refractory (r/r) AML. The combination was evaluated in 18 patients, ineligible for intensive treatment. The overall response rate was 20%, including two complete remissions without hematological recovery and one partial response. We also observed myeloid differentiation upon TCP/ATRA treatment in patients who did not reach clinical remission. Median overall survival (OS) was 3.3 months, and one-year OS 22%. One patient developed an ATRA-induced differentiation syndrome. The most frequently reported adverse events were vertigo and hypotension. TCP plasma levels correlated with intracellular TCP concentration. Increased H3K4me1 and H3k4me2 levels were observed in AML blasts and white blood cells from some TCP/ATRA treated patients. Combined TCP/ATRA treatment can induce differentiation of AML blasts and lead to clinical response in heavily pretreated patients with r/r AML with acceptable toxicity.

We described, from a narrative point of view, the experiences and perspectives of Italian SLE adults during the COVID-19 emergency, by distinguishing the illness experience before and after the lockdown. Methods: Fifteen patients were invited to participate. Illness narratives were collected between 22 and 29 March 2020 using a written modality to capture patients perspectives before and after the COVID-19 lockdown. We performed a two-fold analysis of collected data by distinguishing three narrative types and a qualitative analysis of content to identify the relevant themes and sub-themes reported. Results: Eight narratives included in the final analysis (mean length 436.9 words) have been written by eight females (mean age 43.3  9.9 years, mean disease duration 13.1  7.4 years). Six patients provided a quest narrative, one a chaos and the remaining one a restitution narrative. By text content analysis, we identified specific themes, temporally distinct before and after the lockdown. Before COVID-19, all the patients referred to a good control of disease, however the unexpected arrival of the COVID-19 emergency broke a balance, and patients perceived the loss of health status control, with anxiety and stress.

In this context, we examine whether reduced opportunity costs, such as having more free time and being unemployed, affect peoples entrepreneurial efforts, particularly regarding professionalized streaming activity. As such, we use an extensive longitudinal dataset gathered from the live-video streaming service Twitch.tv, and we exploit the changes and restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic to measure individuals responses to having to spend more time at home, also given that some streamers were more affected than others. By comparing newcomers to established streamers, we find that all streamers intensified their efforts during this period and that this effect was particularly strong for streamers who were somewhat but not fully professionalized prior to the pandemic. This is consistent with the view that low opportunity costs are advantageous for starting and professionalizing activities in the platform labor market, that the work is taken up because of a lack of alternatives and, thus, can provide a form of insurance. This especially holds for streamers who had reached a certain threshold pre COVID-19, as performing at this level enabled them to consider further professionalizing their streaming activities.

Then the animals were divided into three groups and received IV crystalloids at various rates, i.e. 5 ml/kg/h; 10 ml/kg/h; and 20 ml/kg/h.

These patients are increasingly susceptible to infection with various pathogens due to the excessive release of anti-inflammatory cytokines from anti-inflammatory effector cells. Recently, CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) found in the sera of mice with pancreatitis was identified as an active molecule for SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation. Also, the inhibitory activity of glycyrrhizin (GL) on CCL2 production was reported. Therefore, the effect of GL on SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation was investigated in a murine SIRS model. Without any stimulation, splenic T cells from mice 5 days after SIRS induction produced cytokines associated with anti-inflammatory response manifestation. However, these cytokines were not produced by splenic T cells from SIRS mice previously treated with GL. In dual-chamber transwells, IL-4-producing cells were generated from normal T cells cultured with peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) from SIRS mice. However, IL-4-producing cells were not generated from normal T cells in transwell cultures performed with PMN from GL-treated SIRS mice. CCL2 was produced by PMN from SIRS mice, while this chemokine was not demonstrated in cultures of PMN from SIRS mice treated with GL. These results indicate that GL has the capacity to suppress SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation through the inhibition of CCL2 production by PMN.","output":"Glycyrrhizin inhibits the manifestations of anti-inflammatory responses that appear in association with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)-like reactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ImportanceThromboses after the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1-S have been reported.

ResultsOf 46,162,942 adults, 21,193,814 (46%) had their first vaccination during follow-up. Adjusted HRs 1-28 days after ChAdOx1-S, compared with pre-vaccination rates, at ages <70 and []70 respectively, were 0.97 (95% CI: 0.90-1.05) and 0.58 (0.53-0.63) for venous thromboses, and 0.90 (0.86-0.95) and 0.76 (0.73-0.79) for arterial thromboses. Corresponding HRs for BNT162b2 were 0.81 (0.74-0.88) and 0.57 (0.53-0.62) for venous thromboses, and 0.94 (0.90-0.99) and 0.72 (0.70-0.75) for arterial thromboses. HRs for thrombotic events were higher at younger ages for venous thromboses after ChAdOx1-S, and for arterial thromboses after both vaccines. Rates of intracranial venous thrombosis (ICVT) and thrombocytopenia in adults aged <70 years were higher 1-28 days after ChAdOx1-S (adjusted HRs 2.27, 95% CI:1.33- 3.88 and 1.71, 1.35-2.16 respectively), but not after BNT162b2 (0.59, 0.24-1.45 and 1.00, 0.75-1.34) compared with pre-vaccination.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of HCA on CBF autoregulation with a validated method based on near-infrared spectroscopy. METHODS Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSco2) was monitored in 25 patients undergoing aortic reconstructive operations. HCA was used in 13 patients. Autoregulation was measured continuously during the operation by calculating the linear correlation coefficient between low-frequency changes in rSco2 and mean arterial pressure (MAP), generating the variable cerebral oximetry index (COx). When CBF autoregulation is functional, COx is near 0, because CBF and MAP are not correlated, but approaches 1 when autoregulation is impaired (ie, CBF is pressure passive). On the basis of prior studies, impaired autoregulation was defined as COx exceeding 0.3. RESULTS COx did not differ between HCA and non-HCA groups before cardiopulmonary bypass or during the cooling phase of the operation, although the lower limit of autoregulation tended to be lower in patients before HCA (p = 0.053). During patient rewarming, COx was lower in the HCA group (p = 0.045), and abnormal COx was less frequent (31% vs 75%, p = 0.047) compared with the non-HCA group. CONCLUSIONS During aortic reconstructive operations, CBF autoregulation is preserved during the cooling phase of the procedure in patients undergoing HCA.

However, creating this association is a time consuming process and requires substantial instructor effort. In this study, we present the results of crowdsourcing valuable insights into the underlying concepts of problems in mathematics and English writing, as a first step in leveraging the crowd to expedite the task of generating KCs. We presented crowdworkers with two problems in each domain and asked them to provide three explanations about why one problem is more challenging than the other. These explanations were then independently analyzed through (1) a series of qualitative coding methods and (2) several topic modeling techniques, to compare how they might assist in extracting KCs and other insights from the participant contributions. Results of our qualitative coding showed that crowdworkers were able to generate KCs that approximately matched those generated by domain experts. At the same time, the topic models outputs were evaluated against both the domain expert generated KCs and the results of the previous coding to determine effectiveness. Ultimately we found that while the topic modeling was not up to parity with the qualitative coding methods, it did assist in identifying useful clusters of explanations. This work demonstrates a method to leverage both the crowds knowledge and topic modeling to assist in the process of generating KCs for assessment items.","output":"Evaluating Crowdsourcing and Topic Modeling in Generating Knowledge Components from Explanations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and purpose - While many other countries implemented strict regulations and restrictions for their citizens during the 1st wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Sweden maintained a more restrained approach. The Swedish Public Health Agency emphasized individual responsibility and pushed for behavioral changes. With strict lockdown a 77% decrease in ankle fracture incidence has been reported. We investigated whether there was a change in the incidence of ankle fractures seen at 7 selected hospitals during the Covid-19 pandemic 2020.Patients and methods - Data on all ankle fractures treated at 7 selected departments during March 15 through June 15, 2020, and for the same period in the preceding 3 years (2017-2019), was retrieved from the Swedish Fracture Register. The number of fractures during the whole period and subsequent 30-day periods were compared between 2020 and 2017-2019, including subgroup analyses of age and sex.Results - The monthly rate of ankle fractures was reduced by 14% in 2020 (139 fractures) compared with 2017-2019 (161 fractures). Women had a 16% decrease and patients aged > 70 years had a 29% decrease. During the 1st 30-day period, a 26% decrease in fractures was seen.Interpretation - During the 1st wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a moderate decline in the number of ankle fractures was seen. Women and patients aged > 70 years displayed the greatest reduction. The greatest reduction in incidence of fractures was seen during the 1st 30-day period. This indicates greater adherence to government recommendations regarding social distancing in these subgroups and during the 1st month of the pandemic.

Aligning with the globalization of health and the factors affecting global burden of diseases, Nepal echoes the progressive increase in life expectancy, changes in diseases patterns, including the current impact of COVID-19. Nepals health system is also accommodating recent federalization, and thus it is critical to explore how the primary health care system is grappling the challenges amidst these changes. In this review, we conducted a narrative synthesis of literature to explore the challenges related to transformation of Nepals primary health care delivery system to meet the demands incurred by impact of globalization and recent federalization, covering following database: PubMED, Embase and Google Scholar. Of the 49 articles abstracted for full text review, 37 were included in the analyses. Existing theories were used for constructing the conceptual framework to explain the study findings. The results are divided into four themes. Additional searches were conducted to further support the narrative synthesis: a total of 46 articles were further included in the articulation of main findings. Transforming Nepals primary health care system requires a clear focus on following priority areas that include i) Revised efforts towards strengthening of community based primary health care units; ii) Adapting vertical programs to federal governance; iii) Reinforcing the health insurance scheme; and iv) Strengthening an existing network of community health workers and health human resources.

Methods: According to the province specific cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19 reported as of March 31, 2020, the low, medium and high-risk areas were classified. In these areas, a stratified two stage cluster random sampling method was used to select participants for face-to-face questionnaire surveys. Data on the incidence of ARI and related healthcare seeking behaviors in community residents during COVID-19 epidemic period were collected to calculate the attack rate of ARI and related healthcare seeking rate. Logistic regression method was used to explore the influencing factors for ARI incidence and healthcare seeking behavior. Results: A total of 34 857 community residents were surveyed, in whom 647 (1.9%) reported that they had ARI symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic period, and 241 (37.2%) had healthcare seeking behaviors. In terms of the incidence of COVID-19-related ARI, in high-risk area, the risk of COVID-19-related ARI was 1.36 times (95%CI: 1.12-1.65) than that in low-risk area; among different age groups, the risk of COVID-19-related ARI in age groups 20-39 years, 60 years was 1.80 times (95%CI: 1.29-2.59) and 1.63 times (95%CI: 1.14-2.40) than that in age group 1-9 years; the risk of COVID-19-related ARI in people with underlying diseases was 1.53 times (95%CI: 1.23-1.89) than that in those without underlying diseases; the risk of COVID-19-related ARI in people with contacts with confirmed cases of COVID-19 and people with fever or respiratory symptoms was 1.53 times (95%CI: 1.01-2.27) and 6.60 times (95%CI: 5.05-8.53) than those in people without these contacts. The healthcare seeking rate in COVID-19-related ARI patients with exposures to those with fever or respiratory symptoms was 1.68 times (95%CI: 1.05-2.70) than that in such patients without the exposures. Conclusions: The attack rate of COVID-19-related ARI was affected by the local epidemic level of COVID-19, and in high-risk area, the attack rate of COVID-19-related ARI was also high. The healthcare seeking rate in patients with COVID-19-related ARI was low.

The condition has heterogeneously been named as Chronic COVID syndrome, Post COVID-19 Syndrome, post-acute sequela of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), and the more familiar long COVID. Method: In order to capture all relevant published studies, we undertook a multi-step search with no language restriction. The following four-step search strategy was utilized: First, a preliminary (limited) search was conducted on January 20, 2021, in Google Scholar and PubMed to identify the appropriate keywords. Then, on January 30, 2021, we adopted a search strategy of electronic databases from Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of sciences, using those keywords. Then, after duplicate removal, we screened all titles, abstracts, and full texts. This resulted in 66 eligible studies. Subsequently, after a forward and backward search of their references and citations an additional 54 publications were found, resulting in a total of 120 publications that formed the basis of the present analysis. The titles, abstracts, and full-texts of non-English articles were translated using Google Translate for further evaluation. We conducted our scoping review based on the PRISMA-ScR Checklist. Results: We found only one randomized clinical trial in our search. Of the 67 original studies, 22 were cohort and 28 were cross-sectional studies totaling 74.6% of the original studies. Of the total of 120 publications, 59 (49.1%) focused on signs and symptoms, 28 (23.3%) were focused on management, and 13 (10.8%) focused on pathophysiology. Ten (9%) publications focused on imaging studies. Ninety-one percent of the original investigations came from high and upper-middle-income countries, highlighting the scarcity of reports originating from low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Conclusion: The predominant symptoms among those with the so-called Long COVIDwere: fatigue, breathlessness, arthralgia, sleep difficulties, and chest pain. Recent reports also point to the risk of long-term sequela with cutaneous, respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, mental health, neurologic, and renal involvement in those who survive the acute phase of the illness. The ambiguity and controversies in its definition have impaired proper recognition and management of those requiring additional support following the resolution of the acute phase of this infection. This has resulted in long-standing distress for the patients and their families. Our findings highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach, support, and rehabilitation for these patients in terms of long-term mental and physical health.","output":"Long COVID, A Comprehensive Systematic Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Flow control during endovascular stroke treatment with stent-retrievers is crucial for successful revascularization. The standard technique recommended by stent-retriever manufacturers implies obstruction of the respective access catheter by the microcatheter, through which the stent-retriever is delivered. This, in turn, results in reduced aspiration during thrombectomy. In order to maximize aspiration, we fully retract the microcatheter out of the access catheter before thrombectomy-an approach we term the 'bare wire thrombectomy' (BWT) technique. We verified the improved throughput with systematic in vitro studies and assessed the clinical effectiveness and safety of this method. METHODS We compared aspiration flow of water through various access catheters (5-8 F) with a Rebar microcatheter (0.18 inch and 0.27 inch) and a Trevo stent-retriever using the standard technique and the BWT technique in vitro. We also retrospectively analyzed 302 retrieval maneuvers in 117 patients who received endovascular treatment with a stent-retriever between February 2010 and April 2015. RESULTS In the in vitro experiment, removal of the microcatheter in all tested settings resulted in significantly increased aspiration flow through the access catheter (p<0.001). This effect was particularly pronounced in access catheters with a diameter of 7 F. In the clinical study, the revascularization rate (Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction 2b) was 91%. There were no complications associated with the BWT technique in 302 retrieval maneuvers. CONCLUSIONS The BWT technique results in improved aspiration flow rates compared with the standard deployment technique. Our clinical data show that the BWT technique is effective and safe.","output":"Optimizing endovascular stroke treatment: removing the microcatheter before clot retrieval with stent-retrievers increases aspiration flow."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Often the first opportunity for clinicians to assess risk of preterm birth is when women present with threatened preterm labour symptoms (such as period-like pain, tightenings or back ache). However, threatened preterm labour symptoms are not a strong predictor of imminent birth. Clinicians are then faced with a complex clinical dilemma, the need to ameliorate the consequences of preterm birth requires consideration with the side-effects and costs. The QUiPP app is a validated app which can aid clinicians when they triage a women who is in threatened preterm labour. AIM: Our aim was to produce a toolkit to promote a best practice pathway for women who arrive in threatened preterm labour. METHODS: We worked with two hospitals in South London. This included the aid of a toolkit midwife at each hospital. We also undertook stakeholder focus groups and worked with two Maternity Voice Partnership groups to ensure a diverse range of voices was heard in the toolkit development. While we aimed to produce the toolkit in September 2020, we rapidly rolled out and produced the first version of the toolkit in April 2020 due to COVID-19. As the QUiPP app can reduce admissions and hospital transfers, there was a need to enable all hospitals in England to have access to the toolkit as soon as possible. RESULTS: While the rapid rollout of The QUiPP App Toolkit due to COVID-19 was not planned, it has demonstrated that toolkits to improve clinical practice can be produced promptly. Through actively welcoming continued feedback meant the initial version of the toolkit could be continually and iteratively refined. The toolkit has been recommended nationally, with National Health Service England recommending the app and toolkit in their COVID-19 update to the Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle and in the British Association of Perinatal Medicine Antenatal Optimisation Toolkit.","output":"Development and rapid rollout of The QUiPP App Toolkit for women who arrive in threatened preterm labour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmits from person to person mainly through respiratory droplets and coughing.

Infection severity largely depends on individual's immune response, age and co-morbidities. Present study categorized COVID-19 infected patients based on their infection severity and linked COVID-19 severity with age, gender and ABO blood group types. Clinical details of 383 COVID-19 patients were collected from Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital (RGSSH), India; divided into three groups; mild, moderate and severe patients, based on their symptoms. Present analysis revealed that age plays major role in infection severity, as the symptoms are more severe in patients above 45 years. Infection rate was higher in males compared to females. Most patients with A(+ve) and B(+ve) blood group were severely affected compared to those of blood group type O(+ve) and AB(+ve). O(+ve) blood group was least represented in severe patients.

Infants born less than 37 weeks gestation, who underwent PDAL prior to discharge home, with no other structural cardiac abnormality, were included. Information collected included: patient demographics, pre and post-operative clinical characteristics, pre-operative medical management, post-operative complications and outcome. RESULTS: Over the study, 263 infants underwent PDAL an incidence of 3.07 per 10,000 live births. 88% were born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks) and 60% were male. The commonest reasons for ligation were inability to wean respiratory support (83.7%) and haemodynamically significant PDA (87.8%). Pre-operatively 65.7% received medical therapy. Surgery was performed at a median age of 33 days (range 9-260, IQR 24-48); the corrected age was less than 31 + 6 week in 50.6% babies at PDAL.

Despite rapid progress in the development of biomedical techniques, it is still a significant challenge to find promising new antiviral targets and drugs. In the past, antiviral drugs mainly targeted viral proteins when they were used as part of treatment strategies. Since the virus mutation rate is much faster than that of the host, such drugs feature drug resistance and narrow-spectrum antiviral problems. Therefore, the targeting of host molecules has gradually become an important area of research for the development of antiviral drugs. In recent years, rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques have enabled numerous genetic studies (such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening, etc.) for human diseases, providing valuable genetic and evolutionary resources. Furthermore, it has been revealed that successful drug targets exhibit similar genetic and evolutionary features, which are of great value in identifying promising drug targets and discovering new drugs. Considering these developments, in this article the authors propose a host-targeted antiviral drug discovery strategy based on knowledge of genetics and evolution. We first comprehensively summarized the genetic, subcellular location, and evolutionary features of the human genes that have been successfully used as antiviral targets. Next, the summarized features were used to screen novel druggable antiviral targets and to find potential antiviral drugs, in an attempt to promote the discovery of new antiviral drugs.","output":"Facilitating Antiviral Drug Discovery Using Genetic and Evolutionary Knowledge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By gathering data on people during their ordinary daily activities, we tested if looking at, but not manipulating, smartphones led to a mimicry response in the observer.

We aim to document the Lebanese experience in the repatriation of citizens during COVID-19 which allow us to disclose encountered challenges and lessons learned. METHODS: This is a retrospective description of processes involved in the phased repatriation of Lebanese citizens. The Mission consisted of 4 phases starting, April 5th until June 19th 2020. The prioritization of returnees was based on both medical and social risk assessment. The repatriation team was divided into four groups: the aircraft team, the airport team, the hotel team and the follow up team. On arrival, all returning citizens were tested using Polymerase chain Reaction (PCR) based technique, and were obliged to adhere to a mandatory facility quarantine for 24 to 48 h. Returning travelers who were tested positive for COVID-19 were transferred to the hospital. Those who were tested negative were urged to strictly comply with home-quarantine for a duration of 14 days. They were followed up on a daily basis by the repatriation team. RESULTS: Overall, 25,783 Lebanese citizens have returned home during the phased repatriation. The third phase ranked the uppermost in regard of the number of citizens repatriated. The total number of performed PCR tests at the airport upon arrival was 14,893 with an average percentage of around 1% positivity for COVID-19. On the other hand, more than 10,687 repatriates underwent external PCR requisite in the third and fourth phases. Two hundred seventy-two repatriates were tested positive for COVID-19 upon their arrival.

This period could have been particularly painful for the patients due to the virus itself, and to the difficulty to access to healthcare facilities due to the lockdown. Objectives: To assess the impact of the lockdown in patients under biologics. Methods: This is a descriptive study, conducted between 03/01/2021 and 07/31/2021 in the Department of Rheumatology of the University Hospital of Ibn Rochd in Casablanca. Inclusion criteria were all patients on biologics during the lockdown period. The number of painful, swollen joints, pain visual analogue scale, and disease activity were collected before and during the lockdown. Results: Thirty-one patients under biologics were included. The average age was 43.4 years. There were 17 males and 14 females (sex ratio M/F 1,21). Cormibidities were hypertension and type 2 diabetes (9.7%), hypertension and dyslipidemia (6.5%), arrhythmia (6.5%), smoking (9.7%), hypertension and dysthyroidism (3.2%). All the patients were under biologics with an average duration of 2 years distributed as follows: 3 patients on etanercept (9.67%), 8 patients on tocilizumab (28.8%), 10 patients on infliximab (32.25%), 5 patients on adalimumab (16.12%)), 4 patients under golimumab (12.90%), 1 under secukinumab (3.22%). Biologics were associated with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in 38.7% (methotrexate 12.9%, salosopyrine25, 8%), corticosteroids in 25.7%, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in 16.1%. The disease activity before COVID-19 of the patients was: 48.39% weak activity, 35.4% remission, 16.13% moderate activity. No patient reported a flare of the disease. During lockdown, 5 patients reported a flare of their disease (16.12%) They were followed for: 2 spondyloarthritis, 1 rheumatoid arthritis, 1 psoriatic arthritis, 1 adult onset Still's disease. All the patients have temporarily stopped their drugs because they couldn't come to their appointments because of the lockdown. Conclusion: Our study notes that the patients who kept their follow-up during lockdown have maintained a control of their disease activity. Our results are consistent with the observations of a French study on the impact of lockdown on the activity of rheumatoid arthritis.

Substantial reduction in availability of substances would present a unique opportunity to consider the supply-side hypothesis that reductions in drug availability will lead to reductions in drug prevalence. METHODS: Longitudinal data come from Monitoring the Future and are based on responses from 582 adolescents who were originally surveyed as part of a national sample of 12th grade students in early 2020, one month before social distancing policies began. They were surveyed again after social distancing policies were implemented, in the summer of 2020. RESULTS: Perceived availability of marijuana and alcohol declined across the two survey waves at the largest levels ever recorded in the 46 years of the project, by an absolute 17 %, p < .01 and 24 %, p < .01, respectively. Despite these declines, prevalence levels did not significantly change across the two waves for marijuana use in the past 30 days or for binge drinking in the past two weeks.

This study highlights the factors related to intentions to comply with newly issued health directives during an ongoing extreme crisis, such as the current pandemic. In addition, it compares the impact of these factors on different minority groups and the general population in Israel. METHODS Using an online survey (N=1005), we examined the impact of compliance-related factors on compliance intentions with newly issued health directives in two minority groups in Israel: the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community (N=323) and the Arab community (N=361), as well as in the general population (N=321), during the first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Participants were presented with a new made-up COVID-19-related instruction simulated to be issued by the Israeli Ministry of Health. Compliance intentions and compliance-related factors were measured. RESULTS The Arab minority expressed greater intentions of complying with the instructions than the other groups. Perceptions on risk and the effectiveness of the instruction were the only two significantly associated factors with compliance intentions in all of the social groups. Additional factors affected different groups to different extents. Trust in government was related to compliance intentions only in the Arab minority. CONCLUSION Intentions to comply with health instructions during a crisis differ in various minority groups and in comparison to the general population, both in their levels and in the factors related to them. Policy-makers and health authorities should consider providing information about the risks and negative outcomes of the crisis as well as the expected effectiveness of the recommended behaviors. Future research should examine other minority groups and other types of instructions in different stages of a crisis.","output":"\\"Apples and Oranges:\\" Examining Different Social Groups' Compliance With Government Health Instructions During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In surgery of repair for spina bifida, various skin plastic techniques are sometimes necessary due to large skin defect or subsequent ulcers in cases when approximation on the midline is difficult. CASE REPORT A baby was born with a large skin defect due to huge lumbar myeloschisis and kyphosis, which was repaired 2 days after birth using Limberg's skin flap at the peak of kyphosis. Skin ischemia around the tip of the flap gradually enlarged and resulted in a large skin ulcer. We performed negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) using a Vacuum Assisted Closure (V.A.C.?) therapy system for 4 weeks which shrank the ulcer remarkably. Subsequently, a pedicle skin flap without graft was performed to cover the rest of the ulcer, which adapted well without CSF leakage postoperatively. CONCLUSION A combination treatment of NPWT and skin plastic surgery was successfully performed for a very young infant with spina bifida. NPWT could be another useful option for the treatment of ulcer following spina bifida repair surgery, though surgeons should carefully confirm that there is no CSF leakage before and during the procedure.","output":"Negative pressure wound therapy for a large skin ulcer following repair of huge myeloschisis with kyphosis in a newborn."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Understanding the experiences of ICU patients with COVID-11 helps to provide the unique care activities, improve the quality of care and promote health status, thereby creating a window for mutual understanding between the treatment team and the patients. Objectives: The present study aimed to explore lived experiences of critically ill patients with COVID-11 after discharge from intensive care units of hospitals in Iran. Methods: The present study was qualitative research with a hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Participants were purposefully selected from critically ill patients with COVID-11 who were discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) and transferred to the general ward. Data were mostly collected through in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews and, in some cases, telephone calls. Data were analyzed using the method of Dickelman et al. (1196). Guba and Lincoln's (1191) criteria were used to achieve data authenticity. Results: Data were obtained from 15 COVID-11 recovered patients with a history of ICU admission. Twelve participants were female and four were male with a mean age of 26 years. The four main themes were identified along with their subthemes: Perception of death before dying (worry, helplessness, and expecting a different death), social stigma (social isolation and stigma), a nurse as a symbol of rebirth (a compassionate and supportive nurse and the supportive role of others), and meaningful life (a change in outlook on life and the manifestation of spirituality). Conclusion: The results of the present study indicated that personal thoughts such as thinking about death and social treatments such as stigma can lead to threatening physical and psychological problems in COVID-11 patients. Nurses and family members can prevent many of these problems by providing holistic care and psychological support. Apart from the challenges posed by the disease, post-recovery changes in patients' attitudes toward life can be considered as a positive point.","output":"Lived experiences of critically ill patients with covid-11 after discharge from intensive care unit: A phenomenological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]the mechanisms that give rise to the new LOR are more formal, explicit, and coercive.

Research has been hindered by both the inability in blinding the exposure, and by the need for recruiting large enough cohorts. The aim of this study is to investigate whether using a new form of air purifier using plasma air purification (PAP) in operating rooms (ORs) lowers the SSI rate or not. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Multicentre, double-blind, cluster-randomised, placebo-controlled trial conducted at seven hospitals in 2017-2022. All patients that undergo orthopaedic surgery for minimum 30 min are included. Intervention group: patients operated in OR with PAP devices turned on. CONTROL GROUP: patients operated in OR with PAP devices turned off. Randomisation: each OR will be randomised in periods of 4 weeks, 6 weeks or 8 weeks to either have the devices on or off. PRIMARY OUTCOME: any SSI postoperatively defined as a composite endpoint of any of the following: use of isoxazolylpenicillin, clindamycin or rifampicin for 2 days or more, International Classification of Diseases codes or Nordic Medico-Statistical Committee codes indicating postoperative infection. In a second step, we will perform a chart review on those patients with positive indicators of SSI to further validate the outcome. Secondary outcomes are described in the Methods section. Power: we assume an SSI rate of 2%, an SSI reduction rate of 25% and we need approximately 45 000 patients to attain a power of 80% at a significance level of 0.05.

The role of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in the event of COVID-19-associated cardiovascular collapse has not yet been established. We reviewed existing literature surrounding the role of VA-ECMO in the treatment of coronavirus-related cardiovascular collapse. COVID-19 is associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular complications compared to previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV). We found only one case report from China where COVID-19-associated fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock (CS) was successfully rescued using VA-ECMO as a bridge to recovery (BTR). We identified potential clinical scenarios (cardiac injury, myocardial infarction with and without obstructive coronary artery disease, viral myocarditis, and decompensated heart failure) leading to CS and risk factors for poor/uncertain benefit (age, sepsis, mixed/predominantly vasodilatory shock, prothrombotic state and/or coagulopathy, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure or high-risk prognostic scores) specific to using VA-ECMO as BTR in COVID-19 infection. Additional considerations and proposed recommendations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic were formulated with guidance from published data and expert consensus. A small subset of patients with cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 infection may progress to refractory CS. Accepting that resource scarcity may be the overwhelming concern for healthcare systems during this pandemic, VA-ECMO can be considered in highly selected cases of refractory CS and echocardiographic evidence of biventricular failure.

BrS is a challenging entity, in regard to diagnosis as well as arrhythmia risk prediction and management. Nowadays, asymptomatic patients represent the majority of newly diagnosed patients with BrS, and its incidence is expected to rise due to (genetic) family screening. Progress in our understanding of the genetic and molecular pathophysiology is limited by the absence of a true gold standard, with consensus on its clinical definition changing over time. Nevertheless, novel insights continue to arise from detailed and in-depth studies, including the complex genetic and molecular basis. This includes the increasingly recognised relevance of an underlying structural substrate. Risk stratification in patients with BrS remains challenging, particularly in those who are asymptomatic, but recent studies have demonstrated the potential usefulness of risk scores to identify patients at high risk of arrhythmia and SCD. Development and validation of a model that incorporates clinical and genetic factors, comorbidities, age and gender, and environmental aspects may facilitate improved prediction of disease expressivity and arrhythmia/SCD risk, and potentially guide patient management and therapy.

Clinical trial data available thus far have been obtained primarily in patients with resistant hypertension, defined as standardized systolic clinic blood pressure  160 mm Hg (or  150 mm Hg in patients with type 2 diabetes) despite appropriate pharmacologic treatment with at least 3 antihypertensive drugs, including a diuretic agent. Accordingly, these criteria and blood pressure thresholds should be borne in mind when selecting patients for renal nerve ablation. Secondary forms of hypertension and pseudoresistance, such as nonadherence to medication, intolerance of medication, and white coat hypertension, should have been ruled out, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is mandatory in this context. Because there are theoretical concerns with regard to renal safety, selected patients should have preserved renal function, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate  45 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Optimal periprocedural management of volume status and medication regimens at specialized and experienced centers equipped with adequate infrastructure to cope with potential procedural complications will minimize potential patient risks. Long-term safety and efficacy data are limited to 3 years of follow-up in small patient cohorts, so efforts to monitor treated patients are crucial to define the long-term performance of the procedure. Although renal nerve ablation could have beneficial effects in other conditions characterized by elevated renal sympathetic nerve activity, its potential use for such indications should currently be limited to formal research studies of its safety and efficacy.","output":"International expert consensus statement: Percutaneous transluminal renal denervation for the treatment of resistant hypertension."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of novel coronavirus (nCoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has posed an international public health emergency worldwide and forced people to be confined in their homes.

Few studies have adjusted for confounding for different clinical outcomes including all reported cases within a country.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 20,293 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported between 1 March and 28 April 2020 through the national epidemiological surveillance system. We calculated absolute risk, relative risk (RR) and adjusted relative risk (aRR) to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with hospitalisation, ICU admission and death using Poisson regressions. RESULTS: Increasing age ( 60 years) was the major determinant for all outcomes. Age  90 years was the strongest determinant of hospital admission (aRR: 6.1), and 70C79 years for ICU (aRR: 10.4). Comorbidities of cardiovascular, immunodeficiency, kidney and lung disease (aRR: 4.3, 2.8, 2.4, 2.0, respectively) had stronger associations with ICU admission, while for death they were kidney, cardiovascular and chronic neurological disease (aRR: 2.9, 2.6, 2.0).

Secondary use of EHR data includes research, quality, and educational initiatives. Fundamental to secondary use is a framework to ensure fidelity, transparency, and completeness of the source data. In developing this framework, competing priorities must be considered as to which data sources are used and how data are organized and incorporated into a useable format. In assembling perioperative data from diverse institutions across the United States and Europe, the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG) has developed methods to support such a framework. This special article outlines how MPOG has approached considerations of data structure, validation, and accessibility to support multicenter integration of perioperative EHRs. In this multicenter practice registry, MPOG has developed processes to extract data from the perioperative EHR; transform data into a standardized format; and validate, deidentify, and transfer data to a secure central Coordinating Center database. Participating institutions may obtain access to this central database, governed by quality and research committees, to inform clinical practice and contribute to the scientific and clinical communities. Through a rigorous and standardized approach to ensure data integrity, MPOG enables data to be usable for quality improvement and advancing scientific knowledge. As of March 2019, our collaboration of 46 hospitals has accrued 10.7 million anesthesia records with associated perioperative EHR data across heterogeneous vendors. Facilitated by MPOG, each site retains access to a local repository containing all site-specific perioperative data, distinct from source EHRs and readily available for local research, quality, and educational initiatives. Through committee approval processes, investigators at participating sites may additionally access multicenter data for similar initiatives. Emerging from this work are 4 considerations that our group has prioritized to improve data quality: (1) data should be available at the local level before Coordinating Center transfer; (2) data should be rigorously validated against standardized metrics before use; (3) data should be curated into computable phenotypes that are easily accessible; and (4) data should be collected for both research and quality improvement purposes because these complementary goals bolster the strength of each endeavor.","output":"Considerations for Integration of Perioperative Electronic Health Records Across Institutions for Research and Quality Improvement: The Approach Taken by the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regular exercise fosters fitness-enhancing benefits. We assume that exercise interventions become successful and sustainable if physiological benefits of exercise are also subjectively perceivable. The goal of this study was to examine how young inactive adults physiologically respond to an exercise intervention and how those responses are subjectively experienced. Furthermore, we aimed to assess whether the sequence of two distinct endurance-based exercise modes has an impact on physiological and subjectively experienced physical fitness. Thirty-one young inactive adults were assessed for this substudy of the larger iReAct study. Participants were randomly assigned to a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or a moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) group for 6 weeks and subsequently switched groups for a second training period. Physiological fitness data was collected at baseline, follow-up I, and follow-up II using a graded cardiopulmonary exercise test. Subjectively reconstructed (i.e., retrospective constructions) experiences relating to physical fitness were assessed at follow-up II using a biographical mapping method. A repeated-measures one-way ANOVA on each training group was performed to see whether physiological and subjectively experienced fitness differed across training periods. The rate of change between all variables was calculated for the first and the second training period in order to compare the agreement between physiological and subjective fitness improvements. Participants increased their fitness across the intervention period both physiologically and subjectively. However, the rate of change depended on the sequence of the two training modes. While VO(2max) increased significantly in both training periods in the MICT-HIIT sequence, a significant increase in VO(2max) in the HIIT-MICT sequence was only observed in the HIIT period. Participants similarly perceived those increases subjectively in their exercise-related physical fitness, although they experienced a significant decrease in the second period of the HIIT-MICT sequence. For subjectively perceived physical fitness relating to everyday activities, significant increases were only observed for the first period of the MICT-HIIT sequence. Young inactive adults can improve both their physiological and their subjectively perceived fitness through regular exercise. However, exercise modes and their sequence can make a substantial difference regarding measured and perceived physical fitness. Additionally, despite a favorable tendency toward HIIT over MICT, inter- and intra-individual variability, particularly in the subjective experiences of fitness, reiterates the necessity of individualized approaches to exercise.","output":"Does Becoming Fit Mean Feeling (f)it?

The active shoulder abduction angles of the affected side and the patient-reported shoulder-specific quality-of-life recovery score of the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) questionnaire were examined at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively. Additionally, the association between these outcomes and risk factors for shoulder impairment were investigated. RESULTS: The average active shoulder abduction angles were significantly improved at 3 and 6 months postoperatively compared with 1 month postoperatively (96.5  4.3 at 1 month versus 110.1  4.7 at 3 months, p = 0.035, and versus 142.0  4.6 at 6 months, p < 0.0001). The proportion of patients who were unable to abduct their shoulders by 150 or more was significantly lower at 6 months postoperatively (41.5%) compared with 1 month postoperatively (82.4%, p < 0.0001). The WORC score significantly improved from 60.4  2.4% at 1 month postoperatively to 67.9  2.6% at 6 months postoperatively (p = 0.036). Multivariate analysis revealed that postoperative radiotherapy was a significant risk factor for shoulder impairment at 3 and 6 months postoperatively (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027, respectively), and that level V dissection and head and neck irradiation were significant risk factors for a worse shoulder outcome at 6 and 9 months postoperatively (respective p values for level V dissection and head and neck irradiation were p = 0.049 and p = 0.030 at 6 months postoperatively, and p = 0.016 and p = 0.013 at 9 months postoperatively).

Postoperative radiotherapy was a predictor of poor shoulder function in the early postoperative period; both level V dissection and head and neck irradiation were predictors of poor shoulder function at 6 and 9 months after neck dissection.","output":"Shoulder function after neck dissection: Assessment via a shoulder-specific quality-of-life questionnaire and active shoulder abduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines emerging trends in the responses of governments and religious communities to the COVID-19 health crisis.

While pharmacological solutions are being developed and implemented, the onus of mitigating the impact of the virus falls, in part, on individual citizens and their adherence to public health guidelines. However, promoting adherence to these guidelines has proven challenging. There is a pressing need to understand the factors that influence peoples adherence to these guidelines in order to improve public compliance. To this end, the current study investigated whether peoples perceptions of others adherence predict their own adherence. We also investigated whether any influence of perceived social norms was mediated by perceptions of the moral wrongness of non-adherence, anticipated shame for non-adherence, or perceptions of disease severity. One hundred fifty-two Australians participated in our study between June 6, 2020 and August 21, 2020. Findings from this preliminary investigation suggest that (1) people match their behavior to perceived social norms, and (2) this is driven, at least in part, by people using others behavior as a cue to the severity of disease threat. Such findings provide insight into the proximate and ultimate bases of norm-following behavior, and shed preliminary light on public health-related behavior in the context of a pandemic. Although further research is needed, the results of this studywhich suggest that people use others behavior as a cue to how serious the pandemic is and as a guide for their own behaviorcould have important implications for public health organizations, social movements, and political leaders and the role they play in the fight against epidemics and pandemics.","output":"Why Do People (Not) Engage in Social Distancing?

The potential inverse relation of HDL to coronary artery disease (CAD) and the effects of HDL on myriad other inflammatory conditions warrant a better understanding of the genetic basis of the HDL proteome. We conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of the regulation of the proteome of HDL isolated from a panel of 100 diverse inbred strains of mice (the hybrid mouse diversity panel) and examined protein composition and efflux capacity to identify novel factors that affect the HDL proteome. Genetic analysis revealed widely varied HDL protein levels across the strains. Some of this variation was explained by local cis-acting regulation, termed cis-protein quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Variations in apoA-II and apoC-3 affected the abundance of multiple HDL proteins, indicating a coordinated regulation. We identified modules of covarying proteins and defined a protein-protein interaction network that describes the protein composition of the naturally occurring subspecies of HDL in mice. Sterol efflux capacity varied up to 3-fold across the strains, and HDL proteins displayed distinct correlation patterns with macrophage and ABCA1-specific cholesterol efflux capacity and cholesterol exchange, suggesting that subspecies of HDL participate in discrete functions. The baseline and stimulated sterol efflux capacity phenotypes were associated with distinct QTLs with smaller effect size, suggesting a multigenetic regulation. Our results highlight the complexity of HDL particles by revealing the high degree of heterogeneity and intercorrelation, some of which is associated with functional variation, and support the concept that HDL-cholesterol alone is not an accurate measure of HDLs properties, such as protection against CAD.","output":"Genetic control of the mouse HDL proteome defines HDL traits, function, and heterogeneity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have come to be accepted as the gold standard for assessing the efficacy and effectiveness of therapeutics and interventions in medicine. In this paper, we aim to describe some evolving concepts associated with the design and conduct of RCTs and outline new approaches aiming to increase efficiency and reduce costs. RECENT FINDINGS A well-powered and performed RCT is usually a study involving several different centers from different geographical areas that enrolls a large number of patients in diverse clinical settings. Altogether, these features increase the generalizability of the study and make the rapid implementation of the findings more likely. However, this does not come without cost. Among several possible alternatives to conventional RCTs, the most important ones are related to the unit of randomization (individual vs. cluster), study design (conventional vs. adaptive), randomization scheme (fixed vs. response-adaptive), data collection (conventional case report forms vs. registry-embedded) and statistical approach (frequentist vs. Bayesian).

Previous research demonstrates that belongingness to social groups can promote prosocial, preventive health behaviors. The current research tests the effects of belongingness to two types of groups, intimate (family) and social category (nation), on intentions to comply with preventive health behaviors and reasons for these behaviors. We conducted three studies using French participants at low risk of grave effects from COVID-19 (total N = 875). In Study 1, across three time periods, belongingness was correlated with greater intentions to comply with preventive behaviors when these behaviors were not enforced by law. In Study 2, we experimentally manipulated threat to belongingness (vs. no threat). When belongingness was threatened, participants were less concerned with protecting vulnerable people. Closeness to family predicted preventive behavior intentions and both self-centered and prosocial reasons for these behaviors, regardless of condition. National identification buffered the negative effects of the threat to belongingness condition on preventive behavior intentions. In Study 3, we experimentally primed thoughts of belongingness to family vs. nation vs. control condition. We found greater intentions to engage in preventive behaviors and greater concern with protecting oneself and close relatives in the family condition. In summary, belongingness to one's family promotes preventive behavior intentions and the reasons given are to protect both oneself and others. Self-reported (but not primed) national identification can be related to prevention behavior intentions under certain conditions.","output":"Do it for others!

The molecular mechanisms by which combinations of mutations, especially those remote from the active site, alter drug binding to confer resistance are poorly understood and thus difficult to counteract. A machine learning strategy was developed that coupled parallel molecular dynamics simulations with experimental potency to identify specific conserved mechanisms underlying resistance. Physical features were extracted from the simulations, analyzed, and integrated into one consistent and interpretable elastic network model. To rigorously test this strategy, HIV-1 protease variants with diverse mutations were used, with potencies ranging from picomolar to micromolar to the drug darunavir. Feature reduction resulted in a model with four specific features that predicts for both the training and test sets inhibitor binding free energy within 1 kcal/mol of the experimental value over this entire range of potency. These predictive features are physically interpretable, as they vary specifically with affinity and diagonally transverse across the protease homodimer. This physics-based strategy of parallel molecular dynamics and machine learning captures mechanisms by which complex combinations of mutations confer resistance and identify critical features that serve as bellwethers of affinity, which will be critical in future drug design.","output":"Deciphering Complex Mechanisms of Resistance and Loss of Potency through Coupled Molecular Dynamics and Machine Learning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter explores the significance of Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet represented in the films and pop music.

However, the lack of adequate testing kits could be a bottleneck, especially in the case of unanticipated new diseases, such as COVID-19, where the testing technology, manufacturing capability, distribution, human skills and laboratories might be unavailable or in short supply. In addition, the cost of the standard PCR test is approximately USD 48, which is prohibitive for poorer patients and most governments. We address this bottleneck by proposing a test methodology that pools the sample from two (or more) patients in a single test. The key insight is that a single negative result from a pooled sample likely implies negative infection of all the individual patients. and It thereby rules out further tests for the patients. This protocol, therefore, requires significantly fewer tests. This may, however, result in somewhat increased false negatives. Our simulations show that combining samples from two patients with 7% underlying likelihood of infection implies that 36% fewer test kits are required, with 14% additional units of time for testing.","output":"Accelerated infection testing at scale: a proposal for inference with single test on multiple patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with pituitary tumours, ensuing hormonal abnormalities and mass effects are usually followed in multidisciplinary pituitary clinics and can represent a management challenge even during the times of non-pandemic.

In the face of the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic, we do not know whether patients with IBD will be more susceptible to infection or disease. We hypothesized that the viral entry molecules angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are expressed in the intestine. We further hypothesized that their expression could be affected by inflammation or medication usage. METHODS: We examined the expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 by quantitative polymerase chain reacion in animal models of IBD. Publicly available data from organoids and mucosal biopsies from patients with IBD were examined for expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We conducted RNA sequencing for CD11b-enriched cells and peripheral and lamina propria T-cells from well-annotated patient samples. RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundantly expressed in the ileum and colon and had high expression in intestinal epithelial cells. In animal models, inflammation led to downregulation of epithelial Ace2. Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not increased in samples from patients with compared with those of control patients. In CD11b-enriched cells but not T-cells, the level of expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the mucosa was comparable to other functional mucosal genes and was not affected by inflammation. Anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and steroids were linked to significantly lower expression of ACE2 in CD11b-enriched cells. CONCLUSIONS: The viral entry molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the ileum and colon.

METHODS: Two-dose VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection or hospitalization among adults 18-years-old, including due to Alpha, Gamma and Delta variants of concern (VOC), was assessed at 14 days post-vaccination by test-negative design studies separately conducted in British Columbia and Quebec, Canada between May 30 and November 27 (epi-weeks 22-47), 2021. RESULTS: In both provinces, all homologous or heterologous mRNA and/or ChAdOx1 two-dose schedules were associated with 90% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization risk for at least 7 months. With slight decline from a peak of >90%, VE against infection was 80% for at least 6 months following homologous mRNA vaccination, lower by 10% when both doses were ChAdOx1 but comparably-high following heterologous ChAdOx1 + mRNA receipt. Findings were similar by age group, sex and VOC. VE was significantly higher with longer 7C8-week vs. manufacturer-specified 3C4-week interval between mRNA doses. CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of any mRNA and/or ChAdOx1 combination gave substantial and sustained protection against SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization, spanning Delta-dominant circulation. ChAdOx1 VE against infection was improved by heterologous mRNA series completion.

These services largely breakdowns due to restrictions on border movements, confined travel and transportation services, a decline in international tourists' visitation, nationwide lockdowns, and maintaining social distancing in the population. Although these measures are highly needed to contain coronavirus, it decreases economic and financial activities in a country, which requires smart solutions to globally subsidize the services sector. The study used different COVID-19 measures, and its resulting impact on the services industry by using world aggregated data from 1975 through 2020. The study benefited from the Keynesian theory of aggregate demand that remains provided a solution to minimize economic shocks through stringent or liberalizing economic policies. The COVID-19 pandemic is more severe than the financial shocks of 2018 that affected almost all sectors of the globalized world, particularly the services sector, which has been severally affected by COVID-19; it is a high time to revisit economic policies to control pandemic recession. The study used quantiles regression and innovation accounting matrix to obtain ex-ante and ex-post analysis. The quantile regression estimates show that causes of death by communicable diseases, including COVID-19, mainly decline the share of services value added to the global GDP at different quantiles distribution. In contrast, word-of-mouth helps to prevent it from the transmission channel of coronavirus plague through information sharing among the general masses. The control of food prices and managing physical distancing reduces suspected coronavirus cases; however, it negatively affects the services sector's value share. The smart lockdown and sound economic activities do not decrease coronavirus cases, while they support increasing the percentage of the services sector to the global GDP. The innovation accounting matrix suggested that smart lockdown, managing physical distancing, effective price control, and sound financial activities will help to reduce coronavirus cases that will further translate into increased services value-added for the next ten years. The social distancing will exert a more considerable variance error shock to the services industry, which indicates the viability of these measures to contained novel coronavirus over a time horizon.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the angiographic characteristics of 56 patients with pseudo-occlusion of the ICA treated with CAS. Angiographic changes were evaluated from digital subtraction angiography in terms of lesion characteristics of the stenosis and the diameter changes in the distal ICA before and after CAS. RESULTS Fifty-six patients were successfully treated. Based on angiographic findings of ICA stenosis, 33 and 23 patients were classified into the single-channel and multiple-channel group, respectively. Regarding the diameter changes in the distal ICA after CAS, 31 cases were classified as immediate dilatation and the other 25 as restricted dilatation. Immediate dilatation of the distal ICA beyond the stent and that at a follow-up examination were observed significantly less frequently in the multiple-channel group than in the single-channel group. The use of multiple stents and stent occlusion at a follow-up examination were significantly more prevalent in the multiple-channel group than in the single-channel group. CONCLUSION Stenotic lesions of pseudo-occlusion of the ICA were classified as single channel and multiple channel. Restricted dilatation of the distal ICA after CAS was more prevalent in the multiple-channel group. Because adverse events tended to be more frequent in the multiple-channel group than in the single-channel group, the indications for CAS should be determined carefully in multiple-channel patients.

Methods: : From February 2020 until March 2021, we screened 156 CF patients for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (serology) and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in deep throat saliva or nasopharyngeal swabs (molecular testing). From patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we recorded symptoms and collected clinical data. Results: : In total, 13 patients (8.3%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, most of them during the second and the beginning third wave of the pandemic. Ten positive tested patients described symptoms linked to COVID-19. The most common symptom was cough followed by fatigue and headache. SARS-CoV-2 infection did not impair lung function. No positive tested patient needed to be hospitalized. Conclusions: : SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients with CF are not as rare as initially anticipated, as frequent testing revealed. However, infected patients did not experience more severe clinical courses or worse clinical outcome.

The respiratory disorder in the CF results in mortality and morbidity which is characterized by series of serious events involving mucus hypersecretion, microbial infections, airways obstruction, inflammation, destruction of epithelium, tissue remodeling and terminal lung diseases. Mucins are the high molecular weight glycoproteins important for the viscoelastic properties of the mucus, play a significant role in the disease mechanisms. Determining the functional association between the CFTR and mucins might help to identify the putative target for specific therapeutic approach. In fact, furin enzyme which helps in the entry of novel COVID-19 virus into the cell, is upregulated in CF and this can also serve as a potential target for CF treatment. Moreover, the use of nano-formulations for CF treatment is an area of research being widely studied as they have also demonstrated promising outcomes.

This paper charts the development of policy as a concern for IUHE/IUHPE (International Union for Health Education/International Union for Health Promotion and Education) from the mid-1970s when 'health education policies' were prominent issues, to the launch of Healthy Public Policy (in the 1980s) and Health in All Policy (in the 2000s). We argue that solid conceptual and theoretical foundations exist to frame and develop the relevance and connectedness of health promotion more prominently. We start off with a brief introduction into (health) political science, and then illustrate the urgency of the argument with three case studies. The first takes a critical realist perspective on 'closing the gap' in Australian Indigenous populations. With recent evidence it demonstrates that the core of the policymaking process needs to re-align itself with an Indigenous narrative. The second case study reviews the politics of healthy urban planning and health equity in cities. Taking a critical theory institutionalist view, the case describes how the political and narrative parallels between urban theory and health equity have gone underexplored. With an explicit gaze to connect the two, the field could become a large and influential driver of enhanced health promotion and public health policy. The third case describes the languages, policy frames, and distinctions, in four urban/health paradigms. It shows that unconscious policy and practice bias exists in policy priorities and processes. We conclude with observations and recommendations on the role of health promotion as a conceptual realm and field of activity.

There is a need to determine the feasibility of using a meditation app to reduce stress and improve stress-related outcomes in middle-aged adults with a focus on men, as previous meditation appCbased studies have reported a low proportion of or even no male participants. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to (1) determine the feasibility (ie, acceptability and demand with a focus on men) of a consumer-based meditation app (Calm), to reduce stress among middle-aged adults reporting elevated stress levels, and (2) explore the preliminary effects of Calm on perceived stress, psychological outcomes (anxiety, depressive symptoms, mindfulness, and general coping), health behaviors (physical activity and eating habits), and COVID-19 perceptions. METHODS: This feasibility randomized controlled trial evaluated an app-based meditation intervention in middle-aged adults (N=83) with elevated stress levels (ie, Perceived Stress Scale score 15) and limited or no previous experience with meditation. Participants were randomized to the intervention group (Calm app) or a control (educational podcasts; POD) group. Participants completed self-report assessments at baseline and postintervention (week 4). Feasibility was measured as acceptability and demand using Bowen framework. Feasibility and COVID-19 perceptions data were examined using descriptive statistics, and preliminary effects were evaluated using repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Participants were satisfied with Calm (27/28, 96%) and found it appropriate or useful (26/28, 93%). Most reported they would likely continue using the Calm app (18/28, 64%). More Calm users reported satisfaction, appropriateness or usefulness, and intent to continue app use than POD users. Calm users (n=33) completed a mean of 20 (SD 31.1) minutes of meditation on the days they meditated and 103 (SD 109.1) minutes of meditation per week. The average adherence rate to the prescribed meditation was 71% among Calm app users, compared to 62% among POD users. Recruitment rate of men was 35% (29/83). Of those randomized to Calm, 55% (15/29) were men, and retention among them was higher (14/15, 93%) than that among women (12/20, 60%). No significant within or between group differences were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A 4-week, app-based mindfulness meditation intervention (Calm) may be feasible for middle-aged adults and a useful stress-management tool. Calm users expressed satisfaction with the app and felt it was appropriate and useful. Significant improvements in perceived stress and psychological outcomes or stress-related health behaviors were not observed. Even though men spent less time in meditation than women did and completed fewer weekly sessions, they were more likely to adhere to the prescription. Further research is needed for improving stress and stress-related outcomes among middle-aged adults with emphasis on the effects of mindfulness meditation apps for men.

Parents of children aged 5 to 9 years from Western Australia were eligible to participate and recruited through convenience sampling. An online survey instrument that included validated measures of their children's physical activity (unstructured, organized, home-based, indoor/outdoor active play, dog play/walking), sociodemographic, and other potential confounders was administered to parents. Paired t-tests and mixed ANOVA models assessed changes in physical activity outcomes. The analytic sample comprised parents of 157 children who were 6.9 years of age (SD = 1.7) on average. Overall, weekly minutes of total physical activity (PA) did not change from before to during COVID-19. However, frequency and duration (total and home-based) of unstructured physical activity significantly increased. Outdoor play in the yard or street around the house, outdoor play in the park or playground or outdoor recreation area, and active indoor play at home all significantly increased. Frequency and total duration of organised physical activity significantly declined during COVID-19 distancing. During Western Australian COVID-19 restrictions, there was an increase in young children's unstructured physical activity and outdoor play and a decrease in organised physical activity.

METHODS: We screened 3915 tweets from public Twitter profiles in Canada by using the search words \\"vaccine\\" and \\"COVID.\\" The tweets that met the inclusion criteria (ie, those about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy) were coded via content analysis. Codes were then organized into themes and interpreted by using the Theoretical Domains Framework. RESULTS: Overall, 605 tweets were identified as those about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy stemmed from the following themes: concerns over safety, suspicion about political or economic forces driving the COVID-19 pandemic or vaccine development, a lack of knowledge about the vaccine, antivaccine or confusing messages from authority figures, and a lack of legal liability from vaccine companies. This study also examined mistrust toward the medical industry not due to hesitancy, but due to the legacy of communities marginalized by health care institutions. These themes were categorized into the following five Theoretical Domains Framework constructs: knowledge, beliefs about consequences, environmental context and resources, social influence, and emotion. CONCLUSIONS: With the World Health Organization stating that one of the worst threats to global health is vaccine hesitancy, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind this reluctance.

This PCR-free method involves reverse transcribing a target gene on the viral RNA before enzymatically digesting all but the resulting dsDNA. Ratiometric quantification of RNA abundance is achieved by single-molecule counting and length-based nanopore identification of dsDNA from a SARS-CoV-2 gene and a human reference gene. We graded nasal swab samples from >15 subjects and find that the SARS-CoV-2 ratiometric nanopore index correlates well with the reported RT-qPCR threshold cycle for positive classified samples. Remarkably, nanopore analysis also reports quantitative positive outcomes for clinical samples classified as negative by RT-qPCR, suggesting that the method may be used to diagnose COVID-19 in samples that may evade detection.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge for Latin America. Understanding dynamics is essential for decision making, to reduce the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, governments in Latin America have taken measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 primarily based on World Health Organization recommendations. However, the potential impact of the virus in Latin America is still unknown. Given the urgency, governments need more accurate estimates of what could happen in Latin America in order to make informed decisions, At the September 20, 2020, cumulative cases 2295 of COVID-19 per 1 million population has been registered in Latin America and the Caribbean.

The M46I mutation significantly affects the energetics and conformational stability of HIV-1 protease in terms of RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, and hydrogen formation potential. This mutation significantly decreased van der Waals interaction and binding free energy (?G) in the M46ICsaquinavir complex and induced inward flap curling and a wider opening of the flaps for most of the MD simulation period. The predominant open conformation was reduced, but inward flap curling/active site compactness was increased in the presence of saquinavir in M46I HIV-1 protease. In conclusion, the M46I mutation induced structural dynamics changes that weaken the protease grip on saquinavir without distorting the active site of the protein. The produced information may be utilized for the discovery of inhibitor(s) against drug-resistant HIV-1 protease.","output":"Drug Resistance Mechanism of M46I-Mutation-Induced Saquinavir Resistance in HIV-1 Protease Using Molecular Dynamics Simulation and Binding Energy Calculation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-term sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are now recognized. However, there is still a lack of consensus regarding the terminology for this emerging chronic clinical syndrome, which includes long COVID, chronic COVID syndrome, post-COVID-19 syndrome, post-acute COVID-19, and long-hauler COVID-19. In this review, I will use the term \\"long COVID\\". A review of the medical history and epidemiology of past pandemics and epidemics in modern literature review identifies common long-term post-infectious disorders, with the common finding of altered cognition. In the brain, the cerebral hypoxia induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection may be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in \\"brain fog\\". Historically, the common symptom of altered cognition has been reported during earlier pandemics, which include the influenza pandemics of 1889 and 1892 (Russian flu), the Spanish flu pandemic (1918-1919), encephalitis lethargica, diphtheria, and myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome or post-viral fatigue syndrome).

Grouping the set of initial indicators is carried out based on the method of an extreme grouping of parameters and the method of principal components. A weighted linear additive convolution was used to develop partial composite indices and an economic development comprehensive index. The practical approbation was carried out for the regions of Ukraine according to the data of 9 months of 2019 and the same period of 2020. To establish the regions' structure, we used the division of the comprehensive index values into intervals and further distributing regions into classes according to the level of economic development.

MethodsOvid MEDLINE and Compendex were searched from inception to January 2021. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and full text of potentially relevant reviews, using a priori inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were systematic reviews examining effects of HVAC design features on virus transmission. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality using AMSTAR2. ResultsSearching identified 361 citations, 45 were potentially relevant, and 7 were included. Reviews were published between 2007 and 2021, and included 47 virus studies. Two earlier reviews (2007, 2016) of 21 studies found sufficient evidence that mechanical ventilation (airflow patterns, ventilation rates) plays a role in airborne transmission; however, both found insufficient evidence to quantify minimum mechanical ventilation requirements. One review (2017) of 9 studies examining humidity and indoor air quality found that influenza virus survival was lowest between 40% and 80% relative humidity; authors noted that ventilation rates were a confounding variable. Two reviews (2021) examined mitigation strategies for coronavirus transmission, finding droplet transmission decreased with increasing temperature and relative humidity. One review (2020) identified 14 studies examining coronavirus transmission in air-conditioning systems, finding HVAC systems played a role in virus spread during previous coronavirus outbreaks. One review (2020) examined virus transmission interventions on public ground transportation, finding ventilation and filtration to be effective. DiscussionSeven reviews synthesizing 47 studies demonstrate a role of HVAC in mitigating airborne virus transmission. Ventilation, humidity, temperature, and filtration can play a role in viability and transmission of viruses, including coronaviruses. Recommendations for minimum standards were not possible due to few studies investigating a given HVAC parameter.

At pressures above 100 GPa, the bcca??hcp transition exists in both metals, and the phase boundary has a domed shape and does not rise in temperature above 2 kK. This behavior of the phase boundary with the increasing temperature is caused by the softer phonon modes of the bcc structure and the smaller contribution of lattice vibrations to the free energy of the crystal compared to the hcp phase.

People experiencing homelessness are vulnerable to infection and severe disease. Health and housing authorities in England have developed a residential intervention that aims to isolate those vulnerable to severe disease (COVID-PROTECT) and care for people with symptoms (COVID CARE). Methods: We used a discrete-time Markov chain model to forecast COVID-19 infections among people experiencing homelessness, given strong containment measures in the general population and some transmission among 35,817 people living in 1,065 hostels, and 11,748 people sleeping rough (the 'do nothing' scenario). We then estimated demand for beds if those eligible are offered COVID-PROTECT and COVID-CARE. We estimated the reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and hospital admissions that could be achieved by these interventions. We also conducted sensitivity and scenario analyses to identify programme success factors. Results: In a 'do nothing' scenario, we estimate that 34% of the homeless population could get COVID-19 between March and August 2020, with 364 deaths, 4,074 hospital admissions and 572 critical care admissions. In our 'base intervention' scenario, demand for COVID-PROTECT peaks at 9,934 beds, and demand for COVID-CARE peaks at 1,366 beds. The intervention could reduce transmission by removing symptomatic individuals from the community, and preventing vulnerable individuals from being infected. This could lead to a reduction of 164 deaths, 2,624 hospital admissions, and 248 critical care admissions over this period. Sensitivity analyses showed that the number of deaths is sensitive to transmission of COVID-19 in COVID-PROTECT. If COVID-PROTECT capacity is limited, scenario analyses show the benefit of prioritising people who are vulnerable to severe disease.

Ingestion of ethanol + salt leads to a significant increase in urinary volume and water intake that were significantly prevented by the extracts from the mixture and isolated plants. Ethanol + salt solution significantly increased the blood pressure, heart rate, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-chol), atherogenic indices, liver and kidney function parameters, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. However, the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-chol), albumin, reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were significantly reduced. The extracts of the mixture and isolated plants significantly prevented all these variations with a more pronounced action for the lowest dose of the mixture on the lipid profile, oxidative stress, and kidney function.

Patients with cTnI elevations had higher in-hospital mortality. Additionally, myocarditis is associated with exercise-related sudden cardiac death in athletes. Therefore, reports of COVID-19 myocarditis concerned the sports cardiology community, which issued two guidelines on managing athletes with COVID-19 infection. We reviewed reports of myocardial involvement in athletes after COVID-19 infection published before June 2021. The incidence of the diagnosis of myocarditis in athletes post-COVID-19 ranged from 0 to 15.4% based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) performed 10 to 194 days after initial diagnosis of COVID-19. Only a few studies adhered to accepted myocarditis diagnostic guidelines and only two studies included a control group of uninfected athletes. There was significant heterogeneity in the method and protocols used in evaluating athletes post-COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 myocarditis in athletes appears to be over-diagnosed. The evaluation of myocarditis post-COVID-19 should be individually performed and managed according to the current guidelines.

PATIENTS AND METHODS This is a proof-of-concept, single-blind randomized controlled trial carried out from April 2018 to June 2019 at the Centre des Maladies du Sein du CHU de Qubec - Universit Laval. The objectives were to determine whether a single dose of preoperative antibiotics reduces surgical site infection (SSI) after wire-localized lumpectomy and to identify the risk factors for SSI. The patients were randomized to receive preoperative prophylactic antibiotics or not. SSI was defined by positive breast wound cultures, abscess drainage, and/or antibiotics given for clinical signs of breast infection within 30 days of the operation. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04818931. RESULTS A total of 330 patients were enrolled. Eighteen patients were excluded. The SSI rate was 3.1% (5/160) in the antibiotic group versus 5.9% (9/152) in the control group (p = 0.28). Only obesity was a significant risk factor for SSI. All cases of SSI were treated routinely with antibiotics; one patient required wound re-opening. None of the SSIs delayed the adjuvant treatment. CONCLUSION Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis does not significantly decrease the occurrence of breast SSI. It is safe to omit prophylactic antibiotics for a wire-localized lumpectomy. This could also decrease the treatment costs and avoid unnecessary side effects.","output":"Do Preoperative Prophylactic Antibiotics Reduce Surgical Site Infection Following Wire-Localized Lumpectomy?

We analysed ROTEM measurements in COVID-19 patients with a severe disease course and in patients with severe sepsis. METHODS: In this study, data obtained by extended analysis of haemostasis with standard laboratory tests and thromboelastometry of 20 patients with severe course of COVID-19 were retrospectively analysed and compared with similar data from 20 patients with severe sepsis but no COVID-19. RESULTS: The thromboelastometry values obtained from 20 sepsis patients contained a maximum clot firmness above the normal range but among COVID-19 patients, hypercoagulability was much more pronounced, with significantly higher maximum clot firmness (FIBTEM: 38.4  10.1 mm vs. 29.6  10.8 mm; P = 0.012; EXTEM: 70.4  10.4 mm vs. 60.6  14.8 mm; P = 0.022). Additionally, fibrinogen levels were significantly higher among COVID-19 patients (757  135 mg/dl vs. 498  132 mg/dl, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, thromboelastometry showed fibrinolysis shutdown among COVID-19 patients with significantly lower maximum of lysis than among sepsis patients (EXTEM: 0.6  1.2 % vs. 3.3  3.7 %; P = 0.013). Seven of 20 COVID-19 patients experienced thromboembolic events, whereas no patient in the sepsis group experienced such events.

This finding raised the question on what factors could explain risk perception in older adults. The present study examined age-related differences in risk perception in the early stages of COVID-19 lockdown, analyzing variables that can explain the differences in perception of risk at different ages. A total of 1,765 adults aged between 18 and 87 years old completed an online survey assessing perceived risk severity and risk vulnerability of getting COVID-19, sociodemographic status, emotional state, experience relating to COVID-19, and physical health status. Results showed that the older the participants, the lower the perceived vulnerability to getting COVID-19, but the higher the perceived severity. Different predictors explain the perception of risk severity and vulnerability at different ages. Overall, self-reported anxiety over the pandemic is a crucial predictor in explaining risk perceptions in all age groups.

Surgical and endovascular interventions are the main treatments for advanced PAD but alternative and adjunctive medical therapies are needed. Currently the main preclinical experimental model employed in PAD research is based on induction of acute hind limb ischemia (HLI) by a 1-stage procedure. Since there are concerns regarding the ability to translate findings from this animal model to patients, we aimed to develop a novel clinically relevant animal model of PAD. HLI was induced in male Apolipoprotein E (ApoE(?/?)) deficient mice by a 2-stage procedure of initial gradual femoral artery occlusion by ameroid constrictors for 14 days and subsequent excision of the femoral artery. This 2-stage HLI model was compared to the classical 1-stage HLI model and sham controls. Ischemia severity was assessed using Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging (LDPI). Ambulatory ability was assessed using an open field test, a treadmill test and using established scoring scales. Molecular markers of angiogenesis and shear stress were assessed within gastrocnemius muscle tissue samples using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HLI was more severe in mice receiving the 2-stage compared to the 1-stage ischemia induction procedure as assessed by LDPI (p = 0.014), and reflected in a higher ischemic score (p = 0.004) and lower average distance travelled on a treadmill test (p = 0.045). Mice undergoing the 2-stage HLI also had lower expression of angiogenesis markers (vascular endothelial growth factor, p = 0.004; vascular endothelial growth factor- receptor 2, p = 0.008) and shear stress response mechano-transducer transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (p = 0.041) within gastrocnemius muscle samples, compared to animals having the 1-stage HLI procedure. Mice subjected to the 2-stage HLI receiving an exercise program showed significantly greater improvement in their ambulatory ability on a treadmill test than a sedentary control group. This study describes a novel model of HLI which leads to more severe and sustained ischemia than the conventionally used model. Exercise therapy, which has established efficacy in PAD patients, was also effective in this new model. This new model maybe useful in the evaluation of potential novel PAD therapies.","output":"Development of a two-stage limb ischemia model to better simulate human peripheral artery disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In a fast-evolving public health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple pieces of relevant information can be posted sequentially on a social media platform. The interval between subsequent posting times may have a different impact on the transmission and cross-propagation of the old and new information that results in a different peak value and a final size of forwarding users of the new information, depending on the content correlation and whether the new information is posted during the outbreak or quasiCsteady-state phase of the old information. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to help in designing effective communication strategies to ensure information is delivered to the maximal number of users. METHODS: We developed and analyzed two classes of susceptible-forwarding-immune information propagation models with delay in transmission to describe the cross-propagation process of relevant information. A total of 28,661 retweets of typical information were posted frequently by each opinion leader related to COVID-19 with high influence (data acquisition up to February 19, 2020). The information was processed into discrete points with a frequency of 10 minutes, and the real data were fitted by the model numerical simulation. Furthermore, the influence of parameters on information dissemination and the design of a publishing strategy were analyzed. RESULTS: The current epidemic outbreak situation, epidemic prevention, and other related authoritative information cannot be timely and effectively browsed by the public. The ingenious use of information release intervals can effectively enhance the interaction between information and realize the effective diffusion of information. We parameterized our models using real data from Sina Microblog and used the parameterized models to define and evaluate mutual attractiveness indexes, and we used these indexes and parameter sensitivity analyses to inform optimal strategies for new information to be effectively propagated in the microblog. The results of the parameter analysis showed that using different attractiveness indexes as the key parameters can control the information transmission with different release intervals, so it is considered as a key link in the design of an information communication strategy. At the same time, the dynamic process of information was analyzed through index evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Our model can carry out an accurate numerical simulation of information at different release intervals and achieve a dynamic evaluation of information transmission by constructing an indicator system so as to provide theoretical support and strategic suggestions for government decision making. This study optimizes information posting strategies to maximize communication efforts for delivering key public health messages to the public for better outcomes of public health emergency management.","output":"Quantifying the Influence of Delay in Opinion Transmission of COVID-19 Information Propagation: Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel binding site for angiotensins II and III that is unmasked by parachloromercuribenzoate has been reported in rat, mouse and human brains.

To determine if this binding site occurs in other mouse tissues, 8 tissues were assayed for expression of this binding site by radioligand binding assay and compared with the expression of this binding site in the forebrain. Particulate fractions of homogenates of testis, epididymis, seminal vesicles, heart, spleen, pancreas, lung, skeletal muscle, and forebrain were incubated with (125)I-sarcosine(1), isoleucine(8) angiotensin II in the presence or absence of 0.3 mM parachloromercuribenzoate plus 10 M losartan and 10 M PD123319 (to saturate AT(1) and AT(2) receptors). Specific (3 M angiotensin II displaceable) high affinity binding occurred in the testis > forebrain > epididymis > spleen > pancreas > lung when parachloromercuribenzoate was present. Binding could not be reliably observed in heart, skeletal muscle and seminal vesicles. High affinity binding of (125)I-sarcosine(1), isoleucine(8) angiotensin II was observed in the absence of parachloromercuribenzoate in the pancreas on occasion.

It can accelerate the natural corrosion rate of cultural heritages and monuments, leading to premature aging and lowering their aesthetic value. Globally, at the beginning of 2020, to tackle the spread of novel COVID-19, the lockdown was enforced in the most hard-hit countries. Therefore, this study assesses, as a first time, the plausible benefits of traffic and urban mobility reductions on the natural process of deterioration of materials during COVID-19 lockdown in twenty-four major cities on five continents. The potential risk is estimated based on exceeding the tolerable degradation limits for each material. The notable impact of COVID-19 mobility restrictions on air quality was evidenced in 2020 compared to 2019. The introduced mobility restrictions in 2020 could decrease the surface recession rate of materials. Extremely randomized trees analysis showed that PM(10) was the main influencing factor for corrosion of portland, copper, cast bronze, and carbon steel with a relative importance of 0.60, 0.32, 0.90, and 0.64, respectively, while SO(2) and HNO(3) were mainly responsible for corrosion of sandstone and zinc with a relative importance of 0.60 and 0.40, respectively. The globally adverse governed meteorological conditions in 2020 could not positively influence the movement restrictions around the world in air quality improvements.

Therefore, this study investigates social media literacy among oil palm smallholders in East Malaysia and the association with oil palm integration practices. A survey of 194 respondents was conducted using a random sampling method. The survey questionnaire was adapted from several previous studies on social media literacy. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses, involving t-test, ANOVA, and logistic regression were conducted. Social media literacy was significantly higher among oil palm smallholders who were younger, with higher educational levels (p < 0.05). The logistic regression analysis showed that as the level of social media literacy increased, the probability for agricultural integration practices also increased (odds ratio (OR) = 1.052;95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.022, 1.083). However, smallholders needed to optimise their use of social media to provide greater benefits to their agriculture. The findings of this study are useful in illustrating that interventions in social media literacy may efficiently facilitate oil palm integration.

To date, no structure of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp7:nsp8 complex has been published. The current understanding of this complex is based on structures from truncated constructs, with missing electron densities, or from related CoV species where SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 share upward of 90% sequence identity. Despite available structures solved using crystallography and cryo-EM representing detailed static snapshots of the nsp7:nsp8 complex, it is evident that the complex has a high degree of structural plasticity. However, relatively little is known about the conformational dynamics of the individual proteins and how they complex to interact with other nsps. Here, the solution-based structural proteomic techniques, hydrogenCdeuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), illuminate the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 full-length nsp7 and nsp8 proteins and the nsp7:nsp8 protein complex. Results presented from the two techniques are complementary and validate the interaction surfaces identified from the published three-dimensional heterotetrameric crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 truncated nsp7:nsp8 complex. Furthermore, mapping of XL-MS data onto higher-order complexes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 do not assemble into a hexadecameric structure as implied by the SARS-CoV full-length nsp7:nsp8 crystal structure. Instead, our results suggest that the nsp7:nsp8 heterotetramer can dissociate into a stable dimeric unit that might bind to nsp12 in the RTC without significantly altering nsp7Cnsp8 interactions.","output":"Revealing the Structural Plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 Using Structural Proteomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1.

Themes that emerged included flexibility, collaboration and access to resources, a sense of continual accessibility and connectivity to work, information overload and interpersonal relationships. Depending on how digital communication is managed, we found each aspect has the capacity to be simultaneously positive (i.e., resourceful) or negative (e.g., demanding).

This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of the current pandemic on people diagnosed with OCD, and whether pandemics may affect the development of OCD symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search using NCBI PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar on February 9, 2021. Research articles related to OCD and COVID-19 or other pandemics were attempted to be identified using pre-defined search terms. Case reports, clinical guidelines, letters, and clinical research articles including 100 participants were included; reviews were excluded. The systematic review adheres to PRISMA guidelines and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of the included clinical research articles. RESULTS: A total of 79 articles were included in the full-text assessment. Of these, 59 were clinical research articles, two were clinical guidelines, six were case reports, and 12 were letters. The research articles examined OCD symptoms in adult patients with diagnosed OCD, the general population, pregnant women, healthcare workers, students, and young adults, children, and adolescents. Only one study on OCD in previous pandemics was identified. CONCLUSION: This systematic review found that people both with and without diagnosed OCD prior to the pandemic generally experienced a worsened landscape of symptoms of OCD during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the responses are heterogeneous and many factors other than the pandemic seemed to affect the development of OCD symptoms. To prevent the impairment of symptoms and the development of new cases, close monitoring of patients with OCD and education of the general public is essential. Literature is still limited; thus, multinational and cross-cultural, longitudinal studies are warranted to gain further insights on this topic.","output":"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder During the COVID-19 PandemicA Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak had created several challenges for health care workers and public worldwide.

DESIGN: Data come from a cross-sectional online survey targeted at LGBTQ+ people, which collected data on mental health, experiences of discrimination and a number of other pandemic-related experiences. To examine the association between sexual orientation and gender and mental health and experiences of discrimination, we conducted regression analyses that adjusted for a range of sociodemographic variables. SETTING: A web-based survey was used to collect data between the end of April and mid July 2020. PARTICIPANTS: An analytical sample of 310 LGBTQ+ respondents aged 18 and above. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed mental health with the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale and with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D-10). We asked respondents about discriminatory experiences because of their LGBTQ+ identity during the coronavirus pandemic. RESULTS: Perceived stress scores among our LGBTQ+ sample were high (mean: 7.67; SD: 3.22). Based on a score of 10 or more on the CES-D-10, the majority of participants had high levels of depressive symptoms (72%). Around one-in-six respondents reported some form of discrimination since the start of the pandemic because they were LGBTQ+ (16.7%). The average score for perceived stress increased by 1.44 points (95% CI 0.517 to 2.354) for respondents who had experienced discrimination versus those who had not.

However, most of these cleavage sites have not been experimentally confirmed and the proteins have not been identified in vitro or in virus-infected cells. We used specific antibodies to identify and characterize a 22-kDa protein (p1a-22) expressed from gene 1 in MHV A59-infected DBT cells. Processing of p1a-22 from the polyprotein began immediately after translation, but some processing continued for several hours. Amino-terminal sequencing of p1a-22 purified from MHV-infected cells showed that it was cleaved at a putative 3CLpro cleavage site, Gln_Ser4014 (where the underscore indicates the site of cleavage), that is located between the 3CLpro domain and the end of open reading frame (ORF) 1a. Subclones of this region of gene 1 were used to express polypeptides in vitro that contained one or more 3CLpro cleavage sites, and cleavage of these substrates by recombinant 3CLpro in vitro confirmed that amino-terminal cleavage of p1a-22 occurred at Gln_Ser4014. We demonstrated that the carboxy-terminal cleavage of the p1a-22 protein occurred at Gln_Asn4208, a sequence that had not been predicted as a site for cleavage by MHV 3CLpro. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of recombinant MHV 3CLpro in identifying and confirming cleavage sites within the gene 1 polyprotein. Based on our results, we predict that at least seven mature proteins are processed from the ORF 1a polyprotein by 3CLpro and suggest that additional noncanonical cleavage sites may be used by 3CLpro during processing of the gene 1 polyprotein.","output":"Mouse hepatitis virus 3C-like protease cleaves a 22-kilodalton protein from the open reading frame 1a polyprotein in virus-infected cells and in vitro."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is uncertainty about the safety of kidney transplantation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic due to the risk of donor transmission, nosocomial infection and immunosuppression use.

Zebrafish models of COL6A3 mutations showed deficits in axonal targeting mechanisms. Therefore, COL6A3 mutations have been considered to contribute to irregular sensorimotor circuit formation. To test this hypothesis, we examined structural abnormalities in cerebral fiber tracts of dystonia patients with COL6A3 mutations using diffusion tensor imaging. METHODS We performed a voxel-wise statistical analysis to compare fractional anisotropy within whole-brain white matter in four of the previously reported dystonia patients with COL6A3 mutations and 12 healthy controls. Region of interests-based probabilistic tractography was performed as a post-hoc-analysis. RESULTS Dystonia patients with COL6A3 mutations showed significantly decreased fractional anisotropy bilaterally in midbrain, pons, cerebellar peduncles, thalamus, internal capsule and in frontal and parietal subcortical regions compared to healthy controls. Tractography revealed a decreased fractional anisotropy in patients with COL6A3-associated dystonia between bilateral dentate nucleus and thalamus.

This algorithm integrates local evolutionary context from homologous sequences that explicitly model residue-residue epistasis for the protein of interest with the global evolutionary context that encodes rich semantic and structural features from the enormous protein sequence universe. As such, it enables accurate mapping from sequence to function and provides generalization from low-order mutants to higher-order mutants. We show that ECNet predicts the sequence-function relationship more accurately as compared to existing machine learning algorithms by using ~50 deep mutational scanning and random mutagenesis datasets.

Previous research linked increased susceptibility to collapsing glomerulopathy, including in patients with HIV-associated nephropathy, to apo L1 (APOL1) variants that are more common in those of African descent. METHODS To investigate genetic, histopathologic, and molecular features in six black patients with COVID-19 presenting with AKI and de novo nephrotic-range proteinuria, we obtained biopsied kidney tissue, which was examined by in situ hybridization for viral detection and by NanoString for COVID-19 and acute tubular injury-associated genes. We also collected peripheral blood for APOL1 genotyping. RESULTS This case series included six black patients with COVID-19 (four men, two women), mean age 55 years. At biopsy day, mean serum creatinine was 6.5 mg/dl and mean urine protein-creatinine ratio was 11.5 g. Kidney biopsy specimens showed collapsing glomerulopathy, extensive foot process effacement, and focal/diffuse acute tubular injury. Three patients had endothelial reticular aggregates. We found no evidence of viral particles or SARS-CoV-2 RNA. NanoString showed elevated chemokine gene expression and changes in expression of genes associated with acute tubular injury compared with controls. All six patients had an APOL1 high-risk genotype. Five patients needed dialysis (two of whom died); one partially recovered without dialysis. CONCLUSIONS Collapsing glomerulopathy in black patients with COVID-19 was associated with high-risk APOL1 variants. We found no direct viral infection in the kidneys, suggesting a possible alternative mechanism: a \\"two-hit\\" combination of genetic predisposition and cytokine-mediated host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The purpose was to compare radiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia on thin-section CT upon admission between patients with mild and severe disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University between January 20 and January 27, 2020 were enrolled. Based on the World Health Organization guidelines, 50 patients were categorized with mild form and 20 with severe form based on clinical conditions. Imaging features, clinical, and laboratory data were reviewed and compared. RESULTS: Patients with severe form (median age, 65.00; IQR: 54.75-75.00) were older than those with mild form of disease (median age, 42.5; IQR: 32.75-58.50) (P<0.001). Patients with severe form of disease had more lung segments involved (median number of segments: 7.5 vs. 17.5, P=<0.001) and also larger opacities (median number of segments with opacities measuring 3 cm to less than 50% of the lung segment: 5.5 vs. 2.0, P=0.006;  50% of lung segment: 7.5 vs. 0.0, P<0.001).

We evaluated the ability of two FDA-cleared nucleic acid-based tests, the semiautomated respiratory virus nucleic acid test (VRNAT) and the fully automated respiratory virus nucleic acid test SP (RVNAT(SP)) (Nanosphere Inc., Northbrook, IL) to detect influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus A and B (RSV A/B) from clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Detection of viral RNA in both tests is based on nucleic acid amplification followed by hybridization to capture probes immobilized on a glass slide. A novel technology utilizing gold nanoparticle-conjugated probes is utilized to detect the presence of captured target DNA. This microarray-based approach to detection has proven to be more sensitive than the traditional culture/direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) method for detecting RSV and influenza viruses in clinical specimens, including the novel 2009 H1N1 strain.

It has been hypothesized that if COVID-19 exhibits seasonality, changing temperatures in the coming months will shift transmission patterns around the world. Such projections, however, require an estimate of the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature at a global scale, and one that isolates the role of temperature from confounding factors, such as public health capacity. This paper provides the first plausibly causal estimates of the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and local temperature using a global sample comprising of 166,686 confirmed new COVID-19 cases from 134 countries from January 22, 2020 to March 15, 2020. We find robust statistical evidence that a 1C increase in local temperature reduces transmission by 13% [-21%, -4%, 95%CI]. In contrast, we do not find that specific humidity or precipitation influence transmission. Our statistical approach separates effects of climate variation on COVID-19 transmission from other potentially correlated factors, such as differences in public health responses across countries and heterogeneous population densities. Using constructions of expected seasonal temperatures, we project that changing temperatures between March 2020 and July 2020 will cause COVID-19 transmission to fall by 43% on average for Northern Hemisphere countries and to rise by 71% on average for Southern Hemisphere countries. However, these patterns reverse as the boreal winter approaches, with seasonal temperatures in January 2021 increasing average COVID-19 transmission by 59% relative to March 2020 in northern countries and lowering transmission by 2% in southern countries. These findings suggest that Southern Hemisphere countries should expect greater transmission in the coming months. Moreover, Northern Hemisphere countries face a crucial window of opportunity: if contagion-containing policy interventions can dramatically reduce COVID-19 cases with the aid of the approaching warmer months, it may be possible to avoid a second wave of COVID-19 next winter.","output":"Causal empirical estimates suggest COVID-19 transmission rates are highly seasonal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study developed and evaluated a brief, single-session online intervention designed to facilitate treatment seeking among adults with clinically significant social anxiety (SA) symptoms, who generally seek treatment at exceptionally low rates.

Therefore we sought to characterise the infection. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine and characterise the etiological agent responsible for the poor outcome. METHODS: Classical virological methods, such as plaque assay and plaque reduction neutralisation test combined with amplicon-based sequencing, as well as a viral metagenomic approach, were performed to characterise the etiological agents of the infection. FINDINGS: Plaque assay revealed two distinct plaque phenotypes, suggesting either the presence of two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains or a productive coinfection of two different species of virus. Amplicon-based sequencing did not support the presence of any SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants that would explain the high viral load and suggested the presence of a single SARS-CoV-2 strain. Nonetheless, the viral metagenomic analysis revealed that Coronaviridae and Herpesviridae were the predominant virus families within the sample.

Currently, EPR schemes do not provide sufficient incentives for moving towards the higher levels of the waste hierarchy, e.g. by reducing the amounts of waste through incentivising the design of products with longer lifespans and by enhancing reuse activities through easier collection and repair of end-of-life products. Nevertheless, several municipalities and regional actors around Europe are increasingly promoting reuse activities through a variety of initiatives. Furthermore, even in the absence of legal drivers, many producer responsibility organisations (PROs), who execute their members responsibilities in EPR schemes, are considering promoting reuse and have initiated a number of pilot projects. A product group that has been identified as having high commercial potential for reuse is white goods, but the development of large-scale reuse of white goods seems unlikely unless a series of legal and organisational barriers are effectively addressed. Through an empirical investigation with relevant stakeholders, based on interviews, and the analysis of two case studies of PROs that developed criteria for allowing reusers to access their end-of-life white goods, this contribution presents insights on drivers and barriers for the repair and reuse of white goods in EPR schemes and discusses potential interventions that could facilitate the upscale of reuse activities. Concluding, although the reuse potential for white goods is high, the analysis highlights the currently insufficient policy landscape for incentivising reuse and the need for additional interventions to make reuse feasible as a mainstream enterprise.","output":"Enabling Reuse in Extended Producer Responsibility Schemes for White Goods: Legal and Organisational Conditions for Connecting Resource Flows and Actors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Viewpoint discusses insights from basic science and clinical perspectives on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)/severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the brain, with a particular focus on Parkinsons disease Major points include that neuropathology studies have not answered the central issue of whether the virus enters central nervous system neurons, astrocytes or microglia, and the brain vascular cell types that express virus have not yet been identified Currently, there is no clear evidence for human neuronal or astrocyte expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major receptor for viral entry, but ACE2 expression may be activated by inflammation, and a comparison of healthy and infected brains is important In contrast to the 1918 influenza pandemic and avian flu, reports of encephalopathy in COVID-19 have been slow to emerge, and there are so far no documented reports of parkinsonism apart from a single case report We recommend consensus guidelines for the clinical treatment of Parkinsons patients with COVID-19 While a role for the virus in causing or exacerbating Parkinsons disease appears unlikely at this time, aggravation of specific motor and non-motor symptoms has been reported, and it will be important to monitor subjects after recovery, particularly for those with persisting hyposmia","output":"COVID-19 and possible links with Parkinsons disease and parkinsonism: from bench to bedside"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Der Kehlkopf bildet als Teil des Atemtrakts den bergang vom Rachen zur Luftr?hre im vorderen Halsbereich.

However, decisions about its introduction should be supported by up-to-date evidence capable of providing an overview of available knowledge. OBJECTIVES To map the (a) state of research on massive open online courses in undergraduate and postgraduate health sciences education, (b) evaluation methods and tools used to measure learning outcomes, and (c) factors increasing their effectiveness as documented to date. DESIGN A rapid review following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines. METHODS PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane, Scopus, PsycInfo and Medline (via Ovid) were searched. Primary studies reporting one or more massive open online course (1) devoted to undergraduate and/or postgraduate students in nursing and healthcare sciences (2), written in English (3) with abstract available (4) and published up to February 18th, 2020 were all included. After having assessed the need for a review and the topic itself (a), the literature search was performed (b), studies were screened and selected (c), data was extracted (d), and the findings were summarised (e). RESULTS Thirty-six studies emerged with mainly an explorative/descriptive or case study design. The courses have been developed mainly by universities alone or in collaboration with institutions mainly in US, Sweden and the UK. Their delivery has been performed at multi-national levels, mainly in English, and with a number of participants ranging from 45 to >23,000. The duration spanned from two weeks to six months on clinical topics (e.g., emergency medicine) to methods (e.g., statistics). The target audience has been mainly mixed, including students, healthcare professionals, and lay citizens. Evaluation methods and tools have been described in 28 studies, and multiple-choice questions were most frequently adopted. Factors affecting the effectiveness of massive open online courses have been identified analysing the courses themselves and the participants. CONCLUSION Massive open online courses have recently started to be studied in healthcare sciences: these can be useful to educate students, mainly as elective courses, and to educate a massive audience, thus embodying the third mission of the university. The complexity of factors increasing effectiveness suggests the need for a multidisciplinary approach both in their design and implementation.","output":"What knowledge is available on massive open online courses in nursing and academic healthcare sciences education?

Interaction between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a potential factor in the infectivity of a host. In this study, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with its receptor, ACE2, in different hosts was evaluated to predict the probability of viral entry. Phylogeny and alignment comparison of the ACE2 sequences did not lead to any meaningful conclusion on viral entry in different hosts. The binding ability between ACE2 and the spike protein was assessed to delineate several spike binding parameters of ACE2. A significant difference between the known infected and uninfected species was observed for six parameters. However, these parameters did not specifically categorize the Orders into infected or uninfected. Finally, a logistic regression model constructed using spike binding parameters of ACE2, revealed that in the mammalian class, most of the species of Carnivores, Artiodactyls, Perissodactyls, Pholidota, and Primates had a high probability of viral entry. However, among the Proboscidea, African elephants had a low probability of viral entry. Among rodents, hamsters were highly probable for viral entry with rats and mice having a medium to low probability. Rabbits have a high probability of viral entry. In Birds, ducks have a very low probability, while chickens seemed to have medium probability and turkey showed the highest probability of viral entry.

Although these ACE2 molecules were found to share similar overall structures, their S-ACE2 interface residues differed. These differences likely result in variations in the ACE2 binding affinities to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The highest affinities are predicted for human, gorilla, and monkey, while mouse and rat ACE2 are predicted to have the lowest affinities. Cat ACE2 is predicted to have a lower S protein affinity than dog ACE2. Although affinity is not the only factor that affects viral susceptibility, it is one of the most important factors.

However, hydrophobic species are frequently incompatible with biological systems. For this reason, fluorinated matrices are often sought, since fluorinated species are neither hydrophilic nor hydrophobic; they therefore do not interact with most biomolecules. However, most fluorinated oils have densities much higher than the density of water (1 g/ml). Consequently, water droplets float in fluorinated oils, aggregating near their surfaces. This facilitates droplet-droplet collision and fusion, exposing droplets to air interfaces and making their manipulation difficult. Here, we report the synthesis, characterization, and use of fluorinated polysiloxane oils that have densities close to the density of water. These, with a non-ionic fluorosilicone surfactant, produce thermostable water-in-oil emulsions that neither float nor sink.

Further, oil-diffusible reagents can initiate reactions within the droplets.

Methods: A home exercise prescription was formulated after investigating and categorizing the home exercise status of 4000 undergraduates during the period of COVID-19. In this prospective cohort study, 200 young people were recruited for a home exercise prescription intervention, and 200 individuals did not undergo any intervention for 4 weeks in February 2020. Physical and mental health indexes including anxiety factors, obsessive-compulsive symptoms factors, depression factors, somatization subscale factors, and sleep and diet factors were evaluated. Results: Of 4,000 undergraduates living at home, 64.8% were dissatisfied with their physical and mental condition. Ninety-three percent wanted to adopt an exercise practice at home during the period of COVID-19. In the prospective cohort study, the average anxiety scores and sleep and diet scores before the intervention were 2.14  0.43 and 2.24  0.54, respectively, in the intervention group.

Subjective factors can make supplying appropriate ventilation difficult. Capnography is not routinely used when ventilating nonintubated patients. Our objective was to determine if providers were able to maintain normal capnography values with BVM ventilation in pediatric patients based on clinical skills alone. METHODS Providers (nurses, residents, and fellows) delivered 2 minutes of BVM respiratory support to healthy children during induction of anesthesia for elective surgery. All patients had standard monitoring including capnography, but providers were blinded to capnography data. Capnography data were video recorded; values between 30 and 50 mmHg were considered indicative of normal ventilation. Any deviation from this range for greater than 10 consecutive seconds was considered an episode of inappropriate ventilation. MAIN RESULTS Twenty-five providers-patient pairs were enrolled. Nineteen providers were anesthesia residents. The median age of patients was 5.3 years (interquartile range, 3.3-8.5 years). Nineteen providers (76%) had at least 1 episode of abnormal ventilation with a median of 2 episodes per provider (interquartile range, 0.5-2.5). Among these providers, total mean duration of abnormal ventilation was 57 seconds (95% confidence interval, 41-72) or 47% (95% confidence interval, 34%-60%) of the 2-minute period.

While much research has focussed on the drivers of fish populations, there has been less investigation of the decisions made day-to-day by fishers and their subsequent impact on fishing pressure. Studies that focus on the fisher decisions of smaller vessels may be particularly important due to the prevalence of smaller vessels in many fisheries and their potential vulnerability to bad weather and economic change. Here we outline a methodology with which to identify the factors affecting fisher decisions and success as well as quantifying their effects. We analyse first the decision of when to leave port, and then the success of the fishing trip. Fisher behaviour is here analysed in terms of the decisions taken by fishers in response to bio-physical and socio-economic changes and to illustrate our method, we describe its application to the under 10-meter fleet targeting sea bass in the UK. We document the effects of wave height and show with increasing wave height fewer vessels left port to go fishing. The decision to leave port was only substantially affected by time of high tide at one of the four ports investigated. We measured the success of fishing trips by the landings of sea bass (kg) per metre of vessel length. Fishing success was lower when wave height was greater and when fish price had increased relative to the previous trip. Fuel price was unimportant, but a large proportion of the variation in success was explained by variation between individual vessels, presumably due to variation in skipper ability or technical restrictions due to vessel characteristics.

The pandemic is expanding rapidly which makes the global availability and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines critical. Strategies put in place include the establishment of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) within which the COVAX facility aims to distribute 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses by the end of 2021, with procurement mechanisms already being established. At the same time, regulatory authorities have emergency use authorizations aimed at the rapid approval of safe and effective vaccines, with a push for harmonization in regulatory approaches being advocated. The Meeting was also apprised of other innovations being developed for vaccines including multi-array patches for easier vaccine application, increased heat stability for mitigating cold chain and storage challenges, the barcoding of primary packaging for enhancing vaccine traceability, and gathering data for decision-making. Over time, these innovations will facilitate the widespread availability and equitable access of vaccines including those addressing epidemics and pandemics. In addition, a number of manufacturers described technologies they have for accelerating vaccine manufacturing and supply globally. Overall, there was agreement that manufacturers from developing countries play a critical role in the global research, development and supply of vaccines for a healthy future, with increasing collaboration and partnering between them a growing strength.","output":"Vaccines for a healthy future: 21st DCVMN Annual General Meeting 2020 report()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several viruses have been identified in recent years in the intestinal contents of chickens and turkeys with enteric problems, which have been observed in commercial farms worldwide, including Brazil.

We recently reported a laboratory protocol for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 based on real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays using two primer sets, N and N2. On January 30-31, 2020, the protocol and the reagents for these assays were distributed to the local public health institutes and quarantine depots in Japan nationwide, and thereafter SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing was initiated. For further validation, the assays were compared with the commercially available kits using the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and clinical specimens obtained from COVID19-suspected individuals. The LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene (LM S&W-E) assay was highly sensitive for the SARS-CoV-2, as was the N2 set, as both the assays showed consistent results for the clinical specimens. While the LM S&W-E set targets the highly conserved region of E gene in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the N2 set was designed to target specifically the unique region in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. Therefore, the N2 set exhibits high specificity and sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

The purpose of this study was to explore factors contributing to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare providers, their perspectives regarding vaccine uptake by the public and their recommendations to improve vaccine uptake in Ethiopia. METHODS: a phenomenological qualitative study was conducted among purposively selected healthcare providers working in the Ministry of Health (MoH), regulatory authority, public and private hospitals and health centres who hesitated to take the COVID-19 vaccine in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in June 2021. A total of twenty in-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured open-ended interview guide. Participants included nurses, physicians, pharmacists, health officers, Medical Laboratory technologists and midwives. A qualitative content analysis approach was chosen to analyse the data. RESULTS: all the participants agreed (n=20) that lack of consistent information and inadequate evidence about COVID-19 vaccine safety, efficacy and quality were the main reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. History of perceived and confirmed COVID-19 infection history, misinformation, religious views, unknown short and long-term effects of the vaccine and undefined length of time of vaccines protection were also other reasons mentioned by the participants. CONCLUSION: healthcare providers were hesitant toward COVID-19 vaccine mainly due to lack of clear evidence regarding the vaccines short and long-term safety, efficacy and quality profiles. Hence, the long-term safety and efficacy of the vaccine should be extensively studied and evidence dissemination and communication should be clear and transparent.","output":"Exploring reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare providers in Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic mandates the development of a safe and effective Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.

Detection and quantification of the virus from environmental DNA/RNA (eDNA/eRNA) using pond water represents a potential, noninvasive routine approach for pathogen monitoring and early disease forecasting in aquaculture systems. Here, we report a simple iron flocculation method for viral concentration from water combined with a newly developed hydrolysis probe quantitative RT-qPCR method for detection and quantification of TiLV. The RT-qPCR method targeting a conserved region of TiLV genome segment 9 has a detection limit of 10 viral copies per L of template. The method had a 100% analytical specificity and sensitivity for TiLV. The optimized iron flocculation method was able to recover 16.11  3.3% of virus from water samples spiked with viral cultures. During disease outbreak cases from an open-caged system and a closed hatchery system, both tilapia and water samples were collected for detection and quantification of TiLV. The results revealed that TiLV was detected from both clinically sick fish and asymptomatic fish. Most importantly, the virus was successfully detected from water samples collected from different locations in the affected farms e.g. river water samples from affected cages (8.50  102 to 2.79  104 copies/L) and fish-rearing water samples, sewage, and reservoir (4.29  102 to 3.53  103 copies/L) from affected and unaffected ponds of the hatchery. In summary, this study suggests that the eRNA detection system using iron flocculation coupled with probe based-RT-qPCR is feasible for concentration and quantification of TiLV from water.

Both medications prolong the QT interval and accordingly may put patients at increased risk of torsades de pointes and sudden death. Published guidance documents vary in their recommendations for monitoring and managing these potential adverse effects. Accordingly, we set out to conduct a systematic review of the arrhythmogenic effect of short courses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. We searched in MEDLINE and Embase, as well as grey literature up to April 17, 2020, on the risk of QT prolongation, torsades, ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden death with short-term chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine usage. This resulted in 390 unique records, of which fourteen were ultimately selected for qualitative synthesis and which included data on 1515 COVID-19 patients. Approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients treated with these drugs developed QT prolongation. We found evidence of ventricular arrhythmia in two COVID-19 patients out of a group of 28 treated with high-dose chloroquine. A limitation of these results is unclear follow-up and possible publication/reporting bias, but there is compelling evidence that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine induce significant QT interval prolongation and potentially increase the risk of arrhythmia.

METHODS: This retrospective research on 150 adults was conducted at Security Forces Hospital, Riyadh, KSA. Participants were allocated to three groups (50/group): control, T1DM, and T1DM with COVID-19. Participants' fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), complete blood count, vitamin D, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, D-dimer, liver and kidney function, and hydroxychloroquine treatment were retrieved and analyzed. RESULTS: The percentages of comorbidities and not taking hydroxychloroquine were significantly higher among T1DM patients with COVID-19 than patients with T1DM only.

Women who were referred from other hospitals (aOR 3.32; 95%CI 1.40C7.32) and had cesarean birth (aOR 4.96; 95%CI 1.66C14.86) were more likely to be admitted in ICU. Neonates born to women with MNM admitted in ICU had lower birthweight (aOR 5.41; 95%CI 2.53C11.58) and Apgar score at 5 min (aOR 6.39; 95%CI 2.20C18.55) compared with women with MNM outside ICU. ICU admission because of MNM occurred mostly postpartum (n = 63; 96.9%). Leading direct obstetric causes of MNM admitted in ICU were hypertensive diseases of pregnancy (n = 24; 36.9%), followed by postpartum hemorrhage (n = 14; 21.5%), while the leading indirect obstetric cause was heart diseases (n = 3; 4.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors that were associated with MNM in ICU were referral and cesarean birth. Hypertensive disease of pregnancy and postpartum hemorrhage were the main obstetric causes of MNM in ICU. These findings would provide guidance to improve professional skills of primary health care providers and encourage vaginal birth in the absence of medical indications for cesarean birth.","output":"Women with maternal near-miss in the intensive care unit in Yangzhou, China: a 5-year retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Affected by the COVID-19, the opening of higher education institutions in China has been postponed, and the policy of suspending classes without stopping has become a litmus test for emergency response to the epidemic and for education informationization.

COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The mode of transmission of COVID-19 is a subject of intense research. The airborne transmission is one prime possibility. Breathing and talking are natural processes which generate exhaled particles. The exhaled air is an aerosol/droplet composed of naturally produced particulates of varying size. The duration over which the aerosols/droplets are suspended in the air is an important factor. Long suspended aerosols/droplets are potential source of transmission, particularly in confined spaces. We have calculated times of suspension by considering various environmental factors, namely, the ambient temperature and relative humidity in a confined space, in this work. Both temperature and relative humidity affect the suspension time of the exhaled aerosols/droplets with varying degree. The effects of environmental factors are significant for aerosols, particularly for those with small radii. We have discussed the possible implications of our findings in this paper.

We sought to assess the sensitivity of four anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in individuals with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We obtained sera from 36 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and May 2020. We evaluated samples collected at around 21 days ({+/-}14 days) after their initial PCR test using 3 commercially available ELISA assays, two anti-spike (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Vitros, and Euroimmun) and one anti-nucleocapsid (Abbott Architect), and a Yale-developed anti-spike ELISA test. We determined the sensitivity of the tests and compared their results. The Euroimmun and Yale ELISA had an equivocal and indeterminate category, which were considered as both negative and positive. Results: Among the 36 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, mean age was 43 ({+/-}13) years and 19 (53%) were female. The sensitivities of the tests were not significantly different (Abbott Architect, Ortho Vitros, Euroimmmun, and Yale assays: 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71-95), 94% (95% CI, 81-99), 86% (95% CI, 71-95), and 94% (95% CI, 81-99), respectively; p-value=0.464). The sensitivities of the Euroimmun and Yale ELISA tests increased when the equivocal/indeterminate results were considered positive (97% [95% CI, 85-100] and 100% [95% CI, 90-100], respectively), but were not significantly different from other tests (p=0.082). The cross-correlation coefficient ranged from 0.85-0.98 between three anti-spike protein assays (Ortho Vitros, Euroimmun, Yale) and was 0.58-0.71 between the three anti-spike protein assays and the anti-nucleocapsid assay (Abbott). Conclusion: The sensitivities of four anti-SARS-CoV-2 protein assays did not significantly differ, although the sample size was small. Sensitivity also depended on the interpretation of equivocal and indeterminate results. The strongest correlations were present for the three anti-spike proteins assays. These findings suggest that individual test characteristics and the correlation between different tests should be considered when comparing or aggregating data across different populations studies for serologic surveillance of past SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Performance of Abbott Architect, Ortho Vitros, and Euroimmun Assays in Detecting Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators regulate the resolution of acute inflammation. They are formed by enzymatic oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and are divided into families including lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins. Resolvin D1 (RvD1), produced by docosahexaenoic acid, exerts anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving activities. This research aimed to investigate the implication of seminal RvD1 in human infertility. Infertile patients (n 67) were grouped based on pathological reproductive conditions as idiopathic infertility, varicocele, and leukocytospermia; the fourth group was composed of fertile men (n 18). Sperm characteristics were evaluated by light microscopy (WHO guidelines) and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The seminal levels of RvD1 and F(2)-isoprostane (F(2)-IsoPs) were dosed. In twenty men (6 fertile men, 8 with varicocele, 6 with leukocytospermia) seminal phospholipase A(2), iron, cholesterol, transferrin, estradiol, ferritin, testosterone, and sperm membrane fatty acids were detected. The results indicated that: (i) RvD1 amount was positively correlated with F(2)-IsoPs and reduced sperm quality; (ii) RvD1 levels were significantly higher in patients with leukocytospermia, varicocele, and idiopathic infertility compared to fertile men; (iii) RvD1 increased along with other markers of oxidative stress and inflammation as fatty acids content and clinical biomarkers.

For this reason, they may warrant long-term antiviral prophylaxis. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus, accounts for 10 to 20% of all shingles locations and can be associated with severe ocular involvement (keratitis, kerato-uveitis) of which a quarter becomes chronic/recurrent.

FCD has been insufficiently described in individuals with low education. Here, we investigated the frequency of FCD among individuals with low education. METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively all new referrals from primary care to a tertiary memory clinic from 2014 to 2021. Final diagnosis, diagnostic work-up, clinical and cognitive testing data were compared between FCD and other diagnoses, grouped as Neurodegenerative Disorders (NDD). A regression model was used to assess the effect of education on the diagnosis. Data is shown in Mean [SD]. RESULTS: A total of 516 individuals (70.76 [10.3] years) with low educational attainment (4.5 [3.94] years) were divided into FCD (146, 28.3%) and NDD. Compared with NDD, FCD patients showed lower age at presentation (66.2 [9.4] vs. 72.6 [10.2], p < 0.001), higher Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (22.4 [6.2] vs. 14.7 [7.8], p < 0.001) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) scores (7.4 [5.4] vs. 5.3 [3.7], p = 0.0001).

METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients admitted to an academic-level ED in France who were undergoing a joint measurement of SpO2 and arterial blood gas. We compared SpO2 with SaO2 and evaluated performance of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio for the prediction of 300 and 400 mmHg PaO2/FiO2 cut-off values in COVID-19 positive and negative subgroups using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: During the study period from February to April 2020, a total of 430 arterial samples were analyzed and collected from 395 patients.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are widely used in COPD, but the extent to which these therapies protect or expose patients to risk of severe COVID-19 is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ICSs following pulmonary expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). METHODS: We evaluated the effect of ICS administration on pulmonary ACE2 expression in vitro in human airway epithelial cell cultures and in vivo in mouse models of ICS administration. Mice deficient in the type I IFN-&#945;/? receptor (Ifnar1-/-) and administration of exogenous IFN-? were used to study the functional role of type-I interferon signaling in ACE2 expression. We compared sputum ACE2 expression in patients with COPD stratified according to use or nonuse of ICS. RESULTS: ICS administration attenuated ACE2 expression in mice, an effect that was reversed by exogenous IFN-? administration, and Ifnar1-/- mice had reduced ACE2 expression, indicating that type I interferon contributes mechanistically to this effect. ICS administration attenuated expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cell cultures from patients with COPD and in mice with elastase-induced COPD-like changes. Compared with ICS nonusers, patients with COPD who were taking ICSs also had reduced sputum expression of ACE2. CONCLUSION: ICS therapies in COPD reduce expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2.

Predicating our work on narrative theory, we present an automated pipeline for the discovery and description of the generative narrative frameworks of conspiracy theories that circulate on social media, and actual conspiracies reported in the news media. We base this work on two separate comprehensive repositories of blog posts and news articles describing the well-known conspiracy theory Pizzagate from 2016, and the New Jersey political conspiracy Bridgegate from 2013. Inspired by the qualitative narrative theory of Greimas, we formulate a graphical generative machine learning model where nodes represent actors/actants, and multi-edges and self-loops among nodes capture context-specific relationships. Posts and news items are viewed as samples of subgraphs of the hidden narrative framework network. The problem of reconstructing the underlying narrative structure is then posed as a latent model estimation problem. To derive the narrative frameworks in our target corpora, we automatically extract and aggregate the actants (people, places, objects) and their relationships from the posts and articles. We capture context specific actants and interactant relationships by developing a system of supernodes and subnodes. We use these to construct an actant-relationship network, which constitutes the underlying generative narrative framework for each of the corpora. We show how the Pizzagate framework relies on the conspiracy theorists interpretation of hidden knowledge to link otherwise unlinked domains of human interaction, and hypothesize that this multi-domain focus is an important feature of conspiracy theories. We contrast this to the single domain focus of an actual conspiracy. While Pizzagate relies on the alignment of multiple domains, Bridgegate remains firmly rooted in the single domain of New Jersey politics. We hypothesize that the narrative framework of a conspiracy theory might stabilize quickly in contrast to the narrative framework of an actual conspiracy, which might develop more slowly as revelations come to light. By highlighting the structural differences between the two narrative frameworks, our approach could be used by private and public analysts to help distinguish between conspiracy theories and conspiracies.","output":"An automated pipeline for the discovery of conspiracy and conspiracy theory narrative frameworks: Bridgegate, Pizzagate and storytelling on the web"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organizations use multiple strategies to increase the number and impact of eco-innovations as a path to achieve competitive advantage.

The rapid evolution of digital technologies has often created the necessity for the establishment of an e-Governance model. There is often a need for an inclusive e-governance model with integrated multiactor governance services and where a single market approach can be adopted. e-Governance often aims to minimise bureaucratic processes, while at the same time including a digital-by-default approach to public services. This aims at administrative efficiency and the reduction of bureaucratic processes. It can also improve government capabilities, and enhances trust and security, which brings confidence in governmental transactions. However, solid implementations of a distributed data sharing model within an e-governance architecture is far from a reality; hence, citizens of European countries often go through the tedious process of having their confidential information verified. This paper focuses on the sinGLe sign-on e-GovernAnce Paradigm based on a distributed file-exchange network for security, transparency, cost-effectiveness and trust (GLASS) model, which aims to ensure that a citizen can control their relationship with governmental agencies. The paper thus proposes an approach that integrates a permissioned blockchain with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). This method demonstrates how we may encrypt and store verifiable credentials of the GLASS ecosystem, such as academic awards, ID documents and so on, within IPFS in a secure manner and thus only allow trusted users to read a blockchain record, and obtain the encryption key. This allows for the decryption of a given verifiable credential that stored on IPFS.

Samples were collected approximately weekly by wastewater treatment utilities as part of a regular wastewater surveillance service and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were normalized to pepper mild mottle virus, an indicator of fecal matter in wastewater. We show that wastewater data reflect temporal and geographic trends in clinical COVID-19 cases and investigate the impact of normalization on correlations with case data within and across locations. We also provide key lessons learned from our broad-scale implementation of wastewater-based epidemiology, which can be used to inform wastewater-based epidemiology approaches for future emerging diseases. This work demonstrates that wastewater surveillance is a feasible approach for nationwide population-level monitoring of COVID-19 disease. With an evolving epidemic and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, wastewater-based epidemiology can serve as a passive surveillance approach for detecting changing dynamics or resurgences of the virus.

Over the past fortnightly reporting period, the number of new cases in all jurisdictions continues to decline, or remain very low, and testing rates continue to be high across all jurisdictions, with the positivity rate remaining very low at less than 0.1%. The incidence of COVID-19 has markedly reduced since a peak in mid-March. A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have been effective in slowing the spread of disease in Australia. Of the 147 cases notified between 25 May and 7 June, 63% acquired their infection overseas. The proportion of cases locally acquired has dropped substantially to 28% of new cases this period compared with 50% and greater observed since 30 March 2020. Of the cases considered to be locally-acquired over this period, most were associated with contacts of confirmed cases or were associated with known outbreaks. A small proportion of overall cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years. Three-quarters of all cases in this age group have been associated with overseas travel, including several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in children under 18, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, as of 7 June 2020, the largest numbers of both cases and deaths have been reported in the United States. Of the confirmed cases reported globally, the case fatality rate is approximately 5.8%.

In many cases, the characteristic timescale of environmental changes as well as their correlations play a fundamental role in the way living systems adapt and respond to it. A proper mathematical approach to understand population dynamics, thus, requires approaches more refined than, e.g., simple white-noise approximations. To shed further light onto this problem, in this paper we propose a unifying framework based on different analytical and numerical tools available to deal with colored environmental noise. In particular, we employ a unified colored noise approximation to map the original problem into an effective one with white noise, and then we apply a standard path integral approach to gain analytical understanding. For the sake of specificity, we present our approach using as a guideline a variation of the contact processwhich can also be seen as a birth-death process of the Malthus-Verhulst classwhere the propagation or birth rate varies stochastically in time. Our approach allows us to tackle in a systematic manner some of the relevant questions concerning population dynamics under environmental variability, such as determining the stationary population density, establishing the conditions under which a population may become extinct, and estimating extinction times.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 100 SCA patients; 50 with COVID-19 (COVID group) and 50 without (non-COVID group). All patients signed written informed consent. RESULTS: The COVID group had a significantly higher VOC episode median per year; 3 (IQR,1-6) vs 2 (IQR,2-12) (P < 0.05). The need for hospitalisation was similar in both groups. The non-COVID group had more history of culture-proven infection (P = 0.05).

We compared modified Rankin Scale scores and mortality at 3 months in patients hospitalised before and after the declaration of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS In total, 318 patients with acute ischaemic stroke met our inclusion criteria. No differences were observed between periods in global or specific characteristics, with the exception of a higher proportion of patients older than 80 years during the first period (42.2% vs. 29.0%, P=.028).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) have been shown to detect anti-PF4 in patients with VITT, but chemiluminescence assays do not reliably detect them. ELISA assays are not widely available in diagnostic laboratories, and, globally, very few laboratories perform platelet activation assays. METHODS: Assays that are commercially available in the United Kingdom were evaluated for their ability to identify anti-PF4 antibodies in samples from patients with suspected VITT. Four IgG-specific ELISAs, two polyspecific ELISAs, and four rapid assays were performed on samples from 43 patients with suspected VITT from across the United Kingdom. Cases were identified after referral to the UK Expert Haematology Panel multidisciplinary team and categorized into unlikely, possible, or probable VITT. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We demonstrated that the HemosIL AcuStar HIT-IgG, HemosIL HIT-Ab, Diamed PaGIA gel, and STic Expert assays have poor sensitivity for VITT in comparison to ELISA. Where these assays are used for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) diagnosis, laboratories should ensure that requests for suspected VITT are clearly identified so that an ELISA is performed. No superiority of IgG-ELISAs over polyspecific ELISAs in sensitivity to VITT could be demonstrated.

The phylogenetic analysis of the studied genomes along with the reference genome suggested that the viral strains found in Bangladesh might be coming from multiple countries such as France, Germany, India, the USA, and Brazil. After entering into the country, intra-cluster and inter-cluster began to circulate in the 8 individual divisions of Bangladesh. We also identified 26 parsimony-informative sites along with the 9 most important sites for virus evolution. Genome-wide annotations revealed 256 mutations, of which 10 were novel (NSP3, RdRp, Spike) in Bangladeshi strains where I120F(NSP2), P323L(RdRp), D614G (spike), R203K, G204R(N) are the most prominent. Most importantly, numerous mutations were flourishing in the N protein gene (67) followed by S (45), RdRp (38), NSP2 (34), NSP3 (20), and ORF8 (6) gene.

Administration of soluble ACE2 protein acting as a decoy to bind to SARS-CoV-2 should limit viral uptake mediated by binding to membrane-bound full-length ACE2, and further therapeutic benefit should result from ensuring enzymatic ACE2 activity to affected organs in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A short variant of human soluble ACE2 protein consisting of 618 amino acids (hACE2 1-618) was generated and fused with an albumin binding domain (ABD) using an artificial gene encoding ABDCon, with improved albumin binding affinity. Human kidney organoids were used for infectivity studies of SARS-CoV-2 in a BSL-3 facility to examine the neutralizing effect of these novel ACE2 variants. RESULTS: Whereas plasma ACE2 activity of the naked ACE2 1-618 and ACE2 1-740 lasted about 8 hours, the ACE2 1-618-ABD resulted in substantial activity at 96 hours, and it was still biologically active 3 days after injection. Human kidney organoids express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and when infected with SARS-CoV-2, our modified long-acting ACE2 variant neutralized infection.

Furthermore, GAPI is also a reliable tool in terms of comprehensiveness for the whole analytical procedures, from sampling till the final assessment. NEMI is the easiest and fastest greenness evaluation tool; however, the information it provides is particularly of limited scope and sometimes inaccurate. To ensure greenness of chromatographic analytical methods, there must be clear planning beforehand, to reduce chemical hazards sent to environment. Additionally, it is highly recommended in method validation protocols to consider the greenness of a given analytical procedure before releasing to routine use. The LC-MS/MS analysis for the active metabolite of REM (Nuc) reported by Avataneo et al. and Du et al. proved to be the best bio-analytical methods regarding the environmental aspects depending on the GAPI and AGREE tools. However, the HPLC method for REM analysis in intravenous solution reported by Jitta et al. proved to be the greenest analytical method for determination of REM in the pharmaceutical dosage forms according to the ESA, GAPI, and AGREE tools.","output":"Environmental impact of the reported chromatographic methods for the determination of the first FDA-Approved therapy for COVID-19 Patients, Remdesivir: A comparative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002, resulting in roughly 8000 cases worldwide and 10% mortality. The animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV precursors still exist and the likelihood of future outbreaks in the human population is high. The SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLP) is an attractive target for pharmaceutical development because it is essential for virus replication and is conserved among human coronaviruses. A yeast-based assay was established for PLP activity that relies on the ability of PLP to induce a pronounced slow-growth phenotype when expressed in S. cerevisiae. Induction of the slow-growth phenotype was shown to take place over a 60-hour time course, providing the basis for conducting a screen for small molecules that restore growth by inhibiting the function of PLP. Five chemical suppressors of the slow-growth phenotype were identified from the 2000 member NIH Diversity Set library. One of these, NSC158362, potently inhibited SARS-CoV replication in cell culture without toxic effects on cells, and it specifically inhibited SARS-CoV replication but not influenza virus replication. The effect of NSC158362 on PLP protease, deubiquitinase and anti-interferon activities was investigated but the compound did not alter these activities. Another suppressor, NSC158011, demonstrated the ability to inhibit PLP protease activity in a cell-based assay. The identification of these inhibitors demonstrated a strong functional connection between the PLP-based yeast assay, the inhibitory compounds, and SARS-CoV biology. Furthermore the data with NSC158362 suggest a novel mechanism for inhibition of SARS-CoV replication that may involve an unknown activity of PLP, or alternatively a direct effect on a cellular target that modifies or bypasses PLP function in yeast and mammalian cells.","output":"Yeast Based Small Molecule Screen for Inhibitors of SARS-CoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Several recent studies have found that fluvoxamine decreases the risk of serious disease progression among people with early COVID-19. In this study, we examined changes in the total number of fluvoxamine tablets dispensed across retail pharmacies in the U.S. Methods: We hypothesized that fluvoxamine prescriptions would increase substantially since March 2021 as an option for the early treatment of COVID-19. We used the IQVIA National Prescription Audit (NPA) Weekly nationally projected data for prescriptions dispensed from retail pharmacies for fluvoxamine from 27 December 2019 to 31 December 2021. We performed an interrupted-time series analyses on frequency of dispensing fluvoxamine tablets. Results: The weekly rate of dispensed tablets of fluvoxamine increased throughout the study period. The weekly number of dispensed tablets of fluvoxamine increased (11.1%) from a baseline of 1,586,154 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1,563,960 to 1,608,348) to 1,762,381 (95% CI: 1,735,682 to 1,789,080) by December 2021.

We discuss the role of hydrodynamic interactions for three different systems: i) the deformation and orientation of sedimenting semiflexible polymers, ii) the propulsion and force-rectification with a nano-machine realized by a rotating elastic rod, and iii) the deformation of a brush made of grafted semiflexible polymers in shear flows. In all these examples deformable polymers are subject to various hydrodynamic flows and hydrodynamic interactions. Perfect stiff nano-cylinders are known to show no orientational effects as they sediment through a viscous fluid, but it is the coupling between elasticity and hydrodynamic torques that leads to an orientation perpendicular to the direction of sedimentation. Likewise, a rotating stiff rod does not lead to a net propulsion in the Stokes limit, but if bending is allowed an effective thrust develops whose strength and direction is independent of the sense of rotation and thus acts as a rectification device. Lastly, surface-anchored polymers are deformed by shear flows, which modifies the effective hydrodynamic boundary condition in a non-linear fashion. All these results are obtained with hydrodynamic Brownian dynamics simulation techniques, as appropriate for dilute systems. Scaling analyses are presented when possible. The common theme is the interaction between elasticity of soft matter and hydrodynamics, which can lead to qualitatively new effects.","output":"Hydrodynamic effects in driven soft matter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Portugal is experiencing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020. All-causes mortality in Portugal increased during March and April 2020 compared to previous years, but this increase is not explained by COVID-19 reported deaths. The aim of this study was to analyze and consider other criteria for estimating excessive all-cause mortality during the early COVID-19 pandemic period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Public data was used to estimate excess mortality by age and region between March 1 and April 22, proposing baselines adjusted for the lockdown period. RESULTS: An excess mortality of 2400 to 4000 deaths was observed. Excess mortality was associated with older age groups (over age 65) [corrected]. DISCUSSION: The data suggests a ternary explanation for early excess mortality: COVID-19, non-identified COVID-19 and decrease in access to healthcare. The estimates have implications in terms of communication of non-pharmaceutical actions, for research, and to healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: Despite the inherent uncertainty, the excess mortality occurred between March 1 and April 22 could be 3.5- to 5-fold higher than what can be explained by the official COVID-19 deaths [corrected].","output":"Excess Mortality Estimation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Preliminary Data from Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methanolic extracts of liana of Caesalpinia welwitschiana and leaves of C. bonduc were found to possess moderate antifeedant and ovicidal activities against Tuta absoluta.

Colloidal growth techniques, such as antisolvent precipitation, form dispersions with properties that match bulk layered R-P phases, but controlling the composition of these particles remains challenging. Here, we explore the microstructure of particles of R-P phases of methylammonium lead iodide prepared by antisolvent precipitation from ternary mixtures of alkylammonium cations, where one cation can form perovskite phases (CH3NH3+) and the other two promote layered structures as spacers (e.g., C4H9NH3+ and C12H25NH3+). We determine that alkylammonium spacers pack with constant methylene density in the R-P interlayer and exclude interlayer solvent in dispersed colloids, regardless of length or branching. Using this result, we illustrate how the competition between cations that act as spacers between layers, or as grain-terminating ligands, determines the colloidal microstructure of layered R-P crystallites in solution. Optical measurements reveal that quantum well dimensions can be tuned by engineering the ternary cation composition. Transmission synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering and small-angle neutron scattering reveal changes in the structure of colloids in solvent and after deposition into thin films. In particular, we find that spacers can alloy between R-P layers if they share common steric arrangements, but tend to segregate into polydisperse R-P phases if they do not mix. This study provides a framework to compare the microstructure of colloidal layered perovskites and suggests clear avenues to control phase and colloidal morphology.","output":"Structural Evolution of Layered Hybrid Lead Iodide Perovskites in Colloidal Dispersions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":".","output":"Treatments for COVID-19: emerging drugs against the coronavirus - reply"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: As part of an ongoing effort to support the equitable delivery of cancer care to historically underserved communities inNew York City (NYC), we examined the impact of COVID-19 on community outreach organizations working with an NCI-comprehensive cancer center Methods: We conducted 16 semi-structured interviews (30-90 minutes;July-September 2020) with stakeholders (SH) including patient navigators, patient advocates, faith-based leaders, community health, and non-profit organizations in NYC-the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US Using thematic analysis, we characterized experiences and challenges in supporting cancer care delivery during COVID-19 Results: Per SH, COVID-19 required organizations to shift priorities to address day-to-day needs exacerbated by COVID-19 (food insecurity, financial/housing instability, misinformation, emotional distress) Organizations adapted by leveraging existing partnerships, including the cancer center, and partnering with new local/state organizations to broaden their work scope (e g , COVID-19 testing centers, food pantries, technology training), and disseminate reliable COVID-19 information to communities All organizations transitioned to virtual platforms creating challenges for those with limited technical resources and often excluded older or isolated populations;thus, many organizations retained a socially distanced in-person component to remain visible and trustworthy within the community Importantly, SH emphasized the importance of cancer center support via proactive involvement and communication with community members, providing a supportive infrastructure (funding, technical support, personnel), and incorporating community voices into new programs and projects during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic Conclusion: In addition to or in lieu of cancer care delivery efforts, community organizations are compelled to develop innovative approaches that address the more immediate needs of the community resulting from COVID-19 Cancer centers can support their community partners by being responsive and flexible to the community needs, building trust within the community, and strengthening community organizational capacity to reduce the long-term damage of COVID-19 and achieve equity","output":"Voices of community organizations: How cancer centers can support communities in the face of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Financial inclusion plays a positive role in protecting agriculture during or after disaster.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of pancreatic cancer patients (31 cases with E. coli BSI and 93 cases without BSI) by a case-control study. SPSS 17.0 was adopted to perform univariate and multivariate analyses. Bacterial resistance analysis was performed by Whonet 5.6. RESULTS: Hospitalization days 7 days, number of admissions 2 times, surgery, chemotherapy, the type of antibiotics used 2 species, albumin<40.0 g/L, and prealbumin < 0.2 g/L were the potential risk factors for pancreatic cancer patients with E. coli BSI (P < 0.1). Multivariate logistic regression showed hospitalization days 7 days (OR = 11.196, 95% CI = 0.024C0.333, P < 0.001), surgery (OR = 32.053, 95% CI = 0.007C0.137, P < 0.001), and chemotherapy (OR = 6.174, 95% CI = 0.038C0.688, P=0.014) were the independent risk factors for E. coli BSI of pancreatic cancer patients. E. coli resistant to carbapenems was rare; they were susceptible to cephamycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

We employed bivariate correlations and hierarchical regression to analyze the data. We found that the strongest predictors are political orientation, trust in physicians, subjective norms, and prior flu shot uptake. These associations suggest that individuals who held more liberal political views, expressed higher levels of trust in their primary care provider, perceived stronger social pressure to vaccinate against COVID-19, and received a flu shot during the previous flu season, had a stronger intention to vaccinate against COVID-19.

METHODS: We examined the association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death at a large medical center in New York City. Data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with Covid-19, excluding those who were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department (study baseline). The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those in patients who did not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. RESULTS: Of 1446 consecutive patients, 70 patients were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 1376 patients, during a median follow-up of 22.5 days, 811 (58.9%) received hydroxychloroquine (600 mg twice on day 1, then 400 mg daily for a median of 5 days); 45.8% of the patients were treated within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department, and 85.9% within 48 hours. Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were more severely ill at baseline than those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, 223 vs. 360). Overall, 346 patients (25.1%) had a primary end-point event (180 patients were intubated, of whom 66 subsequently died, and 166 died without intubation). In the main analysis, there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death (hazard ratio, 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.32). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death. Randomized, controlled trials of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19 are needed.

One reason for this problem may be the poor knowledge of pharmacological interactions in psychiatry. The aim of this study was to explore the opinions and knowledge of psychiatrists from around the world on various aspects related to polypharmacotherapy. A total of 1335 psychiatrists from six continents were included in the study. The respondents opinion on the problem of hepatotoxicity in psychiatry was also examined. The greatest discrepancy among psychiatrists from different continents in the answers given concerned the definition of polypharmacotherapy (p < 0.001) and the approach to hepatotoxicity (p < 0.001). It is noteworthy that only about 20% of the psychiatrists surveyed (p < 0.001) believe that polypharmacotherapy is associated with a higher rate of patients hospitalisations. The most commonly used type of polypharmacy by psychiatrists was antidepressants and antipsychotics. Most of them also stated that polypharmacy was associated with reduced patient compliance with the doctors recommendations related to taking medications due to the increased complexity of the therapy. The continent that diversified the analysed questions to the greatest extent was Africa.

In the current study, antibodies were investigated in patients recently diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were obtained from 245 patients in whom SARS-CoV-2 infection had been confirmed via real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction between March and October 2020. Serum samples were acquired between 2 and 60 days following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms or the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients. All specimens were tested simultaneously using an IgM/IgG rapid diagnostic test (RDT), IgG nucleocapsid protein-based chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA), IgG, and IgA spike protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Blood donor samples obtained in 2018 were used as negative controls. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the RDT IgG were compared with the IgG immunoassays as standards. The RDT IgG exhibited 97.5% sensitivity and 89.4% specificity compared with a CMIA IgG, 98.4% sensitivity, and 78.8% specificity compared with an ELISA IgG. IgM, IgG, and IgA seropositivity rates were low between 1 and 2 weeks after COVID-19 symptom onset or the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. IgM seropositivity rate began decreasing after 4 weeks, whereas IgG and IgA seropositivity rate remained at appreciable levels over the 8-week study period. No cross-reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses was detected.

Pandemics have occurred throughout human history and appear to be increasing because of rising emergence of viral diseases from animals (zoonoses). The risk of a pandemic arises from the combined effects of the Spark Risk (e.g. bushmeat hunting) and the Spread Risk (e.g. mode of transmission and population susceptibility). Pandemics have health, economic, gender, social and political impacts. Building pandemic preparedness is complex and requires considerable coordination. In the context of Covid-19, modelling of transmission has been central to many governments response including introduction of lockdown and physical distancing. Developing vaccines for novel pathogens is not simple or straightforward and community mitigation measures are essential.

The disease has caused significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among patients with comorbidities. The current treatment involves supportive management alongside antiviral therapy and immunosuppressant therapy in severely affected patients. We describe a case of a patient with underlying lupus nephritis (LN) who presented with severe COVID-19 infection and concomitant LN flare with acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient was treated with antiviral therapy, Favipiravir, considering his risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. As the patients would usually have AKI alongside LN flare, we administered initial steroid therapy at a lower dose (Methylprednisolone 50mg daily) and oral hydroxychloroquine despite the initial concerns on immunosuppressant usage in COVID-19 infections. Although our patient recovered relatively well from COVID- 19 infection, he continued to have positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 up to 29 days of illness. His kidney function stabilised despite having persistent nephrotic range proteinuria. Hence, the attending team decided to pulse the patient with a high dose steroid (IV Methylprednisolone 250mg OD for three days) after two weeks of illness despite the persistent positive swab. The patient's condition continued to improve, and this case illustrates an approach in treating COVID-19 with concomitant active immune-mediated glomerulonephritis.

METHODS From January 2012 to December 2013, data from patients who underwent curative radical gastrectomy and consequently received AC for pathologic stage 2 or 3 gastric cancer at 27 institutions in South Korea were analyzed. RESULTS The study enrolled 925 patients, 661 patients (71.5%) who completed 8 cycles of AC and 264 patients (28.5%) who did not. Compared with the mean disease-free survival (DFS) of the patients who completed 8 AC cycles (69.3 months), the mean DFS of patients who completed 6 AC cycles (72.4 months; p = 0.531) and those who completed 7 AC cycles (63.7 months; p = 0.184) did not differ significantly. However, the mean DFS of the patients who completed 5 AC cycles (48.2 months; p = 0.016) and those who completed 1-4 AC cycles (62.9 months; p = 0.036) was significantly lower than the DFS of those who completed 8 AC cycles. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, the mean DFS was significantly affected by advanced stage, large tumor size, positive vascular invasion, and number of completed AC cycles (1-5 cycles: hazard ratio 1.45; 95% confidence interval 1.01-2.08; p = 0.041).

Cheaper and faster alternatives, such as antigen and paper-strip tests, have been proposed. They return results rapidly, but have lower sensitivity thresholds for detecting virus. To quantify the effects of the tradeoffs between sensitivity, cost, testing frequency, and delay in test return on the overall course of an outbreak, we built a multi-scale immuno-epidemiological model that connects the virus profile of infected individuals with transmission and testing at the population level. We investigated various randomized testing strategies and found that, for fixed testing capacity, lower sensitivity tests with shorter return delays slightly flatten the daily incidence curve and delay the time to the peak daily incidence. However, compared with RT-PCR testing, they do not always reduce the cumulative case count at half a year into the outbreak. When testing frequency is increased to account for the lower cost of less sensitive tests, we observe a large reduction in cumulative case counts, from 55.4% to as low as 1.22% half a year into the outbreak. The improvement is preserved even when the testing budget is reduced by one half or one third.

Targeting these proteins represent viable options to stop the first stage of infection and transmission. Hence, 97 alkaloids from African medicinal plants with reported antiviral activity were evaluated for this purpose via in silico studies. These alkaloids were docked for their interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, ACE2, and TMPRSS2. Top 20 alkaloids with highest binding affinities were further screened for their interactions with spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and with ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain complex (ACE2-RBD). The energy profiling, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS), binding free energy base on Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA), clustering of MDS trajectories, and virtual physicochemical and pharmacokinetic screening of the best docked alkaloids were performed. Results revealed that more than 15 alkaloids interacted better than the reference compounds. 10-Hydroxyusambarensine and Cryptospirolepine were docked in a similar binding pattern to the S1-specificy pocket of TMPRSS2 as camostat (reference inhibitor).

METHODS: Here, we examined whether the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole could acutely reduce sFlt-1 and ET-1 (measured as CT-proET-1 [C-terminal pro-endothelin-1]), or increase free PlGF (placental growth factor) in 20 women with confirmed preeclampsia. Primary outcome was specified as the difference in sFlt-1, PlGF, or CT-proET-1 after 4 days of omeprazole versus 20 preeclamptic women not receiving omeprazole. RESULTS: Mean maternal age was 30 years, and median gestational age was 30(+3) weeks. Baseline sFlt-1 levels were identical in both groups, and the same was true for PlGF or CT-proET-1. After 4 days, sFlt-1 levels remained similar in women not receiving omeprazole compared with women receiving omeprazole, while the levels of PlGF and CT-proET-1 also did not differ between groups. Women receiving omeprazole had a similar prolongation of pregnancy after inclusion compared with those in the nonomeprazole group (median 15 versus 14 days). Except for a higher neonatal intubation rate in the nonomeprazole group (31% versus 4%, P=0.02), there were no differences in maternal/perinatal complications. Finally, making use of the placenta perfusion model, we established that both omeprazole and its S-isomer, esomeprazole, when maternally applied, reached the fetal compartment (fetal-to-maternal ratios 0.43C0.59), while only esomeprazole inhibited placental sFlt-1 release.

In this pursuit, an exhaustive computational method has been used on the DrugBank compounds targeting nsp16/nsp10 complex (PDB code: 6W4H). A structure-based pharmacophore model was generated, and the selected model was escalated to screen DrugBank database, resulting in three compounds. These compounds were subjected to molecular docking studies at the protein-binding pocket employing the CDOCKER module available with the Discovery Studio v18. In order to discover potential candidate compounds, the co-crystallized compound S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) was used as the reference compound. Additionally, the compounds remdesivir and hydroxycholoroquine were employed for comparative docking. The results have shown that the three compounds have demonstrated a higher dock score than the reference compounds and were upgraded to molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) studies. The MDS results demonstrated that the three compounds, framycetin, kanamycin, and tobramycin, are promising candidate compounds. They have represented a stable binding mode at the targets binding pocket with an average protein backbone root mean square deviation below 0.3 nm.

Published data demonstrate the possibility of severe kidney injury in patients suffering from COVID-19. However, these data are still controversial. Methods: A total of 1,280 patients with a proven diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in our study. COVID-19 was confirmed in all patients using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test of a nasopharyngeal swab, and based on the typical computed tomography findings. Demographic data, underlying comorbidities, and laboratory blood tests were assessed. We assessed the incidence of AKI and its associated mortality defined by survival status at discharge. Results: Proteinuria was identified with 648 patients (50.6%) with COVID-19. AKI was identified in 371 patients (29.0%). Ten of these patients (2.7%) required dialysis. The risk factors for AKI included age of > 65 years, augmentation of C-reactive protein, ferritin and an increase in values of activated partial thromboplastin time. Overall, 162 of the 1,280 hospitalized patients (12.7%) and 111 of the 371 patients (29.9%) with AKI did not survive. The hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was 3.96 (95% confidence interval, 2.83-5.54) for patients with AKI vs. no AKI. Conclusion: AKI was a relatively common finding among patients with COVID-19. The risk factors for AKI in COVID-19 included old age, the inflammatory response, the severity of lung involvement, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Methods: : This was an online, cross-sectional study recruited a total of 316 participants. Participants were administered a self-reported questionnaire to gather data on demographic, personal, clinical and psychological characteristics;the 21-item depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21) to assess the severity of their depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms;the multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) to assess the degree of social support;and the World Health Organization quality of life-BREF (WHOQoL-BREF) to assess QoL. Results: : The psychological and social QoL scores were lower than the non-pandemic norms of the general population, while the physical health and environmental QoL scores were comparable. After adjusting for relevant demographic, personal, and clinical variables, religious coping;greater number of hours of online classes attended;and greater social support from family, friends and significant others were found to be significantly associated with higher QoL among the participants.

This comes with a drawback, since CoG has a non-linear response at the periphery of the detector due to the lack of weights beyond the detector. Detectors with multiplexed readout that are based on finely segmented scintillators and coarsely segmented photosensors are known to suffer from the so called edge effect where a pile-up of the reconstructed coordinates from the edge crystals is observed. This may lead to incorrect assignment of the events to crystal pixels and result in formation of erroneous lines of response causing a degradation of spatial resolution and reduction of image contrast. To overcome abovementioned limitations in gamma ray detectors with multiplexed photosensor readout, we propose to use modified Gaussian Position Weighted Center of Gravity technique for calculation of gamma ray interaction position. Here the proposed method is applied to PET detectors with 2424 LYSO crystals read out by 8  8 SiPM array with 64:16 row/column multiplexing. Furthermore, we compared the modified Gaussian Position Weighted Center of Gravity (PW-CoG) and Truncated Center of Gravity (TCoG) coordinate reconstruction methods. It was observed that both algorithms resolve peaks corresponding to events registered in the crystal pixels on the periphery of the crystal array, however peak-to-valley ratios and crystal resolvability metrics for PW-CoG algorithm are generally greater.","output":"Gaussian position weighted center of gravity algorithm for multiplexed readout."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study industrial reactions to both the global financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic Although most industries in the U S suffered from the two events, the stock performance of most industries started to recover following the announcements of quantitative easing Our results indicate that quantitative easing is effective in boosting investor confidence We also find that the effect of quantitative easing in 2020 on stock performance is more significant for the industries that are more affected by the pandemic","output":"Global Financial Crisis and COVID-19: Industrial Reactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundSeasonal influenza vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) is widely recommended to protect staff and patients. A previous systematic review examined interventions to encourage uptake finding that hard mandates, such as loss of employment for non-vaccination, were more effective than soft mandates, such as signing a declination form, or other interventions such as incentives. Despite these overarching patterns the authors of the review concluded that substantial heterogeneity remained requiring further analysis. This paper reanalyses the evidence using Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to examine whether the strategies used to implement interventions explain the residual heterogeneity. MethodsWe used ICA to extract implementation features and trialists reflections on what underpinned the success of the intervention they evaluated. The ICA findings then informed and structured two QCA analyses to systematically analyse associations between implementation features and intervention outcomes. Analysis 1 examined hard mandate studies. Analysis 2 examined soft mandates and other interventions. ResultsIn Analysis 1 ICA revealed the significance of leading from the front rather than top-down implementation of hard mandates. Four key features underpinned this: providing education prior to implementation; two-way engagement so HCW can voice concerns prior to implementation; previous use of other strategies so that institutions dont-go-in-cold with hard-mandates; and support from institutional leadership. QCA revealed that either of two configurations were associated with greater success of hard mandates. The first involves two-way engagement, leadership support and a dont-go-in-cold approach. The second involves leadership support, education and a dont-go-in-cold approach. Reapplying the leading from the front theory in Analysis 2 revealed similar patterns. ConclusionsRegardless of intervention type a leading from the front approach to implementation will likely enhance intervention success.

Currently, there are no definitive recommendations as to the timing and dosing of prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In this manuscript, we report a case of SARS-CoV2-mediated hypercoagulability and review the literature pertaining to the incidence and pathophysiology of coronavirus-mediated coagulopathies. A 64-year-old female, with a medical history of hypothyroidism and remote tobacco abuse, presented to the ED with fever and nonproductive cough. She had multiple negative SARS-CoV2 nasopharyngeal PCR tests during her hospital stay, but chest imaging and elevated inflammatory markers were suggestive of SARS-CoV2 infection. Computed tomography showed a left upper lobe pulmonary embolism with associated right heart strain, and an enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, for which she was initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin. Despite the medical management of her pulmonary embolism and conservative management of her SARS-CoV2, her clinical condition worsened requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. After seven days, she was successfully extubated and was transferred to the medical service where her clinical course remained stable and subsequently discharged home on apixaban.

Twelve compounds, (C)-afzelechin (AF), (C)-epiafzelechin (EAF), (+)-catechin (CA), (C)-epicatechin (EC), (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (C)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (+)-catechin-3-O-gallate (CAG), (C)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate (ECG), (C)-gallocatechin-3-O-gallate (GCG), (C)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), procyanidin A2 (PA2), and procyanidin B2 (PB2), were selected for docking simulation. The resulting data predicted that all 12 metabolites could bind to M(pro). The affinity scores of PA2 and PB2 were predicted to be ?9.2, followed by ECG, GCG, EGCG, and CAG, ?8.3 to ?8.7, and then six flavan-3-ol aglycones, ?7.0 to ?7.7. Docking characterization predicted that these compounds bound to three or four subsites (S1, S1, S2, and S4) in the binding pocket of M(pro) via different spatial ways and various formation of one to four hydrogen bonds. In vitro analysis with 10 available compounds showed that CAG, ECG, GCG, EGCG, and PB2 inhibited the M(pro) activity with an IC(50) value, 2.98  0.21, 5.21  0.5, 6.38  0.5, 7.51  0.21, and 75.3  1.29 M, respectively, while CA, EC, EGC, GC, and PA2 did not have inhibitory activities. To further substantiate the inhibitory activities, extracts prepared from green tea (GT), two muscadine grapes (MG), cacao, and dark chocolate (DC), which are rich in CAG, ECG, GAG, EGCG, or/and PB2, were used for inhibitory assay.

Portable technology has become acutely important with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the conversion of in-person clinical evaluations to remote telemedicine encounters. Patients and providers want to do as much as possible remotely. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review of the accuracy and effectiveness of available portable automated refractors compared to the current standard of care, subjective refraction (SR). METHODS A literature search of PubMED, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov 97 unique publications in English on portable autorefractors. Twelve studies comparing a portable AR device to at least one form of SR were systematically included in this review. RESULTS There were four portable autorefractors (Netra, Quicksee, Retinomax and SVOne) studied against SR. There was high patient acceptance of glasses prescriptions by the Quicksee alone, with 87% subjects seeing the same or better than SR. Quicksee was more accurate than Netra and Retinomax. SVOne was preferred over Netra and outperformed Retinomax in multiple measures, despite Retinomax being the fastest test.

Identification of ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 as cellular receptors for these viruses has enabled the development of immunotherapeutic reagents which prevent virus attachment and subsequent fusion. Here we present the structural analysis of the protein and carbohydrate components of the unbound viral attachment glycoprotein of NiV glycoprotein (NiV-G) at a 2.2-A resolution. Comparison with its ephrin-B2-bound form reveals that conformational changes within the envelope glycoprotein are required to achieve viral attachment. Structural differences are particularly pronounced in the 579-590 loop, a major component of the ephrin binding surface. In addition, the 236-245 loop is rather disordered in the unbound structure. We extend our structural characterization of NiV-G with mass spectrometric analysis of the carbohydrate moieties. We demonstrate that NiV-G is largely devoid of the oligomannose-type glycans that in viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and Ebola virus influence viral tropism and the host immune response. Nevertheless, we find putative ligands for the endothelial cell lectin, LSECtin. Finally, by mapping structural conservation and glycosylation site positions from other members of the paramyxovirus family, we suggest the molecular surface involved in oligomerization.

However, most mAbs-based immunotherapies conducted so far have only considered the blunting of viral propagation and not other possible therapeutic effects independent of virus neutralization, namely the modulation of the endogenous immune response. As induction of long-term antiviral immunity still remains a paramount challenge for treating chronic infections, we have asked here whether neutralizing mAbs can, in addition to blunting viral propagation, exert immunomodulatory effects with protective outcomes. Supporting this idea, we report here that mice infected with the FrCas(E) murine retrovirus on day 8 after birth die of leukemia within 4C5 months and mount a non-protective immune response, whereas those rapidly subjected to short immunotherapy with a neutralizing mAb survive healthy and mount a long-lasting protective antiviral immunity with strong humoral and cellular immune responses. Interestingly, the administered mAb mediates lysis of infected cells through an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanism. In addition, it forms immune complexes (ICs) with infected cells that enhance antiviral CTL responses through FcR-mediated binding to dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, the endogenous antiviral antibodies generated in mAb-treated mice also display the same properties, allowing containment of viral propagation and enhancement of memory cellular responses after disappearance of the administered mAb. Thus, our data demonstrate that neutralizing antiviral mAbs can act as immunomodulatory agents capable of stimulating a protective immunity lasting long after the end of the treatment. They also show an important role of infected-cells/antibody complexes in the induction and the maintenance of protective immunity through enhancement of both primary and memory antiviral T-cell responses. They also indicate that targeting infected cells, and not just viruses, by antibodies can be crucial for elicitation of efficient, long-lasting antiviral T-cell responses. This must be considered when designing antiviral mAb-based immunotherapies.","output":"A Crucial Role for Infected-Cell/Antibody Immune Complexes in the Enhancement of Endogenous Antiviral Immunity by Short Passive Immunotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although endemic to much of the global population, few studies have examined Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in US refugee populations. This study investigates the prevalence of H. pylori infection and barriers to treatment in the International Family Medicine Clinic (IFMC), a primary care refugee clinic, in central Virginia. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a chart review of 188 refugee patients of the IFMC who were referred for an H. pylori test between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Recorded measures included patient demographics, H. pylori test result, treatment of initial infection, completion of test of cure (TOC), TOC results, salvage therapy, and barriers to treatment. Binary logistic regression was performed to examine the association between demographic factors and H. pylori test results. RESULTS Of the 171 patients who completed an H. pylori test, 94 tested positive (54.9%). Of the 93 patients that were subsequently treated, 76 were treated with clarithromycin triple therapy (82%). Forty-eight patients (52%) completed a TOC after completing treatment, and 21 (43%) of these patients remained positive, indicating persistent infection. Eighteen patients (90%) who remained positive for H. pylori were subsequently treated with quadruple therapy. Patients under 18 (OR = 0.25, p < 0.01) and patients with a history of previous H. pylori (OR = 0.44, p < 0.05) were less likely to have positive results on initial H. pylori testing. Common barriers to treatment included pregnancy, religious observance (e.g., fasting), and health system complications (e.g., prior authorization for medications, cost of treatment).

However, a more sensitive and accurate diagnostic tool was required. Therefore, droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) was suggested as an alternative method. Here, we evaluated the performance of ddPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 and compared it to the performance of RT-qPCR. METHODS: The analytical performances, including limit of blank and limit of detection, were established using positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 reference materials. A total of 366 RNA extracts (173 positive and 193 negative by RT-qPCR) were collected from four institutions and tested with a Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR kit that detects the SARS-CoV-2 genome using primers for N1 and N2. RESULTS: Limit of blank was set at 0, and the limits of detection of N1 and N2 were 1.99 copies/L and 5.18 copies/L, respectively. Linearity was evaluated using serial dilution samples, which demonstrated good results (R(2): 0.999, linear range: 5.88C6825.25 copies/L for N1 and R(2): 0.999, 5.53C5855.47 copies/L for N2). The results of ddPCR and RT-qPCR revealed substantial agreement (Cohens kappa: 0.639, p < 0.01). The 63 samples with positive ddPCR but negative RT-qPCR showed low copy numbers, and 55% of them had COVID-19-related symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction demonstrated excellent sensitivity for SARS-Cov-2 detection and consistently agreed with the results from conventional RT-qPCR. Furthermore, ddPCR provided quantitative data that can be used to monitor changes in the viral load of patients with COVID-19.

When patients refuse to undergo coronavirus disease testing, they compromise not only just their own health but also the health of those around them. The primary objective of our review is to identify the most ethical way a given healthcare system may respond to a patients refusal to undergo coronavirus disease 2019 testing. DATA SOURCES: We apply a systematic approach to a true clinical case scenario to evaluate the ethical merits of four plausible responses to a patients refusal to undergo coronavirus disease testing. Although our clinical case is anecdotal, it is representative of our experience at our University Tertiary Care Center. DATA EXTRACTION: Each plausible response in the case is rigorously analyzed by examining relevant stakeholders, facts, norms, and ethical weight both with respect to individuals rights and to the interests of public health. We use the So Far No Objections method as the ethical approach of choice because it has been widely used in the Ethics Modules of the Surgical Council on Resident Education Curriculum of the American College of Surgeons. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two ethically viable options may be tailored to individual circumstances depending on the severity of the patients condition. Although unstable patients must be assumed to be coronavirus disease positive and treated accordingly even in the absence of a test, stable patients who refuse testing may rightfully be asked to seek care elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Although patient autonomy is a fundamental principle of our societys medical ethic, during a pandemic we must, in the interest of vulnerable and critically ill patients, draw certain limits to obliging the preferences of noncritically ill patients with decisional capacity.","output":"Critical Ethics: How to Balance Patient Autonomy With Fairness When Patients Refuse Coronavirus Disease 2019 Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Although the diagnosis and treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80% of LC cases, have greatly improved in the past decade, there is still an urgent need to find more sensitive and specific screening methods. Recently, new molecular biomarkers are emerging as potential non-invasive diagnostic agents to screen NSCLC, including multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) that show an unusual expression profile. Moreover, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) miRNA profile could be linked with NSCLC and used for diagnosis. We developed a molecular beacon (MB)-based miRNA detection strategy for NSCLC. Following PBMCs isolation and screening of the expression profile of a panel of miRNA by RT-qPCR, we designed a MB targeting of up-regulated miR-21-5p. This MB 21-5p was characterized by FRET-melting, CD, NMR and native PAGE, allowing the optimization of an in-situ approach involving miR-21-5p detection in PBMCs via MB.

Recent scientific evidence demonstrates its feasibility and patient satisfaction. During the lockdown period, the Department of Pediatric Orthopedics at the Istituto di Cura Citta di Pavia supported subjects affected by AIS in two manners: online with the physical therapist (TR) and by using pre-recorded videos (VE). The aim of the present exploratory trial was to evaluate the practice of telerehabilitation in order to employ it in case of new lockdown measures. METHODS: Adherence, perceived enjoyment during the exercise performance and degree of satisfaction with technology were assessed on 18 subjects with AIS, divided into two groups according to the type of exercise administration (seven patients in TR;11 patients in VE). RESULTS: The VE group shows a more noticeable adherence than the TR group. Nonetheless, the perceived enjoyment is more significant in the TR subjects than in the VE ones. The level of satisfaction with technology is positive in both groups under study, without remarkable differences. CONCLUSIONS: The exercise administered at a distance has been positively perceived by all the subjects, though on different levels according to the type of technology employed. Results speak in favor of the use of technology as a means to therapeutic exercise delivery in individuals with AIS. Nevertheless, it is not clear which of the two types it is better to suggest.

The objective of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with end-stage heart failure and durable LVADs. METHODS: The Trans-CoV-VAD registry is a multi-center registry of LVAD and cardiac transplant patients in the United States with confirmed COVID-19. Patient characteristics, exposure history, presentation, laboratory data, course, and clinical outcomes were collected by participating institutions and reviewed by a central data repository. This report represents the participation of the first 9 centers to report LVAD data into the registry. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were included in this cohort. The median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 46C68), 14 (35%) were women, and 21 (52%) were Black. Among the most common presenting symptoms were cough (41%), fever, and fatigue (both 38%). A total of 18% were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Only 43% of the patients reported either subjective or measured fever during the entire course of illness.

To this end we developed a deterministic transmission model based on the renewal equation and fitted the model to daily case and death data in the first few months of 2020 in 79 countries and states, representing 4.2 billions individuals. Based on a region-specific infection fatality ratio, we inferred the time-varying probability of case detection and the time-varying decline in transmissiblity. As a validation, the predicted total number of infected was close to that found in serosurveys; more importantly, the inferred probability of detection strongly correlated with the number of daily tests per inhabitant, with 50 % detection achieved with 0.003 daily tests per inhabitants. Most of the decline in transmission was explained by the reductions in transmissibility (social distancing), which avoided 10 millions deaths in the regions studied over the first four months of 2020. In contrast, symptom-based testing and isolation of positive cases was not an efficient way to control the spread of the disease, as a large part of transmission happens before symptoms and only a small fraction of infected individuals was typically detected. The latter is explained by the limited number of tests available, and the fact that increasing test capacity often increases the probability of detection less than proportionally. Together these results suggest that little control can be achieved by symptom-based testing and isolation alone.","output":"Estimating the global reduction in transmission and rise in detection capacity of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mechanism of host cell invasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 SARS-CoV-2 is connected with the interaction of spike protein (S) with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through receptor-binding domain (RBD).

Our previous reports investigating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PTSD patients showed that these patients exhibit an increased inflammatory T helper (Th) cell phenotype and widespread downregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs), key molecules involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. A combination of analyzing prior datasets on gene and miRNA expression of PBMCs from PTSD and Control samples, as well as experiments using primary PBMCs collected from human PTSD and Controls blood, was used to evaluate TP53 expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA modulation on Th17 development. In the current report, we note several downregulated miRNAs were linked to tumor protein 53 (TP53), also known as p53. Expression data from PBMCs revealed that compared to Controls, PTSD patients exhibited decreased TP53 which correlated with an increased inflammatory Th17 phenotype. Decreased expression of TP53 in the PTSD population was shown to be associated with an increase in DNA methylation in the TP53 promotor region. Lastly, the most significantly downregulated TP53-associated miRNA, let-7a, was shown to negatively regulate Th17 T cells. Let-7a modulation in activated CD4+ T cells was shown to influence Th17 development and function, via alterations in IL-6 and IL-17 production, respectively. Collectively, these studies reveal that PTSD patients could be susceptible to inflammation by epigenetic dysregulation of TP53, which alters the miRNA profile to favor a proinflammatory Th17 phenotype.","output":"Dysregulated TP53 Among PTSD Patients Leads to Downregulation of miRNA let-7a and Promotes an Inflammatory Th17 Phenotype"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a wide range of effects on education at all levels worldwide.

In this article, we investigate false news across nine domains on Weibo, the largest Twitter-like social media platform in China, from 2009 to 2019. The newly collected data comprise 44,728 posts in the nine domains, published by 40,215 users, and reposted over 3.4 million times. Based on the distributions and spreads of the multi-domain dataset, we observe that false news in domains that are close to daily life like health and medicine generated more posts but diffused less effectively than those in other domains like politics, and that political false news had the most effective capacity for diffusion. The widely diffused false news posts on Weibo were associated strongly with certain types of users -- by gender, age, etc. Further, these posts provoked strong emotions in the reposts and diffused further with the active engagement of false-news starters. Our findings have the potential to help design false news detection systems in suspicious news discovery, veracity prediction, and display and explanation.

Furthermore, sources and wet deposition of WSOC were estimated using in-situ measurements and modeling. The light-absorption by WSOC at 250-300a?nm (UV region) and 400-550a?nm (visible region) was 64.17% and 15.36% relative to the estimated total light-absorption, respectively.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Pragmatic, unblinded randomized clinical trial conducted at 21 hospitals in Canada, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the US. Eligible adult patients with COVID-19 were not intubated and required oxygen (40%) or noninvasive ventilation. A total of 400 patients were enrolled between May 19, 2020, and May 18, 2021, and final follow-up was completed in July 2021. Intervention: Patients were randomized to awake prone positioning (n = 205) or usual care without prone positioning (control; n = 195). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was endotracheal intubation within 30 days of randomization. The secondary outcomes included mortality at 60 days, days free from invasive mechanical ventilation or noninvasive ventilation at 30 days, days free from the intensive care unit or hospital at 60 days, adverse events, and serious adverse events. Results: Among the 400 patients who were randomized (mean age, 57.6 years [SD, 12.83 years]; 117 [29.3%] were women), all (100%) completed the trial. In the first 4 days after randomization, the median duration of prone positioning was 4.8 h/d (IQR, 1.8 to 8.0 h/d) in the awake prone positioning group vs 0 h/d (IQR, 0 to 0 h/d) in the control group. By day 30, 70 of 205 patients (34.1%) in the prone positioning group were intubated vs 79 of 195 patients (40.5%) in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.59 to 1.12], P = .20; absolute difference, -6.37% [95% CI, -15.83% to 3.10%]). Prone positioning did not significantly reduce mortality at 60 days (hazard ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.40], P = .54; absolute difference, -1.15% [95% CI, -9.40% to 7.10%]) and had no significant effect on days free from invasive mechanical ventilation or noninvasive ventilation at 30 days or on days free from the intensive care unit or hospital at 60 days.

The results bring further support to the claim that, among all the factors contributing to home advantage and referee bias, crowd noise has a relevant role. Thus, spectators can significantly contribute to determine the dynamics and the outcomes of professional football matches.","output":"The sound of silence in association football: Home advantage and referee bias decrease in matches played without spectators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo declared its tenth Ebola virus disease outbreak in July 2018, which has circulated primarily in the Nord Kivu province. In addition to standard epidemiologic surveillance and response efforts, the Institut National de Recherche Biom&eacutedicale implemented an end-to-end genomic surveillance system, including sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, and dissemination of genomic epidemiologic results to frontline public health workers. Here we report 538 new genomes from this outbreak; together with previously available sequence data (n = 48 genomes), this represents an unprecedented 17% of all laboratory-confirmed infections. To support outbreak response efforts, we reconstructed spatiotemporal transmission dynamics at broad and at fine scales as new data were available and disseminated the results via an interactive narrative-based platform. Our innovative system enables actionable information sharing between scientists and epidemiologists coordinating the day-to-day response on the time scales necessary to guide response efforts. The development of this genomic surveillance pipeline, within a resource-limited setting, represents significant technological and scientific progress in genomic epidemiology. Here we present a phylodynamic analysis of the outbreak as of February 2020, and describe the types of epidemiologic dynamics that we monitor the genomic data for, including resolution of co-circulating transmission chains, detection of superspreading events, inference of regions that act as transmission sources and sinks, and differentiation of closely linked cases versus propagated transmission.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS the study subjects were all COVID-19 cases diagnosed in the area of the Agency for Health Protection of the Metropolitan Area of Milan (Lombardy Region, Northern Italy) between 10.02.2020 and 25.04.2020, whose data were gathered with an ad hoc information system developed at the beginning of the pandemic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES the association between metabolic syndrome components (alone and in combination) and hospitalization (both in any ward and in intensive care unit) was measured by means of cause-specific Cox models with gender, age, and comorbidities as potential confounders. RESULTS the cohort included 15,162 subjects followed from diagnosis up to 20.07.2020. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of hospitalization in any ward estimated by the Cox model were 1.26 for uncomplicated diabetes mellitus (95%CI 1.18-1.34); 1.21 for complicated diabetes mellitus (95%CI 1.05-1.39); 1.07 for dyslipidaemia (95%CI 1.00-1.14); and 1.11 for hypertension (95%CI 1.05-1.17).

Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a begomovirus, which is the largest and most economically important group of plant viruses, transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. The circulation of TYLCV in the insect involves complex insect-virus interactions, whereas the molecular mechanisms of these interactions remain ambiguous. The insect gut as a barrier for viral entry and dissemination is thought to regulate the vector specificity. However, due to its tiny size, information for the responses of whitefly gut to virus infection is limited. METHODS: We investigated the transcriptional response of the gut of B. tabaci Middle East-Asia Minor 1 species to TYLCV infection using Illumina sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 5207 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between viruliferous and non-viruliferous whitefly guts were identified. Enrichment analyses showed that cargo receptor and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were enriched in DEGs, and might help the virus to cross gut barrier. TYLCV could perturb cell cycle and DNA repair as a possible result of its replication in the whitefly. Our data also demonstrated that TYLCV can activate whitefly defense responses, such as antimicrobial peptides. Meanwhile, a number of genes involved in intracellular signaling were activated by TYLCV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the complex insect-virus relationship in whitefly gut and provide substantial molecular information for the role of insect midguts in virus transmission.

Study selection, data extraction and bias assessment (using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale) were performed independently by 2 authors. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. In all, 16 studies (11 cohort studies and 5 case-control studies) involving a total of 391,071 HCV patients and 38,333,839 non-HCV controls were included. The overall analysis showed a 47% higher risk to develop kidney cancer among the patients with HCV infection (pooled OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.14-1.91), despite significant heterogeneity (I2 = 87.6%). The multivariable meta-regression showed that study design, age, sample size and HIV co-infection were significant sources of variance, and totally accounted for 82% of the I2 .

Results show that trust in vaccines, concerning both the vaccine's efficacy and the vaccine's safety, was associated with willingness to use the vaccine. Perceptions of trust were related to intergroup psychology, such that vaccine donations from political opponents rather than allies were trusted less. This meant that in the Philippines, there was a preference to use vaccines from the United States over those from China, although the pattern was less clear in Pakistan. Having said this, the highest levels of trust and willingness to use vaccines in both countries were for vaccines offered by the World Health Organization (WHO). Last but not least, a perception of global common fate of all humans in the face of the pandemic was positively associated with willingness to get vaccinated, even when controlling for concerns about the vaccine's efficacy and safety.

Clinical utility of urine genotyping, however, has not been explored extensively. We evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M detection in matched urine, plasma, and tissue and the clinical outcomes of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer treated with rociletinib. METHODS Tissue (n = 540), plasma (n = 482), and urine (n = 213) were collected from evaluable patients enrolled in TIGER-X, a phase I/II study. Genotyping was performed by therascreen EGFR testing in tissue, BEAMing in plasma, and a quantitative short footprint assay (Trovera) in urine, which was used to further examine discordant samples. RESULTS Positive percent agreement with tissue T790M results was similar for urine (82%; 142 of 173) and plasma (81%; 313 of 387) genotyping. Urine and plasma together identified more patients who were T790M positive (92%) than tissue alone (83%) among matched samples (n = 177). The ability to identify mutations in plasma was strongly associated with M stage (P < .001); rate of T790M detection for patients with M1a/M0 disease increased from 54% for plasma alone to 85% when urine and plasma were both examined. Objective response rates of patients who were T790M positive were comparable between tumor (34%), plasma (32%), and urine (37%). CONCLUSION Clinical response to rociletinib was comparable irrespective of whether T790M status was identified by liquid or tissue biopsy. Combined, urine and plasma identified a higher percentage of patients who were T790M positive than tumor genotyping alone and improved detection of T790M, particularly in the absence of distant metastases. These findings support the noninvasive analysis of urine and plasma before tumor rebiopsy when assessing T790M status.","output":"EGFR Genotyping of Matched Urine, Plasma, and Tumor Tissue in Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Rociletinib, an EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To fight the global pandemic of COVID-19, the government of Nepal made it compulsory for everyone entering the country to be confined in quarantine for two weeks Without proper infrastructure, facilities for lodging, and food, many people fled from the quarantine shelter in the initial days The authorities were helpless in checking up on them then One month after the complete lockdown, there were still people who were defying the rule and walking hungry and barefoot toward their native homes","output":"The Empty Stomach That Defies All Rules"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives This study assesses associations between mistreatment by a provider during childbirth and maternal complications in Uttar Pradesh, India.

As of November 11th, 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in 189 countries/regions around the world, with a total of 51,510,611 confirmed cases and more than 1,275,211 deaths, with a global fatality rate of 2.48% (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020b). Therefore, countries are facing lockdown crises and their populations face daily lives full of chaos, anxiety, and reorganization. The characteristics of this epidemic are most often described as \\"unprecedented\\" and replete with \\"uncertainty\\" (Davidson et al., 2020). In order to prevent the spread of this virus, health measures such as quarantine, wearing protective masks, and enforced lockdowns have been adopted by governments around the world, producing psychosocial (emotional distress, anxiety, suicide) and economic side-effects (Lima et al., 2020; Montemurro, 2020). Despite its close geographical proximity to China, Taiwan's number of confirmed infections has been relatively small (584 people diagnosed as of November 11th, with 7 total COVID-19-related fatalities; Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020b). Taiwan's tragic experience 17 years ago with the SARS epidemic helped prepare the government to respond rapidly to the COVID-19 threat, make thorough preparations and advanced deployments, and formulate relevant anti-epidemic border control measures, quarantine and isolation measures, mask-wearing requirements, and public education strategies. Actions such as mask wearing, washing hands frequently, and practicing proper social distancing by the public and the government maintaining a master travel history, occupation, contact history, and cluster (TOCC) database have proven effective in detecting and diagnosing cases early (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020a; Yang et al., 2020). Furthermore, providing first-line personnel with appropriate protective equipment, education, and training as well as timely and transparent information and epidemic prevention guidelines have kept nurses supplied with appropriate personal protective equipment, infection-prevention and control education, training and exercises, and sufficient professional knowledge and skills to provide care safely to patients (Chen et al., 2020; Huang & Chen, 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Concurrently, it has been a challenge to nursing educators regarding how to suspend classes while not stopping academic education and to plan meaningful, alternative clinical experiences during the pandemic (Morin, 2020) and how to redefine and evaluate student performance to maintain teaching quality and learning effectiveness. In addition, \\"disaster nursing\\" is a critical area of professional knowledge for nurses in the 21st century, and all nurses should have an appropriate level of competence in professional disaster nursing. Therefore, core concepts related to infection control, disasters, and disaster preparedness should be incorporated into the curriculum and objectives. Finally, although we in Taiwan have faced the COVID-19 challenge in an environment in which the pandemic risk has been relatively well controlled, our daily lives are no longer taken for granted. When we look back on this experience, what will we learn from these experiences and how will this experience change how we approach healthcare and pandemic threats in the future?

On 16 March 2020, the government announced measures that could be taken by the public to reduce the spread of the virus. On the 18 March 2020 schools across the UK were closed and by 23rd March 2020, the UK entered its first mandatory lockdown. During this time, UK equestrians had to balance meeting their horses welfare needs with government advice and guidance. A survey was distributed to equine owners at the end of March 2020 via social media to try to understand their equine-related decision-making at this time. Data from 452 respondents indicated differences between the types of changes made following the government announcements on 16 March and 18 March. Early changes were focused on implementing biosecurity measures at equine establishments and opting to stop riding the horse, while those after 18 March were largely aimed at reducing the risk associated with various equine-related activities. The findings suggest that few equestrians had emergency plans in place should they be unable to care for their horses, donkeys or mules, and also raise questions about risk perception. ABSTRACT: In the UK, March 2020 was a time of great uncertainty as COVID-19 became increasingly widespread. The government responded by making suggestions about how people could reduce the risk of spread on 16 March, moved swiftly into closing schools on the 18 March before announcing a mandatory lockdown on the 23rd March. This was a challenging time for UK equestrians who had to balance maintaining their equines routine and daily care alongside the increasing biosecurity measures. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to UK equestrians via social media over two days (28 and 29 March 2020) to better understand the decisions made by UK horse, pony and donkey owners during this time. Data from 452 respondents were generated across all four countries comprising the UK, although there were no significant differences in owner response to the pandemic between locations. The changes respondents made differed between the 16th and the 18th of March 2020, with an early emphasis on improving yard biosecurity and opting to stop riding, as well as reducing the time spent at the yard. After the 18 March, respondents placed more emphasis on risk reduction by changing the activities they did with their horse, including riding, with common examples including avoiding high risk activities such as riding on busy roads, jumping, riding young or nervous horses. Few respondents reported having an emergency plan in place should they become ill or otherwise unable to care for their equine. The findings highlight areas that would significantly benefit from in-depth investigation in future research. Equestrian behaviour and mindset around risk-taking and risk perception have already been researched in relation to equestrian activities and sport but have received little attention in the context of wider health challenges. Understanding the uptake of emergency planning and preparation in the UK equestrian community also warrants consideration. Using this information effectively to promote forward planning is likely to be of great benefit in equestrian responses to future health or climate-related crises.","output":"Response of UK Horse, Pony and Donkey Owners to the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Cancer patients, especially those receiving cytotoxic therapy, are assumed to have a higher probability of death from COVID-19 We have conducted this study to identify the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in cancer patients with COVID-19 and have explored the relationship of various clinical factors to mortality in our patient cohort Methods All confirmed cancer cases presented to the hospital from June 8 to August 20, 2020, and developed symptoms/radiological features suspicious of COVID-19 were tested by Real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and/or cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test from a combination of naso-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 Clinical data, treatment details, and outcomes were assessed from the medical records Results Of the total 3,101 cancer patients admitted to the hospital, 1,088 patients were tested and 186 patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 The CFR in the cohort was 27/186 (14 52%) Univariate analysis showed that the risk of death was significantly associated with the presence of any comorbidity (OR: 2 68;(95% CI [1 13C6 32]);P = 0 025), multiple comorbidities (OR: 3 01;(95% CI [1 02C9 07]);P = 0 047 for multiple vs single), and the severity of COVID-19 presentation (OR: 27 48;(95% CI [5 34C141 49]);P &lt; 0 001 for severe vs not severe symptoms) Among all comorbidities, diabetes (OR: 3 31;(95% CI [1 35C8 09]);P = 0 009) and cardiovascular diseases (OR: 3 77;(95% CI [1 02C13 91]);P = 0 046) were significant risk factors for death Anticancer treatments including chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy administered within a month before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms had no significant effect on mortality Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study from India reporting the CFR, clinical associations, and risk factors for mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients Our study shows that the frequency of COVID-19 in cancer patients is high Recent anticancer therapies are not associated with mortality Pre-existing comorbidities, especially diabetes, multiple comorbidities, and severe symptoms at presentation are significantly linked with COVID-19 related death in the cohort","output":"COVID-19 mortality in cancer patients: a report from a tertiary cancer centre in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with a high incidence of thromboembolic events, both venous and arterial.

Mean age was 6019 years for patients with mild and moderate disease and 6914 years for patients with severe disease, 52% with mild and moderate disease and 48% with severe disease were woman, 11% with mild and moderate disease and 20% with severe disease with concurrent cardiovascular disease The median of IPF% was higher in the severe COVID-19 group compared to patients with mild or moderate disease [4.2 (IQR 2.73-6.45) vs 5.8 (IQR 3.9-8.7), P=0.01, Figure 1)]. The median of IPF absolute number was also significantly higher in patients with severe disease comparing to patients with mild or moderate disease (4.2 (2.85-6.1) vs 5.1 (IQR 3.65-7.35), P<0.0001, Figure 2]. Conclusions: Patients with severe Covid-19 have a higher level of IPF in the circulation than patients with mild or moderate disease. IPF may serve as a reliable prognostic marker for in-hospital disease severity in patients with Covid-19.","output":"Immature platelets in patients with Covid-19: Association with disease severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper looks at regulatory developments on sustainability risks in insurance companies.

The focus is on the work on EU regulation by the European Commission and the EU insurance supervisory authority EIOPA, especially on the EU supervisory system Solvency II and on insurance stress testing exercises. The focus is on scenario analyses and stress tests on sustainability risks. The latter are applicable for micro- and macroprudential purposes. Their design is discussed with regard to, inter alia, scenarios, time horizons and granularity. The article thus provides an overview and outlook on the regulatory treatment of sustainability risks in the insurance sector, whereby the EU requirements could serve as a model for international progress in this field.","output":"Nachhaltigkeitsrisiken in Versicherungsunternehmen.

The objective of this review is to identify and appraise the available evidence (clinical trials and laboratory studies on masks and respirators, epidemiological studies, and air sampling studies), clarify key concepts and necessary conditions for airborne transmission, and shed light on knowledge gaps in the field. We find that, except for aerosol-generating procedures, the overall data in support of airborne transmissiontaken in its traditional definition (long-distance and respirable aerosols)are weak, based predominantly on indirect and experimental rather than clinical or epidemiological evidence. Consequently, we propose a revised and broader definition of airborne, going beyond the current droplet and aerosol dichotomy and involving short-range inhalable particles, supported by data targeting the nose as the main viral receptor site. This new model better explains clinical observations, especially in the context of close and prolonged contacts between health care workers and patients, and reconciles seemingly contradictory data in the SARS-CoV-2 literature. The model also carries important implications for personal protective equipment and environmental controls, such as ventilation, in health care settings. However, further studies, especially clinical trials, are needed to complete the picture.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and Health Care Worker Protection in Low-Risk Settings: a Review of Modes of Transmission and a Novel Airborne Model Involving Inhalable Particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Cytokine storm in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients causes lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Immunomodulators such as steroids are widely used to control this situation. This study investigates the effectiveness of steroids used in COVID-19 patients, and their effects on secondary infections, morbidity, and mortality. METHODS: Data were obtained by retrospectively scanning the files of patients in our hospitals intensive care unit clinic during the three peak periods. RESULTS: Between the steroid and non-steroid groups, there was no statistically significant difference in reproductive rates. These rates were 49.7% and 43.2%, respectively. Reproductive rates among steroid types were determined as 25 (56.8%) in the Methylprednisolone group, 18 (69.2%) (Highest) in the Dexamethasone + Methylprednisolone group, and 54 (43.2%) (Lowest) in the Dexamethasone group. Steroid treatment duration was effective on reproduction. Steroids cause more infections, especially after invasive procedures (Tracheal intubation, central venous catheter, etc.). In the groups with and without tracheal aspirate steroids, the growth rates were 71 (76.3%) and 32 (54.2%) respectively. There was no difference in mortality between the groups. CONCLUSION: Cytokine storm causes lung damage and ARDS. Steroids can be useful in controlling this hyper-inflammatory situation. However, increased secondary infections, an important side effect of steroids, increase mortality. Steroids more often cause these infections, especially in patients undergoing invasive Strict adherence to infection control measures during steroid treatment will reduce this risk. In conclusion, while steroids reduce mortality by controlling the hyper-inflammatory picture, they also increase mortality with increased secondary infections.

A subsequent increase in community prevalence of infection could delay further relaxation of lockdown if vaccine uptake and efficacy are not sufficiently high to prevent increased pressure on healthcare services. Methods The PCR self-swab arm of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission Study (REACT-1) estimates community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England based on random cross-sections of the population ages five and over. Here, we present results from the complete round 9 of REACT-1 comprising round 9a in which swabs were collected from 4th to 12th February 2021 and round 9b from 13th to 23rd February 2021. We also compare the results of REACT-1 round 9 to round 8, in which swabs were collected mainly from 6th January to 22nd January 2021. Results Out of 165,456 results for round 9 overall, 689 were positive. Overall weighted prevalence of infection in the community in England was 0.49% (0.44%, 0.55%), representing a fall of over two thirds from round 8. However the rate of decline of the epidemic has slowed from 15 (13, 17) days, estimated for the period from the end of round 8 to the start of round 9, to 31 days estimated using data from round 9 alone (lower confidence limit 17 days). When comparing round 9a to 9b there were apparent falls in four regions, no apparent change in one region and apparent rises in four regions, including London where there was a suggestion of sub-regional heterogeneity in growth and decline. Smoothed prevalence maps suggest large contiguous areas of growth and decline that do not align with administrative regions. Prevalence fell by 50% or more across all age groups in round 9 compared to round 8, with prevalence (round 9) ranging from 0.21% in those aged 65 and over to 0.71% in those aged 13 to 17 years. Round 9 prevalence was highest among Pakistani participants at 2.1% compared to white participants at 0.45% and Black participants at 0.83%. There were higher adjusted odds of infection for healthcare and care home workers, for those working in public transport and those working in education, school, nursery or childcare and lower adjusted odds for those not required to work outside the home. Conclusions Community prevalence of swab-positivity has declined markedly between January and February 2021 during lockdown in England, but remains high; the rate of decline has slowed in the most recent period, with a suggestion of pockets of growth. Continued adherence to social distancing and public health measures is required so that infection rates fall to much lower levels. This will help to ensure that the benefits of the vaccination roll-out programme in England are fully realised.","output":"REACT-1 round 9 final report: Continued but slowing decline of prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 during national lockdown in England in February 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Spinal cord injury is mostly caused by traumatic accident and usually associated with several injuries.

Italy is also a seismically active area, and as such is monitored by a dense permanent network of seismic stations. We analyse continuous seismic data from many stations in northern and central Italy, and quantify the impact of the lockdown on seismic ambient noise, as a function of time and location. We find that the lockdown reduces ambient noise significantly in the 1C10 Hz frequency range; because natural sources of seismic noise are not affected by the lockdown, the seismic signature of anthropic noise can be characterised with unprecedented clarity, by simply comparing the signal recorded before and after the lockdown. Our results correlate well with independent evaluations of the impact of the lockdown (e.g., cell phone displacements), and we submit that ambient-noise seismology is a useful tool to monitor containment measures such as the coronavirus lockdowns.","output":"The 2020 coronavirus lockdown and seismic monitoring of anthropic activities in Northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Covid 19 pandemic has led to and continues to pose challenges for healthcare systems globally, especially in intensive care units.

Literature about international electives is scarce, and understanding what made a student choose one destination over another is unclear. Many medical students based in Europe travel to Africa each year for their elective, however, students expectations and motivations are yet largely unexplored. METHODS: To gain insights into the factors driving students to travel to Africa, we analyzed two large international elective databases based in Germany. We reviewed elective testimonies and extrapolated geographical data as well as the choice of discipline for electives completed in Africa. Based on pre-defined categories, we also investigated students motivations and expectations. RESULTS: We identified approximately 300 elective reports from medical students from German-speaking countries who chose to travel to Africa for their elective. Students commonly reported destinations in Southern and East Africa, with the Republic of South Africa and Tanzania being the most frequently selected destinations. Surgical disciplines were the most commonly reported choice. Diverse motivations were identified, including the desire to improve knowledge and clinical examination skills. A large proportion of students reported a link between destination choice and the potential to partake in surgical procedures not feasible at home; whether these surgeries were not or no longer practiced at home, or whether students could not partake due to level of training, was not ascertainable from the data. A trend-analysis revealed a growing interest in travelling to Africa for electives within the last 15 years. We observed a sharp decline in reports in 2020, a phenomenon most likely related to SARS-CoV-2-related travel restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that medical electives in Africa are commonly reported by medical students from German-speaking countries, with diverse motivations for the choice of destination. A non-neglectable proportion of students identified the possibility to engage in surgical procedures as one of the main reasons for choosing Africa. This poses a series of ethical dilemmas, and well-structured pre-departure trainings may be a solution to this.

The TLIF procedure can be performed open or using minimally invasive techniques. While several studies have found that minimally invasive TLIF (MI-TLIF) has advantages over open TLIF procedures with less blood loss, postoperative pain and hospital length of stay, opponents of the minimally invasive technique cite the lack of restoration of lumbar lordosis as a major drawback. With the increasing awareness of restoring sagittal alignment parameters in degenerative and deformity procedures, surgeons should understand the capabilities of different procedures to achieve surgical goals. To our knowledge, few studies have specifically studied the radiographic restoration of lumbar lordosis after MI-TLIF procedures. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature describing the sagittal lumbar radiographic parameter changes after MI-TLIF. METHODS Following PRISMA guidelines, systematic review was performed. With the assistance of a medical librarian, a highly-sensitive search strategy formulated on 1/19/2018 utilized the following search terms: \\"minimally invasive procedures,\\" \\"transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion,\\" \\"lumbar interbody fusion,\\" \\"diagnostic imaging,\\" \\"radiographs,\\" \\"radiography,\\" \\"x-rays,\\" \\"lordosis,\\" \\"lumbar vertebrae,\\" \\"treatment,\\" \\"outcome,\\" and \\"lumbosacral\\" using Boolean operators 'AND' and 'OR'. Three databases were searched (PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library). An online system (www.covidence.org) was used to standardize article review. All studies were independently analyzed by two investigators and discrepancies mitigated by a third reviewer. Study selection for each cycle was Yes/No/Maybe. Cycles were: (1) (Title/Abstract); (2) (Full Text); (3) (Extraction). Inclusion criteria were: (1) All study designs, (2) MI-TLIF procedures, (3) Reporting total lumbar lordosis (LL) and/or segmental lordosis (SL) pre- and postoperatively. Exclusion criteria were: (1) non MI-TLIF procedures (ALIF, XLIF, LLIF, conventional TLIF, OLIF), (2) No reported LL or SL. RESULTS The search yielded 4,036 results with 836 duplicates leaving 3,200 studies for review. Cycle 1 eliminated 3,153 studies as irrelevant, thus, 47 were eligible for full-text review. Cycle 2 excluded 31 studies for No English full text (9), Oral/Poster (8), Wrong intervention/outcome (10), Duplicate listing (2), Full text not available (1), Literature review (1) resulting in 16 included studies. Study designs were: Randomized-controlled trial (3), Case series (6) and Retrospective (7). Mean # of subjects were 32.0 (range 8-95). Weighted-mean LL was 39.69.2 (range 28-57) and postoperative LL was 45.07.4 (range 36-67) with a LL post-pre difference of 5.25.9 (range -7 to 15). Weighted-mean preoperative SL was 12.74.3 (range 5-21) and postoperative SL was 15.04.5 (range 5-22) with a SL post-pre difference of 2.11.7 (range 0-8). CONCLUSIONS The current literature on MI-TLIF and restoration of LL/SL is limited to 16 published studies, 44% of which are retrospective. The published evidence supporting LL and SL restoration with MI-TLIF is sparse with variable results. This systematic review demonstrates the need for future high-level studies to fully elucidate the capabilities of MI-TLIF procedures for restoring lumbar and segmental lordosis.","output":"Restoration of lumbar lordosis after minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To evaluate the mechanism of Chinese patent drug Xuebijing (XBJ) injection in the treatment of a new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on network pharmacology and molecular docking technology.

Natural products may follow different regulations, from food to therapeutics. Concerning their isolated constituents, extracts are characterized by a complexity that is not easily tackled from both a scientific and a regulatory point of view, but more importantly, from a therapeutic point of view. The evidence-based approach applied to isolated molecules requires appropriate evidence of quality, efficacy, and safety. The same needs must be reached for complex substances by finding appropriate methods to generate this evidence, and in addition, defining an appropriate regulatory field for them. From a scientific point of view, new methods, such as those proposed by systems biology, are available and applicable to complex substances. From a regulatory point of view, Directive 2001/83/EC on medicinal products seems to be modeled on single (or combinations of single) molecule products. On the other hand, Regulation 2017/745/EC on medical devices seems to apply to complex substances without derogating on quality, efficacy, and safety. The regulation specifically names and strengthens medical devices that include substances, mostly of natural origin, introducing the official term medical devices made of substances.

One of the most important insights is that all of the proteins in this pathogen present unique epitopes, so that the targeting of a few specific viral proteins is not likely to result in an effective immune response in humans. Due to the presence of these unique epitopes in all of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, stronger immune responses generated by T cell hyperactivation may lead to cytokine storm and immunopathology and consequently, remote chances of human survival.

The resulting optimization problem is expressed as a cost function to be optimized. Here, we map the cost function into an Ising-like Hamiltonian, describing a system of long-range interacting qubits. Finally, we solve the dose optimization problem by finding the ground-state of the Hamiltonian using a Tree Tensor Network algorithm. In particular, we present an anatomical scenario exemplifying a prostate cancer treatment.

Whilst the results of initial community COVID-19 vaccination are awaited, continuation of multimodality teaching and training that incorporates telelearning will have enduring benefit to post-graduate education and will place educational establishments in good stead to nimbly respond in future pandemic-related public health emergencies. With the rise in innovative virtual learning solutions, medical educators will have to leverage technology to develop electronic educational materials and virtual courses that facilitate adult learning. Technology-enabled virtual learning is thus a timely progression of hybrid classroom initiatives that are already adopted to varying degrees, with a need for faculty to serve as subject matter experts, to host and moderate online discussions, and to provide feedback and overall mentorship. As an extension from existing efforts, simulation-based teaching (SBT) and learning and the use of mixed reality technology should also form a greater core in the cardiovascular medicine curriculum.

With digitalisation impacting our everyday lives and now how we teach and train in medicine, these five guiding principles provide a cognitive scaffold for careful consideration of the required ecosystem in which cardiovascular and general post-graduate medical education can effectively operate.

When an operation continues for an extended duration, regression of spinal anesthesia often leads to general anesthesia. Here we present a case of extended spinal anesthesia assisted by monitored anesthesia care. Case presentation: A 32-year-old male who suffered from persistent pain of the right knee was diagnosed with rupture of the right anterior cruciate ligament. Arthroscopic surgery of the right knee was conducted with spinal anesthesia. A local anesthetic mixture of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 12 mg with 50 g of epinephrine was used. The surgery took longer than expected with a total anesthesia time of 402 minutes. In the final 30 minutes of surgery, spinal anesthesia regressed and the procedure was completed under monitored anesthesia care (MAC). Clinical discussion: When spinal anesthesia is on regression during the final stage of surgery, the application of MAC safely secures additional operation time. By adopting MAC, the patient avoided general anesthesia and had minimal physiological distress and a rapid recovery. Another benefit of MAC is the reduced consumption of resources. Further, by avoiding endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, the risk of transmission of infectious agents is minimized. Conclusion: In situations where spinal anesthesia is regressing close to the end of a surgical procedure, the application of MAC has potential benefits over general anesthesia. These benefits are particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic. ? 2021 The Authors","output":"A case report of arthroscopic surgery under extended spinal anesthesia for 402 minutes, assisted by monitored anesthesia care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new respiratory tract infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus.

METHODS: An initial search of PubMed (until 6 May 2020) was combined with targeted searches of both PubMed and Google Scholar until 1 July 2020. Findings were streamlined for clinical relevance through the advice of an expert working group that included seven senior surgeons and a senior medical virologist. RESULTS: Patient history should be examined for potential exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Hyposmia and hypogeusia may present as early symptoms of COVID-19, and can potentially discriminate from other influenza-like illnesses. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard diagnostic test to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, and although sensitivity can be improved with repeated testing, the decision to retest should incorporate clinical history and the local supply of diagnostic resources. At present, routine serological testing has little utility for diagnosing acute infection. To appropriately conduct preoperative testing, the temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 must be considered. Relative to other thoracic imaging modalities, computed tomography has the greatest utility for characterizing pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 patients who have been diagnosed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

Methods: In this paper, the reported COVID-19 number of deaths in South Africa, for the period 27 March 2020 to 20 May 2020, is modeled using four statistical distributions which can be grouped under the Generalised Gamma distribution. This exploratory study also uses simple additive models to capture the underlying COVID-19 death rate. Results: Empirical results show that the Gamma distribution gives the best fit to the data. The hazard rate is still increasing, and the peak number of deaths has not been reached yet despite the lockdown and other measures to try and slow down the progression of the disease. Conclusions: The exploratory data analysis done in this study is simple and meant to complement the detailed and complex modelling done which is useful in informing policy and decision making.","output":"Statistical distribution fitting to the number of COVID-19 deaths in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine is emerging as key healthcare delivery method in management of patients with limited healthcare access, particularly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. As sleep medicine is technology driven to begin with, it translates well to telemedicine-based patient care. A wide variety of sleep disorders can be evaluated, diagnosed, and managed via telemedicine, while maintaining the highest quality of patient care. This chapter presents two common sleep complaints as telemedicine cases, sleep-disordered breathing and insomnia. Although these complaints are common, they require a special approach via telemedicine. The challenges and pitfalls of these cases are discussed, as well as the distinct advantages of telemedicine in such scenarios. Additionally, clinical pearls are offered regarding the practice of sleep telemedicine, based on available evidence and guidelines.","output":"Sleep Telemedicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The transition from analogue to digital pathology (DP) in Switzerland has coincided with the COVID-19 crisis. The Swiss Digital Pathology Consortium conducted a national survey to assess the experience of pathologists in dealing with the challenges of the pandemic and how this has influenced the outlook and adoption of DP. METHODS: A survey containing 20 questions relating to DP, personal experiences and challenges during the pandemic was addressed to Swiss pathologists at different experience stages in private practice, community and university hospitals. RESULTS: All 74 respondents were pathologists, with 81.1% reporting more than 5 years of diagnostic service experience. 32.5% reported having read 100 digital slides or more in a diagnostic context. 39.2% reported using whole slide imaging systems at their primary workplace. Key DP use cases before the COVID-19 lockdown were tumour boards (39.2%), education (60.8%) and research (44.6%), with DP used for primary diagnosis in 13.5%. During the COVID-19 crisis, the use of DP for primary diagnostics more than doubled (30% vs 13.5%), with internal consults as important drivers (22.5% vs 16.5%), while research use (25% vs 44.6%) and external consults (17.5% vs 41.9%) strongly decreased. Key challenges identified included a lack of established standard operating procedures and availability of specialised hardware and software. CONCLUSIONS: This survey indicates that the crisis acted as a catalyst in promoting DP adoption in centres where basic workflows were already established while posing major technical and organisational challenges in institutions that were at an early stage of DP implementation.","output":"Update on the current opinion, status and future development of digital pathology in Switzerland in light of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a very deadly disease, which has killed thousands and infected millions of people worldwide. More recently in the year 2021, one of its mutants known as \\"The Delta Variant\\" has ravaged our country. It is also currently the chief cause of increasing cases in some North-Eastern states like Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. Different measures have been adopted by the Government in collaboration with local social bodies to identify the infected individuals, detect the level of infection and also vaccinating individuals to shield them from this deadly disease. The current paper is also focused on one such stage, which is quite critical at this juncture, and will use the power of Artificial Intelligence to appropriately identify COVID-19 affected individuals using chest X-Ray images. When implemented, it will make it easier to identify the infection of the lungs by COVID-19. More specifically, the proposed methodology seeks to establish a chain of processes that can help in detecting the infection in the lungs using an advanced and novel image pre-processing with a prediction fusion-based deep learning-based identification system. The image pre-processing technique will initially improve the raw images by selectively optimizing the chromatic intensity and brightness of needy pixels using a deep learning-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) that uses the sigmoidal function. The enhanced image samples are made to undergo training with GoogLeNet and MobileNet deep learning models so that during the testing phase a prediction-fusion approach can be implemented to generate more robust prediction results. An exhaustive implementation with a standard dataset has revealed that the proposed approach can provide a mean accuracy of 98.63%, with the Covid and Normal classes showing 97.17% and 99.22% accuracies respectively. Another deadly disease that has infected thousands of people worldwide is skin cancer. Using the similar technical approach described above, a technique for identifying the type of skin cancer has been developed and experimented by using a standard dataset. Good accuracy of 85.42% has been achieved despite some classes having a comparatively lesser number of image samples. Finally, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) has also been developed by using the trained deep learning files of GoogLeNet and MobileNet so that a user can simply enter the desired image and check the type of prediction/class.","output":"Identification of the Types of Skin Cancers from Skin Cancer Images and Covid-19 Detection on Chest X-Ray Images using Deep Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The coronavirus pandemic, which has numerous global implications, has led people to believe that nothing will be the same as before.

Depending upon the underlying condition, morphological abnormalities are seen in malabsorption range from normal mucosa with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (gluten-sensitive enteropathy, viral gastroenteritis, food allergies, etc.), villous shortening with crypt hyperplasia (celiac disease (CD), treated CD, tropical sprue, and bacterial overgrowth), to completely flat mucosa (CD, refractory sprue, enteropathy-induced T-cell lymphoma, and autoimmune enteropathy).

Many patient-related factors, such as pre-existing comorbidities, affect disease severity and can be used to aid this prediction. OBJECTIVE: Because rapid automated profiling of peripheral blood samples is widely available, we aimed to investigate how data from the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 can be used to predict clinical outcomes. METHODS: We investigated clinical data sets of patients with COVID-19 with known outcomes by combining statistical comparison and correlation methods with machine learning algorithms; the latter included decision tree, random forest, variants of gradient boosting machine, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and deep learning methods. RESULTS: Our work revealed that several clinical parameters that are measurable in blood samples are factors that can discriminate between healthy people and COVID-19Cpositive patients, and we showed the value of these parameters in predicting later severity of COVID-19 symptoms. We developed a number of analytical methods that showed accuracy and precision scores >90% for disease severity prediction. CONCLUSIONS: We developed methodologies to analyze routine patient clinical data that enable more accurate prediction of COVID-19 patient outcomes. With this approach, data from standard hospital laboratory analyses of patient blood could be used to identify patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of mortality, thus enabling optimization of hospital facilities for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Machine Learning Approach to Predicting COVID-19 Disease Severity Based on Clinical Blood Test Data: Statistical Analysis and Model Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The past decade has seen a large influx of work investigating time of day variation in different human biofluid and tissue metabolomes.

This review, of all published studies to date, establishes the extent of daily variation with regard to the number and identity of rhythmic metabolites observed in blood, saliva, urine, breath, and skeletal muscle. The probable sources driving such variation, in addition to what metabolite classes are most susceptible in adhering to or uncoupling from such cycles is described in addition to a compiled list of common rhythmic metabolites. The reviewed studies show that the metabolome undergoes significant time of day variation, primarily observed for amino acids and multiple lipid classes. Such 24 h rhythms, driven by various factors discussed herein, are an additional source of intra/inter-individual variation and are thus highly pertinent to all studies applying untargeted and targeted metabolomics platforms, particularly for the construction of biomarker panels.

METHODS: A cross-sectional on-line survey was distributed to employees of a major health care institution located in S?o Paulo, Brazil between April 3 and April 10, 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The sample comprised 2,646 respondents. Most participants (44.4%) reported excessive or almost excessive access to information about the novel coronavirus and 67.6% reported having increased their average time spent on social media. When asked how frequently they consider it was easy to determine the reliability of information, sometimes corresponded to 43.2% of the answers in contrast to 14.6% responding always. Answers related to potential signs of information overload associated with the pandemic indicated that 31% of respondents felt stressed by the amount of information they had to keep up with almost every day or always. Overall, 80.0% of respondents reported having experienced at least one of the following symptoms: headache, eye twitching, restlessness or sleeping difficulty. The frequency of symptoms was higher among participants with a more negative information processing style regarding when dealing with large volumes of information relative to those with a positive information processing style. Likewise, symptoms were more frequently reported by participants who had increased their social media access relative to those reporting reduced access during the pandemic.

This study aimed to measure the intervention's impact on length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission, and the daily intensity of inpatient services utilization. METHODS Using a nonrandomized controlled intervention at a 1000-bed U.S. academic quaternary medical center, we studied 13,941 individuals admitted to a general medicine hospitalist service (of which 5644 were age > =65 years); 1483 were on intervention teams (576 age > =65 years), 5413 concurrent controls, and 7045 historical controls. On 2 of 11 hospitalist teams, a geriatrician, palliative care physician and social worker attended multidisciplinary discharge rounds twice weekly, to recommend inpatient geriatric or palliative care consult (GPCC), postacute nursing or home care, versus postdischarge outpatient consultation. We measured the difference in improvement over time between intervention and control team patients for the following: (1) LOS adjusted for case-mix index, (2) 30-day readmissions, and (3) intensity of hospital service utilization (mean services provided per patient per day). RESULTS Adjusted LOS (in hospital days) was decreased by 0.36 days (p = 0.039) for the 1483 patients in the intervention teams, with greater LOS reduction of 0.55 days per admission (p = 0.022) on average among the subset of 576 older patient admissions. Readmissions were unchanged (-1.17%, p = 0.48 for all patients; 1.91%, p = 0.46 for older patients). However, the daily relative value unit (RVU) utilization was modestly increased for both the overall and older subgroup, 0.35 RVUs (p = 0.041) and 0.74 RVUs (p < 0.001) per patient-day on average across the intervention teams, respectively. CONCLUSION An interprofessional intervention of geriatric and palliative care consultation in collaboration with a hospitalist service may reduce LOS, especially for geriatric patients, without an increase in readmissions.

The study design was prospective observational using three anesthetized female pigs (20-25 kg). Forty-eight 2.5-  2.5-cm burns were created on the flanks of pig's using an aluminum bar (150 g) preheated to 80C for 20 seconds. Burns were treated with an occlusive or antimicrobial dressing and photographed at day 10 for determination of gross percentage reepithelialization in a 1-cm diameter circle in the center of the burn by two experienced clinicians masked to each other's measurements. A 10-mm full-thickness punch biopsy was taken from the center of the burns and evaluated by a board-certified dermatopathologist masked to clinical assessments. One clinician and the dermatopathologist repeated the assessments 1 month apart. The outcome was percentage wound reepithelialization at 10 days. The criterion standard was the histological assessment. Intraobserver and interobserver agreements were calculated with Pearson's correlation coefficients. A coefficient less than .4 was considered poor. Sixteen burns were created on each of three animals. Six wounds were excluded because of the presence of a thick eschar covering the burn, making the gross determination of reepithelialization impossible. Intraobserver agreement for histological reepithelialization was 0.96 (P < .001). Intraobserver agreement for gross visual assessment of reepithelialization was 0.75 (P < .001). Interobserver agreement for gross visual assessment of reepithelialization was 0.60 (P < .001). The agreement between gross visual and histological assessment of burn reepithelialization was -0.25.

In the cytoplasm, SHP2 potentiates RAS-ERK signaling, which promotes cell proliferation and cell motility, while in the nucleus, it mediates gene regulation. As a result, elucidating the details of SHP2 trafficking is important for understanding its biological roles, including in cancer. YAP1 comprises multiple splicing isoforms defined in part by the presence (as in YAP1-2?3) or absence (as in YAP1-2&#945;) of a ?3-segment encoded by exon 6 that disrupts a critical leucine zipper. While the disruptive segment is known to reduce coactivator function, it is unclear how this element impacts the physical and functional relationships between YAP1 and SHP2. To explore this question, we first demonstrated that YAP1-2?3 cannot bind SHP2. Nevertheless, YAP1-2?3 exhibits stronger mitogenic and motogenic activities than does YAP1-2&#945; because the YAP1-2&#945;-mediated delivery of SHP2 to the nucleus weakens cytoplasmic RAS-ERK signaling.

We attempted to determine the prevalence and prognosis of rapidly improving ARDS and of persistent severe ARDS related to COVID-19. METHODS: We included consecutive patients with COVID-19 receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in three intensive care units (ICU) during the second pandemic wave in Greece. We defined rapidly improving ARDS as extubation or a partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO(2):FiO(2)) greater than 300 on the first day following intubation. We defined persistent severe ARDS as PaO(2):FiO(2) of equal to or less than 100 on the second day following intubation. RESULTS: A total of 280 intubated patients met criteria of ARDS with a median PaO(2):FiO(2) of 125.0 (interquartile range 93.0C161.0) on day of intubation, and overall ICU-mortality of 52.5% (ranging from 24.3 to 66.9% across the three participating sites). Prevalence of rapidly improving ARDS was 3.9% (11 of 280 patients); no extubation occurred on the first day following intubation. ICU-mortality of patients with rapidly improving ARDS was 54.5%. This low prevalence and high mortality rate of rapidly improving ARDS were consistent across participating sites. Prevalence of persistent severe ARDS was 12.1% and corresponding mortality was 82.4%.

This packed-bed tide-motion system is available with larger vessels and may thus be a promising platform for large-scale HCV production.","output":"High-Titer Hepatitis C Virus Production in a Scalable Single-Use High Cell Density Bioreactor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION We describe the results of an exploratory analysis performed on the first head-to-head study (JapicCTI-194611) comparing two different intravenous (IV) neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists, fosnetupitant and fosaprepitant, in combination with palonosetron (PALO) and dexamethasone (DEX) for the prevention of highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC)-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). This analysis was performed to validate the findings of the primary analysis (previously published) utilizing a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach for missing values for the efficacy endpoint of complete response (no emetic event and no rescue medication), while also evaluating the time periods encompassing the 0-168-hour (h) \\"extended overall phase\\" interval. METHODS Patients scheduled to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy were randomized 1:1 to fosnetupitant 235 mg or fosaprepitant 150 mg in combination with PALO 0.75 mg and DEX. Complete response rates were calculated and compared (stratified by age category and sex with a Mantel-Haenszel test) during the study's primary overall phase (0-120 h) and during additional time intervals of interest [acute (0-24 h), delayed (24-120 h), extended delayed (> 24-168 h), beyond delayed (120-168 h), and extended overall (0-168 h)]. RESULTS A total of 785 patients were included (fosnetupitant N = 392, fosaprepitant N = 393). Complete response rates were numerically higher for fosnetupitant versus fosaprepitant for all time intervals and statistically significant for the extended overall phase. Complete response rates for fosnetupitant versus fosaprepitant during the overall, acute, delayed, extended delayed, beyond delayed, and extended overall phases were 75.5% vs. 71.0% (p = 0.1530), 93.9% vs. 92.6% (p = 0.4832), 77.0% vs. 72.8% (p = 0.1682), 74.7% vs. 68.4% (p = 0.0506), 86.7% vs. 81.7% (p = 0.0523), and 73.5% vs. 66.9% (p = 0.0450), respectively. CONCLUSION In this exploratory analysis, fosnetupitant appeared to be more effective than fosaprepitant in preventing CINV associated with cisplatin-based HEC during the extended 7-day period following chemotherapy.","output":"Exploratory Analysis Comparing Fosnetupitant Versus Fosaprepitant for Prevention of Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV): A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase 3 Study (CONSOLE)."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/33.md","filePath":"drive/33.md"}'),R={name:"drive/33.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
